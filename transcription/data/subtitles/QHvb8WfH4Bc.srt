1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
Is where we will begin this evening. I'll be looking at a number of verses

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,239
tonight and

3
00:00:07,239 --> 00:00:10,399
Looking here to begin in Ephesians chapter number 5

4
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:16,319
I mentioned at the close of the service this morning that the title of the message is. Thank you Lord and

5
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:21,120
We have much to be thankful for and as you're turning to Ephesians 5

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,680
I will just share with you the words of that familiar hymn and

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,879
Kimberly played it this morning for our invitation. Thank you Lord. It's number 217 in our hymnals

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,799
The songwriter says this some thank the Lord for friends and home for mercy sure and sweet

9
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,479
But I would praise him for his grace in prayer. I would repeat

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,840
Some thank him for the flowers that grow some for the stars that shine. My heart is filled with joy and praise

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,040
Because I know he's mine. I

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:59,520
Trust in him from day to day. I prove his saving grace. I'll sing this song of praise to him

13
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:05,239
Until I see his face now just think about the song the the words of the song

14
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:10,000
Sometimes we sing the songs and maybe we don't really let the the the words sink in

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,680
But I think about these last words of this third verse

16
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:20,440
When the songwriter said I'll sing this song of praise to him until I see his face. See that's the reality

17
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:25,120
For every child of God that we praise him here upon this earth

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:31,000
But one day we'll take our final breath here and we will enter into his presence and we'll see him face-to-face

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,559
I'm not amazing. And then of course the chorus. Thank you Lord for saving my soul. Thank you Lord for making me whole

20
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:40,879
Thank you Lord for giving to me thy great salvation

21
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:47,080
So rich and free and what a great hymn and I remember

22
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:54,879
Even before I got saved I didn't understand all that. I was singing of course in that particular song at the time, but I remember

23
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:58,639
being in a teen Sunday school class at that Grace Baptist Church in

24
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,599
Jacksonville, North Carolina that I mentioned this morning where my parents were both saved and discipled and

25
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:11,839
Mentioned about the influence of our spiritual leader their pastor Rodney Padot and I remember the teen class singing that song

26
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:14,759
Thank you Lord. And again, I didn't understand all of it

27
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,119
I had not been saved at that particular time in my life

28
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:22,800
But what a blessing to now sing that song understanding the fullness

29
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:27,440
Of what the songwriter had in mind and being mindful of our salvation

30
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:34,600
This evening we would understand I mentioned even a little bit this morning that the Bible addresses the subject of praise

31
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:40,619
Regularly, in fact, I believe that even as the young people this evening demonstrate it for us

32
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,259
Many of us in the room have memorized a verse or more

33
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:52,740
That deal with the subject of giving thanks and we know that the Bible is full of verses of Scripture that deal with

34
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,179
the importance of praising and thanking our God and

35
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:59,899
Many of us over the years have memorized such verses

36
00:02:59,899 --> 00:03:08,539
it is absolutely imperative as a child of God that we regularly engage in worship and praise of our God and

37
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:14,820
We find that of course in the society in which we live and really it's just because it's a

38
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:19,259
Part of the human nature. It's easy for us to complain and murmur

39
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:25,320
it's easy for us to live under the circumstances if you will and we find that one of the

40
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:31,559
characteristics that Paul gives with regard to the last days in which we're living is that people are going to be

41
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:38,199
Unthankful and certainly we have seen that we've experienced that we live in the midst of a generation that

42
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,919
seems as if they believe that they're owed something and

43
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,800
that

44
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,639
particular perspective

45
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:49,320
Unfortunately does not often result in a measure of gratitude

46
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,160
Rather a measure of I deserve this

47
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:58,839
It's what I'm supposed to receive and we understand this evening even as we've had the opportunity to sing these great hymns

48
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,839
That that God saved us and he changed our lives. We sing that song. Oh happy day

49
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:10,740
I hope you remember the day in which your eternal destination was changed in a moment and how

50
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,800
He did for you what you could not do for yourself what no one else could do for you

51
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:22,359
he saved your soul and what a blessing and we develop that attitude of

52
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:28,179
Gratitude and I know that's something that you'll hear often a little cliche type of a phrase if you will

53
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,579
But how important it is for the children of God? I believe this evening

54
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,100
That that it is important also that we guard against

55
00:04:37,619 --> 00:04:39,619
developing that attitude of

56
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:43,859
Expecting things that we just feel like we have this

57
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:50,179
right to have these things and we just expect them because what happens is that begins to

58
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:56,779
Result in a lack of gratitude as the people of God I mentioned this morning about the New Testament

59
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,899
Admonition that has been given and I'll read for you Ephesians 5 and verse number 20 where the Bible says this

60
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:12,339
Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ

61
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,619
It's interesting than in the beginning of this chapter if you go back to verse number one

62
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:24,179
It says be therefore followers of God as dear children and walk in love as Christ

63
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:31,339
Also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savor

64
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,940
But fornication and all uncleanness or our covetousness

65
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:42,239
Let it not be once named among you as becoming Saints neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting

66
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:46,299
which are not convenient, but notice the end of verse number four, but rather

67
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,980
giving a thanks and

68
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:55,540
In those few verses of course dealing with some of the things with regard to our speech and some of those things that would be

69
00:05:55,779 --> 00:06:01,059
Spoken and he says that we're to give thanks and we noticed in verse number 20 that it says giving. Thanks always

70
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:06,500
For all things. That's pretty conclusive. Is it not? I mean, there's not much wiggle room and

71
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,579
Sometimes we try to maybe in our lives

72
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:13,420
We try to examine certain things and maybe we try to find that loophole if you will

73
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:19,380
We try to find that that wiggle room. Well Ephesians 5 in verse number 20 just really doesn't give us any wiggle room

74
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,100
giving thanks always

75
00:06:22,179 --> 00:06:27,660
for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and

76
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:35,500
it reminds me of course of the New Testament truth that we find in first Thessalonians 5 and verse number 18 a

77
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:42,540
Similar truth that is given in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ

78
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:49,100
Jesus concerning you now if the Word of God tells us that something is the will of God for us

79
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,779
We ought to pay attention to that. Amen. I mean we ought to give heed to that

80
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:56,179
We ought to say okay. This is something I need to be engaged in something

81
00:06:56,179 --> 00:06:59,500
I need to practice something I need to do as we look at the

82
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,059
The Word of God this evening and deal with this subject matter

83
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:08,660
I want you to first consider with me the principle of praise the principle of praise

84
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:15,579
We understand this evening that even as we look at these two verses of Scripture in Ephesians 5 20 and in first Thessalonians 5 18

85
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:23,059
that there is a biblical principle that would teach us that were to praise God that we're to give thanks unto his name and

86
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:31,899
notice with me back in the Psalms if you will and I'm going to reference a number of verses of Scripture from the Psalms this evening and

87
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:38,140
The first one that I want to mention here as we think about this principle is in Psalm 96 and verse number 8

88
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:45,179
where the Bible says this give unto the Lord the glory do unto his name and

89
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,859
It says bring an offering and come into his courts

90
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:54,779
Oh worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness fear before him all the earth

91
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:59,940
and I think about this give unto the Lord the glory do unto his name and

92
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:07,220
It is appropriate for us to praise the Lord. The psalmist says in Psalm 147 in verse number one

93
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:10,059
notice the

94
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:14,220
Verbiage that is used here with regard to praising the Lord in Psalm

95
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:21,980
147 and again a number of verse a number of the Psalms begin with the the introduction of praise ye the Lord

96
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:29,079
In fact, you'll find maybe even on the page of your Bible and for Psalm 147 in my Bible

97
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:37,099
I have Psalm 146 147 148 and 149 and all four of these Psalms begin with praise ye the Lord and

98
00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:43,340
Notice however what it says here in Psalm 147 in verse number one praise ye the Lord notice

99
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:49,400
For it is good to sing praises unto our God. It is good

100
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,880
Now we read over in 1st Thessalonians 5 in verse number 18

101
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:57,739
That were to give thanks and that this is the will of God in Christ

102
00:08:57,739 --> 00:09:03,700
Jesus concerning you right and everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you now

103
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:09,020
We see here that the psalmist tells us that it is good to sing praises unto our God

104
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:12,099
for it is

105
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,739
pleasant and

106
00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:15,619
praise is

107
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:17,619
Comely, it's beautiful

108
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:22,739
We think about this verse when we think about the psalmist sharing with us this principle in this

109
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,979
This reality for us as the people of God to be engaged in

110
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,059
Praising our Lord

111
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:36,039
I don't believe this evening that it is necessary for me to belabor the point on dealing with a

112
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,700
Principle that is such a well-known principle

113
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,020
in fact

114
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:45,859
I believe this evening that it would be safe for me to say that each of us understand the principle of praising the Lord the

115
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:51,179
Biblical principle that is set forth in his word that we are to be engaged in praising

116
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:54,340
So then let me deal with this. We see that there's a principle

117
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,539
But now I notice that we need to purpose to praise the Lord see

118
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:09,539
When I understand the principle, then it will lead me to having in my mind, in my life, a purpose, a resolve to praise the Lord.

119
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:14,539
Because I understand the principle. I understand that this is the will of God and Christ Jesus concerning me.

120
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:18,039
I understand that it's good, that it's pleasant, that it's comely.

121
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:22,839
And therefore, I am going to purpose to praise the Lord.

122
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:24,939
I want you to listen to what the psalmist says.

123
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:28,339
It's so many verses, I actually just printed them out so that I didn't turn to all of them.

124
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:31,839
So, if you want the printout, I can provide you a copy of it.

125
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:43,439
But let me just read quickly for you a number of verses of Scripture in which the psalmist shares with us his resolve to praise the Lord.

126
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:46,939
Where he purposes that he will praise the Lord.

127
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:53,139
And we notice the heart attitude of the psalmist when he makes these declarative statements that,

128
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:58,639
I will praise the Lord. Notice what it says in Psalm 7 and verse number 17.

129
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:07,739
I will praise the Lord according to His righteousness and will sing praise to the name of the Lord Most High.

130
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:15,739
In Psalm 9 and verse number 1, the psalmist says, I will praise Thee, O Lord, with my whole heart.

131
00:11:15,739 --> 00:11:18,939
I will show forth all Thy marvelous works.

132
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:24,439
I see the psalmist in Psalm 9 and verse number 1 where he says that he's going to praise the Lord with my whole heart.

133
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:27,339
Not half-hearted, but with my whole heart.

134
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:38,439
I mean, with a level of, you know, we see here the passion perhaps that we would speak about with him passionately praising the Lord with my whole heart.

135
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:40,839
Not half-hearted.

136
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,839
Psalm 35 and verse number 18, I will give thanks in the great congregation.

137
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,039
I will praise Thee among much people.

138
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:54,339
See, I like what the psalmist says there in Psalm 35 and verse number 18

139
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:58,139
because when we praise the Lord in the midst of many people,

140
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:02,939
it has the opportunity to exalt and magnify our Savior

141
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:11,039
and certainly gives us a position in which we can testify of what He, our God, has done for us.

142
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:17,539
I understand in the midst of many people, it may not be the most popular thing to sing praise unto our God,

143
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:19,539
but it's the appropriate thing.

144
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:22,139
The psalmist goes on to say in Psalm 52 and verse number 9,

145
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:27,339
I will praise Thee forever because Thou hast done it.

146
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:30,939
And I will wait on Thy name for it is good before Thy saints.

147
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:33,539
I think about this truth of I will praise Thee forever

148
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:38,039
and certainly we can have the days of our lives that are numbered here upon this earth

149
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:41,839
that I intend to praise the Lord all the days of my life,

150
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,039
but the reality is that for all of eternity, we will praise Him.

151
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,639
He is worthy and we will praise Him.

152
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,539
We looked this morning at Revelation 5 and verse number 9

153
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:55,639
and looked at that scene in heaven, Psalm 54 and verse number 6,

154
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:03,339
I will freely sacrifice unto Thee. I will praise Thy name, O Lord, for it is good.

155
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:05,439
Psalm 56 and verse number 4,

156
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:09,639
In God I will praise His word. In God I have put my trust.

157
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:13,039
I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.

158
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,939
He says in Psalm 57 and verse number 9,

159
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:17,239
I will praise Thee, O Lord, among the people.

160
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:19,939
I will sing unto Thee among the nations.

161
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:23,939
Again, we see as we mentioned earlier in Psalm 35 and verse number 18,

162
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:28,939
now we see in Psalm 57 and verse number 9 this idea of praising God among the people.

163
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:32,639
You know, it's important that we praise God privately,

164
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,139
but you know, it's impactful that we praise Him publicly,

165
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:37,939
that when we're in the midst of other people,

166
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:39,939
the Bible says let the redeemed of the Lord say so.

167
00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:43,139
I often say, especially as we have opportunity to give testimonies

168
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:47,139
and on our prayer, praise, and pie service that we have annually

169
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:50,639
and we give those in attendance an opportunity to give a testimony

170
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,139
and I say let the redeemed of the Lord say so

171
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:58,339
and the reality is that as you testify of God's working in your life,

172
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:02,739
not only does it exalt the Lord in the midst of the congregation,

173
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:05,739
but it also helps other believers.

174
00:14:05,739 --> 00:14:10,539
It encourages the brethren to hear how God is working on your behalf

175
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:14,539
and what God is doing and we're exalting the Lord.

176
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:16,139
Yes, we ought to do it privately.

177
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:19,839
I mean, every day of our lives we ought to privately be engaged

178
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,939
in praising and exalting our Lord,

179
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:27,139
but when He gives us those opportunities to exalt Him and to praise Him publicly,

180
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:33,739
we ought to do it and the opportunities that are accompanied by us doing so will abound.

181
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:36,439
Psalm 69 and verse number 30,

182
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:41,739
I will praise the name of God with a song and will magnify Him with thanksgiving.

183
00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:44,439
In Psalm 86 and verse number 12, the psalmist says,

184
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:48,539
I will praise thee O Lord my God with all my heart

185
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:51,739
and I will glorify thy name forevermore.

186
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:54,739
Once again, we see this idea of my whole heart.

187
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:56,539
Here he says with all my heart.

188
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:59,539
In Psalm 9 and verse number 1, he said with my whole heart.

189
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:03,839
Again, that wholehearted passionate praising of our God.

190
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,739
You know, the reality is that there are people that we see in our society

191
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:11,239
that do things with passion.

192
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:13,639
There are people that cheer their teams.

193
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:18,739
I understand that many of the arenas today are not as packed as they have been in the past

194
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:22,339
because of the impact of COVID and so on and so forth.

195
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:27,539
But prior to COVID, you could see how that there are people that have passion

196
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:34,239
about cheering on athletes and cheering for goals and scores and so on and so forth.

197
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:38,639
I remember being in England and I remember having conversation

198
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,039
and a church service in England is a little bit different than a church service here.

199
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:47,439
And they're a little bit more reserved, if I could say.

200
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:51,339
And I remember as I was there sitting in the church service

201
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:55,539
and going through kind of some of the process in which they go through,

202
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:59,039
I thought, man, if I was preaching, these people wouldn't know what hit them, you know.

203
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:01,339
And I don't know what Spurgeon dealt with.

204
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:02,939
He seemed to be kind of a fireball.

205
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:07,939
But the reality is that just kind of more quiet, reserved, if you will.

206
00:16:07,939 --> 00:16:10,339
I began to inquire and someone told me this.

207
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:13,539
Well, you know, the people just aren't that passionate.

208
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,839
I said, have you ever watched them watch football?

209
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:18,539
We call it soccer.

210
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:23,239
But there's some passionate fans about a little ball being kicked back and forth

211
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:27,339
for 90 minutes with a final score sometimes of one to zero.

212
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:31,239
I mean, they get all kinds of crazy passionate about it, right?

213
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:34,939
Right, Armando? You listen to the Spanish channel when they score a goal

214
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:38,939
and the guy has to take some breaths in between yelling goal, right?

215
00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:41,439
I mean, they get passionate about it.

216
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:43,139
They shake the stands and everything.

217
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:46,239
But what I'm saying is that, listen, it's okay for us to show a little passion

218
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:49,539
about praising the Lord with my whole heart.

219
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:50,939
Remember what He's done for you.

220
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:53,539
Remember what He's done and how He's worked.

221
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:56,339
And we see the psalmist making the statement about my whole heart.

222
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:57,939
Psalm 108, verse number three,

223
00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:00,739
I will praise the Lord among the people

224
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:04,339
and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.

225
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:06,139
Psalm 109 and verse number 30,

226
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:08,839
I will greatly praise the Lord with my mouth.

227
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:12,939
Yea, I will praise Him among the multitude.

228
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:16,239
Psalm 111 and verse number one, praise you the Lord.

229
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:19,039
And then it says this, I will praise the Lord with my whole heart

230
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,039
in the assembly of the upright and in the congregation.

231
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,539
Psalm 118 and verse number 19, open to me the gates of righteousness.

232
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:31,739
I will go into them and I will praise the Lord.

233
00:17:31,739 --> 00:17:35,739
I will praise thee for thou hast heard me and art become my salvation.

234
00:17:35,739 --> 00:17:37,639
Psalm 118 and verse 21.

235
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:41,139
Psalm 118 and verse 28, thou art my God, I will praise thee.

236
00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:45,439
Thou art my God, I will exalt thee.

237
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,939
Psalm 119 and verse number seven,

238
00:17:46,939 --> 00:17:49,239
I will praise thee with uprightness of heart

239
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:52,239
when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.

240
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,739
Psalm 138 and verse number one,

241
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,939
I will praise thee with my whole heart before the gods

242
00:17:55,939 --> 00:17:57,839
will I sing praise unto thee.

243
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,439
Psalm 139 and verse 14,

244
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:02,539
I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

245
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,939
Marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well.

246
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:07,739
Psalm 145 and verse number two,

247
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:09,139
notice what the psalmist says.

248
00:18:09,139 --> 00:18:12,439
Every day will I bless thee

249
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:17,239
and I will praise thy name forever and ever.

250
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:19,239
I know that's a lot of verses of scripture.

251
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:20,739
Some of you guys are trying to keep up

252
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:22,339
and so I went a little faster

253
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:24,639
and just kind of messed with them a little bit.

254
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,339
You know, I heard the pages turning

255
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:31,139
and the reality is that I wanted to read all of those verses

256
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:35,440
for us to understand how the psalmist purposed to praise the Lord.

257
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
He said I will.

258
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,839
Here's what I'm purposing to do.

259
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,839
And when we begin to think about the principle of praising God,

260
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:49,139
the biblical principle that we as the children of God,

261
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:52,739
that we are to give thanks always,

262
00:18:52,739 --> 00:18:57,039
that we are to give thanks for all things,

263
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,639
that it should lead to us purposing, resolving,

264
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:03,239
that I'm going to praise him.

265
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:04,639
I'm making a decision.

266
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:06,940
I'm making this decision.

267
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,839
I will say in the same manner in which the psalmist said,

268
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:14,339
I will declare that I will praise him.

269
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:16,940
Now, here's something that I find interesting.

270
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:23,239
It is possible this evening for me to understand a principle

271
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:26,639
and for me to purpose or plan to do something

272
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:28,940
and then not actually do it.

273
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,639
Right? It's possible.

274
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:34,639
Let me illustrate it this way.

275
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:38,639
I hope it's understood. I think it will be.

276
00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:42,139
I understand the principle of exercise.

277
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,639
I do.

278
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:45,139
I understand how it works.

279
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:48,139
I understand what you do.

280
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:49,239
I understand it.

281
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:53,139
There are times in which I purpose to do it.

282
00:19:53,139 --> 00:19:55,639
And with all of my understanding

283
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:57,639
and with all of my purposing,

284
00:19:57,639 --> 00:19:59,639
sometimes I just don't do it.

285
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:03,639
Right? I know it'd be good for me to go to the gym.

286
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:05,639
I know it'd be good for me to work out.

287
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:07,639
I know it'd be good for me to exercise.

288
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,639
I understand the benefits and so on and so forth,

289
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:11,639
but just because I understand something

290
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:14,639
and just because I plan to do it

291
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:17,639
doesn't mean it actually gets done.

292
00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:18,639
Can you relate?

293
00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:21,639
Maybe not with exercise, but maybe something else.

294
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:25,639
It just so happens that you plan to maybe exercise

295
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:26,639
or to eat right,

296
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:29,639
and then you get a nice big chocolate cake.

297
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:31,639
I had a piece of that on Friday night.

298
00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:33,639
It was good too, man.

299
00:20:33,639 --> 00:20:36,639
I saw that thing Armando and I thought,

300
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:38,639
that's for me tonight.

301
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:40,639
And it was good.

302
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,639
But you understand what I mean, right?

303
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:45,639
This evening, however, when we think about

304
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:47,639
this subject of praising the Lord,

305
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:49,639
when we think about thanking the Lord,

306
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:52,639
it ought not be something that gets neglected.

307
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:56,639
It ought not be something that I understand the principle

308
00:20:56,639 --> 00:20:58,639
and I purpose to do it,

309
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:01,639
but it just never seems to happen.

310
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:04,639
It needs to be regular in our lives.

311
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:08,639
It needs to be something that we practice regularly.

312
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:09,639
And if you're taking notes,

313
00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:12,639
that simply is the third thought this evening,

314
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:16,639
is to practice praising the Lord.

315
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:19,639
I mean, just make it a routine in your life.

316
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:23,639
Just make it a part of your being

317
00:21:23,639 --> 00:21:25,639
that you just praise God.

318
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:27,639
I shared with somebody this morning after the service,

319
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:28,639
we were talking in the back,

320
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:30,639
and I shared with someone this morning

321
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:33,639
how that in my own personal prayer time,

322
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:35,639
I go through a whole host of things each morning

323
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:38,639
in which I just thank God for.

324
00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:40,639
And I mean, I just thank Him for His attributes,

325
00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:41,639
I thank Him for who He is,

326
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:45,639
and I just go through in my mind this list of things.

327
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:48,639
And it's not like a ritualistic kind of thing.

328
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:49,639
It really helps me.

329
00:21:49,639 --> 00:21:50,639
Because all of a sudden,

330
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:52,639
what's happening in my life,

331
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:54,639
and you're thinking about all the things

332
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:56,639
that we're going to face on a particular day

333
00:21:56,639 --> 00:21:59,639
and all of the uncertainties that the day holds,

334
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:01,639
but I begin by praising God for who He is

335
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:03,639
and for the things that He's done

336
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:05,639
and for all of these wonderful blessings

337
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:07,639
that He's bestowed upon me,

338
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:10,639
and it helps me to get in that right frame of mind.

339
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:12,639
It helps me to have a perspective

340
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:15,639
that is appropriate that will enable me

341
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:18,639
to deal with the unforeseen things of the day

342
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:20,639
that I don't know about but God knows about.

343
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,639
It really gets me in that right frame of mind.

344
00:22:23,639 --> 00:22:26,639
It helps me to have that practice in my life.

345
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:31,639
And I don't want to make it sound this evening

346
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:34,639
that it's just some kind of ritual, routine thing,

347
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:37,639
just a mundane exercise,

348
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:39,639
but that we understand that we're praising

349
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:41,639
the God of the universe

350
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:43,639
who holds all power,

351
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:44,639
who knows all things,

352
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:47,639
and we have the privilege of entering into His presence

353
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:50,639
and exalting and praising His name

354
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:51,639
because of who He is

355
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:53,639
and because of the things that He's done.

356
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:56,639
And in my life, I want to practice that.

357
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:59,639
I don't think I do it as well as I should.

358
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:01,639
I don't think I've arrived.

359
00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:04,639
I'm not suggesting that in any way, shape, or form,

360
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:06,639
but the reality is that in our lives,

361
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:07,639
we need to praise the Lord.

362
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:10,639
We need to practice praising God.

363
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,639
Go back to Exodus 15, if you will.

364
00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:16,639
I want to look at two examples in the Old Testament

365
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:19,639
here of some rejoicing.

366
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:21,639
Exodus 15.

367
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:24,639
We're familiar with the passage of Scripture, no doubt.

368
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:27,639
In Exodus 14, as we have the privilege of reading

369
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:30,639
about the great miracle when God

370
00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:33,639
demonstrated His power and allowed the children of Israel

371
00:23:33,639 --> 00:23:36,639
to cross over the Red Sea on dry ground

372
00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:40,639
and how the Egyptians are saying to do so,

373
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:46,639
how God troubled the host of the Egyptians.

374
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:49,639
Of course, the Bible tells us about their chariot wheels

375
00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:51,639
coming off and they drove heavily

376
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,639
and they were consumed in the midst of the Red Sea

377
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:56,639
and how God had given them victory.

378
00:23:56,639 --> 00:23:59,639
And you find in Exodus 15, verse 1,

379
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:00,639
the Bible says,

380
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,639
Then sang Moses and the children of Israel

381
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:05,639
this song unto the Lord.

382
00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:07,639
And Spake, saying,

383
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:09,639
I will sing unto the Lord,

384
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:12,639
for He hath triumphed gloriously.

385
00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:15,639
The horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea.

386
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:17,639
The Lord is my strength and song,

387
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:19,639
and He has become my salvation.

388
00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:22,639
He is my God, and I will prepare Him in habitation.

389
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:25,639
My Father is God, and I will exalt Him.

390
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:26,639
Notice in verse 7,

391
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:28,639
And in the greatness of Thine excellency

392
00:24:28,639 --> 00:24:31,639
Thou hast overthrown them that rose up against Thee.

393
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:33,639
Thou sentest forth Thy wrath,

394
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,639
which consumed them as stubble.

395
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:37,639
In verse 9, the enemy said,

396
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:39,639
The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake,

397
00:24:39,639 --> 00:24:41,639
I will divide and despoil.

398
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:43,639
My lust shall be satisfied upon them.

399
00:24:43,639 --> 00:24:44,639
I will draw my sword.

400
00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:46,639
My hand shall destroy them.

401
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:48,639
Thou didst blow with Thy wind.

402
00:24:48,639 --> 00:24:49,639
The sea covered them.

403
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:51,639
They sank as lead in the mighty waters.

404
00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:53,639
Notice what verse 11 says,

405
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:56,639
Who is like unto Thee, O Lord, among the gods?

406
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:57,639
Who is like Thee?

407
00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:00,639
Glorious in holiness, fearful in praises,

408
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:02,639
doing wonders.

409
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:04,639
Thou stretchest out Thy right hand.

410
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:06,639
The earth swallowed them.

411
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:09,639
Thou, in Thy mercy, hast led forth the people

412
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:11,639
which Thou hast redeemed.

413
00:25:11,639 --> 00:25:13,639
Thou hast guided them in Thy strength

414
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:15,639
unto Thy holy habitation.

415
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,639
The people shall hear and be afraid.

416
00:25:17,639 --> 00:25:20,639
Sorrow shall take hold of the inhabitants of Palestina.

417
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:22,639
Now, you look at these verses of Scripture,

418
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:24,639
you find in verse number 18,

419
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:26,639
the Bible says the Lord shall reign forever and ever.

420
00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:27,639
Verse number 21,

421
00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:28,639
And Miriam answered them,

422
00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:31,639
Sing ye to the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously.

423
00:25:31,639 --> 00:25:34,639
The horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea.

424
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:36,639
I mean, you begin to read about the Song of Moses

425
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:40,639
as many times we'd refer to this passage of being,

426
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,639
and you begin to see how they're praising God.

427
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:43,639
I mean, it's exciting to read through,

428
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:46,639
and I didn't read the entirety of the passage,

429
00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:48,639
but you begin to see and get into the mind,

430
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:50,639
if you will, just for a moment,

431
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:52,639
of what these people had just experienced,

432
00:25:52,639 --> 00:25:55,639
and not only there with the crossing of the Red Sea,

433
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:57,639
but when you look at the entirety

434
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:01,639
of what had happened in the previous months

435
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:04,639
of their lives with the plagues

436
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:06,639
and all of those things,

437
00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:08,639
and how God was demonstrating His power,

438
00:26:08,639 --> 00:26:13,639
and He was going forth and showing them His plan.

439
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:15,639
And for many years,

440
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:18,639
they had suffered in great affliction and turmoil,

441
00:26:18,639 --> 00:26:20,639
and they were dealing with great adversity,

442
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:23,639
and now they've seen the hand of God,

443
00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:26,639
and they have experienced the power of God firsthand.

444
00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:30,639
I mean, can you imagine being at the Red Sea?

445
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:33,639
I mean, can you imagine being there

446
00:26:33,639 --> 00:26:35,639
and experiencing that?

447
00:26:35,639 --> 00:26:36,639
These are the same people

448
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:38,639
that had just experienced the plagues,

449
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:43,639
where Moses would leave the presence of Pharaoh,

450
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:45,639
understanding on a number of times

451
00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:48,639
in which Pharaoh pled for deliverance

452
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:49,639
and for a reprieve,

453
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:50,639
and Moses said,

454
00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:52,639
I'll leave, and I'm going to hold up my hands,

455
00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:54,639
and God's going to take it away,

456
00:26:54,639 --> 00:26:55,639
and God did.

457
00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:57,639
I mean, this is amazing.

458
00:26:57,639 --> 00:27:01,639
I mean, even the counselors of the Pharaoh said,

459
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:05,639
this is the finger of God.

460
00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:07,639
I can't imagine seeing this.

461
00:27:07,639 --> 00:27:10,639
I mean, just as much as I try to put my mind there

462
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:14,639
and try to see the demonstration of God's power,

463
00:27:14,639 --> 00:27:17,639
and to see how we would respond in praising God,

464
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:20,639
in practicing praise.

465
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,639
And I tell you, it's interesting

466
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,639
when you read Exodus chapter number 15,

467
00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:28,639
and you see how that after such great deliverance,

468
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:30,639
Moses and the people of Israel

469
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:32,639
sing praise unto the Lord,

470
00:27:32,639 --> 00:27:36,639
and as they are praising God and thanking God,

471
00:27:36,639 --> 00:27:40,639
they're mentioning how that He's triumphed gloriously.

472
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:43,639
They've mentioned how the Lord is their strength and song,

473
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:45,639
and they go through all of these things

474
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:46,639
of praising God,

475
00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:48,639
and then in just a little while,

476
00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:50,639
they come to a place where there's no water

477
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:52,639
and what happens?

478
00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:54,639
Are they still praising God?

479
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,639
No.

480
00:27:56,639 --> 00:27:57,639
What are they doing?

481
00:27:57,639 --> 00:27:59,639
They're complaining.

482
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:02,639
Are they not?

483
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,639
The people murmured in verse number 24

484
00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:06,639
against Moses saying,

485
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:07,639
what shall we drink?

486
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:10,639
Now, why do I point this out this evening?

487
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,639
I want to focus on verses 1 through 21,

488
00:28:12,639 --> 00:28:13,639
the importance of praising God,

489
00:28:13,639 --> 00:28:16,639
the practice of praise.

490
00:28:16,639 --> 00:28:17,639
But the reason why I point out

491
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:19,639
the latter part of Exodus 15

492
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:21,639
is because in your life, in my life,

493
00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:24,639
in my life, I can practice praise this morning

494
00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:25,639
and then something,

495
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:27,639
some curveball, if you will,

496
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,639
some circumstance comes in my life

497
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:30,639
that I didn't expect

498
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:31,639
and all of a sudden,

499
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:32,639
well, I was just praising God

500
00:28:32,639 --> 00:28:34,639
and now I'm complaining

501
00:28:34,639 --> 00:28:36,639
because I'm a human being.

502
00:28:36,639 --> 00:28:37,639
So are you.

503
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:40,639
I said, what's going on here?

504
00:28:40,639 --> 00:28:42,639
What do we need to do?

505
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,639
We need to get back to a place where we're praising God.

506
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,639
We need to be able to identify in our lives

507
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:49,639
those times we begin to murmur.

508
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:51,639
I mean, have you been able to?

509
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:54,639
Have you practiced in your life

510
00:28:54,639 --> 00:28:56,639
that act of discipline,

511
00:28:56,639 --> 00:28:58,639
of being able to catch yourself

512
00:28:58,639 --> 00:28:59,639
when you're complaining

513
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:00,639
or murmuring about something?

514
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:01,639
And say, you know,

515
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,639
what am I complaining about?

516
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:04,639
I mean, God's been so good

517
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:07,639
and God's done this and He's done that.

518
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:08,639
It reminds me of a story.

519
00:29:08,639 --> 00:29:09,639
I shared part of this this morning

520
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:11,639
with someone at the back door as well,

521
00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:14,639
but we're very familiar with Corrie ten Boom

522
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:17,639
and we understand the German concentration camps

523
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:18,639
and all of the things

524
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:19,639
and they spent some time

525
00:29:19,639 --> 00:29:22,639
in one of the worst of those German concentration camps

526
00:29:22,639 --> 00:29:24,639
during the Second World War

527
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:26,639
and they found themselves in prison,

528
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:30,639
Corrie ten Boom and her sister Betsy,

529
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:32,639
and they were disgusted to discover

530
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:36,639
that the barracks in which they were put,

531
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:39,639
they were infested with fleas.

532
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:42,639
That's not certainly a desirable situation.

533
00:29:42,639 --> 00:29:46,639
I don't know if you've ever had an experience with fleas.

534
00:29:46,639 --> 00:29:48,639
I remember being at a relative's house

535
00:29:48,639 --> 00:29:49,639
a number of years ago,

536
00:29:49,639 --> 00:29:51,639
probably 25-ish years ago,

537
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:53,639
and they had some animals

538
00:29:53,639 --> 00:29:55,639
and one of the animals got some fleas

539
00:29:55,639 --> 00:29:56,639
and I remember sitting there

540
00:29:56,639 --> 00:29:58,639
trying to watch a game

541
00:29:58,639 --> 00:29:59,639
with a bunch of animals

542
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:02,639
was actually my uncle and I was trying to watch a game with my uncle and man

543
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:07,599
those fleas were biting my feet man it was annoying and those things you just

544
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:11,879
look down and they're crawling on you and whatever and then nothing compared

545
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:16,119
to what they had experienced but I said this is annoying what's up with this

546
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:22,439
right why don't you deal with this well it was the initial response of Corey

547
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:30,759
ten boom to complain and I kind of understand why she might complain but

548
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:37,119
Betsy her sister insisted that instead of complaining they give thanks you

549
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:42,959
know what she quoted first Thessalonians 518 in everything give

550
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:49,599
thanks for this is the will of God and Christ Jesus concerning you now I think

551
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:57,679
that perhaps it would require and even as the account says it required some

552
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,439
persuasion on the part of Betsy to persuade Corey to thank God in this

553
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:09,239
situation and I can understand that I can I can identify with Corey and saying

554
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:13,879
you want me to give thanks in this situation I'm thankful for the sister

555
00:31:13,879 --> 00:31:21,279
that said in everything give thanks and we find that the account goes on to

556
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:27,139
tell us this that several months later after they'd been in there the two

557
00:31:27,139 --> 00:31:31,919
sisters expressed their surprise they began to notice something about what

558
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,799
some of their circumstances that had been taking place and they said this

559
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:41,799
that the camp guards did not return to their barracks and did not disrupt or

560
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:47,279
prevent them from having Bible studies with the other prisoners and here's what

561
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:53,959
they concluded they concluded and Corey realized the account goes on to say that

562
00:31:53,959 --> 00:32:00,359
the very fleas with which she had so despised had actually been a God sent

563
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:07,679
protection from those cruel guards that's a we read it now it's a man it's

564
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,319
a good story but what about when the fleas come in your life for my life it

565
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:15,279
might not be actual fleas but you understand I'm saying God why is this

566
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:20,119
happening why is that happening I borrowed my dad's truck a number of

567
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:25,119
years ago I think was when you had one of your shoulders operated on and he

568
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:27,559
wasn't gonna be able to drive for a while my mom doesn't like driving the

569
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:30,599
truck and so I borrowed it and I had it here and I think you still live in

570
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:34,999
Pennsylvania at the time and I would borrow the truck and I got a flat tire

571
00:32:34,999 --> 00:32:39,439
in the truck and that's just kind of an inconvenience right and say man I don't

572
00:32:39,439 --> 00:32:43,599
have time for a flat tire and I had a meeting I had somebody I was supposed to

573
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:48,239
go meet and visit with and what have you and so I took that spare off and I took

574
00:32:48,239 --> 00:32:52,039
the the tire off I put the spare on through the tire in the bed of the truck

575
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:56,839
and on my way I went and took care of the things I had to take care of had the

576
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:01,479
meeting so on and so forth came back to church and a few hours had passed and

577
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:05,039
someone came by and I was chatting with them and they left and then they called

578
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,959
me and said hey I just noticed that you had a flat tire on the truck I said whoa

579
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:14,599
tell me this again a flat tire I said yes it's flat the they told me what's

580
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:20,959
tire now one flat tire is a problem but two is a real situation you only have

581
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:25,999
one spare and you know you need four tires to be able to drive and so I was

582
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:29,959
really in a kind of a situation I called Ed and said Ed you got a an air

583
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:33,679
compressor you got something I can use he said yeah and I was able to get an

584
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,559
air compressor we got the tire pumped up so that I can get to the place to be

585
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:42,639
able to get the tire taken care of you know I had not thought about the need to

586
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:46,199
patch the original one immediately because I got a spare and then got a

587
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:52,439
tire a flat there it was very interesting because my natural response

588
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:56,359
to that situation was really to complain I would be transparent with you this

589
00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:01,199
evening why like I don't have time for this have you ever been there where you

590
00:34:01,199 --> 00:34:06,079
say I don't have time for this I mean this is not what I expected to happen

591
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:10,999
today but you know I sat in a place to get those tires patched and had the

592
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:14,479
privilege of being able to share the gospel with someone for about an hour

593
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:19,319
that otherwise if I didn't have two flat tires that day I never would have met

594
00:34:19,319 --> 00:34:24,919
that person I just wouldn't have and you know during that time when I left that

595
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:32,759
place the Lord just in a very gracious way corrected my perspective he really

596
00:34:32,759 --> 00:34:41,719
did he said what about in everything giving thanks always for all things and

597
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:48,519
you know God can work in mysterious ways and he does and and oftentimes in my

598
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:55,519
life and perhaps you can understand this it's easy for us to see after the fact

599
00:34:55,519 --> 00:35:02,639
what God was doing you understand I mean but in the very midst of it we're too

600
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:08,959
sideways with whatever's going on to be able to really take a step back and say

601
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:12,999
I wonder what God's doing here and how God is working here and what God's plan

602
00:35:12,999 --> 00:35:19,679
is for this let me thank God for this situation right now and ask him to use

603
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:24,239
me for his honor for his glory that's not normally my response to a problem

604
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,039
what I'm saying to this evening is that we need to practice praising God in all

605
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:37,039
things I need to and we look at the situation and say our God is is worthy

606
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,679
of our praise you know what God was doing at the end of Exodus 15 he was

607
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:48,679
proving to his people that he was still able to take care of just water of the

608
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:53,439
the everyday thing listen God did not lead them out of Egypt so they would die

609
00:35:53,479 --> 00:36:00,399
of thirst he was able and he was proving them and he proved them there at the

610
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:05,079
waters and we find that this was the very first trial that they faced after

611
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,079
delivered sort of the book of First Chronicles if you will let's look at one

612
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,599
other example of this importance of practicing praise and we find in First

613
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:21,959
Chronicles chapter 16 the record is given here to us of that in which David

614
00:36:21,959 --> 00:36:27,239
is praising the Lord he's the king of Israel at the time and he had had in his

615
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:33,439
heart to bring the ark of God back to Jerusalem and if you look through the

616
00:36:33,439 --> 00:36:37,199
passage of Scripture and you look at the 15th chapter of the book of First

617
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:43,259
Chronicles you'll find some things that happen and how they did not do the the

618
00:36:43,259 --> 00:36:47,839
work of God and the way in which God told them to do in fact back in chapter

619
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,799
13 you read about Uzzah and the the death and so on and so forth and you

620
00:36:52,799 --> 00:36:57,839
look through the passage and you begin to see how that in chapter 15 they they

621
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,879
got things corrected they got things understood they went back and they found

622
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:05,919
the proper way of transporting the ark and all that they were to do and by the

623
00:37:05,919 --> 00:37:09,999
way God had given that instruction to Moses at the time in which they built

624
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:13,959
the the ark and all of the pieces of furniture for the tabernacle there were

625
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:18,759
plain instructions that were provided as to who was to transport and how they

626
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:24,439
were to transport and they did not do that back in chapter 13 and therefore

627
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:28,719
Uzzah was killed we find that the ark is now brought back to Jerusalem in chapter

628
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:33,479
15 and the Bible tells us in verse number six in verse number one of

629
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:37,639
chapter 16 notice what it says so they brought the ark of God and set it in the

630
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:42,359
midst of the tent that David had pitched for it and they offered burnt sacrifices

631
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:47,839
and peace offerings before God we can read and skip down if you will notice

632
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:56,119
in verse number seven it says this then on that day David delivered first this

633
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:01,639
psalm to thank the Lord into the hand of Asaph and his brethren notice what it

634
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:05,439
says in verse eight give thanks unto the Lord call upon his name make known his

635
00:38:05,439 --> 00:38:12,079
deeds among the people it says sing unto him sing psalms unto him talk ye of all

636
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,159
his wondrous works glory in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that

637
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:21,799
seek the Lord seek the Lord in his strength seek his face continually if

638
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:26,799
you skip down look at verse 25 for great is the Lord and greatly to be praised he

639
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:30,719
also is to be feared above all gods for all the gods of the people are idols but

640
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:36,799
the Lord made the heavens verse 29 give unto the Lord the glory due unto his

641
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:41,359
name bring an offering and come before him worship the Lord in the beauty of

642
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:46,039
holiness and we'd mentioned from Psalm 96 this same truth that we find in verse

643
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:50,919
number 29 in verse 34 Oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his

644
00:38:50,919 --> 00:38:56,839
mercy endureth forever and say ye save us O God of our salvation and gather us

645
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:01,479
together and deliver us from the heathen that we may give thanks to thy holy name

646
00:39:01,479 --> 00:39:08,799
and glory in thy praise as I look here at the praise in first Chronicles 16 and

647
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:12,599
there are other portions that we could look at and to see how the people of God

648
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:17,279
praise the Lord but I see how that they were practicing praising God I see how

649
00:39:17,279 --> 00:39:22,879
that David had prioritized and purpose to praise as you read through the Psalms

650
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:27,919
and read a number of those I will praise the Lord verses that I read to you just

651
00:39:27,919 --> 00:39:32,639
a few moments ago you'll find that many of them the Psalms are ascribed to David

652
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:36,319
and he had purpose that he was gonna praise the Lord with his whole heart and

653
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:42,119
we find here in first Chronicles 16 that when this on this momentous occasion

654
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:46,759
when the ark was brought back to Jerusalem what do they do they praise

655
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:51,119
the Lord they were thanking God for the provision for all that had taken place

656
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,319
and all that had transpired and they're exalting the Lord and they're giving

657
00:39:55,319 --> 00:40:02,039
glory unto his name and I find this evening as I think about this

658
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:04,699
this truth of thank you Lord

659
00:40:04,699 --> 00:40:08,779
and the reality that we are to give thanks always

660
00:40:08,779 --> 00:40:11,759
for all things and that we are to be engaged

661
00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:16,399
in the worship of our God, exalting him and thanking him.

662
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:19,239
There are many reasons for us to rejoice.

663
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:21,919
I mean, honestly, it shouldn't take us long

664
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,959
to come up with something to be thankful for.

665
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:26,759
I haven't seen it done in years,

666
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:30,119
but I believe it was at Grace Baptist Church

667
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:32,799
the last time I saw it in Jacksonville, North Carolina,

668
00:40:32,799 --> 00:40:35,519
where they would have, I don't know how often they did it,

669
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:37,959
I don't remember, popcorn testimonies.

670
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:39,319
Do you remember that, Dad?

671
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:40,159
And here's how it would work.

672
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:40,979
You remember, Mom?

673
00:40:40,979 --> 00:40:42,599
This is how it would work.

674
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,659
Michael would stand up and he'd give a testimony

675
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:48,119
and then he'd say, all right, Brother Armando.

676
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:50,199
And Brother Armando would stand up and give a testimony

677
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:54,039
and Brother Armando would say, okay, Sister Faith.

678
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:55,959
And Faith would stand up and give a testimony

679
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:58,799
and Faith would say, okay, Sister Mimi.

680
00:40:58,799 --> 00:41:00,999
And it's just popcorn testimonies, what they did.

681
00:41:00,999 --> 00:41:02,399
It was good.

682
00:41:02,399 --> 00:41:04,679
I wasn't even saved and it was good.

683
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:06,719
But you know, there were some people,

684
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:09,159
here's what they do, I hope they don't call me.

685
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:12,099
Oh, buddy, I hope they don't call me.

686
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:13,439
And you know what you do when you don't want somebody

687
00:41:13,439 --> 00:41:14,799
to call you, you look down.

688
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:17,999
Is it not true?

689
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:19,639
I mean, seriously, you look down,

690
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:21,919
because if I don't see you, you can't see me.

691
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:24,799
I mean, it's kind of a thought that we have, right?

692
00:41:24,799 --> 00:41:28,679
So you want to know how, I mean, how my brain works?

693
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:30,359
I can give you a little insight tonight.

694
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:32,439
You know who I look for if we're doing something like that?

695
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:34,039
The person with their head down.

696
00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:36,399
And you say, you're cruel.

697
00:41:36,399 --> 00:41:39,079
I know, but that's what I do.

698
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:42,479
But the reality is that that's a good thing.

699
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:45,519
And we ought to be able to, right?

700
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:50,199
I mean, as saved people, we ought to this evening.

701
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:52,479
I don't care if you don't like talking in front of people.

702
00:41:52,479 --> 00:41:55,239
I understand one of the number one fears of adults

703
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:57,879
is public speaking, I understand that.

704
00:41:57,879 --> 00:42:01,759
But honestly, this evening, as the children of God,

705
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:04,239
we ought to be able to go person by person

706
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,599
and not miss anybody.

707
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,279
And everybody ought to be able to praise God for something.

708
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:12,119
Amen.

709
00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:16,159
I'm not going to put you on the spot, don't get scared.

710
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,319
But I'm just saying we ought to be able to.

711
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:23,639
Because our God is worthy, and he's done so much for us.

712
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:28,639
And if we just get into that mindset,

713
00:42:29,399 --> 00:42:33,159
if we not only understand a principle

714
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:36,479
and we purpose to do it, but we begin practicing it,

715
00:42:36,479 --> 00:42:40,919
and it just becomes our normal behavior.

716
00:42:40,919 --> 00:42:45,919
Again, not in some kind of a religious kind of just,

717
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:49,039
we just going through the motions.

718
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:50,639
I'm not saying it that way.

719
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:54,159
But I'm saying that we just, we're so full of gratitude

720
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:57,399
that it just flows out of us that we're praising our God.

721
00:42:58,359 --> 00:42:59,679
And it's genuine.

722
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:01,359
It's not something that's just rehearsed

723
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,839
and recited and memorized.

724
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:04,599
It's not something that we just kind of,

725
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:07,159
well, I have to and so I'm going to.

726
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:10,119
No, it's from a genuine heart of gratitude.

727
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:11,879
And we practice it.

728
00:43:11,879 --> 00:43:15,319
And when we practice it, here's what I think happens.

729
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:17,559
See, here's, to use my illustration

730
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:21,759
from a few moments ago of exercise, okay?

731
00:43:21,759 --> 00:43:25,919
There are times in my life, as I look back at my life,

732
00:43:25,919 --> 00:43:29,599
when I was in high school playing sports

733
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,599
and very involved in athletics and what have you,

734
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:37,599
I had such a commitment to working out and exercising

735
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:41,679
that it seemed like no matter what happened on my schedule,

736
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:43,879
I still found a way to do it.

737
00:43:43,879 --> 00:43:45,239
You understand what I'm saying?

738
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:49,439
Now, I try to look for reasons not to do it.

739
00:43:49,439 --> 00:43:50,439
I'm just being honest.

740
00:43:50,439 --> 00:43:53,799
Like, I mean, you know, I got to do this

741
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:55,719
and I got to do that and, you know.

742
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,279
And it's easy when you're 40 and you say things hurt after,

743
00:44:00,279 --> 00:44:02,559
you know, if you don't exercise for a few weeks

744
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:05,199
and then you go and exercise and then you hurt

745
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:08,119
and then you don't exercise, it's just not desirable.

746
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:12,879
But when I think about practicing praise,

747
00:44:12,879 --> 00:44:15,199
here's what I think it does for us.

748
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:19,199
When I get into that regular behavior,

749
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:22,839
that regular practice of praising God,

750
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:26,759
then when things come in my life that at face value,

751
00:44:26,759 --> 00:44:31,759
at first glance, seem to be, what is this about?

752
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:35,759
I'm in that practice of praising God.

753
00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:36,839
And I'm able to say, God,

754
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:38,399
I don't know what you're doing here,

755
00:44:38,399 --> 00:44:42,139
but I'm gonna thank you because I know you have a plan.

756
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:44,079
I know you have a purpose.

757
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:49,079
I know that in this, you are working for my good

758
00:44:49,579 --> 00:44:52,599
and for your glory and would you help me

759
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:55,959
to have a proper attitude and a proper perspective?

760
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:58,759
See, but if I'm not practicing praise,

761
00:44:58,759 --> 00:45:00,599
when that thing comes in my life

762
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:02,919
that's kind of a challenge and a difficulty,

763
00:45:02,919 --> 00:45:05,479
it's real easy for me to murmur and complain.

764
00:45:05,479 --> 00:45:08,879
It's real easy for me to just go into the old nature,

765
00:45:08,879 --> 00:45:10,599
here's how we work, here's what we do,

766
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:12,719
here's what the human nature is.

767
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:14,599
And so this evening, thank you, Lord.

768
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:16,679
Oh, we have so much to thank him for.

769
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:18,839
So much to thank him for.

770
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:21,159
We understand the principle.

771
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:24,519
I hope tonight we would purpose to praise him

772
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:28,099
and that we would practice praising him.

773
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:31,439
Every day in our lives, just practice praising the Lord.

774
00:45:31,439 --> 00:45:33,239
Just do it.

775
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:37,919
Just get engaged daily, privately, publicly at home.

776
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:40,819
Listen, let me share testimony with me or with you,

777
00:45:40,819 --> 00:45:44,619
with your wife, with your children, with your whoever.

778
00:45:44,619 --> 00:45:46,719
Let me share what God's doing.

779
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:51,719
You begin to practice and have that discipline in your life.

780
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:55,499
In everything, give thanks,

781
00:45:55,499 --> 00:45:59,639
for this is the will of God and Christ Jesus concerning you.

782
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:00,479
Let's pray.

783
00:46:00,479 --> 00:46:01,799
Father, we love you.

784
00:46:01,799 --> 00:46:03,139
We thank you for loving us.

785
00:46:03,139 --> 00:46:04,999
We thank you that you are God.

786
00:46:07,339 --> 00:46:08,779
We thank you this evening.

787
00:46:11,379 --> 00:46:16,379
For the example of those that have gone before us.

788
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:22,139
We thank you, God, for the principles

789
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:25,039
and regular reminders that you give us in your word.

790
00:46:26,179 --> 00:46:28,819
And I pray, Lord, tonight that you would help us

791
00:46:29,939 --> 00:46:33,019
to understand the principle,

792
00:46:34,179 --> 00:46:37,039
help us to purpose, to praise you,

793
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:38,979
and help us to practice praise.

794
00:46:38,979 --> 00:46:43,259
Lord, help us to just regularly praise your name.

795
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,059
You've been so good to us, God.

796
00:46:47,399 --> 00:46:49,299
You've blessed us with all spiritual blessings

797
00:46:49,299 --> 00:46:50,739
in heavenly places.

798
00:46:52,279 --> 00:46:55,819
You've given us your word

799
00:46:57,859 --> 00:47:00,239
that reveals to us your character and who you are

800
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:02,999
and your plan for the ages.

801
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:06,659
We agree with the psalmist when he says

802
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:09,019
that you daily loadeth us with benefits.

803
00:47:11,779 --> 00:47:13,459
We think about the song, even,

804
00:47:13,459 --> 00:47:16,059
that the children sang this evening

805
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:19,979
and some of the things in which we are to be grateful for,

806
00:47:19,979 --> 00:47:21,239
to be thankful for.

807
00:47:22,459 --> 00:47:26,779
God, help us, not only privately,

808
00:47:26,779 --> 00:47:29,379
but also publicly to practice praising you.

809
00:47:30,859 --> 00:47:35,339
I pray that you would challenge us, help us,

810
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:37,739
have your will and way in these few moments of invitation.

811
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:39,699
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

812
00:47:39,699 --> 00:47:40,539
We just.
