1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
Revelation chapter number three, and as we look here at this portion of Scripture, we're

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:10,039
not going to make it through the entire letter or text with regard to the message to the

3
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:11,039
Laodiceans.

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,119
I'm going to do this in two parts, and I start at the beginning of the week thinking I was

5
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:20,440
going to get it all in one service, and then just about halfway through the week I started

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,479
kind of thinking, nah, it's not going to happen, and then I thought, yeah, it will happen,

7
00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:28,799
and then I told Holly on Friday, you've got to put part one in the bulletin because it's

8
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:35,560
just not going to happen, but we're thankful for these seven letters that are written here

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,360
in the book of Revelation, chapter number two and three, and of course, as you know,

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,880
this is the seventh and final letter that's written to the church of the Laodiceans.

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,880
It's very interesting.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,580
Look at verse 14 with me in chapter three.

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:53,319
The Bible says this, and unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write, and we'll

14
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:57,319
read further as we go through the message this evening, but I want to remind you of

15
00:00:57,319 --> 00:01:01,880
the interesting approach or really introduction here that we read with regard to who is being

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,880
addressed.

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,160
When we read of the church, the first letter, the church of Ephesus, a location where the

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,519
church was, and yes, we understand this church is in Laodicea.

19
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:17,480
It is a local church, but it's interesting how God uses the words that he uses in writing

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,760
to this church because he doesn't say unto the church in Laodicea.

21
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,480
He says to the church of the Laodiceans.

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,839
We find that he writes to the church in Ephesus in chapter two.

23
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:32,919
He says to the church of Ephesus when he writes beginning in verse number eight of chapter

24
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:34,959
two to the church in Smyrna.

25
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:41,720
He says unto the angel of the church in Smyrna, and then we find in Pergamos, in Thyatira,

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:47,120
in Sardis, in Philadelphia, those six churches that are addressed, and now we come to this

27
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,239
seventh and final letter, and he doesn't say, again, I'm going to be repetitive, he doesn't

28
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:54,720
say to the church in Laodicea.

29
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,959
He says the church of the Laodiceans.

30
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,680
Every word of God is pure.

31
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,680
God chooses his words on purpose and with purpose, and he communicates something to

32
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,679
us, and we find here in this text of Scripture that this was a church of the people, a church

33
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:16,119
of the people, a church of the people.

34
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:23,479
No longer was the Lord Jesus Christ the head of this church, and by the way, it's his church.

35
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:26,080
He is to be the head of the church.

36
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,639
He said in Matthew, I will build your church?

37
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:35,660
No, he said I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

38
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,839
We find that in Colossians chapter number one, he makes it very plain and very clear

39
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:46,399
that he is the head of the church, and I'm thankful that the Lord Jesus Christ is the

40
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,399
head of the church.

41
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:51,399
By the way, if you look at Acts 20 and also in Ephesians chapter number five, he purchased

42
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:53,240
the church with his own blood.

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,399
I was having a conversation with John on the back porch before the service this evening,

44
00:02:57,399 --> 00:03:03,399
and I said I kind of just feel like maybe in the era that we're living that some people

45
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:07,520
maybe just don't understand the significance of the church.

46
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:15,720
They don't appreciate what a church is and how we're to relate to a church and having

47
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,800
a local church that stands on the truth of God's word, a church that wants to do something

48
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,600
for the cause of Christ, and what a blessing to understand the truth of the church.

49
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:31,759
Listen, the church was not man's idea, it's God's idea, it's God's plan, God's organism,

50
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:37,600
if you will, for this era of human history is the local church.

51
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,539
It is the pillar and ground of the truth is what we're told as Paul is writing to Timothy

52
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:44,600
and giving him instruction.

53
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:50,000
So we find here that as we look here, this church of the Laodiceans, God addresses them

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,479
in that manner because he no longer was the head of the church.

55
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:57,520
Remember, we won't get to it this evening, but later in the text in verse number 20,

56
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,500
he says, behold, I stand at the door and knock.

57
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,919
The picture is clear in verse number 20 of this letter to the church.

58
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:12,440
So often verse number 20 of Revelation 3 is used when people are trying to lead somebody

59
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,799
to Christ and they're out visiting and soul winning and sharing the gospel, and they say

60
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,559
something like this, listen, Jesus is knocking on the heart door or the door of your heart,

61
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:27,359
and if you just let them in, that is not the picture that is in Revelation 3 and verse

62
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,359
number 20.

63
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:33,760
It's fine to use that as application if you choose to do so, but the reality is that Jesus

64
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:40,299
Christ, the one who died for the church, that rose for the church, we find that he is on

65
00:04:40,299 --> 00:04:45,100
the outside of the church knocking.

66
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,899
The outside of his church, it's the church of the people, of the Laodiceans.

67
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:53,859
Listen, the church is not a club.

68
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:54,859
Church is not a club.

69
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:55,859
Amen?

70
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:59,140
The church is the bride of Christ.

71
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:04,000
Man, hallelujah for church.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We need more churches.

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,700
We don't need fewer churches.

74
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,380
I find out weekly of churches without pastors, churches that are closing down, churches that

75
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,420
no longer stand for the truth that they once stood for, churches that have gone apostate,

76
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,980
churches that have gone liberal, churches that have gone contemporary, so on and so

77
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,980
forth.

78
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,540
It's all around us.

79
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,859
The church of the Laodiceans.

80
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:30,820
It's of interest that as you look at this letter, you'll find that the Lord Jesus Christ

81
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:36,019
has nothing positive to say about this church.

82
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:37,019
Nothing positive.

83
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:40,540
What a sad indictment.

84
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,820
He said nothing positive with regard to this church.

85
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:50,420
We find that the church, as I referred to it a few weeks ago in Smyrna, I referred to

86
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:55,100
that church as being the poor, rich church.

87
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:02,739
Remember the Bible says this in Revelation 2 in verse number 8, I know thy works in tribulation

88
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:07,059
and poverty, but thou art rich.

89
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:13,579
Think about the verse that we just are working on for the month of March with regard to the

90
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:19,140
truth of the transaction that took place, for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ

91
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:25,059
that though He was rich, He became poor.

92
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:26,140
Why?

93
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:32,420
For our sakes, that we through His poverty might be rich.

94
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:38,100
And the church in Smyrna is referred to as the church that God says, I know thy poverty,

95
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,100
but thou art rich.

96
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,420
And I said that that church could be referred to as the poor, rich church.

97
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:47,820
Well now, the church of the Laodiceans, we could refer to it as the rich, poor church.

98
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,820
Oh, they had all the things.

99
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,380
In fact, they say in verse number 17, I am rich, increased with goods, have need of nothing.

100
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:57,739
And we'll look at it in more detail in just a moment.

101
00:06:57,739 --> 00:07:05,619
But we find that this church could be described as being the rich, poor church.

102
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:13,179
If churches all around the world today that have multi-million dollar buildings and all

103
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:21,380
sorts of things, I mean just beautiful structures, but is God there?

104
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,920
Is God there?

105
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,100
Some of them, sure, God is there.

106
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,220
And I'm not saying anything negative about a place that is nice and elaborate and so

107
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,220
on and so forth.

108
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:36,540
But we must understand here that this was a bad situation in Laodicea.

109
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:41,859
The city is about 45 miles southeast of Philadelphia, the last church that we dealt with.

110
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:46,339
We find that in AD 60, we understand through history that there was great devastation of

111
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:49,619
the city of Laodicea as a result of an earthquake.

112
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:53,260
The people, however, of the city refused imperial assistance.

113
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,260
Why?

114
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,619
Because they would rebuild on their own resources.

115
00:07:56,619 --> 00:07:59,059
I mean that was kind of the mindset of the people.

116
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:03,019
And unfortunately what was happening is that the mindset of the people in the community

117
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:06,299
was influencing and impacting the church.

118
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:10,660
The church wasn't having an impact and influence on the community, but the community was certainly

119
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,019
influencing and impacting the church.

120
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:16,500
I heard somebody make this statement on Tuesday, I was at a pastor's meeting, and they said

121
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,579
this, I still believe in a gospel that will save a man.

122
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:20,660
You believe that?

123
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,299
I believe in a gospel that will save a man.

124
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:28,339
He said, but I also believe in a gospel that will change a man.

125
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:32,659
And here's what he said, he went on to say this, unfortunately I'm not seeing a lot of

126
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:36,380
changed men today.

127
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,619
If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.

128
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,900
Old things are passed away, behold all things are become new.

129
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,859
I referenced that this morning in 2 Corinthians 5.

130
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:50,500
And the reality is that here as we look at this church in Laodicea, the church of the

131
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:56,539
Laodiceans, they were being heavily influenced by their community.

132
00:08:56,539 --> 00:09:02,460
While God's intent is always for the church to influence the community.

133
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:10,179
The city was known to have water come in via an aqueduct that was about five miles.

134
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:13,140
The water was known to always be lukewarm.

135
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,659
You never really get a cold drink of water, just lukewarm.

136
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,940
You ever have a hot day and just need a cold drink?

137
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,500
It was very known in this particular city and it's interesting because God deals with

138
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,219
that in verse 15 with regard to the condition of their own hearts.

139
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:34,340
As we introduce the letter, I want you to notice some things, some reminders if you

140
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,539
will for the church.

141
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:41,340
Notice in verse number 14, and unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write, notice

142
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,340
this phrase, these things saith the amen.

143
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,460
I mentioned this in the service this morning.

144
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,900
The reality is that in each of the letters that Christ writes to the churches, we find

145
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,659
that there's some aspect by way of introduction where he highlights some attribute of himself.

146
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:00,059
We find that in chapter number 14.

147
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:02,619
of the book of Revelation, there's this great revelation

148
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:06,659
about Jesus and who he is and John seeing him

149
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:09,599
and all of that, and then we come to each of the letters

150
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:12,199
and in the introductory verse, you'll find

151
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:14,739
a particular attribute that's highlighted here.

152
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:19,179
Jesus says, these things saith the amen.

153
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:20,979
You know what that literally means?

154
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:24,419
What he says is so.

155
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:26,919
If you say amen, sometimes somebody's preaching

156
00:10:26,979 --> 00:10:30,239
and somebody will say, amen, so be it, I agree.

157
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:35,639
Well here, Jesus is saying, these things saith the amen,

158
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:38,719
giving a name to himself as being the amen

159
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:42,119
and what he says is so.

160
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,119
What does that mean?

161
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:48,119
Well, his account, his evaluation is true, is accurate.

162
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,979
It doesn't matter, Laodiceans, what you think

163
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:57,339
or what you say, it matters what the amen says.

164
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:59,099
And can I tell you this evening, that's a reminder

165
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:00,899
that we need in our lives as well.

166
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:05,099
These things saith the amen.

167
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:08,139
Notice as he continues in verse number 14,

168
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:12,019
the faithful and true witness.

169
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:13,819
Aren't you thankful for that description?

170
00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:16,779
The Lord Jesus Christ, he is faithful.

171
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:18,819
He is the true witness.

172
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:21,059
It goes right along with the name amen

173
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,019
and it tells us that he is the faithful and true witness.

174
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:26,220
He tells us in the next phrase,

175
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,459
the beginning of the creation of God.

176
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,619
Please do not misunderstand, that does not mean

177
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:33,099
that he was the first created

178
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:37,939
for we know that he's not created, he is God in flesh

179
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:39,899
and we understand the truth of the Trinity

180
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,099
and we find that the truth of God's word

181
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:44,299
is given to us in John chapter number one

182
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:46,040
and many of us are familiar with the passage,

183
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,019
but he says this, in the beginning was the word

184
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:54,019
and the word was with God and the word was God, amen.

185
00:11:56,939 --> 00:11:59,819
The word in just a few verses, verse 14,

186
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:04,739
was made flesh and dwelt among us.

187
00:12:04,739 --> 00:12:06,379
That's Jesus Christ, he's God.

188
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:07,379
But notice in verse two,

189
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:09,259
the same was in the beginning with God,

190
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:10,660
all things, how many things?

191
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,220
All things were made by him

192
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,179
and without him was not anything made that was made.

193
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:18,940
Colossians chapter number one,

194
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,660
we find that here he reiterates this truth

195
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,699
of the role he had in creation.

196
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:26,619
In Colossians chapter number one

197
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:31,080
and verses 15 through 18 highlight this for us beautifully

198
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,179
as we understand that all things come from him.

199
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:38,199
Notice in verse 15, who is the image of the invisible God,

200
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:40,179
the firstborn of every creature,

201
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:43,580
for by him were all things created that are in heaven

202
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,779
and that are in earth, visible and invisible,

203
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,300
whether they be thrones or dominions

204
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,099
or principalities or powers,

205
00:12:49,099 --> 00:12:53,099
all things were created by him and for him

206
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:56,179
and he is before all things

207
00:12:56,179 --> 00:13:01,179
and by him all things consist, amen.

208
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:02,699
That's our God.

209
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,259
Why did the Laodiceans need these reminders?

210
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:07,259
Well, they needed the reminder that he's the amen,

211
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:08,699
what he says is so,

212
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:13,020
because they had some self-deception, amen.

213
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,419
They needed to know that he's the true and faithful

214
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:16,899
and true witness.

215
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:18,500
They needed to know that, why?

216
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,739
Because of that self-deception.

217
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:23,860
I preached a message years ago on a Wednesday evening

218
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,580
and it's actually a series of messages on deception

219
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,839
and I said this as I preached through that series

220
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,779
of messages that the worst deception is self-deception.

221
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:36,580
They were deceived.

222
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:43,380
So Jesus is the amen, he is the faithful and true witness.

223
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:46,139
He tells them that all things come from him,

224
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:47,819
that he is the beginning of the creation of God.

225
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:49,059
Why does he tell them that?

226
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:52,539
Well, because they thought they had all these things

227
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:54,339
and they thought, man, we're increased with goods,

228
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:56,500
we have need of nothing and God reminds them,

229
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,380
hey, everything that you have is because of me.

230
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,559
Is that not a reminder that we need today as well?

231
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,819
I'm not my own, I'm bought with a price.

232
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:08,259
Deuteronomy talks about the God

233
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:10,979
that gives us the power to get wealth.

234
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:14,339
So often we have this thing messed up in our head.

235
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,299
We think, oh, I got this, I'm a self-made.

236
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:20,339
No, God gave you everything that you have.

237
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:24,839
And when we understand, I wrote it on a little sticky

238
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,299
on my desk and put it right in the middle of my calendar,

239
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,380
on my desk calendar.

240
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,480
Any of you can go down there and see it, it's sitting there.

241
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,399
Stop trying to possess what God gave us to steward.

242
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:41,239
Stop trying to possess what God gave us to steward.

243
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,779
We've gotten really possessive.

244
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:50,779
It's my life, it's my, am I not?

245
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:53,320
Do you live in the same area that I live in?

246
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,279
Come on.

247
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,839
And that mentality, that philosophy

248
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:01,540
can creep into our minds.

249
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,399
We're stewards, we're stewards.

250
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,700
And what does he require of stewards?

251
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,559
That we're faithful.

252
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:14,919
Moreover, it's required in stewards

253
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:17,839
that a man be found faithful.

254
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,380
What else does he remind him of?

255
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,179
Well, the same thing he reminded every church of.

256
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:28,619
In verse 15, I know thy works.

257
00:15:28,619 --> 00:15:29,540
What is that a reminder of?

258
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,179
Well, God's omniscience.

259
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:33,419
I preached about it this morning

260
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:36,639
that we're gonna stand at the judgment seat of Christ.

261
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,899
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ.

262
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:41,519
Listen, we're not gonna cover anything,

263
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,540
we're not gonna hide anything, we're not gonna,

264
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,940
he knows everything.

265
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,899
He knows the works and he knows the motives.

266
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:49,019
He knows what sort it is.

267
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:54,639
And here we find that he says, I know thy works.

268
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:00,639
The people, the church of the Laodiceans,

269
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,000
they needed these reminders.

270
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,079
But could I tell you this evening,

271
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:07,919
we too need these reminders.

272
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:09,839
We need these reminders.

273
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,260
I'm gonna preach this evening just a few thoughts.

274
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,880
That was all introduction.

275
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,239
I just got a few thoughts for you.

276
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:18,799
Number one, if you're taking notes, a faulty path.

277
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,260
A faulty path.

278
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,339
The Bible tells us in verse number 15,

279
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:28,220
I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot.

280
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,619
I would thou wert cold or hot.

281
00:16:31,619 --> 00:16:34,579
So then because thou art lukewarm

282
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:39,579
and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth.

283
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:48,380
Wow, what a, can you imagine being in the church

284
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,579
of the Laodiceans and getting this letter?

285
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:55,779
Wow, God who knows all things, what he says is so.

286
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,779
He says, you're lukewarm.

287
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:00,380
You're not hot, you're not cold.

288
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,459
I would that you were one or the other,

289
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,500
but you're lukewarm and because you're lukewarm,

290
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,059
I'm gonna spew you out of my mouth.

291
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,220
Wow, they had a faulty path.

292
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,179
They were lukewarm, they were compromising,

293
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:15,559
they were accommodating.

294
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:17,940
You know, we live in a time in which there's

295
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:22,139
so much pressure, so much pressure to bend

296
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:26,139
and to bow to the pressures of the society,

297
00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:28,339
to accommodate and to compromise,

298
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,380
but I want you to understand this evening

299
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,559
that we have God's word and we can stand upon God's word.

300
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:39,899
We're to contend earnestly, contend for the faith

301
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:41,380
that was once delivered to the saints

302
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,339
and we find that so often this idea of being lukewarm,

303
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:47,919
this compromising, accommodating perspective,

304
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,519
this path that we find them on is a path

305
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:54,119
that is so often one in which people will turn to, why?

306
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,639
Because they wanna get a bigger crowd,

307
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:57,200
they wanna do certain things.

308
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,200
I heard somebody say it just recently.

309
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,040
In fact, I was at a pastor's meeting and they said,

310
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,119
man, I always had a dream to pastor a church

311
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:07,760
of like 600 people and there was a greater context

312
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,399
to why they said that, but that was their statement

313
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:13,919
and in making their statement, they were speaking about

314
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,220
what do you do in order to see a church grow that big?

315
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,399
There are many things that you can do,

316
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,919
but you better stay on God's path

317
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,440
because God's work must be done God's way.

318
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,480
By the way, David learned a lesson about that with Uzzah,

319
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,440
did he not?

320
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:35,520
Was it a good thing to bring the ark back to Jerusalem?

321
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
Yeah, it was a good thing.

322
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,279
Were the people in agreement?

323
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:41,320
Yeah, they were in agreement, but guess what?

324
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,960
They did it the wrong way.

325
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,640
So much for all these people today,

326
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,200
just do what you want, just worship God how you want.

327
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,479
No, God said you approach me on my terms, amen?

328
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:58,039
And they tried to take that ark on a cart.

329
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:01,000
By the way, where did they get that idea from?

330
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,440
It's how the Philistines sent it back.

331
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,559
Am I not right?

332
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,479
The Philistines sent it back, the world's way, right?

333
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,400
The oxen go over the threshing floor

334
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,640
and Uzzah touches that thing and he's killed.

335
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:22,119
You read the account in Chronicles

336
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,840
and you find that it's interesting,

337
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,880
it's in both accounts and you look at the contrast

338
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,440
between the two and how David responds and what he does

339
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,880
and you find in Chronicles that really he goes back

340
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
and he searches and he finds out how are we supposed,

341
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,159
like he was afraid, he was displeased,

342
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:38,960
he was, I mean, all kinds of things going on,

343
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,799
but you know what he did?

344
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:41,559
He went back and he found out how are we supposed

345
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:43,880
to transport this according to God's way?

346
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,320
And you know what he found out?

347
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,320
That God gave the prescribed way to Moses.

348
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,520
In fact, there were staves that were made

349
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,239
and rings that were there and the part of carrying it

350
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,279
and the priests were to do it,

351
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,779
he found out were to do it God's way.

352
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:00,619
And then.

353
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:08,199
God blessed. This faulty path that this church was on, being influenced and impacted by their

354
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:12,799
community with this, I'll say potential, I can't, I don't want to read into it, say something

355
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:18,639
that's not there, but it seems like there was this desire on their part to be relevant.

356
00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:23,639
By the way, we hear so much about relevance today. You're just not relevant anymore, you're

357
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:28,759
outdated, you need this, you need to update that, so on and so forth. God is always relevant.

358
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:37,799
Why? Because God is outside of time. He's the eternal God. He's Alpha and Omega. And

359
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:43,639
He gave us a book, the Bible, and it doesn't need to be updated, it doesn't, no, no, no,

360
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:49,239
it just needs to be followed. It needs to be read once again and obeyed. We find that

361
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:53,679
this church, they're on this faulty path, I have written in my notes the contrast between

362
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,159
a thermostat and a thermometer. Have you ever given any thought to the difference between

363
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:04,559
a thermostat and a thermometer? What does a thermometer do, Tim? A thermometer, what

364
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:10,199
does it do? Takes the temperature. Is that what a thermometer does? It reads temperature.

365
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:18,639
Am I right? Is he right? Am I right? He gave the answer, amen? Do we agree? What's a thermostat

366
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:28,079
do? Sets the temperature, right? It controls. I have an app on my phone to control those

367
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:33,839
thermostats back there. Why? Because every once in a while it needs an adjustment. And

368
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:38,719
I can go on that phone and I can go up or down or whatever needs to happen, amen? I

369
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:43,999
see too many people doing this and I got to put it down a degree, but the thermostat sets

370
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:50,559
the temperature. The thermometer simply reads the temperature. See, we don't need to be

371
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:58,839
thermometers, we need to be thermostats. They were on a faulty path. Not only were they

372
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:02,959
on a faulty path, number two, if you're taking notes, they had a faulty perspective. Notice

373
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:08,559
their perspective as we continue reading this letter to the church of the Laodiceans in

374
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:15,599
verse 17, we see this faulty perspective on full display for us. The Bible says, because

375
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:22,959
thou sayest. There are three things that the church of the Laodiceans, the people were

376
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:28,159
saying this was their perspective, but their perspective was faulty for they say this,

377
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:42,599
I am rich. I am increased with goods. Notice this one, I have need of nothing. I would

378
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:48,839
argue knowing what we know about the entirety of the letter that it was as if they didn't

379
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:57,319
even need God because He was on the outside of this church. Can I remind you this evening

380
00:22:57,399 --> 00:23:07,399
what I said this morning? Without Him, I can do nothing. What did Jesus teach in John 15?

381
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:17,080
I am the vine, ye are the branches. Right? We have no live flowers in here and the reason

382
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,559
for that is because I have allergies and so it's not really good if there's a bunch of

383
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,519
live flowers up here. Makes me sneeze and itchy eyes and all that sort of thing so we

384
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:31,679
got forever flowers. But you have live flowers that are cut from the vine and they last just

385
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,879
for a short period of time. Why? Because their source of life has been cut off. They'll last

386
00:23:37,879 --> 00:23:42,399
just for a short time. You buy flowers for your wife. It's a great thing to do, but man

387
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:47,679
after a little while what happens? The petals of those flowers start falling on the countertop.

388
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:54,959
Do they not? Before long the flowers must be discarded. Why? Because they're dead. And

389
00:23:54,959 --> 00:24:00,360
Jesus taught in John 15, without me you can do nothing. Paul said this, I know that in

390
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:07,519
me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing. We find that they're saying we're rich, we're

391
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:12,399
increased with goods, we have need of nothing. By the way, as I look at the message to the

392
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:17,839
church of the Laodiceans here in Revelation chapter number 3, as we conclude and understand

393
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:22,639
as I've mentioned many times throughout this series, that these churches are representative

394
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:30,079
of the entirety of the church age. This was a true local church in Laodicea. There are

395
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:36,119
some that take the approach that each church represents a certain portion of church history

396
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:42,279
and every church within that history of timeline has to be that type of church. I don't believe

397
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:47,600
that. I believe that in every era of church history you can find every church represented

398
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:54,479
that you find within Revelation 2 and 3. It would be a sad day if we're living in the

399
00:24:54,479 --> 00:25:00,239
last days and we're in the Laodicean church age and all we can be is a church of the Laodiceans.

400
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:06,880
That'd be sad. I don't believe that. We can have revival. We can have a church that's

401
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:13,000
amended. We can have a work that's being done for Christ that is worthwhile, that is

402
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
bringing honor and glory to His name. These are not the only seven churches in existence

403
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,059
in the first century. But Jesus in His wisdom and His omniscience, He chose to write these

404
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:31,059
letters to these seven churches because they're representative. And we find this evening that

405
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:36,479
I believe, listen, if you look in the beginning of the book of Acts, after the church is rolling

406
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:45,519
and people are getting saved and I mean God is at work, what happens? Persecution. Right?

407
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:51,799
Persecution. What's the devil trying to do? Well, he's trying to stamp out Christianity

408
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:56,059
is what he's trying to do. He's trying to bring that persecution. He's opposing the

409
00:25:56,059 --> 00:26:00,880
work of God. You get to Acts chapter 8 when the persecution reaches that pinnacle, if

410
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,839
you will, and they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word, hallelujah.

411
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:10,600
They had only been in Jerusalem at that time, but the command in Acts 1 and verse 8 was

412
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:17,419
to both in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the uttermost. And after all of that persecution

413
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:22,479
in Acts chapter 8, you know what happens? They go to those places that they had not

414
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:28,679
yet gone. The church is flourishing and the church is going forth. Listen, persecution

415
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:35,600
didn't work. And persecution still doesn't work. Some of the most persecuted believers

416
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:45,199
in the world today are where Christianity is thriving the most. You can read it. You

417
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:55,079
can see reports. I mentioned a few of those places this morning. Iran, North Korea, Egypt,

418
00:26:55,079 --> 00:27:03,479
Northern Africa. It's amazing. Great persecution, but the church is flourishing. This tactic

419
00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:15,239
of the enemy is a different tactic. Plenty, rich, increased with goods, need of nothing.

420
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:21,519
Could I call it this way? Comfortable. You know what happens when you get comfortable?

421
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:33,799
You get apathetic. You get indifferent. Don't really need it. Become a club. That's what

422
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:41,660
happens. That's why it's a church of the people, a church of the Laodiceans. They had a faulty

423
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:46,279
perspective because this is what they said, but I want you to notice in verse 17, the

424
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:51,279
one, now remember, these things say at the end, this is the one, the Lord Jesus Christ,

425
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:57,959
what He says is so. He says, thou sayest, but you know not. It's as if Christ is now

426
00:27:57,959 --> 00:28:03,199
going to say, here's the real situation. Here's what you say of your condition, but here's

427
00:28:03,199 --> 00:28:09,839
what is reality. They had a faulty perspective. Notice what He says. They said three things,

428
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:17,559
rich, increased with goods, have need of nothing. He says five things. Thou are wretched, miserable,

429
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:28,799
poor, blind, and naked. Wow. What a description. Now remember again, He is the faithful and true

430
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:34,440
witness. He is the amen. What He says is so. They could as much as they wanted to try to argue with

431
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:40,679
the assessment that Christ gives forth, but the reality is it would just be in vain because what

432
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:47,760
He says is so. They had a faulty perspective. They did not know their own condition. They

433
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:55,599
have gotten so comfortable and so apathetic and so indifferent and just so comfortable

434
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:04,640
with their circumstances and their situation that they did not realize their terrible condition.

435
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,640
I've argued from this pulpit, people have made the statement that the most miserable

436
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:14,320
people in the world are lost people. I disagree wholeheartedly. Why do I say that? Because

437
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:20,039
there are some really happy lost people. They don't know. They don't care. Whatever the

438
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:24,979
reason is, they don't understand the brevity of life. They don't understand the reality

439
00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:29,960
of eternity. There are many reasons. I think the most miserable people in the world are

440
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:40,039
backslidden Christians. The ones that know to do right and aren't doing it. They're miserable.

441
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:47,760
No, I'm not miserable. Argue with yourself. You're miserable. Amen? That's what Jesus

442
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:54,520
says. They're wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked. When you look at the contrast in

443
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:00,599
verse 17, you recognize that this faulty path of verse 15 and 16 leads to this faulty perspective.

444
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:09,199
And there's a measure here of self-reliance, there's a measure here of self-deception,

445
00:30:09,199 --> 00:30:15,119
as I mentioned earlier this evening, this deceived condition of this church.

446
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:20,919
And oh that God would help us this evening to not be self-reliant.

447
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:25,979
Oh that God would help us not to be deceived.

448
00:30:25,979 --> 00:30:33,859
God would help us to have a time of revival, of evaluation, examination.

449
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:37,739
Because remember at the end of each letter that he writes, and it's true of this message

450
00:30:37,739 --> 00:30:41,539
as well, in verse 22 here, but at the end of each of the letters he says,

451
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:51,459
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches, plural.

452
00:30:51,459 --> 00:30:57,299
There's truth in each letter that every believer can learn from.

453
00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:02,219
And the reality this evening is that here of the church of the Laodiceans, the last

454
00:31:02,219 --> 00:31:06,939
of these churches that are addressed, we find that this evening there's great truth for

455
00:31:06,939 --> 00:31:09,339
us, warnings.

456
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:13,419
The counsel we'll deal with next week as we get into verse 18, he says, I counsel thee.

457
00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:19,239
But as I look at this text of Scripture and I find this faulty path and this faulty perspective,

458
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:22,599
number three, if you're taking notes this evening, I would say a frequent problem.

459
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:25,479
Why do I say it's a frequent problem?

460
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:32,639
Because a lot of churches today that can be described just like the church of the Laodiceans.

461
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:36,879
I'm not trying to stand in a position this evening and cast stones at other churches.

462
00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:40,879
I'm not in a position where I'm going to be Elijah syndrome or the only ones, because

463
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:41,879
I know we're not.

464
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:46,039
I have pastors and missionary friends that I pray for every week.

465
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:50,719
I sit right in that seat and I pray for them and they are faithfully serving God.

466
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:53,079
They are standing on the truth of God's word.

467
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:54,959
They're seeking to reach their communities.

468
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:57,839
They are friends that are faithful.

469
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:59,199
Here's how I prayed for them this morning.

470
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:02,199
I said, God, thank you for these friends in the ministry.

471
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:07,919
God, thank you for their faithfulness and would you help each of us to finish the race

472
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,119
that you've called us to?

473
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:12,679
That's how I prayed for them this morning.

474
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:20,759
There are some really good churches, but this path and this perspective that we see

475
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:24,879
of the church of the Laodiceans is a frequent problem.

476
00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:31,799
Unfortunately, many churches throughout the ages have resembled the church of the Laodiceans.

477
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:36,359
Many churches have resembled this church.

478
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:43,119
If they were to adequately and honestly evaluate, we find that they would fit the mold, if you

479
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:46,119
will.

480
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:51,519
Though it's a common problem, it's a frequent problem, the reality this evening is it doesn't

481
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:52,519
have to be.

482
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:55,319
It doesn't have to be.

483
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:58,319
Our God still reigns, amen?

484
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,319
He's still on his throne.

485
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:02,079
The gospel still works.

486
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:03,199
You believe that this evening?

487
00:33:03,199 --> 00:33:05,119
I believe the gospel still works.

488
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:11,199
Listen, if Jesus was done with us, we'd be out of here.

489
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:14,879
For the Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness.

490
00:33:14,879 --> 00:33:18,679
But as longsuffering to us, we're not willing that any should perish, but that all should

491
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:20,279
come to repentance.

492
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:25,559
God has us here in March of 2025 for a purpose, for a reason.

493
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,239
He's not done with us.

494
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:32,039
And we find this evening that though this is a frequent problem throughout church history,

495
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:35,399
it does not have to be.

496
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:37,159
We don't have to be apathetic and indifferent.

497
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:39,679
We don't have to be increased with goods and have need of nothing.

498
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,919
No, we can walk in obedience to Christ and his commands.

499
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:48,159
We can walk in understanding that I must abide in him and I can do nothing without him.

500
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,199
And all that we do is for the glory of God.

501
00:33:51,199 --> 00:33:57,499
We can be surrendered and sold out for the cause of Christ.

502
00:33:57,499 --> 00:33:59,439
We don't have to be influenced by this world.

503
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:00,439
We don't have to.

504
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:06,439
We're told not to be, and be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing

505
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:10,999
of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

506
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:13,599
Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.

507
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,599
Why?

508
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:15,599
They're all going to fade away.

509
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,079
They're going to pass away.

510
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:22,239
But he that doeth the will of God abideth forever, 1 John chapter 2.

511
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,239
Is it true?

512
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:26,279
It's what God said in his word.

513
00:34:26,279 --> 00:34:32,679
This evening a local church can operate and function in a manner that is God-honoring.

514
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:44,539
This evening a church can have the blessing of God, can have God's blessing upon it.

515
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:50,159
God gives us the instructions in his word for how a church is to function or operate.

516
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,639
It's not up for you or for me to sit around in some round table conference room somewhere

517
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,479
and figure out how should we have church polity, how should we do this, how should

518
00:34:58,479 --> 00:34:59,479
we do that.

519
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:03,519
No, it's for us to go and open up the word of God that he's provided to us and say, how

520
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:06,679
does it work?

521
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:08,679
What are the offices in a church?

522
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:10,999
Who's qualified for the offices in a church?

523
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:12,959
It's not your opinion or my opinion that matters.

524
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:16,599
It's what God said, amen?

525
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:23,919
And we find this evening that as we look at this church of the Laodiceans, we see that

526
00:35:23,919 --> 00:35:28,799
this frequent problem doesn't have to be.

527
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:35,119
I remember hearing people say, Brother Mershon would say this often as he's in the work of

528
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,799
evangelism, he's been sidelined for a period of time due to illness with his wife.

529
00:35:40,799 --> 00:35:45,799
He said he believes that God can send revival.

530
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:48,159
I believe that this evening.

531
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,359
And here's what he said, if I didn't believe that God could send revival, why would I do

532
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:53,359
it?

533
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,359
Why would I travel?

534
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:57,479
Why would I do what I'm doing?

535
00:35:57,479 --> 00:35:59,959
Will thou not revive thy people again?

536
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:03,799
It is time to seek the Lord.

537
00:36:03,799 --> 00:36:10,039
Brother Jeff said it this morning, break up your fallow ground.

538
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:19,559
The last phrase of verse 16 reveals just how repulsive this local church was to the Lord.

539
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:26,599
I will spew thee out of my mouth.

540
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:34,139
Oh that our Lord would look upon us and be pleased with us.

541
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:40,639
Oh that it would never be said, you're lukewarm.

542
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:45,279
You're not hot, you're not cold, I'm going to spew you out of my mouth.

543
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:50,799
Oh I don't ever want it to be said of me personally or us corporately as a church,

544
00:36:50,799 --> 00:36:57,319
that we'd keep the fire going, God has a purpose for us, He has a plan for us.

545
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:01,439
And what we must do is His work, His way.

546
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:06,719
The church of the Laodiceans was a church of the people, made a faulty path that led

547
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:07,719
to a faulty perspective.

548
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:12,559
It's a frequent problem that we've seen in church history, but I submit to you this evening

549
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:15,519
it doesn't have to be.

550
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:18,759
In 2025, we can still please God.

551
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:22,999
You say, but it's hard.

552
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:27,839
Everyone else, this, that, and the other.

553
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:36,639
Can I remind you of a verse in Genesis 6, but Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.

554
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:43,719
Noah lived in a day of terrible wickedness, did he not?

555
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,679
But Noah was upright.

556
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:50,159
Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.

557
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:55,599
And for us this evening, we too can please God.

558
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,159
We don't have to be like the Laodiceans.

559
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,159
Let's pray together.

560
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:01,579
Father, we love you.

561
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:02,879
We thank you for loving us.

562
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:03,879
Thank you for your word.

563
00:38:04,879 --> 00:38:10,559
I pray that the Holy Spirit would move and work in hearts as only you can.

564
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,439
Help us as a church.

565
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:17,099
Church is made up of individuals.

566
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:21,799
Church is never going to have revival until the individuals have revival.

567
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:28,479
Families aren't going to have revival until the individuals in that family have revival.

568
00:38:28,479 --> 00:38:32,639
Strong people make strong families, make strong churches.

569
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:37,239
God, I pray that you'd help us.

570
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:41,719
Help us, Lord, to take heed to the message to the church of the Laodiceans.

571
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:49,000
Help us, Lord, to never go down this path and have this faulty perspective.

572
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,440
Help us to look into the perfect law of liberty, the word of God.

573
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,959
And help us to be doers of the word and not hearers only.

574
00:38:57,959 --> 00:39:00,959
Help us not to be deceived.

575
00:39:00,959 --> 00:39:05,000
I pray that in these moments of invitation that you'd have your will and way.

576
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,799
We'll give you the glory for all that you'll do.

577
00:39:06,799 --> 00:39:08,239
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

578
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:08,679
Would you stand up?
