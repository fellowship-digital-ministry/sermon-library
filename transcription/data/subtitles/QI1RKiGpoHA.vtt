WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840
Revelation chapter number three, and as we look here at this portion of Scripture, we're

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.039
not going to make it through the entire letter or text with regard to the message to the

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:11.039
Laodiceans.

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:15.119
I'm going to do this in two parts, and I start at the beginning of the week thinking I was

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:20.440
going to get it all in one service, and then just about halfway through the week I started

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.479
kind of thinking, nah, it's not going to happen, and then I thought, yeah, it will happen,

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:28.799
and then I told Holly on Friday, you've got to put part one in the bulletin because it's

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:35.560
just not going to happen, but we're thankful for these seven letters that are written here

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.360
in the book of Revelation, chapter number two and three, and of course, as you know,

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.880
this is the seventh and final letter that's written to the church of the Laodiceans.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.880
It's very interesting.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.580
Look at verse 14 with me in chapter three.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:53.319
The Bible says this, and unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write, and we'll

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:57.319
read further as we go through the message this evening, but I want to remind you of

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:01.880
the interesting approach or really introduction here that we read with regard to who is being

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.880
addressed.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.160
When we read of the church, the first letter, the church of Ephesus, a location where the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.519
church was, and yes, we understand this church is in Laodicea.

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:17.480
It is a local church, but it's interesting how God uses the words that he uses in writing

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.760
to this church because he doesn't say unto the church in Laodicea.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.480
He says to the church of the Laodiceans.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.839
We find that he writes to the church in Ephesus in chapter two.

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:32.919
He says to the church of Ephesus when he writes beginning in verse number eight of chapter

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:34.959
two to the church in Smyrna.

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:41.720
He says unto the angel of the church in Smyrna, and then we find in Pergamos, in Thyatira,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.120
in Sardis, in Philadelphia, those six churches that are addressed, and now we come to this

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.239
seventh and final letter, and he doesn't say, again, I'm going to be repetitive, he doesn't

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:54.720
say to the church in Laodicea.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.959
He says the church of the Laodiceans.

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:59.680
Every word of God is pure.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.680
God chooses his words on purpose and with purpose, and he communicates something to

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.679
us, and we find here in this text of Scripture that this was a church of the people, a church

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:16.119
of the people, a church of the people.

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:23.479
No longer was the Lord Jesus Christ the head of this church, and by the way, it's his church.

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:26.080
He is to be the head of the church.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.639
He said in Matthew, I will build your church?

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:35.660
No, he said I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.839
We find that in Colossians chapter number one, he makes it very plain and very clear

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:46.399
that he is the head of the church, and I'm thankful that the Lord Jesus Christ is the

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.399
head of the church.

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:51.399
By the way, if you look at Acts 20 and also in Ephesians chapter number five, he purchased

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:53.240
the church with his own blood.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.399
I was having a conversation with John on the back porch before the service this evening,

00:02:57.399 --> 00:03:03.399
and I said I kind of just feel like maybe in the era that we're living that some people

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:07.520
maybe just don't understand the significance of the church.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:15.720
They don't appreciate what a church is and how we're to relate to a church and having

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.800
a local church that stands on the truth of God's word, a church that wants to do something

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.600
for the cause of Christ, and what a blessing to understand the truth of the church.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:31.759
Listen, the church was not man's idea, it's God's idea, it's God's plan, God's organism,

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:37.600
if you will, for this era of human history is the local church.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.539
It is the pillar and ground of the truth is what we're told as Paul is writing to Timothy

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:44.600
and giving him instruction.

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:50.000
So we find here that as we look here, this church of the Laodiceans, God addresses them

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.479
in that manner because he no longer was the head of the church.

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:57.520
Remember, we won't get to it this evening, but later in the text in verse number 20,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.500
he says, behold, I stand at the door and knock.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.919
The picture is clear in verse number 20 of this letter to the church.

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:12.440
So often verse number 20 of Revelation 3 is used when people are trying to lead somebody

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.799
to Christ and they're out visiting and soul winning and sharing the gospel, and they say

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.559
something like this, listen, Jesus is knocking on the heart door or the door of your heart,

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:27.359
and if you just let them in, that is not the picture that is in Revelation 3 and verse

00:04:27.359 --> 00:04:28.359
number 20.

00:04:28.359 --> 00:04:33.760
It's fine to use that as application if you choose to do so, but the reality is that Jesus

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:40.299
Christ, the one who died for the church, that rose for the church, we find that he is on

00:04:40.299 --> 00:04:45.100
the outside of the church knocking.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.899
The outside of his church, it's the church of the people, of the Laodiceans.

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:53.859
Listen, the church is not a club.

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:54.859
Church is not a club.

00:04:54.859 --> 00:04:55.859
Amen?

00:04:55.859 --> 00:04:59.140
The church is the bride of Christ.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.000
Man, hallelujah for church.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
We need more churches.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.700
We don't need fewer churches.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.380
I find out weekly of churches without pastors, churches that are closing down, churches that

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.420
no longer stand for the truth that they once stood for, churches that have gone apostate,

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.980
churches that have gone liberal, churches that have gone contemporary, so on and so

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:20.980
forth.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.540
It's all around us.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.859
The church of the Laodiceans.

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:30.820
It's of interest that as you look at this letter, you'll find that the Lord Jesus Christ

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.019
has nothing positive to say about this church.

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:37.019
Nothing positive.

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:40.540
What a sad indictment.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.820
He said nothing positive with regard to this church.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:50.420
We find that the church, as I referred to it a few weeks ago in Smyrna, I referred to

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.100
that church as being the poor, rich church.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:02.739
Remember the Bible says this in Revelation 2 in verse number 8, I know thy works in tribulation

00:06:02.739 --> 00:06:07.059
and poverty, but thou art rich.

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:13.579
Think about the verse that we just are working on for the month of March with regard to the

00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:19.140
truth of the transaction that took place, for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:25.059
that though He was rich, He became poor.

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:26.140
Why?

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:32.420
For our sakes, that we through His poverty might be rich.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:38.100
And the church in Smyrna is referred to as the church that God says, I know thy poverty,

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.100
but thou art rich.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.420
And I said that that church could be referred to as the poor, rich church.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.820
Well now, the church of the Laodiceans, we could refer to it as the rich, poor church.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.820
Oh, they had all the things.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.380
In fact, they say in verse number 17, I am rich, increased with goods, have need of nothing.

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:57.739
And we'll look at it in more detail in just a moment.

00:06:57.739 --> 00:07:05.619
But we find that this church could be described as being the rich, poor church.

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:13.179
If churches all around the world today that have multi-million dollar buildings and all

00:07:13.179 --> 00:07:21.380
sorts of things, I mean just beautiful structures, but is God there?

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.920
Is God there?

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.100
Some of them, sure, God is there.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.220
And I'm not saying anything negative about a place that is nice and elaborate and so

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.220
on and so forth.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:36.540
But we must understand here that this was a bad situation in Laodicea.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:41.859
The city is about 45 miles southeast of Philadelphia, the last church that we dealt with.

00:07:41.859 --> 00:07:46.339
We find that in AD 60, we understand through history that there was great devastation of

00:07:46.339 --> 00:07:49.619
the city of Laodicea as a result of an earthquake.

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:53.260
The people, however, of the city refused imperial assistance.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.260
Why?

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.619
Because they would rebuild on their own resources.

00:07:56.619 --> 00:07:59.059
I mean that was kind of the mindset of the people.

00:07:59.059 --> 00:08:03.019
And unfortunately what was happening is that the mindset of the people in the community

00:08:03.019 --> 00:08:06.299
was influencing and impacting the church.

00:08:06.299 --> 00:08:10.660
The church wasn't having an impact and influence on the community, but the community was certainly

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.019
influencing and impacting the church.

00:08:13.019 --> 00:08:16.500
I heard somebody make this statement on Tuesday, I was at a pastor's meeting, and they said

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.579
this, I still believe in a gospel that will save a man.

00:08:19.579 --> 00:08:20.660
You believe that?

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.299
I believe in a gospel that will save a man.

00:08:24.299 --> 00:08:28.339
He said, but I also believe in a gospel that will change a man.

00:08:28.339 --> 00:08:32.659
And here's what he said, he went on to say this, unfortunately I'm not seeing a lot of

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:36.380
changed men today.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.619
If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.

00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:41.900
Old things are passed away, behold all things are become new.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.859
I referenced that this morning in 2 Corinthians 5.

00:08:44.859 --> 00:08:50.500
And the reality is that here as we look at this church in Laodicea, the church of the

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:56.539
Laodiceans, they were being heavily influenced by their community.

00:08:56.539 --> 00:09:02.460
While God's intent is always for the church to influence the community.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:10.179
The city was known to have water come in via an aqueduct that was about five miles.

00:09:10.179 --> 00:09:13.140
The water was known to always be lukewarm.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:18.659
You never really get a cold drink of water, just lukewarm.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.940
You ever have a hot day and just need a cold drink?

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:26.500
It was very known in this particular city and it's interesting because God deals with

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:31.219
that in verse 15 with regard to the condition of their own hearts.

00:09:31.219 --> 00:09:34.340
As we introduce the letter, I want you to notice some things, some reminders if you

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.539
will for the church.

00:09:36.539 --> 00:09:41.340
Notice in verse number 14, and unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write, notice

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:46.340
this phrase, these things saith the amen.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.460
I mentioned this in the service this morning.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.900
The reality is that in each of the letters that Christ writes to the churches, we find

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:58.659
that there's some aspect by way of introduction where he highlights some attribute of himself.

00:09:58.659 --> 00:10:00.059
We find that in chapter number 14.

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:02.619
of the book of Revelation, there's this great revelation

00:10:02.619 --> 00:10:06.659
about Jesus and who he is and John seeing him

00:10:06.659 --> 00:10:09.599
and all of that, and then we come to each of the letters

00:10:09.599 --> 00:10:12.199
and in the introductory verse, you'll find

00:10:12.199 --> 00:10:14.739
a particular attribute that's highlighted here.

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:19.179
Jesus says, these things saith the amen.

00:10:19.179 --> 00:10:20.979
You know what that literally means?

00:10:20.979 --> 00:10:24.419
What he says is so.

00:10:24.419 --> 00:10:26.919
If you say amen, sometimes somebody's preaching

00:10:26.979 --> 00:10:30.239
and somebody will say, amen, so be it, I agree.

00:10:31.959 --> 00:10:35.639
Well here, Jesus is saying, these things saith the amen,

00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:38.719
giving a name to himself as being the amen

00:10:38.719 --> 00:10:42.119
and what he says is so.

00:10:42.119 --> 00:10:43.119
What does that mean?

00:10:43.119 --> 00:10:48.119
Well, his account, his evaluation is true, is accurate.

00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:52.979
It doesn't matter, Laodiceans, what you think

00:10:52.979 --> 00:10:57.339
or what you say, it matters what the amen says.

00:10:57.339 --> 00:10:59.099
And can I tell you this evening, that's a reminder

00:10:59.099 --> 00:11:00.899
that we need in our lives as well.

00:11:02.659 --> 00:11:05.099
These things saith the amen.

00:11:05.099 --> 00:11:08.139
Notice as he continues in verse number 14,

00:11:08.139 --> 00:11:12.019
the faithful and true witness.

00:11:12.019 --> 00:11:13.819
Aren't you thankful for that description?

00:11:13.819 --> 00:11:16.779
The Lord Jesus Christ, he is faithful.

00:11:16.779 --> 00:11:18.819
He is the true witness.

00:11:18.819 --> 00:11:21.059
It goes right along with the name amen

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:24.019
and it tells us that he is the faithful and true witness.

00:11:24.019 --> 00:11:26.220
He tells us in the next phrase,

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.459
the beginning of the creation of God.

00:11:29.459 --> 00:11:31.619
Please do not misunderstand, that does not mean

00:11:31.619 --> 00:11:33.099
that he was the first created

00:11:33.099 --> 00:11:37.939
for we know that he's not created, he is God in flesh

00:11:37.939 --> 00:11:39.899
and we understand the truth of the Trinity

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:42.099
and we find that the truth of God's word

00:11:42.099 --> 00:11:44.299
is given to us in John chapter number one

00:11:44.299 --> 00:11:46.040
and many of us are familiar with the passage,

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.019
but he says this, in the beginning was the word

00:11:49.019 --> 00:11:54.019
and the word was with God and the word was God, amen.

00:11:56.939 --> 00:11:59.819
The word in just a few verses, verse 14,

00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:04.739
was made flesh and dwelt among us.

00:12:04.739 --> 00:12:06.379
That's Jesus Christ, he's God.

00:12:06.379 --> 00:12:07.379
But notice in verse two,

00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:09.259
the same was in the beginning with God,

00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:10.660
all things, how many things?

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.220
All things were made by him

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:17.179
and without him was not anything made that was made.

00:12:17.179 --> 00:12:18.940
Colossians chapter number one,

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.660
we find that here he reiterates this truth

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.699
of the role he had in creation.

00:12:24.699 --> 00:12:26.619
In Colossians chapter number one

00:12:26.619 --> 00:12:31.080
and verses 15 through 18 highlight this for us beautifully

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.179
as we understand that all things come from him.

00:12:35.179 --> 00:12:38.199
Notice in verse 15, who is the image of the invisible God,

00:12:38.199 --> 00:12:40.179
the firstborn of every creature,

00:12:40.179 --> 00:12:43.580
for by him were all things created that are in heaven

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.779
and that are in earth, visible and invisible,

00:12:45.779 --> 00:12:47.300
whether they be thrones or dominions

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.099
or principalities or powers,

00:12:49.099 --> 00:12:53.099
all things were created by him and for him

00:12:53.099 --> 00:12:56.179
and he is before all things

00:12:56.179 --> 00:13:01.179
and by him all things consist, amen.

00:13:01.259 --> 00:13:02.699
That's our God.

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:05.259
Why did the Laodiceans need these reminders?

00:13:05.259 --> 00:13:07.259
Well, they needed the reminder that he's the amen,

00:13:07.259 --> 00:13:08.699
what he says is so,

00:13:08.699 --> 00:13:13.020
because they had some self-deception, amen.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.419
They needed to know that he's the true and faithful

00:13:16.059 --> 00:13:16.899
and true witness.

00:13:16.899 --> 00:13:18.500
They needed to know that, why?

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.739
Because of that self-deception.

00:13:20.739 --> 00:13:23.860
I preached a message years ago on a Wednesday evening

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.580
and it's actually a series of messages on deception

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.839
and I said this as I preached through that series

00:13:28.839 --> 00:13:32.779
of messages that the worst deception is self-deception.

00:13:35.179 --> 00:13:36.580
They were deceived.

00:13:40.259 --> 00:13:43.380
So Jesus is the amen, he is the faithful and true witness.

00:13:43.419 --> 00:13:46.139
He tells them that all things come from him,

00:13:46.139 --> 00:13:47.819
that he is the beginning of the creation of God.

00:13:47.819 --> 00:13:49.059
Why does he tell them that?

00:13:49.059 --> 00:13:52.539
Well, because they thought they had all these things

00:13:52.539 --> 00:13:54.339
and they thought, man, we're increased with goods,

00:13:54.339 --> 00:13:56.500
we have need of nothing and God reminds them,

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.380
hey, everything that you have is because of me.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.559
Is that not a reminder that we need today as well?

00:14:03.559 --> 00:14:05.819
I'm not my own, I'm bought with a price.

00:14:05.819 --> 00:14:08.259
Deuteronomy talks about the God

00:14:08.259 --> 00:14:10.979
that gives us the power to get wealth.

00:14:11.899 --> 00:14:14.339
So often we have this thing messed up in our head.

00:14:14.339 --> 00:14:16.299
We think, oh, I got this, I'm a self-made.

00:14:16.299 --> 00:14:20.339
No, God gave you everything that you have.

00:14:22.579 --> 00:14:24.839
And when we understand, I wrote it on a little sticky

00:14:24.839 --> 00:14:27.299
on my desk and put it right in the middle of my calendar,

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:28.380
on my desk calendar.

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.480
Any of you can go down there and see it, it's sitting there.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:35.399
Stop trying to possess what God gave us to steward.

00:14:36.239 --> 00:14:41.239
Stop trying to possess what God gave us to steward.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.779
We've gotten really possessive.

00:14:45.779 --> 00:14:50.779
It's my life, it's my, am I not?

00:14:51.119 --> 00:14:53.320
Do you live in the same area that I live in?

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.279
Come on.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.839
And that mentality, that philosophy

00:14:58.839 --> 00:15:01.540
can creep into our minds.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.399
We're stewards, we're stewards.

00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:09.700
And what does he require of stewards?

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.559
That we're faithful.

00:15:11.559 --> 00:15:14.919
Moreover, it's required in stewards

00:15:14.919 --> 00:15:17.839
that a man be found faithful.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.380
What else does he remind him of?

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:24.179
Well, the same thing he reminded every church of.

00:15:24.179 --> 00:15:28.619
In verse 15, I know thy works.

00:15:28.619 --> 00:15:29.540
What is that a reminder of?

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.179
Well, God's omniscience.

00:15:32.179 --> 00:15:33.419
I preached about it this morning

00:15:33.419 --> 00:15:36.639
that we're gonna stand at the judgment seat of Christ.

00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:39.899
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ.

00:15:39.899 --> 00:15:41.519
Listen, we're not gonna cover anything,

00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:43.540
we're not gonna hide anything, we're not gonna,

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:44.940
he knows everything.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.899
He knows the works and he knows the motives.

00:15:46.899 --> 00:15:49.019
He knows what sort it is.

00:15:49.899 --> 00:15:54.639
And here we find that he says, I know thy works.

00:15:55.639 --> 00:16:00.639
The people, the church of the Laodiceans,

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.000
they needed these reminders.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.079
But could I tell you this evening,

00:16:05.079 --> 00:16:07.919
we too need these reminders.

00:16:07.919 --> 00:16:09.839
We need these reminders.

00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:12.260
I'm gonna preach this evening just a few thoughts.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.880
That was all introduction.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.239
I just got a few thoughts for you.

00:16:15.239 --> 00:16:18.799
Number one, if you're taking notes, a faulty path.

00:16:18.799 --> 00:16:20.260
A faulty path.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.339
The Bible tells us in verse number 15,

00:16:23.339 --> 00:16:28.220
I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.619
I would thou wert cold or hot.

00:16:31.619 --> 00:16:34.579
So then because thou art lukewarm

00:16:34.579 --> 00:16:39.579
and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth.

00:16:43.899 --> 00:16:48.380
Wow, what a, can you imagine being in the church

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.579
of the Laodiceans and getting this letter?

00:16:50.779 --> 00:16:55.779
Wow, God who knows all things, what he says is so.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:58.779
He says, you're lukewarm.

00:16:58.779 --> 00:17:00.380
You're not hot, you're not cold.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.459
I would that you were one or the other,

00:17:02.459 --> 00:17:04.500
but you're lukewarm and because you're lukewarm,

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.059
I'm gonna spew you out of my mouth.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.220
Wow, they had a faulty path.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.179
They were lukewarm, they were compromising,

00:17:14.179 --> 00:17:15.559
they were accommodating.

00:17:16.419 --> 00:17:17.940
You know, we live in a time in which there's

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:22.139
so much pressure, so much pressure to bend

00:17:22.139 --> 00:17:26.139
and to bow to the pressures of the society,

00:17:26.139 --> 00:17:28.339
to accommodate and to compromise,

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:30.380
but I want you to understand this evening

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:34.559
that we have God's word and we can stand upon God's word.

00:17:37.299 --> 00:17:39.899
We're to contend earnestly, contend for the faith

00:17:39.899 --> 00:17:41.380
that was once delivered to the saints

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.339
and we find that so often this idea of being lukewarm,

00:17:45.339 --> 00:17:47.919
this compromising, accommodating perspective,

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.519
this path that we find them on is a path

00:17:50.519 --> 00:17:54.119
that is so often one in which people will turn to, why?

00:17:54.119 --> 00:17:55.639
Because they wanna get a bigger crowd,

00:17:55.639 --> 00:17:57.200
they wanna do certain things.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.200
I heard somebody say it just recently.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.040
In fact, I was at a pastor's meeting and they said,

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.119
man, I always had a dream to pastor a church

00:18:04.119 --> 00:18:07.760
of like 600 people and there was a greater context

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.399
to why they said that, but that was their statement

00:18:11.399 --> 00:18:13.919
and in making their statement, they were speaking about

00:18:13.919 --> 00:18:17.220
what do you do in order to see a church grow that big?

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.399
There are many things that you can do,

00:18:19.399 --> 00:18:21.919
but you better stay on God's path

00:18:21.919 --> 00:18:24.440
because God's work must be done God's way.

00:18:25.839 --> 00:18:28.480
By the way, David learned a lesson about that with Uzzah,

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.440
did he not?

00:18:30.519 --> 00:18:35.520
Was it a good thing to bring the ark back to Jerusalem?

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.520
Yeah, it was a good thing.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.279
Were the people in agreement?

00:18:38.279 --> 00:18:41.320
Yeah, they were in agreement, but guess what?

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.960
They did it the wrong way.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.640
So much for all these people today,

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.200
just do what you want, just worship God how you want.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.479
No, God said you approach me on my terms, amen?

00:18:53.119 --> 00:18:58.039
And they tried to take that ark on a cart.

00:18:58.039 --> 00:19:01.000
By the way, where did they get that idea from?

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.440
It's how the Philistines sent it back.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.559
Am I not right?

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:10.479
The Philistines sent it back, the world's way, right?

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.400
The oxen go over the threshing floor

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.640
and Uzzah touches that thing and he's killed.

00:19:18.159 --> 00:19:22.119
You read the account in Chronicles

00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:23.840
and you find that it's interesting,

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.880
it's in both accounts and you look at the contrast

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.440
between the two and how David responds and what he does

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.880
and you find in Chronicles that really he goes back

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.880
and he searches and he finds out how are we supposed,

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.159
like he was afraid, he was displeased,

00:19:37.159 --> 00:19:38.960
he was, I mean, all kinds of things going on,

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.799
but you know what he did?

00:19:39.799 --> 00:19:41.559
He went back and he found out how are we supposed

00:19:41.559 --> 00:19:43.880
to transport this according to God's way?

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.320
And you know what he found out?

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:49.320
That God gave the prescribed way to Moses.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.520
In fact, there were staves that were made

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.239
and rings that were there and the part of carrying it

00:19:54.239 --> 00:19:55.279
and the priests were to do it,

00:19:55.279 --> 00:19:59.779
he found out were to do it God's way.

00:19:59.779 --> 00:20:00.619
And then.

00:20:00.619 --> 00:20:08.199
God blessed. This faulty path that this church was on, being influenced and impacted by their

00:20:08.199 --> 00:20:12.799
community with this, I'll say potential, I can't, I don't want to read into it, say something

00:20:12.799 --> 00:20:18.639
that's not there, but it seems like there was this desire on their part to be relevant.

00:20:18.639 --> 00:20:23.639
By the way, we hear so much about relevance today. You're just not relevant anymore, you're

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:28.759
outdated, you need this, you need to update that, so on and so forth. God is always relevant.

00:20:28.959 --> 00:20:37.799
Why? Because God is outside of time. He's the eternal God. He's Alpha and Omega. And

00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:43.639
He gave us a book, the Bible, and it doesn't need to be updated, it doesn't, no, no, no,

00:20:43.639 --> 00:20:49.239
it just needs to be followed. It needs to be read once again and obeyed. We find that

00:20:49.239 --> 00:20:53.679
this church, they're on this faulty path, I have written in my notes the contrast between

00:20:53.679 --> 00:20:58.159
a thermostat and a thermometer. Have you ever given any thought to the difference between

00:20:58.159 --> 00:21:04.559
a thermostat and a thermometer? What does a thermometer do, Tim? A thermometer, what

00:21:04.559 --> 00:21:10.199
does it do? Takes the temperature. Is that what a thermometer does? It reads temperature.

00:21:10.199 --> 00:21:18.639
Am I right? Is he right? Am I right? He gave the answer, amen? Do we agree? What's a thermostat

00:21:18.639 --> 00:21:28.079
do? Sets the temperature, right? It controls. I have an app on my phone to control those

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:33.839
thermostats back there. Why? Because every once in a while it needs an adjustment. And

00:21:33.839 --> 00:21:38.719
I can go on that phone and I can go up or down or whatever needs to happen, amen? I

00:21:38.719 --> 00:21:43.999
see too many people doing this and I got to put it down a degree, but the thermostat sets

00:21:44.119 --> 00:21:50.559
the temperature. The thermometer simply reads the temperature. See, we don't need to be

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:58.839
thermometers, we need to be thermostats. They were on a faulty path. Not only were they

00:21:58.839 --> 00:22:02.959
on a faulty path, number two, if you're taking notes, they had a faulty perspective. Notice

00:22:02.959 --> 00:22:08.559
their perspective as we continue reading this letter to the church of the Laodiceans in

00:22:08.599 --> 00:22:15.599
verse 17, we see this faulty perspective on full display for us. The Bible says, because

00:22:15.599 --> 00:22:22.959
thou sayest. There are three things that the church of the Laodiceans, the people were

00:22:22.959 --> 00:22:28.159
saying this was their perspective, but their perspective was faulty for they say this,

00:22:28.159 --> 00:22:42.599
I am rich. I am increased with goods. Notice this one, I have need of nothing. I would

00:22:42.599 --> 00:22:48.839
argue knowing what we know about the entirety of the letter that it was as if they didn't

00:22:48.839 --> 00:22:57.319
even need God because He was on the outside of this church. Can I remind you this evening

00:22:57.399 --> 00:23:07.399
what I said this morning? Without Him, I can do nothing. What did Jesus teach in John 15?

00:23:07.399 --> 00:23:17.080
I am the vine, ye are the branches. Right? We have no live flowers in here and the reason

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.559
for that is because I have allergies and so it's not really good if there's a bunch of

00:23:20.559 --> 00:23:24.519
live flowers up here. Makes me sneeze and itchy eyes and all that sort of thing so we

00:23:24.519 --> 00:23:31.679
got forever flowers. But you have live flowers that are cut from the vine and they last just

00:23:31.679 --> 00:23:37.879
for a short period of time. Why? Because their source of life has been cut off. They'll last

00:23:37.879 --> 00:23:42.399
just for a short time. You buy flowers for your wife. It's a great thing to do, but man

00:23:42.399 --> 00:23:47.679
after a little while what happens? The petals of those flowers start falling on the countertop.

00:23:47.679 --> 00:23:54.959
Do they not? Before long the flowers must be discarded. Why? Because they're dead. And

00:23:54.959 --> 00:24:00.360
Jesus taught in John 15, without me you can do nothing. Paul said this, I know that in

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:07.519
me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing. We find that they're saying we're rich, we're

00:24:07.519 --> 00:24:12.399
increased with goods, we have need of nothing. By the way, as I look at the message to the

00:24:12.399 --> 00:24:17.839
church of the Laodiceans here in Revelation chapter number 3, as we conclude and understand

00:24:17.839 --> 00:24:22.639
as I've mentioned many times throughout this series, that these churches are representative

00:24:22.639 --> 00:24:30.079
of the entirety of the church age. This was a true local church in Laodicea. There are

00:24:30.079 --> 00:24:36.119
some that take the approach that each church represents a certain portion of church history

00:24:36.119 --> 00:24:42.279
and every church within that history of timeline has to be that type of church. I don't believe

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:47.600
that. I believe that in every era of church history you can find every church represented

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:54.479
that you find within Revelation 2 and 3. It would be a sad day if we're living in the

00:24:54.479 --> 00:25:00.239
last days and we're in the Laodicean church age and all we can be is a church of the Laodiceans.

00:25:00.239 --> 00:25:06.880
That'd be sad. I don't believe that. We can have revival. We can have a church that's

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:13.000
amended. We can have a work that's being done for Christ that is worthwhile, that is

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
bringing honor and glory to His name. These are not the only seven churches in existence

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.059
in the first century. But Jesus in His wisdom and His omniscience, He chose to write these

00:25:24.059 --> 00:25:31.059
letters to these seven churches because they're representative. And we find this evening that

00:25:31.059 --> 00:25:36.479
I believe, listen, if you look in the beginning of the book of Acts, after the church is rolling

00:25:36.519 --> 00:25:45.519
and people are getting saved and I mean God is at work, what happens? Persecution. Right?

00:25:45.519 --> 00:25:51.799
Persecution. What's the devil trying to do? Well, he's trying to stamp out Christianity

00:25:51.799 --> 00:25:56.059
is what he's trying to do. He's trying to bring that persecution. He's opposing the

00:25:56.059 --> 00:26:00.880
work of God. You get to Acts chapter 8 when the persecution reaches that pinnacle, if

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:05.839
you will, and they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word, hallelujah.

00:26:05.839 --> 00:26:10.600
They had only been in Jerusalem at that time, but the command in Acts 1 and verse 8 was

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:17.419
to both in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the uttermost. And after all of that persecution

00:26:17.419 --> 00:26:22.479
in Acts chapter 8, you know what happens? They go to those places that they had not

00:26:22.479 --> 00:26:28.679
yet gone. The church is flourishing and the church is going forth. Listen, persecution

00:26:28.679 --> 00:26:35.600
didn't work. And persecution still doesn't work. Some of the most persecuted believers

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:45.199
in the world today are where Christianity is thriving the most. You can read it. You

00:26:45.199 --> 00:26:55.079
can see reports. I mentioned a few of those places this morning. Iran, North Korea, Egypt,

00:26:55.079 --> 00:27:03.479
Northern Africa. It's amazing. Great persecution, but the church is flourishing. This tactic

00:27:03.479 --> 00:27:15.239
of the enemy is a different tactic. Plenty, rich, increased with goods, need of nothing.

00:27:15.239 --> 00:27:21.519
Could I call it this way? Comfortable. You know what happens when you get comfortable?

00:27:21.519 --> 00:27:33.799
You get apathetic. You get indifferent. Don't really need it. Become a club. That's what

00:27:33.799 --> 00:27:41.660
happens. That's why it's a church of the people, a church of the Laodiceans. They had a faulty

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:46.279
perspective because this is what they said, but I want you to notice in verse 17, the

00:27:46.279 --> 00:27:51.279
one, now remember, these things say at the end, this is the one, the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:27:51.279 --> 00:27:57.959
what He says is so. He says, thou sayest, but you know not. It's as if Christ is now

00:27:57.959 --> 00:28:03.199
going to say, here's the real situation. Here's what you say of your condition, but here's

00:28:03.199 --> 00:28:09.839
what is reality. They had a faulty perspective. Notice what He says. They said three things,

00:28:09.839 --> 00:28:17.559
rich, increased with goods, have need of nothing. He says five things. Thou are wretched, miserable,

00:28:18.119 --> 00:28:28.799
poor, blind, and naked. Wow. What a description. Now remember again, He is the faithful and true

00:28:28.799 --> 00:28:34.440
witness. He is the amen. What He says is so. They could as much as they wanted to try to argue with

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:40.679
the assessment that Christ gives forth, but the reality is it would just be in vain because what

00:28:40.679 --> 00:28:47.760
He says is so. They had a faulty perspective. They did not know their own condition. They

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:55.599
have gotten so comfortable and so apathetic and so indifferent and just so comfortable

00:28:55.599 --> 00:29:04.640
with their circumstances and their situation that they did not realize their terrible condition.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:08.640
I've argued from this pulpit, people have made the statement that the most miserable

00:29:08.679 --> 00:29:14.320
people in the world are lost people. I disagree wholeheartedly. Why do I say that? Because

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:20.039
there are some really happy lost people. They don't know. They don't care. Whatever the

00:29:20.039 --> 00:29:24.979
reason is, they don't understand the brevity of life. They don't understand the reality

00:29:24.979 --> 00:29:29.960
of eternity. There are many reasons. I think the most miserable people in the world are

00:29:30.039 --> 00:29:40.039
backslidden Christians. The ones that know to do right and aren't doing it. They're miserable.

00:29:40.039 --> 00:29:47.760
No, I'm not miserable. Argue with yourself. You're miserable. Amen? That's what Jesus

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:54.520
says. They're wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked. When you look at the contrast in

00:29:54.520 --> 00:30:00.599
verse 17, you recognize that this faulty path of verse 15 and 16 leads to this faulty perspective.

00:30:00.599 --> 00:30:09.199
And there's a measure here of self-reliance, there's a measure here of self-deception,

00:30:09.199 --> 00:30:15.119
as I mentioned earlier this evening, this deceived condition of this church.

00:30:15.119 --> 00:30:20.919
And oh that God would help us this evening to not be self-reliant.

00:30:20.919 --> 00:30:25.979
Oh that God would help us not to be deceived.

00:30:25.979 --> 00:30:33.859
God would help us to have a time of revival, of evaluation, examination.

00:30:33.859 --> 00:30:37.739
Because remember at the end of each letter that he writes, and it's true of this message

00:30:37.739 --> 00:30:41.539
as well, in verse 22 here, but at the end of each of the letters he says,

00:30:41.539 --> 00:30:51.459
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches, plural.

00:30:51.459 --> 00:30:57.299
There's truth in each letter that every believer can learn from.

00:30:57.299 --> 00:31:02.219
And the reality this evening is that here of the church of the Laodiceans, the last

00:31:02.219 --> 00:31:06.939
of these churches that are addressed, we find that this evening there's great truth for

00:31:06.939 --> 00:31:09.339
us, warnings.

00:31:09.339 --> 00:31:13.419
The counsel we'll deal with next week as we get into verse 18, he says, I counsel thee.

00:31:13.419 --> 00:31:19.239
But as I look at this text of Scripture and I find this faulty path and this faulty perspective,

00:31:19.239 --> 00:31:22.599
number three, if you're taking notes this evening, I would say a frequent problem.

00:31:22.599 --> 00:31:25.479
Why do I say it's a frequent problem?

00:31:25.479 --> 00:31:32.639
Because a lot of churches today that can be described just like the church of the Laodiceans.

00:31:32.639 --> 00:31:36.879
I'm not trying to stand in a position this evening and cast stones at other churches.

00:31:36.879 --> 00:31:40.879
I'm not in a position where I'm going to be Elijah syndrome or the only ones, because

00:31:40.879 --> 00:31:41.879
I know we're not.

00:31:41.879 --> 00:31:46.039
I have pastors and missionary friends that I pray for every week.

00:31:46.039 --> 00:31:50.719
I sit right in that seat and I pray for them and they are faithfully serving God.

00:31:50.719 --> 00:31:53.079
They are standing on the truth of God's word.

00:31:53.079 --> 00:31:54.959
They're seeking to reach their communities.

00:31:54.959 --> 00:31:57.839
They are friends that are faithful.

00:31:57.839 --> 00:31:59.199
Here's how I prayed for them this morning.

00:31:59.199 --> 00:32:02.199
I said, God, thank you for these friends in the ministry.

00:32:02.199 --> 00:32:07.919
God, thank you for their faithfulness and would you help each of us to finish the race

00:32:07.919 --> 00:32:10.119
that you've called us to?

00:32:10.119 --> 00:32:12.679
That's how I prayed for them this morning.

00:32:12.679 --> 00:32:20.759
There are some really good churches, but this path and this perspective that we see

00:32:20.759 --> 00:32:24.879
of the church of the Laodiceans is a frequent problem.

00:32:24.879 --> 00:32:31.799
Unfortunately, many churches throughout the ages have resembled the church of the Laodiceans.

00:32:31.799 --> 00:32:36.359
Many churches have resembled this church.

00:32:36.359 --> 00:32:43.119
If they were to adequately and honestly evaluate, we find that they would fit the mold, if you

00:32:43.119 --> 00:32:46.119
will.

00:32:46.119 --> 00:32:51.519
Though it's a common problem, it's a frequent problem, the reality this evening is it doesn't

00:32:51.519 --> 00:32:52.519
have to be.

00:32:52.519 --> 00:32:55.319
It doesn't have to be.

00:32:55.319 --> 00:32:58.319
Our God still reigns, amen?

00:32:58.319 --> 00:32:59.319
He's still on his throne.

00:32:59.319 --> 00:33:02.079
The gospel still works.

00:33:02.079 --> 00:33:03.199
You believe that this evening?

00:33:03.199 --> 00:33:05.119
I believe the gospel still works.

00:33:05.879 --> 00:33:11.199
Listen, if Jesus was done with us, we'd be out of here.

00:33:11.199 --> 00:33:14.879
For the Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness.

00:33:14.879 --> 00:33:18.679
But as longsuffering to us, we're not willing that any should perish, but that all should

00:33:18.679 --> 00:33:20.279
come to repentance.

00:33:20.279 --> 00:33:25.559
God has us here in March of 2025 for a purpose, for a reason.

00:33:25.559 --> 00:33:27.239
He's not done with us.

00:33:27.239 --> 00:33:32.039
And we find this evening that though this is a frequent problem throughout church history,

00:33:32.039 --> 00:33:35.399
it does not have to be.

00:33:35.399 --> 00:33:37.159
We don't have to be apathetic and indifferent.

00:33:37.159 --> 00:33:39.679
We don't have to be increased with goods and have need of nothing.

00:33:39.679 --> 00:33:42.919
No, we can walk in obedience to Christ and his commands.

00:33:42.919 --> 00:33:48.159
We can walk in understanding that I must abide in him and I can do nothing without him.

00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:51.199
And all that we do is for the glory of God.

00:33:51.199 --> 00:33:57.499
We can be surrendered and sold out for the cause of Christ.

00:33:57.499 --> 00:33:59.439
We don't have to be influenced by this world.

00:33:59.439 --> 00:34:00.439
We don't have to.

00:34:00.639 --> 00:34:06.439
We're told not to be, and be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing

00:34:06.439 --> 00:34:10.999
of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

00:34:10.999 --> 00:34:13.599
Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.

00:34:13.599 --> 00:34:14.599
Why?

00:34:14.599 --> 00:34:15.599
They're all going to fade away.

00:34:15.599 --> 00:34:17.079
They're going to pass away.

00:34:17.079 --> 00:34:22.239
But he that doeth the will of God abideth forever, 1 John chapter 2.

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:23.239
Is it true?

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:26.279
It's what God said in his word.

00:34:26.279 --> 00:34:32.679
This evening a local church can operate and function in a manner that is God-honoring.

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:44.539
This evening a church can have the blessing of God, can have God's blessing upon it.

00:34:44.539 --> 00:34:50.159
God gives us the instructions in his word for how a church is to function or operate.

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:54.639
It's not up for you or for me to sit around in some round table conference room somewhere

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:58.479
and figure out how should we have church polity, how should we do this, how should

00:34:58.479 --> 00:34:59.479
we do that.

00:34:59.479 --> 00:35:03.519
No, it's for us to go and open up the word of God that he's provided to us and say, how

00:35:03.519 --> 00:35:06.679
does it work?

00:35:06.679 --> 00:35:08.679
What are the offices in a church?

00:35:08.679 --> 00:35:10.999
Who's qualified for the offices in a church?

00:35:10.999 --> 00:35:12.959
It's not your opinion or my opinion that matters.

00:35:12.959 --> 00:35:16.599
It's what God said, amen?

00:35:16.599 --> 00:35:23.919
And we find this evening that as we look at this church of the Laodiceans, we see that

00:35:23.919 --> 00:35:28.799
this frequent problem doesn't have to be.

00:35:28.799 --> 00:35:35.119
I remember hearing people say, Brother Mershon would say this often as he's in the work of

00:35:35.119 --> 00:35:40.799
evangelism, he's been sidelined for a period of time due to illness with his wife.

00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:45.799
He said he believes that God can send revival.

00:35:45.799 --> 00:35:48.159
I believe that this evening.

00:35:48.159 --> 00:35:52.359
And here's what he said, if I didn't believe that God could send revival, why would I do

00:35:52.359 --> 00:35:53.359
it?

00:35:53.359 --> 00:35:54.359
Why would I travel?

00:35:54.359 --> 00:35:57.479
Why would I do what I'm doing?

00:35:57.479 --> 00:35:59.959
Will thou not revive thy people again?

00:35:59.959 --> 00:36:03.799
It is time to seek the Lord.

00:36:03.799 --> 00:36:10.039
Brother Jeff said it this morning, break up your fallow ground.

00:36:10.039 --> 00:36:19.559
The last phrase of verse 16 reveals just how repulsive this local church was to the Lord.

00:36:19.559 --> 00:36:26.599
I will spew thee out of my mouth.

00:36:26.599 --> 00:36:34.139
Oh that our Lord would look upon us and be pleased with us.

00:36:34.139 --> 00:36:40.639
Oh that it would never be said, you're lukewarm.

00:36:40.639 --> 00:36:45.279
You're not hot, you're not cold, I'm going to spew you out of my mouth.

00:36:45.279 --> 00:36:50.799
Oh I don't ever want it to be said of me personally or us corporately as a church,

00:36:50.799 --> 00:36:57.319
that we'd keep the fire going, God has a purpose for us, He has a plan for us.

00:36:57.319 --> 00:37:01.439
And what we must do is His work, His way.

00:37:01.439 --> 00:37:06.719
The church of the Laodiceans was a church of the people, made a faulty path that led

00:37:06.719 --> 00:37:07.719
to a faulty perspective.

00:37:07.719 --> 00:37:12.559
It's a frequent problem that we've seen in church history, but I submit to you this evening

00:37:12.559 --> 00:37:15.519
it doesn't have to be.

00:37:15.519 --> 00:37:18.759
In 2025, we can still please God.

00:37:18.759 --> 00:37:22.999
You say, but it's hard.

00:37:22.999 --> 00:37:27.839
Everyone else, this, that, and the other.

00:37:27.839 --> 00:37:36.639
Can I remind you of a verse in Genesis 6, but Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.

00:37:36.639 --> 00:37:43.719
Noah lived in a day of terrible wickedness, did he not?

00:37:43.719 --> 00:37:46.679
But Noah was upright.

00:37:46.679 --> 00:37:50.159
Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.

00:37:50.159 --> 00:37:55.599
And for us this evening, we too can please God.

00:37:55.599 --> 00:37:59.159
We don't have to be like the Laodiceans.

00:37:59.159 --> 00:38:00.159
Let's pray together.

00:38:00.159 --> 00:38:01.579
Father, we love you.

00:38:01.579 --> 00:38:02.879
We thank you for loving us.

00:38:02.879 --> 00:38:03.879
Thank you for your word.

00:38:04.879 --> 00:38:10.559
I pray that the Holy Spirit would move and work in hearts as only you can.

00:38:10.559 --> 00:38:14.439
Help us as a church.

00:38:14.439 --> 00:38:17.099
Church is made up of individuals.

00:38:17.099 --> 00:38:21.799
Church is never going to have revival until the individuals have revival.

00:38:21.799 --> 00:38:28.479
Families aren't going to have revival until the individuals in that family have revival.

00:38:28.479 --> 00:38:32.639
Strong people make strong families, make strong churches.

00:38:33.639 --> 00:38:37.239
God, I pray that you'd help us.

00:38:37.239 --> 00:38:41.719
Help us, Lord, to take heed to the message to the church of the Laodiceans.

00:38:41.719 --> 00:38:49.000
Help us, Lord, to never go down this path and have this faulty perspective.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.440
Help us to look into the perfect law of liberty, the word of God.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:57.959
And help us to be doers of the word and not hearers only.

00:38:57.959 --> 00:39:00.959
Help us not to be deceived.

00:39:00.959 --> 00:39:05.000
I pray that in these moments of invitation that you'd have your will and way.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.799
We'll give you the glory for all that you'll do.

00:39:06.799 --> 00:39:08.239
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:39:08.239 --> 00:39:08.679
Would you stand up?
