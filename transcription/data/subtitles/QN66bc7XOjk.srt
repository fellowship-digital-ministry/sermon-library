1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,819
over to the book of Psalms, Psalm 105.

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:06,099
Psalm 105 this morning, and be looking at verses 23

3
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:07,880
down through verse number 28.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,399
And if you've looked at the back of the bulletin

5
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:12,359
already this morning, you see the title for the message

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:16,860
is this, in Egypt, God made his greatness known.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,459
The people of God, as you know, were in Egyptian bondage

8
00:00:19,459 --> 00:00:21,639
and God was going to bring them out.

9
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:24,280
We mentioned in our previous message on our subject,

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,680
our theme for Sunday mornings, great is the Lord,

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,159
that he, God, the Lord God Almighty,

12
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:32,919
he appeared to Moses in Horeb.

13
00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:36,860
And in that place, he revealed to Moses his plan.

14
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,560
We spoke about the greatness of God

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,380
as it was revealed to Moses

16
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,880
in that particular text of scripture,

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,479
as we look through Exodus 3, 4, and 5,

18
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,220
and mentioned a number of things.

19
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,939
And it's interesting as you begin to think about

20
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:54,380
all that God would do and all that God was showing Moses,

21
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,099
he would later declare in the book of Deuteronomy,

22
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,939
this great statement about God beginning to show

23
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:02,659
his greatness to his servant.

24
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:04,300
And we find that it began there in Horeb,

25
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,779
but it continues in Egypt,

26
00:01:05,779 --> 00:01:08,540
Moses obeyed the command of the Lord.

27
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,940
And Moses went and stood before Pharaoh.

28
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,339
And as he stood before Pharaoh,

29
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,500
he said what God told him to say,

30
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,900
he delivered faithfully the message of the Lord.

31
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,739
And here's what he said,

32
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:20,699
thus saith the Lord, the Lord God of Israel,

33
00:01:20,699 --> 00:01:22,540
let my people go.

34
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,860
And we know that that was met with opposition,

35
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,860
that Pharaoh refused to allow the people of God to depart.

36
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,440
And over the next several chapters in the book of Exodus,

37
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,440
you find that God makes his greatness known in Egypt.

38
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,260
As we're gonna think about the truth that our God is great,

39
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,639
and in fact, he's revealed his greatness to us in his word.

40
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:43,860
We've seen it over and over,

41
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,580
even as we've studied this year,

42
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,400
and in this particular theme of great is the Lord.

43
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,019
The reality is that as we recognize how great he is,

44
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:54,279
that we ought to finish the verse great is the Lord

45
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:57,000
and greatly to be praised.

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,120
And he is worthy of our praise,

47
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,440
he is worthy of our worship,

48
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,620
we should stand in awe of who our God is.

49
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,720
It's interesting that the manner

50
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,520
in which God revealed his power there in Egypt,

51
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,100
he made his greatness known.

52
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,720
We of course are familiar with the plagues

53
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,440
and we'll mention as we get through the message this morning

54
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,080
but it's of interest that here in Psalm 105,

55
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,279
the psalmist makes reference to the plagues.

56
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:23,600
In Psalm 78, the psalmist makes reference to the plagues.

57
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:25,440
And then also in Psalm 106,

58
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,080
there's a reference not as detailed

59
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,039
as we find in Psalm 78 or in Psalm 105,

60
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:33,080
but again, you see the reference in Psalm 106

61
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,119
to these plagues.

62
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:36,320
It's interesting because there,

63
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,800
as God would speak to Moses, he's there in Egypt,

64
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,500
he tells Moses that with great judgments

65
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,339
is recorded that way in Exodus six and verse number six,

66
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:49,479
and then in chapter seven and verse number three,

67
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:53,360
God promised that he would multiply his signs

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,160
and wonders in Egypt.

69
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,440
Notice with me here in Psalm 105,

70
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,240
beginning in verse number 23,

71
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,800
the Bible says this, Israel also came into Egypt

72
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,399
and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham

73
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:10,080
and he increased his people greatly

74
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,279
and made them stronger than their enemies.

75
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:15,419
He turned their heart to hate his people

76
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:17,679
to deal subtly with his servants.

77
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:22,000
Notice he sent Moses his servant Aaron whom he had chosen.

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,360
They showed his signs among them

79
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,960
and wonders in the land of Ham.

80
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,039
We'll read the rest of the text

81
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,899
as we get through the message this morning,

82
00:03:32,899 --> 00:03:34,720
but I wanna draw your attention to that phrase

83
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,399
in verse number 27 where the Bible says

84
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:39,960
they showed his signs among them

85
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,960
and wonders in the land of Egypt.

86
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,000
That word that we find there in verse number 27,

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,199
wonders, it really means a miracle.

88
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,080
It really carries with it this idea,

89
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,320
it's a special display of God's power,

90
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,839
a special display of God's power.

91
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:59,639
If you're familiar with the text of scripture

92
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:03,259
in the book of Exodus with regard to the 10 plagues,

93
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:08,059
you will understand that God indeed multiplied

94
00:04:08,059 --> 00:04:12,039
his signs and wonders, he made himself known

95
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:16,200
and there was a special display of God's great power.

96
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,980
I'm so thankful this morning that we serve

97
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,299
the Lord God omnipotent, that he has all power.

98
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:24,500
We speak about his omnipotence and we rejoice

99
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,000
in understanding that even as he stood before Abram

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,779
and said, is anything too hard for the Lord?

101
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:33,160
And we know that the answer to that question is no

102
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,619
and we find that as we study through

103
00:04:35,619 --> 00:04:38,940
the precious word of God, that God has revealed

104
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,940
over and over and over to us again his great power.

105
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,820
This morning, we serve the Lord God omnipotent.

106
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,299
We find that here as we look at this portion of scripture,

107
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:52,119
I want you to notice with me if you're taking notes,

108
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:55,420
number one, 10 devastating plagues.

109
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,019
We will not take the time to read all of the details

110
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:01,540
with regard to the plagues as they're revealed to us

111
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,260
in the book of Exodus, we will not take the time

112
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,500
to go through all of that dialogue and what have you,

113
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,100
but I do want you to understand that in chapters seven

114
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,059
through 11 of the book of Exodus,

115
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:14,500
you will find that these plagues are recorded

116
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,100
and you begin to read about all that's taking place

117
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,500
and as we look here and we think about

118
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,459
these 10 devastating plagues, we find that the Bible says

119
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:26,299
here in Psalm 105, beginning in verse number 28,

120
00:05:26,299 --> 00:05:28,779
he sent darkness and made it dark.

121
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:30,899
Now understand that these are not in the same order

122
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:34,380
that the plagues came as you read Exodus seven through 11,

123
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,100
but it says here, he sent darkness and made it dark

124
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,220
and they rebelled not against his word.

125
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,339
He turned their waters into blood and slew their fish,

126
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:45,179
their land brought forth frogs in abundance

127
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,779
and the chambers of their kings.

128
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:50,179
He spake and there came diverse sorts of flies

129
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:51,980
and lice and all their coast.

130
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,140
He gave them hail for rain and flaming fire in their land.

131
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,260
He smote their vines also in their fig trees

132
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,700
and break the trees of their coast.

133
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,500
He spake and the locust came and the caterpillars

134
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,940
and that without number and did eat up all the herbs

135
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,940
in their land and devoured the fruit of their ground.

136
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,739
He smote also all the firstborn in their land,

137
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:17,579
the chief of all their strength.

138
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:20,380
He brought them forth also with silver and gold

139
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,019
and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.

140
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:25,140
Notice in verse 38, it says Egypt was glad

141
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,059
when they departed for the fear of them fell upon them.

142
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:31,579
It's interesting as you consider the 10 devastating plagues

143
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:35,679
and you understand the devastation that was endured there

144
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:39,339
by Pharaoh, by Egypt and all of the Egyptians.

145
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:43,140
It's really summarized for us by the servants of Pharaoh

146
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,640
in Exodus 10 in verse number seven.

147
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,880
Perhaps you wanna turn there and look at what the servants

148
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,899
of Pharaoh say in this passage of scripture.

149
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:53,519
In Exodus chapter number 10 in verse number seven,

150
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,420
we find that this is only after seven of the plagues.

151
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,119
There's still three more plagues to come.

152
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:00,239
There are 10 devastating plagues.

153
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:02,260
And after the seventh plague,

154
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,179
we find that the servants of Pharaoh

155
00:07:05,179 --> 00:07:08,440
begin to speak to Pharaoh in chapter 10 in verse number seven.

156
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,079
Notice what the Bible says.

157
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,440
And Pharaoh's servants said unto him,

158
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,799
how long shall this man be a snare unto us?

159
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:21,220
Let the men go that they may serve the Lord their God.

160
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:26,220
Knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?

161
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,260
These plagues were devastating.

162
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,359
The impact that it would have upon the lives

163
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:36,839
of the Egyptians, we would understand

164
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:40,079
that really every aspect of their life would be impacted.

165
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,959
And you would think about the ways

166
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:45,640
in which their livestock were destroyed.

167
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,040
And it would certainly impact transportation

168
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,359
and agriculture.

169
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:52,679
It would impact all sorts of things.

170
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:54,040
Every area of their lives,

171
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,959
they were impacted by these plagues.

172
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:00,059
It's interesting as you begin to study

173
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:02,119
through the 10 plagues, you will find

174
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:06,679
that the first three affected both the Egyptians

175
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,079
and the children of Israel.

176
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,640
You'll find that in those first three plagues,

177
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,359
it was affected all that were in the land.

178
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,279
And so the children of Israel were not exempt

179
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,820
in those first three plagues.

180
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,540
But as you continue to read through the account

181
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,059
in the book of Exodus with regard

182
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:23,559
to these 10 devastating plagues,

183
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:26,679
you will find that plagues number four through nine

184
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:30,160
only impacted the Egyptians.

185
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,559
God made his power known

186
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,960
that he could bring these plagues upon all.

187
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,039
But then think about the display of God's power

188
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,679
in the fourth through ninth plague

189
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,000
when the Egyptians were affected,

190
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,500
but the children of Israel were not affected.

191
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,280
God's great power.

192
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,760
I would submit to you that not only was God's power displayed

193
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,039
in the devastating plagues and bringing of the plagues,

194
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,280
but I would say also in the departure of the plagues,

195
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,760
you would read through the accounts

196
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,799
in Exodus seven through 11.

197
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:04,340
I would just deal with the first one with frogs

198
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,700
and begin to think about frogs.

199
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,619
And maybe you like frogs,

200
00:09:07,619 --> 00:09:09,280
but you don't want frogs everywhere.

201
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,820
Bed, chamber, oven, all over the place.

202
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,099
I mean, think about all these frogs.

203
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:15,619
And then the magicians, they were like,

204
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:17,280
well, we can make frogs too.

205
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,099
I've never understood that.

206
00:09:20,099 --> 00:09:22,739
You got so many frogs, frogs coming all over the place,

207
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:25,280
and these magicians are gonna create more frogs.

208
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,280
It just doesn't make any kind of sense to me.

209
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,859
But we find that in each of these accounts,

210
00:09:30,859 --> 00:09:33,140
as you look through the book of Exodus

211
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,679
and just using that one particular example,

212
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,739
that God would send Moses to appear

213
00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:39,419
before Pharaoh once again.

214
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:42,900
And after Pharaoh and Moses would have a conversation,

215
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,700
many times the conversation would go something like this.

216
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,659
Pharaoh would say, listen,

217
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:49,679
if you would just allow this plague to depart,

218
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,780
then we'll let you go.

219
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,859
And so Moses would say, depending on the particular plague,

220
00:09:56,859 --> 00:09:57,900
here's what's going to happen.

221
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,820
I'm gonna depart, raise up my hands,

222
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,659
and it will go.

223
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:09,299
will be gone. Man, God's power. God's power. Not only to bring the plague, but then for

224
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:14,139
the departure of the plague. And we're going to see how God is revealing His power. We

225
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:19,439
see in the first three that all are affected and in four through nine just the Egyptians.

226
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:24,019
Of course we know that the death of the firstborn, that tenth plague, that the Bible would tell

227
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:30,039
us that those only would be exempt if they applied the blood. We spake this morning,

228
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:35,999
we sang the song about the power in the blood. And I'm so thankful for the blood of Jesus

229
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:41,079
Christ and I'm so thankful that we can sing this morning about the blood. And I'm so thankful

230
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:44,659
that as we look at the Old Testament and even as we find that the Bible would tell us in

231
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:48,599
Hebrews chapter number 10 that the Old Testament and the law and all of those offerings and

232
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:54,359
sacrifices that they were a shadow of good things to come. And I think about this Passover

233
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:59,359
as it would be known, as you would think about the tenth plague and you would think about

234
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:04,679
the application of the blood and the Bible would teach us and show us how that Paul would

235
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:11,679
conclude to the believers in Corinth, Christ our Passover. And I'm so thankful for the

236
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:17,219
blood. Listen, the only way, there was only one way for the firstborn of any home, any

237
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:23,199
household not to be destroyed, not to be killed, and that only way was by applying the blood.

238
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:28,839
There was but one way that God prescribed and we find that that had to be followed exactly

239
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:34,999
how God said in order to spare life. And we would find this morning that even as we

240
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:40,119
look at that wonderful truth of that tenth plague that Jesus teaches us as we look at

241
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:44,879
the truth of the gospel that there's just one way to be saved. There are not many ways

242
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:49,599
to be saved. There are some that have this idea that you just are sincere in whatever

243
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:55,279
you believe and you'll just make it at the end. And I would submit to you that that's

244
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:03,239
just not biblically accurate. No doubt there are people that are sincere in what they believe

245
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:11,199
but I would say to you that they are sincerely wrong. You can be wrong and be sincere. We

246
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:20,079
find that Jesus said, I am the way. He didn't say a way. He said I am the way, the truth

247
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:32,119
and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me. And I'm so thankful that God Almighty

248
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:39,119
took our place so that we could be redeemed. See, there's only one way to be saved and

249
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:44,679
we see in these ten devastating plagues that even as God was displaying His power in all

250
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:50,119
that's taking place and all that is recorded for us in the book of Exodus with regard to

251
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:55,919
these plagues and God there in Egypt making His greatness known, we find that even in

252
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:01,559
that tenth plague, again as you follow the crimson cord through the scriptures, you'll

253
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:09,359
find again that truth of the blood. And every time they would observe the Passover, they

254
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:15,599
would be reminded of what God did in Egypt. But they would also be reminded of what God

255
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:21,679
promised to do one day at a place called Calvary. And I'm so thankful that this morning that

256
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,159
as we sit here, as we have the opportunity as New Testament believers that we can look

257
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:32,559
back to that day at Calvary when Jesus went to that cruel cross and He shed His precious

258
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:39,599
blood, that one work where He offered Himself one time for sin forever, what a blessed truth.

259
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:45,759
This morning as we look at God demonstrating His greatness and making His greatness known

260
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:50,239
in Egypt, we see ten devastating plagues. Number two, if you're taking notes, I want

261
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:56,159
you to note God's divine power. We've already made mention with regard to the power of God

262
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,519
being displayed with regard to these plagues that He brought upon the Egyptians, but we

263
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,599
find that it's very interesting as I begin to study through the book of Exodus and these

264
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:11,359
particular testimonies and the accounts, it's interesting to me that we find that God is

265
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:17,199
revealing His power first to His own people, to His own people. You understand that the

266
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:22,559
children of Israel, they had to know how powerful God was. They had to understand the power

267
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:28,479
of God. They were in Egyptian bondage. They were in a place where their life was bitter

268
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,119
and hard and difficult and all that they were facing and God said, I'm going to bring you

269
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:38,959
out and I'm going to bring you to a place and we find that even as we would trace the

270
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,039
steps of the children of Israel, as we would go forward through the scriptures and we would

271
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:49,079
understand that God already knew all of those things that would take place. See, we know

272
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:56,079
as we read the Bible, we know that the Egyptians would be devastated through those plagues

273
00:14:56,479 --> 00:15:00,799
and that the children of Israel would depart from the land of Egypt, but we find they'd

274
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:07,399
end up in a place called the Red Sea. Now God knew that, for the Bible tells us as you

275
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:13,199
study through the portion of scripture that it was God that led them to that very place.

276
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,799
It was not that Moses had bad directional leadership and he just went the wrong way

277
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:23,039
and came to a place of difficulty. No, it was God Almighty that led them directly to

278
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:29,719
that place and God through these plagues, He was revealing His power to His people

279
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:35,919
so that they would know what God is able to do. I would say to you on a number of occasions,

280
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:42,259
they just didn't get the lesson. On a number of occasions they'd face a great difficulty.

281
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:48,799
They'd not remember what God did. They would not recall what God did there in Egypt and

282
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:55,479
all that He displayed to them, but we find that God was desiring that His people, the

283
00:15:55,479 --> 00:16:01,439
children of Israel, would know His power. In fact, the Bible says it this way in Psalm

284
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:08,439
106 and verses 21 and 22, it says, they forgot God their Savior, which had done great things

285
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:15,279
in Egypt. And He showed His greatness. He made His greatness known in Egypt. You think

286
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:22,319
about those spies that went out. They went to spy out the land of Canaan and they say

287
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:29,319
ten of them were just not able. I mean the people have defense cities. I mean they have

288
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:38,599
walled cities. The people, they're giants in the land. There are two that stood and

289
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:45,599
say God is able. God is able. And we find this morning that as we look at God's divine

290
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:54,439
power here as He's making His greatness known in Egypt, He's preparing His children for

291
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:59,719
that which would come for those events that they would face in their lives and He's revealed

292
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:06,359
His power to them. We find that God also reveals His power to the Egyptians. No doubt they

293
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:12,119
recognized the greatness of God's power. We find that the Egyptian society would be

294
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:17,439
a people group, a society that was polytheistic. You would find that there were people that

295
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:24,359
worshipped a plurality of gods. They did not serve the Lord God, Jehovah. They had this

296
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:29,159
polytheistic world view. In fact, if you were to study, we won't take the time this morning,

297
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:33,279
it's an interesting study, however, for those of you that may want to do it. You can look

298
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:39,439
at each of the plagues and you can find how each of those plagues were a direct attack

299
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:46,439
against one of the false deities that were served by the Egyptians. You can see that

300
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:53,359
and you can study that and you can see how God is revealing His power to the Egyptians.

301
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:58,959
See in the beginning you begin to note what's taking place as Moses and Aaron would stand

302
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:04,959
before Pharaoh as they would have these plagues. Even before the plagues began with the rod

303
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:11,479
that turned to a serpent, well the servants of Pharaoh were like, we could do that too.

304
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:18,159
But soon they recognized that this power of Jehovah was a power they were not familiar

305
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:26,719
with. That this God of the children of Israel was different than the false gods that they

306
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:32,379
served. In fact, if you were to look there in Exodus 8 and verse number 19, it's interesting,

307
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:37,279
this year again only after in this particular account just a couple of plagues that have

308
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:42,759
taken place, they're in the midst of the third plague here and the third one being

309
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:48,079
lice and we find that that takes place in chapter number 8 and verse number 16. And

310
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,799
we find that the Bible tells us, notice in verse number 17, it says, and they did so

311
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,239
for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and smote the dust of the earth and it

312
00:18:57,239 --> 00:19:03,239
became lice in man and in beast. All the dust of the land became lice throughout all the

313
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:08,079
land of Egypt. That's terrible. I can't even imagine. You ever get out in the yard

314
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,079
and work and you got those little gnats that fly around? Make you feel like you're going

315
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:19,679
to lose your mind, right? Make you go absolutely insane. Lice, all the dust, I mean can you

316
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,639
imagine? But notice this, it says in verse number 18, and the magicians did so with

317
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:31,559
their enchantments. Again, I don't understand it, to bring forth lice. But notice these

318
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:41,639
words, but they could not. But they could not. So, there were lice upon man and upon

319
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:50,759
beast. Notice in verse number 19, then, then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, this is

320
00:19:50,759 --> 00:20:00,199
the finger of God. These magicians that serve these false gods.

321
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:05,359
See, the Egyptians, they had to know the power of God.

322
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:07,499
They had to understand God was revealing.

323
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:12,439
As we look at the truth of the Word of God and we begin to see throughout the pages of

324
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:22,759
Scripture that God desires to make Himself known to people, His prized creation.

325
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:23,759
He loves us.

326
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:26,279
He died for us.

327
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,319
He seeks to make Himself known.

328
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:34,639
And we find that here as we consider these 10 devastating plagues, but then we know God's

329
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:39,999
divine power not only revealed to the children of Israel, to His people at that time, but

330
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:43,759
we find to the Egyptians as well, and I would submit to you this morning that His divine

331
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:49,999
power through this account that is given to us and recorded and preserved in God's Word

332
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:57,079
for us this morning, that believers throughout the ages have been helped by understanding

333
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:02,139
God's great power as it was made known in Egypt.

334
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:07,439
You read through these portions of Scripture and you see plague after plague and you see

335
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:15,659
situation and event that unfold and you say, man, look at the power of God Almighty.

336
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:21,879
We see that throughout the ages, God's people have been helped, have been blessed, have

337
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:28,759
been encouraged, have understood in a greater way just how wonderful and great the power

338
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:31,559
of God Almighty is.

339
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:38,959
I'm thankful this morning that God is able to not only declare to us truth, but on so

340
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:42,479
many times He demonstrates those truths to us.

341
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:45,919
See, it's one thing for God to have said, here's what I am.

342
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,479
I am all powerful.

343
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:48,799
I am merciful.

344
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:49,799
I am gracious.

345
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:55,239
I am, just keep on, I am love.

346
00:21:55,239 --> 00:22:00,259
That would certainly help us to understand who He is.

347
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:04,999
But He said, I am all powerful, and then He demonstrates His power.

348
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:08,479
He says, I am merciful, and then He demonstrates His mercy.

349
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:14,439
He says, I am compassionate, and then we see where the Bible teaches us where God is moved

350
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:15,879
with compassion.

351
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:19,919
We find that He says, I am love, and God is love, but He said, for God's soul of the

352
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,739
world that He gave His only begotten Son, He demonstrated His love for us.

353
00:22:25,739 --> 00:22:30,439
And I'm so thankful that as you study the pages of this precious book that you find

354
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:34,879
that God declares to us who He is, but He also demonstrates.

355
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:40,799
And listen, it helps us when we have the record of what God is able to do and we see God's

356
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:46,159
power at work, and it helps me and it helps you as we face life.

357
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,799
God is all powerful.

358
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:52,559
It's not just that He stated it, though that would be sufficient, but then He reveals it

359
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:57,079
to us and He demonstrates it in such a great way.

360
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:01,079
We see here ten devastating plagues.

361
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:04,719
We see the divine power of God on display.

362
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:09,279
And I would say this if you're taking notes, number three, notice God's divine purpose.

363
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,759
I'm so thankful that God always has purpose.

364
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:16,959
I'm thankful that as you study through the portion of Scripture here in the book of Exodus

365
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:22,719
with regard to the plagues and as you note what's taking place, that you understand that

366
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:26,319
God is moving with purpose.

367
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:31,319
In your life and in my life today, God has purpose.

368
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:36,319
You face a circumstance, you face a difficulty, you have a season of blessing, a season of

369
00:23:36,439 --> 00:23:41,599
trial, and you find in all of that God has purpose.

370
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,759
And I'm so thankful that God has purpose.

371
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:52,759
And we find that as we look at the text of Scripture, I would say that ultimately, through

372
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:58,679
every circumstance that we face in life, that ultimately God's purpose is that He would

373
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:01,119
be glorified.

374
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:05,979
That is the ultimate purpose, that God would be glorified.

375
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:11,059
As we live our lives, as we live day by day, our desire ought to be that we live in such

376
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:14,219
a manner that God is glorified.

377
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,899
That God is exalted and magnified in my life.

378
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:20,819
Listen, it's not about you, it's not about me, it's all about Jesus.

379
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:25,419
The Bible teaches us, even as we read in John chapter number three, that wonderful statement

380
00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:31,259
from John the Baptist when he said, listen, I must decrease, but He, He, the Lord Jesus

381
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:34,539
Christ, He must increase.

382
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:37,379
In my life and in your life, it's all about Him.

383
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:43,899
And that ultimately is the main purpose, the high-level purpose is that God would be glorified.

384
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,659
How does He accomplish that purpose?

385
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:50,539
Well, as we look here at the book of Exodus and we begin to look at some things with regard

386
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:54,779
to the purpose of God being revealed to us, I want you to note what is said in chapter

387
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:59,339
number five of the book of Exodus, and then we'll go forward from there looking at a number

388
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:01,819
of portions of Scripture.

389
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:06,579
Notice in chapter number five of the book of Exodus, this is when we first read of the

390
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:10,019
obedience of Moses as he comes before Pharaoh.

391
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:15,459
The Bible says in verse number one, and afterward Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh,

392
00:25:15,459 --> 00:25:20,179
thus saith the Lord God of Israel, let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto

393
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:21,179
me in the wilderness.

394
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:27,459
Notice in verse number two, and Pharaoh said, who is the Lord that I should obey His voice

395
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,379
to let Israel go?

396
00:25:29,379 --> 00:25:35,059
I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go.

397
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:39,299
See Pharaoh didn't know who God was.

398
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:40,299
Pharaoh didn't know God.

399
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:50,699
I think about Nebuchadnezzar in the book of Daniel, he says bow to this image, the three

400
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:55,619
Hebrew children that refused to bow, and he says, who is that God that will deliver you

401
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:56,619
out of my hand?

402
00:25:56,859 --> 00:26:00,179
He was soon going to find out who that God was.

403
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:01,179
He is the Lord God Almighty.

404
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:07,739
And he sat there, the Bible says a stone-eyed, looking in and he says, did not, hey, hey,

405
00:26:07,739 --> 00:26:13,419
hey, hey guys, didn't we throw three in there, bound?

406
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:19,979
But there's four walking around and the fourth is like unto the Son of God, the Son of Man.

407
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:23,579
Wow, God's power.

408
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:26,899
Pharaoh says, who is the Lord?

409
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:30,059
Who is the Lord that I should obey His voice to let Israel go?

410
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:34,019
I would submit to you that over the next several chapters in the book of Exodus as we think

411
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:35,979
about these ten plagues, you know what God does?

412
00:26:35,979 --> 00:26:38,739
He makes Himself known to Pharaoh.

413
00:26:38,739 --> 00:26:41,459
He shows Pharaoh who He is.

414
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:45,419
See if we don't know who God is, we can't glorify Him.

415
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:47,419
The ultimate purpose is to glorify God.

416
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:52,779
Listen, before you trusted Christ as your Savior, you probably weren't glorifying God.

417
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:56,699
But after we trust Christ as our Savior, begin to live a life that we can bring glory and

418
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:57,699
honor to Him.

419
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,699
Why?

420
00:26:58,699 --> 00:27:02,619
Because I understand now that the purpose of my life is to bring glory to my God.

421
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:07,419
And whatsoever you do, right, whether you eat, no matter what you do, do all to the

422
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:10,419
glory of God.

423
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:19,539
We find here that as we look at this text of Scripture and we find that Moses says to Pharaoh

424
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:23,099
that God said, let my people go, and Pharaoh says, who is He?

425
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,379
I don't know who He is.

426
00:27:24,379 --> 00:27:28,979
Notice in verse number four of chapter number seven, keep moving along, the Bible says this,

427
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:34,619
but Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you that I may lay my hand upon Egypt and bring forth

428
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:38,419
mine armies and my people, the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great

429
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:39,419
judgments.

430
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:47,539
Notice verse number five, and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord.

431
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:52,379
And I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt and bring out the children of Israel from

432
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,899
among them.

433
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:58,279
Remember, I referenced already in chapter eight and verse number 19 after the third

434
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:00,539
plague with the lice, what happens?

435
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:06,859
The magicians, they say this is the finger of God.

436
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:14,659
As we find that God was making Himself known, He was revealing Himself, we find that in

437
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:19,859
chapter number nine, notice a couple of verses here, as we continue to see how God is working

438
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:24,539
and what God is doing, you'll reference this or you'll note this reference throughout the

439
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:29,859
pages of this portion of God's Word where the Bible speaks about that you may know something.

440
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:33,179
Notice with me in verse number 14.

441
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:37,419
The Bible says, for I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart and upon thy

442
00:28:37,419 --> 00:28:39,699
servants and upon thy people.

443
00:28:39,699 --> 00:28:44,419
Notice that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.

444
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:46,419
Isn't that wonderful?

445
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:48,899
You know, there's no one like Jesus.

446
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:49,899
No one.

447
00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:53,219
No one's going to satisfy you like Jesus will satisfy you.

448
00:28:53,219 --> 00:28:56,299
Jesus, I think they played the offertory this morning.

449
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:57,619
Jesus is the sweetest name I know.

450
00:28:57,619 --> 00:28:59,019
Is that what you guys played?

451
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:01,859
Jesus is the sweetest name I know.

452
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:03,699
It really is.

453
00:29:03,699 --> 00:29:08,139
I mean, after you understand, I mean, when you hear the name Jesus, man, immediately

454
00:29:08,139 --> 00:29:11,539
what comes to your mind, what comes to your heart, man, He's my Savior.

455
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:12,699
He's my all in all.

456
00:29:12,699 --> 00:29:15,539
He's my everything.

457
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:20,019
It grieves my heart when I hear somebody use the name of my Savior in vain.

458
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:21,019
Why?

459
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:26,939
Because Jesus is my Savior and it means so much to me.

460
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:35,659
We find that God says that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.

461
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:40,539
Oh, the Egyptians had a plurality of false gods.

462
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:45,099
But God was going to display His power in such a way that they would know that there's

463
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:46,659
no one like Him.

464
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:47,659
There's no one like Him.

465
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:51,699
Listen, the more you get to know the Lord, you find there's no one like Him.

466
00:29:51,699 --> 00:29:52,699
No one like Him.

467
00:29:52,699 --> 00:29:59,259
Listen, there's no other world religion, there's no other cult group that offers anything that

468
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:00,259
we find that this.

469
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:06,859
book gives us. And I'm so thankful to know God. It's a wonderful privilege. You know

470
00:30:06,859 --> 00:30:13,059
people today around our globe, they don't know who God is. They would be in that same

471
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:22,459
situation of Pharaoh there in Exodus chapter 5, of Nebuchadnezzar over in the book of Daniel.

472
00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:31,059
Who is that God? They don't know him. You remember as Paul was there, he was supposed

473
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:36,039
to go to Athens to get a little R&R if you will, but he saw a city that was wholly given

474
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:41,819
to idolatry. He walked through and he saw all of these altars and he came to a place

475
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:48,499
and he found this altar that was marked to the unknown God. Paul stood before those men

476
00:30:48,499 --> 00:30:56,299
and he said, him declare I unto you. He was making God known. I'm so thankful that God

477
00:30:56,299 --> 00:31:01,319
is making himself known. Look, skip down to verse number 29 there in Exodus chapter 9.

478
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:06,299
Notice what the Bible says. And Moses said unto him, as soon as I am gone out of the

479
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:11,799
city I will spread abroad my hands unto the Lord and the thunder shall cease. Neither

480
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:20,599
shall there be any more hail. Why? That thou mayest know how that the earth is the Lord's.

481
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:26,399
He is the creator and the possessor of. All things are his. And we find that again as

482
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:31,439
I mentioned just a few moments ago how that the coming of the plagues but also the departure

483
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:34,239
of the plagues. And Moses said, listen, I'm going to go and I'm going to spread abroad

484
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:37,639
my hands unto the Lord. The thunder is going to cease and there's not going to be any more

485
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:46,119
hail. That's faith by the way. Amen? We find that he said that you would know how that

486
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:54,439
the earth is the Lord's. God gave a promise when he gave the Noahic covenant with regard

487
00:31:54,439 --> 00:32:00,119
to seasons. We find that in our society today that we find all of this talk about global

488
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:05,079
warming and all sorts of things that are going on but we find that the Noahic covenant that

489
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:10,399
God gave a promise with regard to seasons and that they would not fail. Listen, the

490
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:17,919
earth is God's. He created it. And by the way, it is going to be burned up one day.

491
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,319
You read in 2 Peter chapter number 3 and you read about what's going to happen. But that's

492
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:29,999
in God's time. That's according to God's plan. Notice with me in Exodus chapter number 10

493
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:34,199
beginning in verse number 1 the Bible says the Lord said unto Moses, go in unto Pharaoh

494
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:37,839
for I have heart in his heart and the heart of his servants that I might show these my

495
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:44,639
signs before him and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son and of thy son's son

496
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:49,639
what things I have wrought in Egypt and my signs which I have done among them that ye

497
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:58,679
may know how that I am the Lord. Listen, God was interested in the perpetuity of this truth.

498
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:04,079
He was interested and he says to Moses, listen, I'm doing these things. I'm showing you

499
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:09,999
my power. I'm demonstrating to you my power and my greatness not only so that you would

500
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:16,239
know but so that you can declare these truths to your sons and to their sons. What a wonderful

501
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:22,319
blessing to see the perpetuity of truth, to understand that it's our responsibility to

502
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:27,639
influence and impact and teach those that are coming before or behind us that we would

503
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:33,639
teach them to set their hope in God that they would know the wonderful works of God, that

504
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:38,159
they would have faith in what God is able to do, that they would know the power of God

505
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:45,239
Almighty. In chapter number 13, this is dealing specifically with the children of Israel with

506
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:52,639
regard to the Passover. The dedication of the firstborn is recorded here, all the information

507
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:58,279
given with regard to the process and the applying of blood and so on and so forth. And notice

508
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:03,039
with me, we'll pick it up right in the middle in verse number 11 of Exodus 13. The Bible

509
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,839
says, and it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites

510
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:11,559
as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers and shall give it thee that thou shalt set

511
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:17,119
apart unto the Lord all that openeth the matrix and every firstling that cometh of a beast

512
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:22,679
which thou hast and the males shall be the Lord's. Notice verse 13, and every firstling

513
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:27,319
of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb that if thou wilt not redeem it then thou shalt

514
00:34:27,319 --> 00:34:31,279
break his neck and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem. And

515
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:39,199
it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying, what is this? What is this?

516
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:46,399
That thou shalt say unto him, by strength of hand the Lord brought us out from Egypt

517
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:53,039
from the house of bondage. What a great opportunity that they would have. See, in just a little

518
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:57,479
while we'll celebrate Memorial Day and we speak about the importance of memorials and

519
00:34:57,479 --> 00:35:02,839
we find that the Passover, such as other events in Israel's history, really had the

520
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:09,839
idea of setting up a memorial, a time to remember what God did. Of course, with the Passover

521
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,319
it was twofold, not only of remembering what God did but looking forward to what God would

522
00:35:14,319 --> 00:35:20,439
do in the Messiah coming and becoming our Passover. We find that as we look through

523
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:25,559
these portions of Scripture and look at what God is saying as to how he is making himself

524
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:32,559
known and the reason that ye may know these truths, I would summarize it this way. We

525
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:37,839
think about God's purpose is that he would be glorified. In order for him to be glorified

526
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:44,399
I would say this, that he wants us to know his great power personally. He wants us to

527
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:48,999
know his great power personally. I believe this morning that he wants each and every

528
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:53,799
one of us of his children to know how powerful he is. So you're going to face things in your

529
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:58,239
life. I'm going to face things in my life. We'll face things corporately and collectively

530
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:05,679
as a church. God wants us to know how powerful he is. He wants us to know that he has all

531
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:13,159
power. See, Jesus, before he would ascend and go to heaven after his resurrection, we

532
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:18,119
find that he said this and it's recorded this way in Matthew's Gospel, all power is given

533
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:27,259
unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore and we see that the go ye therefore is preceded

534
00:36:27,259 --> 00:36:33,359
by the all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. He concludes that portion of

535
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:39,599
Scripture by saying and I will be with you. I will be with you. Isn't that precious truth?

536
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:46,139
See God wants us to know that he is the all powerful God. Power is an interesting thing.

537
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:50,619
People in our society, people around the world, people for centuries, generations as

538
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:55,819
you study history, you will find that people are longing for more power and more power

539
00:36:55,819 --> 00:37:01,059
and there are world powers that are set up and you look through the pages of history

540
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:07,879
and you begin to see all of those that were seeking power. There are some times that people

541
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:14,259
like Nebuchadnezzar, like Pharaoh, like others that you could read of in history that had

542
00:37:14,259 --> 00:37:22,899
the perspective that they had great power. Think of Pilate. He said to Jesus, don't you

543
00:37:22,899 --> 00:37:31,939
know that I have power to release you or to go to the cross? What did Jesus say? He said,

544
00:37:31,939 --> 00:37:36,819
I want you to understand something Pilate. The only power you have, I'm paraphrasing,

545
00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:46,339
the only power that you have is the power that I let you have. This morning we can look

546
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:52,619
at some people and some groups of people and some organizations. We could think about their

547
00:37:52,619 --> 00:38:01,699
power. But I want you to understand that it pales in comparison to the power of God Almighty.

548
00:38:01,699 --> 00:38:08,379
Our God is the God of the impossible. Our God is the God who has all power. You begin

549
00:38:08,379 --> 00:38:15,659
to look at the Assyrians when they're attacking the children of Israel, Judah, Hezekiah is

550
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:22,739
trusting the Lord. Sennacherib and Rabshakeh. Don't you know all the other peoples that

551
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:28,739
we've conquered? Don't you know who we are? Honestly, accurately, the Assyrians were the

552
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:36,979
world power at that time. But God sent one angel in one night and killed 185,000. We

553
00:38:36,979 --> 00:38:44,699
have the God of all power. And He wants us to know it personally. He wants us to know

554
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:50,339
it personally. I would say this, that when we know His great power personally, then we

555
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:57,179
would praise Him accordingly. See, He is worthy of our praise. This morning when we think

556
00:38:57,179 --> 00:39:01,379
about the greatness of God, when we think about and understand the great power that

557
00:39:01,379 --> 00:39:11,179
our God has, then we should praise Him accordingly. Stand in awe of who He is. He's a great God

558
00:39:11,179 --> 00:39:12,699
with great power.

559
00:39:12,699 --> 00:39:18,459
Abram, is anything too hard for the Lord? Well God, you just told me that you are the

560
00:39:18,459 --> 00:39:26,819
Lord God Almighty. El Shaddai. Obviously there's nothing that's too hard for God. What was

561
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:31,579
it that Abraham thought? Well, he thought that he and Sarah could not have a child.

562
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:39,059
But God promised. God promised, not that He'd give a child between Abraham and Hagar, but

563
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:45,539
that He would give a child between Abraham and Sarah. And what did God do? Exactly what

564
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:50,899
He promised to do. We find that Isaac was born. What a blessing. I mean we could look

565
00:39:50,899 --> 00:39:55,699
over and over and over through the pages of Scripture. You could look in your life and

566
00:39:55,699 --> 00:40:00,139
you can look at those that have gone before us and you can see God's power in their lives.

567
00:40:00,139 --> 00:40:03,679
and we ought to praise Him accordingly.

568
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:06,099
I would say this finally this morning,

569
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:08,259
when God makes Himself known for the purpose

570
00:40:08,259 --> 00:40:09,719
that He'd be glorified,

571
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:13,299
when we understand His great power personally,

572
00:40:13,299 --> 00:40:15,339
we praise Him accordingly,

573
00:40:15,339 --> 00:40:17,499
He desires that we would trust Him fully.

574
00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:20,599
He desires that we trust Him fully.

575
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:25,599
I mean just complete trust in God Almighty.

576
00:40:26,499 --> 00:40:28,819
I've referenced this morning already

577
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:30,419
with the situation with Nebuchadnezzar

578
00:40:30,419 --> 00:40:32,139
and the three Hebrew children,

579
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:34,299
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

580
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:35,959
You think about those three Hebrew children,

581
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:37,399
they trusted God fully.

582
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:40,339
I mean they were all in, man.

583
00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:42,939
They just believed that God was able.

584
00:40:42,939 --> 00:40:46,279
And they said, and if not, we're still not gonna bow.

585
00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:52,259
But they had every belief that God was able.

586
00:40:53,259 --> 00:40:58,259
And because they understood God's great power personally,

587
00:40:59,139 --> 00:41:01,239
they trusted Him fully.

588
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:03,839
See, in your life and in my life,

589
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,639
listen, we don't have to scheme.

590
00:41:06,499 --> 00:41:08,939
We don't have to devise.

591
00:41:08,939 --> 00:41:13,139
We don't have to, you know, there's a world that schemes.

592
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:15,419
Try to bring to pass certain things

593
00:41:15,419 --> 00:41:16,459
that they wanna bring to pass.

594
00:41:16,459 --> 00:41:18,859
They scheme and manipulate and all those types.

595
00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:20,659
We don't have to do that.

596
00:41:20,659 --> 00:41:22,059
We just trust God fully.

597
00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:24,939
God, you're God.

598
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:29,819
You've shown me all of these wonderful truths

599
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:30,839
with regard to your power.

600
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:34,999
You have demonstrated it, and I'm gonna trust you fully.

601
00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:36,359
I think about Moses.

602
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:41,739
See, in Horeb, God made His greatness known

603
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:43,379
to Moses personally.

604
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:47,939
We mentioned that in a previous message just a few weeks ago.

605
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:52,019
We had two messages with regard to he took my place

606
00:41:52,779 --> 00:41:55,539
in the empty tomb between that message and this message.

607
00:41:56,459 --> 00:42:00,099
We find here in Egypt that God made His greatness known.

608
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:04,059
Begin to think about Moses.

609
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:08,659
See, the whole congregation in the nation of Israel

610
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,079
didn't get it.

611
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,179
They forgot his works, right?

612
00:42:11,179 --> 00:42:13,019
They didn't get it.

613
00:42:13,899 --> 00:42:16,299
But Moses was a man that trusted God.

614
00:42:16,299 --> 00:42:17,259
He wasn't perfect.

615
00:42:17,259 --> 00:42:18,419
There's some times in his life

616
00:42:18,419 --> 00:42:20,099
you can look at what's taking place,

617
00:42:20,299 --> 00:42:23,239
but you begin to think about the trust.

618
00:42:24,779 --> 00:42:27,179
Moses says, I can't lead these people,

619
00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:29,859
but you begin to trust God

620
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:34,059
because God had shown, had demonstrated His greatness.

621
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:36,339
In your life and in my life,

622
00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:38,139
I don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow

623
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:41,339
or next week or next month, but God does.

624
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:47,459
And today, God is wanting us to understand His great power

625
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:50,179
so that we would trust Him fully

626
00:42:50,179 --> 00:42:52,079
with whatever it is that might come.

627
00:42:53,899 --> 00:42:58,619
How many people get devastating news with this or that?

628
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:00,899
And it might be job-related.

629
00:43:00,899 --> 00:43:02,339
It might be health-related.

630
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:04,379
It could be a whole host of things,

631
00:43:04,379 --> 00:43:06,779
but we find that God wants to prepare us.

632
00:43:06,779 --> 00:43:08,979
Now, He wants you to know personally

633
00:43:08,979 --> 00:43:12,339
how great He is in His great power

634
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,539
so that you would praise Him

635
00:43:13,539 --> 00:43:15,539
and so that you would trust Him.

636
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:18,339
Oh, this morning, I hope that we would not be

637
00:43:18,339 --> 00:43:20,739
like the children of Israel that would forget.

638
00:43:22,379 --> 00:43:26,519
Many times, in the midst of a growth difficulty,

639
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:28,379
as the songwriter said, we're prone to wander.

640
00:43:28,379 --> 00:43:32,499
I mean, we forget, but oh, that God would help us.

641
00:43:32,499 --> 00:43:34,859
God, this is nothing for you.

642
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:36,819
This is nothing for you, God.

643
00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:39,219
You've demonstrated all of these things

644
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:43,219
in your precious book, and you've done it in my life before.

645
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:47,219
God, I am trusting you alone,

646
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:49,299
and let's see what God will do,

647
00:43:49,299 --> 00:43:52,859
because God is making Himself known

648
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:56,659
for the single purpose that He would be glorified.

649
00:43:56,659 --> 00:43:59,059
And you know, when we trust Him

650
00:43:59,059 --> 00:44:03,379
and when we see Him do great things, He's glorified.

651
00:44:04,419 --> 00:44:09,099
When they sing in Exodus 15 the song of Moses,

652
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:11,259
it wasn't Moses that was getting the glory

653
00:44:11,259 --> 00:44:12,259
for parting the Red Sea.

654
00:44:12,259 --> 00:44:14,719
It was God that was getting the glory.

655
00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:18,619
And that's what it would be in our lives

656
00:44:18,619 --> 00:44:21,719
as we just trust Him that He would be glorified.

657
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:22,559
Let's pray together.

658
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:23,619
Father, we love you.

659
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,779
We thank you for loving us.

660
00:44:24,779 --> 00:44:26,799
We thank you for your precious word.

661
00:44:26,799 --> 00:44:28,739
We thank you for the privilege of being able

662
00:44:28,739 --> 00:44:31,579
to know just how great you are.

663
00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:35,819
Thank you for in the life of Moses,

664
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:38,579
there in Horeb, you made your greatness known.

665
00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:39,939
I think about here in Egypt,

666
00:44:39,939 --> 00:44:41,419
as we think about these plagues,

667
00:44:41,419 --> 00:44:43,859
how you made your greatness known.

668
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:46,739
God, I pray that as we have had the opportunity

669
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:49,739
to study these portions of Scripture this morning,

670
00:44:49,739 --> 00:44:51,939
God, I pray that you would help us

671
00:44:52,779 --> 00:44:54,459
to glorify you in our lives,

672
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:58,459
that we'd glorify you by trusting you.

673
00:44:58,459 --> 00:45:01,619
And I know, God, that we'll only trust you like we should

674
00:45:02,979 --> 00:45:06,859
when we fully understand personally

675
00:45:07,699 --> 00:45:09,259
how great you really are.

676
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:12,099
And I pray, God, this morning that you'd help us

677
00:45:12,099 --> 00:45:15,099
to submit and surrender our lives to you,

678
00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:18,059
that we'd see you do great and mighty things.

679
00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:20,459
We thank you for the privilege

680
00:45:20,459 --> 00:45:23,619
of knowing you and of serving you.

681
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:26,659
God, if there's one here that's not sure of heaven,

682
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:28,699
they've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

683
00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:30,619
as their personal Savior,

684
00:45:30,619 --> 00:45:33,099
I pray that today they would understand

685
00:45:33,099 --> 00:45:35,259
their need for Christ.

686
00:45:35,259 --> 00:45:37,299
Just as we mentioned of that 10th plague,

687
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:38,299
the death of the firstborn,

688
00:45:38,299 --> 00:45:41,179
there was only one way to spare death,

689
00:45:41,179 --> 00:45:42,979
and that was by applying that blood.

690
00:45:44,299 --> 00:45:46,459
We find that Christ is our Passover,

691
00:45:46,459 --> 00:45:48,219
the Lamb of God,

692
00:45:48,219 --> 00:45:49,899
was slain before the foundation of the world,

693
00:45:49,899 --> 00:45:50,739
the Lamb of God,

694
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:52,699
which taketh away the sins of the world.

695
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:56,419
He came and he lived a perfect, sinless life.

696
00:45:56,419 --> 00:45:57,659
He was buried in a borrowed tomb.

697
00:45:57,659 --> 00:46:00,099
He rose conquering sin, death, and the grave.

698
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:01,659
He lives forevermore.

699
00:46:02,779 --> 00:46:04,139
Oh, God, I pray that today,

700
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:05,179
if there's one not saved,

701
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,739
they'd be saved today,

702
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:07,779
be born again.

703
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:11,939
I pray that you'd help every child of God that's here.

704
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:14,099
God, would you help us to trust you?

705
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:17,339
I don't know the specific circumstances

706
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:19,819
that are being dealt with by every individual

707
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:20,899
that's present this morning,

708
00:46:20,899 --> 00:46:21,939
but God, you do.

709
00:46:22,979 --> 00:46:24,739
God, I believe that you want them to know

710
00:46:24,739 --> 00:46:26,939
how powerful and how great you are,

711
00:46:27,939 --> 00:46:31,659
and that we'd trust you through every circumstance,

712
00:46:31,659 --> 00:46:33,939
that you alone would be glorified.

713
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:35,979
I pray that you'd move and work

714
00:46:35,979 --> 00:46:38,099
in this time of invitation,

715
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:39,219
that decisions would be made

716
00:46:39,219 --> 00:46:41,259
that would be pleasing to thee, Lord,

717
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:42,499
that would cause us to be conformed

718
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:44,179
to the image of your Son.

719
00:46:44,179 --> 00:46:45,459
Well, thank you for all that you'll do,

720
00:46:45,459 --> 00:46:46,819
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

721
00:46:46,819 --> 00:46:48,179
Would you stand with me?

722
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:50,339
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

723
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:52,219
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano,

724
00:46:52,219 --> 00:46:54,299
and as we have at the end of our service,

725
00:46:54,299 --> 00:46:56,459
there's an opportunity for a time of invitation,

726
00:46:56,459 --> 00:46:59,099
give you an opportunity to respond.

727
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:00,179
We're ready to listen,

728
00:47:00,179 --> 00:47:01,499
ready to hear the word of God,

729
00:47:01,499 --> 00:47:03,419
but we must be ready to respond.

730
00:47:03,459 --> 00:47:04,819
You've got someone in your life,

731
00:47:04,819 --> 00:47:06,579
there's some trial you're going through,

732
00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:08,939
and you need to make that determination,

733
00:47:08,939 --> 00:47:11,499
that you're gonna trust him fully.

734
00:47:11,499 --> 00:47:12,699
Maybe you're not sure of heaven,

735
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:13,779
let me take a Bible and show you

736
00:47:13,779 --> 00:47:16,099
how you can know for sure that heaven's your home.

737
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:18,379
As Kimberly plays, this altar is open.
