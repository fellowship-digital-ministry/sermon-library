1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
5, and Lord willing, we're gonna finish

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,719
the book of 1 John this morning.

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:07,739
And we started it back in January,

4
00:00:07,739 --> 00:00:10,439
studying through the book of 1 John

5
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:13,600
and our theme, Walking in the Light.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,239
And we started this book and it's been our theme all year.

7
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:21,360
We've had the privilege of singing for all of our services

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,879
the theme song, I Walk and I Talk with the King.

9
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,159
And what a joy and blessing it is

10
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:29,200
to know the Lord Jesus Christ

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,079
as our personal savior.

12
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:33,439
And as we look at this portion of scripture,

13
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,840
I do trust that it'll be a blessing to you.

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,840
Of course, last week I preached a different message.

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,080
I wasn't in the book of 1 John,

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,759
but a couple of weeks ago,

17
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,020
we looked at verses 14 and 15

18
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,040
in 1 John chapter number five.

19
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,959
And as we looked at verses 14 and 15,

20
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:51,040
I dealt with the subject matter of confident prayer.

21
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,799
And the Bible says in verse 14,

22
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,619
and this is the confidence that we have in him,

23
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:57,599
that if we ask anything according to his will,

24
00:00:57,639 --> 00:00:58,599
he heareth us.

25
00:00:58,599 --> 00:01:00,520
And if we know that he hear us,

26
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,639
whatsoever we ask,

27
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:06,000
we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,620
As we concluded that message a couple of weeks ago,

29
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,879
we acknowledged the product of praying according to his will.

30
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:16,540
And we said this, that when we pray according to his will,

31
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,760
that he has told us that he would answer us.

32
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,339
And really the desire and what we see as the product

33
00:01:23,339 --> 00:01:26,180
is a closer walk with the Lord.

34
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,739
I dealt with this.

35
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:31,139
I spent much time on this particular point

36
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:33,019
in the message a couple of weeks ago.

37
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:36,500
And really it's amazing how God has designed it as such.

38
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,199
When we pray according to his will,

39
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:39,940
we say, how do I know his will?

40
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,860
Well, we know his will through his word.

41
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,660
And so we get into the word of God

42
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,940
so that we can know how to pray according to his will.

43
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,699
And then as we pray according to his will,

44
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:50,660
he hears us and he answers us.

45
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,099
And when he answers us,

46
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:55,279
that encourages us because we've had answered prayer

47
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:57,319
and that encourages us.

48
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,080
And then we wanna pray more

49
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,900
because we wanna see more answered prayer.

50
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,419
And so we dig into the word of God more

51
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:04,940
so that we can know his will,

52
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,639
so that we can pray according to his will.

53
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:08,160
And then he answers our prayer.

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,800
And we think about this cycle

55
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,279
and we see how that God and his infinite wisdom

56
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:18,279
has designed it so that it draws us closer to him.

57
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:21,279
And we might be familiar,

58
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:23,960
some of us might be familiar with that song,

59
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,160
just a closer walk with thee.

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,520
And the songwriter said this,

61
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,880
not the entirety of the song,

62
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,440
but they said, just a closer walk with thee.

63
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,279
Grant it, Jesus is my plea.

64
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:38,000
Daily walking close to thee.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,539
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

66
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:45,619
It ought to be the desire of every child of God

67
00:02:45,619 --> 00:02:48,199
to have a closer walk with the Lord.

68
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:51,880
And we find that God has given us this truth in his word

69
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,320
with regard to the product of this answered prayer,

70
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,279
of this praying according to his will,

71
00:02:57,279 --> 00:03:00,360
is that we'll have that closer walk with him,

72
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,800
have that sweet fellowship.

73
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,679
We understand that one of the themes

74
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:06,679
of the book of 1 John, as we've dealt with it all year,

75
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:08,559
is really the theme of fellowship.

76
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:10,720
And he deals with that in the first few verses

77
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,220
of the book of 1 John in the first chapter.

78
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,199
If you'll turn back there just for a moment

79
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,779
in verses three and four,

80
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,800
John immediately starts dealing with this subject,

81
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,339
this topic, if you will,

82
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,059
the theme of fellowship.

83
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:23,899
In verse three, he says,

84
00:03:23,899 --> 00:03:28,899
that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you,

85
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,940
that ye also may have fellowship with us.

86
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,300
And truly, our fellowship is with the Father

87
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,339
and with his son, Jesus Christ.

88
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:41,380
And these things write we unto you,

89
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,940
that your joy may be full.

90
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,380
In verse number five, this then is the message

91
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,940
which we have heard of him and declare unto you

92
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,860
that God is light and in him is no darkness at all.

93
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,979
If we say that we have fellowship with him

94
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:58,539
and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth.

95
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:02,539
And what a joy it is to have fellowship with the Lord.

96
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:04,119
To be able to enter into his presence,

97
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,699
I was chatting via text with my father-in-law this week.

98
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:09,899
And as I was chatting with this past week,

99
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:12,580
I was chatting with him a little bit via text.

100
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,639
And we were talking about the trip

101
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,540
that Holly and I had recently made to Israel

102
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,739
and talking about the Garden of Gethsemane.

103
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,579
And of course, if you were here when I gave that overview

104
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:25,739
of our trip to Israel on Sunday night a few weeks ago,

105
00:04:25,739 --> 00:04:27,619
I mentioned that really the Garden of Gethsemane

106
00:04:27,619 --> 00:04:30,459
was probably the highlight of the trip.

107
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:32,679
I just truly enjoyed being there.

108
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:35,739
And when Jesus was in Jerusalem,

109
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:38,880
the Garden of Gethsemane was the place where he was.

110
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,339
It was his place.

111
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:43,700
John tells us that he resorted thither often.

112
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,779
And you just are in that place and what a blessing it was.

113
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:49,260
But here's what I said to my father-in-law.

114
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:50,859
And I wanna say it to you as well.

115
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:53,339
And I hope that it's a blessing to you.

116
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:54,660
And here's the truth.

117
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,119
As much of a blessing as it was

118
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:59,500
to be in the Garden of Gethsemane.

119
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,640
And as we were there, the group of us,

120
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,140
as Holly and I were there in the Garden of Gethsemane,

121
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,140
we sang together, we wept together, we prayed together.

122
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,079
It was amazing.

123
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:13,260
But here's what's even more amazing.

124
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,500
I don't have to go to the Garden of Gethsemane

125
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,739
to meet with my God.

126
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:20,260
And that's awesome.

127
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,959
Because I can meet with my God

128
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:24,859
and you can meet with your God anywhere,

129
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:28,220
anytime, for any length of time,

130
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,820
you can enter into his presence.

131
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,100
And that is awesome.

132
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,940
Don't misunderstand.

133
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,859
I'm thankful for the opportunity to have been there,

134
00:05:34,859 --> 00:05:37,820
but I'm so thankful and so much more thankful

135
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,420
that I don't have to go there to meet with my God.

136
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,540
I met with him this morning.

137
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,299
I met with him right here this morning.

138
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:50,260
And I prayed for you from right here this morning.

139
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,500
And then I went into my office

140
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,019
and I met with him in my office,

141
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:57,019
at my desk, reading this book.

142
00:05:57,019 --> 00:05:59,100
You met with him wherever you met with him.

143
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,179
I've met with him at Panera.

144
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:02,980
You say, at Panera, I have.

145
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,700
I've met with him at Chick-fil-A, praise God, amen.

146
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,820
You can meet with God anywhere.

147
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,959
And that's awesome.

148
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,220
And we look at this book

149
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,200
and we understand the theme of fellowship

150
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,320
and we understand that John has spent much time

151
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,600
going through and providing us with truth

152
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
in the book of 1 John

153
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,239
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

154
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:27,799
to help us to know some things.

155
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:30,359
He wants us to know that we're saved.

156
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:34,279
I'm so thankful that God desires for his children

157
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:39,279
to know that they know that they know that they're saved.

158
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,480
Listen, I'm thankful that my parents,

159
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,880
and they're here this morning,

160
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,600
desired for my brother and I when we were growing up

161
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,279
that we knew that they were our parents,

162
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,440
that we were their kids, right?

163
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,359
I'm thankful that they didn't treat us

164
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:54,059
like we were somebody else's kids.

165
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:57,160
No, they made us know that we were their children.

166
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,200
We have three children, God's blessed us,

167
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,440
and we want our children to know

168
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,760
that God has entrusted us with them

169
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,200
and they're our children.

170
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,920
And God is my heavenly father.

171
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,200
He wants me to know that I'm his child

172
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,239
and he's given us evidences

173
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:17,420
that would help us to be able to have confidence

174
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,660
that we're saved,

175
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,720
that we don't have to go through life wondering,

176
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,320
am I saved, am I not saved,

177
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,079
am I going to heaven when I die?

178
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,720
Is it based upon this letter?

179
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,000
No, it's all based on the finished work of Christ

180
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,679
at Calvary, his death barrel and glorious resurrection.

181
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:35,279
We place our faith and trust in him alone

182
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,760
and he promised to save us.

183
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,359
And we can rejoice in that

184
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,200
and God wants us to know that.

185
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,959
Not only does he want us to know that we're his children,

186
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,239
but he wants us to know that we can have fellowship

187
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:46,200
with him.

188
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,480
He's never busy.

189
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,600
He's never too busy for you.

190
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,399
But he also wants us to know that there are some things

191
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,359
that can hinder that fellowship.

192
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:59,839
And as we conclude the book of 1 John,

193
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,339
I really believe that here in this portion of scripture,

194
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:07,880
we find really a warning of how our fellowship

195
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,880
with the Lord can be hindered,

196
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,940
but then we are reminded of the blessedness

197
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,519
of abiding in him.

198
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:19,079
And in verse number 19,

199
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:22,480
I'm going to look at verses 16 through 21 this morning,

200
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,040
but I want to draw your attention to verse 19,

201
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,000
give you the title, we'll jump right in.

202
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,480
In verse 19, it says this,

203
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:32,280
and we know that we are of God.

204
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,280
That word know is used so often in this book,

205
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,239
to know, to have that knowledge, that certainty,

206
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:43,000
that confidence.

207
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,359
You ever been in a situation where you know something?

208
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,159
I often say it this way to somebody,

209
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,760
I'll use Michael as an illustration,

210
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,799
I'll meet Michael and I'll say,

211
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,599
hey, Michael, are you 100% sure if you're to die

212
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:52,440
that you'd go to heaven?

213
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,919
Now that's not the first thing that I say to Michael,

214
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,559
but I say that to Michael and he says,

215
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,760
well, you know, I think so.

216
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,880
And I was like, well, God wants you to know.

217
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,919
And I'll say something like this.

218
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:02,880
Do you know that your name is Michael?

219
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,400
You know what everyone says to me?

220
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,179
Yes, they know what their name is.

221
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:10,280
And then I'll say this.

222
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,179
What if I told you your name was Tom, John,

223
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,719
I'll just pick a name.

224
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:17,400
Could I convince you that that's your name?

225
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,479
And they're like, no.

226
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:20,239
And they look at me like I'm crazy.

227
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,640
But I say in that same way that you know

228
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,159
that your name is Michael,

229
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:27,840
God wants you to know that you're his child.

230
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,880
He wants you to know that with confidence

231
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,020
and with certainty.

232
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:36,020
And here it says, and we know that we are of God.

233
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:37,960
We know that we are of God.

234
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,119
As we use that as our title this morning,

235
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:42,320
I mentioned that the passage starts out

236
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,159
with really a warning and helps us to understand

237
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,200
how that our fellowship with God can be hindered.

238
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,960
And if you are taking notes, notice with me,

239
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,599
number one, recognize the peril of sin.

240
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:56,039
Recognize the peril of sin.

241
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,960
In verse number 16, the Bible says this

242
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,760
in first John five and verse 16.

243
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,980
If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall

244
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,860
give him life for them that sin not unto death.

245
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:15,260
There is a sin unto death, I do not say that he shall pray for it.

246
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:20,180
All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not unto death."

247
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,980
And you say, that sounds confusing.

248
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,540
Probably one of the most debated portions of Scripture in the book of 1 John, verse

249
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:32,540
16 and 17, and really as you go forward even into verse 18 as well.

250
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,700
But I hope that this morning that we can find that it's very clear what God is teaching

251
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,900
us here in these verses of Scripture.

252
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:44,060
In my own life, but also in the lives of my brothers and sisters in Christ, we must recognize

253
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,780
the peril of sin.

254
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:51,340
We find that he says in verse number 17 that all unrighteousness is sin, and we understand

255
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,340
that.

256
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,100
We understand this morning that as we go to the Word of God and we look to the Word of

257
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:00,740
God, that God defines what is sinful behavior, what is sin.

258
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,020
We must acknowledge that we have sinned before we could ever be saved, and we understand

259
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,500
the Bible says all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

260
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,260
But here's the amazing thing, as we think about believers and we think about the sin

261
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,860
in the life of a believer and we understand that we've been saved by the blood of the

262
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,780
Lord Jesus Christ, we studied the first chapter and really into the second chapter of the

263
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:27,740
book of 1 John, and we were reminded of some wonderful promises that we need to rehearse

264
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,120
this morning.

265
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,940
Number one is this, there's a promise of forgiveness.

266
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,960
In 1 John chapter number 1 and verse number 9, he says, if we confess our sins, now remember

267
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:44,420
he's writing to save people, so after we're saved, we still sin.

268
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,180
Have you sinned since you've been saved?

269
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,940
Sure you have.

270
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,140
Does that mean that you're not saved?

271
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:56,260
That doesn't mean that you're not saved, but you've sinned since you've been saved.

272
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,740
Now you've been saved from the penalty of sin, but you've not yet been saved from the

273
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,820
presence of sin.

274
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,900
I'm thankful that we've been saved from the power of sin.

275
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,060
You don't, you no longer have to sin.

276
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,620
Sin no longer has dominion over you, as Paul says in the book of Romans, but we find now

277
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:18,460
that as we, as believers, when there's sin in our life, we have this great promise that

278
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:26,980
if we confess our sins, he, God, is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse

279
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,180
us from all unrighteousness.

280
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,660
That ought to cause us to be thankful this morning, that we have this promise of forgiveness,

281
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,500
but not only a promise of forgiveness, but we have the promise in 1 John 2 and verse

282
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,980
number 1 that Jesus Christ the righteous is our advocate.

283
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,320
The Bible says this in 1 John 2 and verse number 1, my little children, these things

284
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,300
write I unto you that ye sin not.

285
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,180
And obviously as a child of God, I ought to desire to live a life of obedience.

286
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:03,180
When we baptize someone, you'll hear it this morning, that you're raised to walk in newness

287
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,460
of life.

288
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:09,980
And that desire on the part of a child of God to live a life of obedience, but we still

289
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,940
have this flesh and there still will be sin, but our desire should be that we sin not.

290
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,800
That's what he says, that you sin not.

291
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,500
But then he says this, and if any man sin, we have an advocate.

292
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:27,060
We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.

293
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,920
And I love this promise in 1 John 2 and verse number 1 that we have an advocate.

294
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,940
We really could look at that today and use the terminology of being a defense attorney.

295
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,940
And here's the amazing thing, and I said this months ago as we studied 1 John chapter number

296
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:48,820
2, that Jesus Christ the righteous, our advocate, our defense attorney, he does not argue our

297
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,820
innocence.

298
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,820
Why?

299
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,380
Because we're guilty.

300
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,080
How could he argue our innocence if we're guilty?

301
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,420
He doesn't argue our innocence, rather he acknowledges our guilt, but then says this,

302
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,300
I've paid for it.

303
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,080
Isn't that awesome?

304
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:14,840
Because the Lord, that we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.

305
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,800
And these are promises that are precious to us as believers, and we ought to understand

306
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,020
that and we ought to be encouraged by that.

307
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,760
As we go back to 1 John 5 and verse number 16, notice what he says, if any man see his

308
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,480
brother sin a sin, which is not unto death.

309
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,740
Now I'm going to try to unpackage this for you and help you this morning and help myself

310
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,740
as well.

311
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,420
He says this, he shall ask, it goes back to praying that we looked at in verses 14 and

312
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,420
15.

313
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,740
He shall ask, notice what it says, and he shall give him life for them that sin not

314
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,420
unto death.

315
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,420
So what's he saying?

316
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:57,180
Well, if we as brothers and sisters in Christ see a brother or sister sinning in error,

317
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:06,380
then we can engage in intercessory prayer for them that their fellowship might be restored.

318
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,520
We're praying.

319
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,020
Listen, we have, there are churches, we don't necessarily have this ministry in our church,

320
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:18,240
though we have certainly discussed and we pray one for another, but a prodigal prayer

321
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,360
list that people will deal with, a prodigal prayer ministry.

322
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:28,100
And we think about people, listen, we know people that are, they've erred, they've sinned,

323
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,020
and we are able to pray for them.

324
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,140
They've sinned a sin that's not unto death.

325
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,140
You say, what does that mean?

326
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,339
Well, we all sin.

327
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,260
Not every sin is a sin unto death.

328
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,140
By the way, aren't you thankful for that?

329
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:43,300
The church would have ceased to exist immediately, right?

330
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:48,420
There'd be no church today if every sin in the life of a believer was a sin unto death.

331
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,820
The church would just stop.

332
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,940
It would just, it would not exist.

333
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,860
And so he says, if you see a brother that sinned a sin that's not unto death, he shall

334
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,700
ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death.

335
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,260
Really it's the idea of intercessory prayer.

336
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,619
By the way, Moses was a great example of this.

337
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:07,140
We don't have time to go back to the book of Exodus, but if we did, you can go to the

338
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:12,980
32nd chapter, and you can see specifically where Moses is, he is interceding on the behalf

339
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:19,140
of erring brothers and sisters of the children of Israel that were erring at that particular

340
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,460
time, and Moses prayed for them.

341
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:28,140
And we have in this passage of Scripture, as we mentioned last week or two weeks ago,

342
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,740
that if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us.

343
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,160
Well, he just said here that if you see a brother sin that's a sin that's not unto death,

344
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,559
he shall ask, you pray for them.

345
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,700
You pray for them.

346
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:44,540
Not condemning them, but seeking to have their fellowship with God restored.

347
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:52,140
I've often said that two pillars of biblical Christianity are forgiveness and reconciliation.

348
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:57,040
And I am so thankful that our God forgives and he reconciles.

349
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,880
And what a blessing that is.

350
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,520
But we find that here in this text of Scripture that it does say to us at the end of verse

351
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,000
number 16, there is a sin unto death.

352
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,400
I do not say that he shall pray for it.

353
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,160
And so we look at this verse, and people always want to know, what's the sin unto death?

354
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,680
Well, actually, God doesn't define it.

355
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,680
How's that for an answer?

356
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,880
You say, we're waiting for an answer.

357
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,339
I don't know.

358
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:24,559
The Bible doesn't define what a sin unto death is.

359
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,300
There's some people that would try to look at blasphemy and what have you, but really

360
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,279
contextually in the book of First John, he's speaking about believers.

361
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,040
And so we find here that he says that there's a sin unto death.

362
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,380
I do not say that he shall pray for it.

363
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,920
The way that you would pray for a brother that sinned a sin that's not unto death.

364
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,619
He says, if there's a sin unto death, you don't pray for them in that same way.

365
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:48,279
Verse 17, all unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not unto death.

366
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:53,400
And so we try to unpackage this and understand what is a sin unto death, though God does

367
00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:02,040
not define this sin, but we find that in his infinite wisdom and in his righteous judgment,

368
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:09,180
that he has made it known to us as his children, that it is possible for the sinning believer

369
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:14,800
to face physical death as a judgment.

370
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,600
Not only has he told us this, that there is a sin unto death, by the way, that ought to

371
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:26,720
cause us to be concerned and walk righteously, amen?

372
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,440
We find that there are a couple of biblical examples.

373
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,600
Turn back to the book of Acts, if you will, we'll look at New Testament examples, turn

374
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,359
to Acts chapter number 5, and we look in this passage, I'm not going to read the entirety

375
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,359
of it.

376
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,600
For your notes, if you want to write down verses 1 through 11, that's the entirety of

377
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,720
the portion of Scripture, but I will not take time to read all of the passage this morning.

378
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,239
Many of us would be familiar with the account here of Ananias and Sapphira.

379
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:57,000
The Bible tells us in Acts 5 in verse number 1, but a certain man named Ananias with Sapphira,

380
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,840
his wife, sold a possession.

381
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,799
And notice what they did in verse number 2, kept back part of the price, his wife also

382
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:09,720
being privy of it, and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles' feet.

383
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,320
Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, to keep

384
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,200
back part of the price of the land?

385
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,000
Because it remained, was it not thine own?

386
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,200
And after it was sold, was it not thine own power?

387
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,320
Why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart?

388
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,400
Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.

389
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,640
And Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and gave up the ghost.

390
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
You know what that means?

391
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,400
That means he died.

392
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,119
You say, he just lied.

393
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:40,640
I know, that's how we look at it.

394
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,040
Just a lie.

395
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,040
Everyone lies.

396
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,320
You better be careful.

397
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,080
Understand the seriousness of sin.

398
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,760
And here, the Bible says that he gave up the ghost, but notice the result of it.

399
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,200
It says, and great fear came on all them that heard these things.

400
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,640
By the way, if this happened in our midst, I think most of us would have great fear as

401
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,640
well.

402
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,200
It'd be a sobering reality to the importance of righteousness.

403
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,840
Amen?

404
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,280
Our God is holy.

405
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,080
It tells us that about three hours later in verse number 7 that his wife came in, she

406
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,880
didn't know what had happened, and she gave the same story.

407
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,040
And it tells us in verse number 10, then fell she down straightway at his feet and yielded

408
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,040
up the ghost.

409
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
She died as well.

410
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,480
And the young men came in and found her dead, and carrying her forth, buried her by her

411
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,480
husband.

412
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,200
Again in verse 11, it says that great fear came upon all the church and upon as many

413
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,840
as heard these things.

414
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,560
The establishment of the church in the book of Acts in the first century, and we find

415
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:48,400
that in this particular incident that really what's happening is sin is starting to creep

416
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,280
into the church.

417
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,480
And God deals with it very severely.

418
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,080
Why?

419
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,560
Because he's concerned about righteousness.

420
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,320
He's concerned about holy living.

421
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,560
And we find at the start of the church, when the church is just in its infancy, if we could

422
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,920
use that terminology this morning, we find that what God is doing is he's helping for

423
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,640
the church to understand the importance of holiness.

424
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,200
See, we don't want the church to be corrupted by sin.

425
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,840
And so God deals with it very severely.

426
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,920
We find that not only does he deal with it severely, but then he tells us in 1 Corinthians

427
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,120
chapter number 11, when we think about the church in Corinth and here in this portion

428
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,120
of Scripture.

429
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,720
In fact, I'll be preaching from 1 Corinthians 11 this evening as we observe the Lord's Supper.

430
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,920
But we find in 1 Corinthians 11, at the end of the passage of Scripture dealing specifically

431
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,680
with the Lord's Supper, the Bible says in verse number 30, for this cause, the fact

432
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,440
that people were drinking and eating unworthily the Lord's Supper, for this cause many are

433
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,840
weak and sickly among you and many sleep.

434
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,040
That word sleep, as we know, it means to die, all right?

435
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,800
Remember with Lazarus, when he was sick and Jesus said to the disciples, he's asleep.

436
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,960
And they said, well, listen, if he's asleep, then let him sleep.

437
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,520
And he spoke plainly and said, he's dead.

438
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,520
He's dead.

439
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:11,120
And here, the text of Scripture, this word sleep means to die.

440
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,400
And so there are people in Corinth that died because of their sin.

441
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,720
And so we find that as we look back in 1 John chapter number 5, that the Bible says that

442
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
there is a sin unto death.

443
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,920
I don't know what it is, but I don't really want to find out.

444
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,680
That make sense this morning?

445
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:34,400
And so the truth that God has revealed to us in understanding that in His infinite wisdom

446
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,840
and in His righteous judgment that He's made it known to us as His people that there is

447
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,520
a sin unto death, I don't want to play with sin.

448
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,760
And neither should you.

449
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,240
You guys know I don't like snakes.

450
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,600
I don't like any kind of snake.

451
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,700
I just don't.

452
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,660
But if it's poisonous, I definitely don't like it.

453
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:59,980
You will never find me, never will you find me messing with a rattlesnake, a copperhead,

454
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,980
any of that.

455
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,060
I'm just not going to do it.

456
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,060
Why?

457
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,500
Because that thing might bite me and it's poisonous and I might die.

458
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,500
And here's the truth.

459
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
I tell my kids this all the time.

460
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,740
If I got bit by a rattlesnake, I'd just have a heart attack.

461
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,420
There wouldn't be the whole thing of getting the anti-venom and all that stuff.

462
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,980
Just I'd have a heart attack and die.

463
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,780
And so the reality is that I'm not going to play with a rattlesnake because I understand

464
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,640
the danger.

465
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,180
In a real sense in the life of a believer, listen, I don't want to mess around and dabble

466
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,580
in sin.

467
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,740
All sin, all unrighteousness is sin.

468
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,780
It's a violation against the Holy God.

469
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:45,340
But I don't want to have from a human perspective an untimely death because God sees fit that,

470
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,700
hey, that's a sin unto death.

471
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:52,900
And he's going to remove me from this world or remove you from this world because you

472
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,940
have brought reproach against the name of God.

473
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,940
Someone used this illustration.

474
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,940
I thought it was a good illustration.

475
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:05,820
An illustration of children at a dinner party and the children misbehaving and the parent

476
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,180
saying eventually to the child, listen, if you continue that, I'm going to send you to

477
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,580
your bedroom.

478
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:19,940
I'm going to remove you from this place because you are bringing a reproach against our family.

479
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,140
You're not going to be permitted to be here.

480
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:28,660
In that type of a fashion, God in his infinite wisdom, he says, child, you're coming home

481
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,900
because you've sinned a sin unto death.

482
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,460
Now the amazing thing, D.L.

483
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,300
Moody used to say this all the time that when he spoke about the truth, well, I'll say that

484
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,300
just for a moment.

485
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,300
Let me say this.

486
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:45,100
Without recognizing the peril of sin, sin in the life of a believer hinders fellowship.

487
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,700
Sin in the life of a believer hinders fellowship.

488
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,820
When I have sin in my life, when you have sin in your life, it hinders our fellowship.

489
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,820
D.L.

490
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:57,980
Moody often said, sin will keep me from this book or this book will keep me from sin.

491
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,860
And the reality is in our lives, we ought to desire to walk righteously and wholly with

492
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:08,260
our God and understanding the peril of sin and understanding, listen, that sin, that

493
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,779
sin is going to hinder my fellowship with my God.

494
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:14,779
And so why would I want to hinder my fellowship with God?

495
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,580
I want to have that fullness of joy.

496
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,180
I want to be in his fellowship.

497
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,100
I want to be in his presence.

498
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:26,240
And we find here that sin in the life of a believer hinders fellowship.

499
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,380
Number two, sin in the life of a believer results in chastisement.

500
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,180
Now the Bible tells us whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth.

501
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:37,980
In Hebrews chapter number 12, verses 5 through 7, you can read of chastisement there.

502
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,660
And I am so thankful that God chastens us.

503
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,260
He deals with us as children.

504
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,340
He chastens us because he loves us.

505
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,860
I don't like being chastened, but I'm thankful that God would chasten us.

506
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,740
And really, we ought to learn to be thankful for chastisement because it is a birthmark

507
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,180
of a believer, that God deals with us.

508
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,420
God says, you're my child, you're sinning, I'm going to chasten you.

509
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,420
Why?

510
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,779
Because I love you.

511
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:07,900
If you don't face chastisement, you better check to see if you're saved.

512
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,420
Hebrews chapter number 12 deals with that very specifically in verses 5 through 7.

513
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:17,540
We think about what John is relaying here and communicating to these believers that

514
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,540
he's writing to.

515
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,279
He says, recognize the peril of sin.

516
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,740
This is what hinders fellowship.

517
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:27,500
He says at the end of verse number 19, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.

518
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,360
No wonder he told us in 1 John 2 that we're to love not the world, neither the things

519
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,960
that are in the world.

520
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:41,640
No wonder that James would tell us that loving the world is enmity and that we cannot love

521
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,240
the world and love God at the same time and understanding this truth that he would deal

522
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,240
with.

523
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,440
And we find here that John says, the whole world lieth in wickedness.

524
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,980
Notice what else he says about the hindrance to fellowship, recognizing the peril of sin.

525
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:02,140
Verse 21, little children, keep yourselves from idols.

526
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,140
Amen.

527
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:08,540
You say, man, that's an interesting way to end the book of 1 John.

528
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,300
Little children, keep yourselves from idols.

529
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,300
Amen.

530
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,059
There's no, you read the Pauline epistles and you read about all the people that Paul

531
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:20,540
saying greet this one and greet that one and so on and so forth, grace and peace and mercy

532
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,020
and so on.

533
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,740
John says, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, little children, keep yourselves

534
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,740
from idols.

535
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,740
Amen.

536
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,500
Wow.

537
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,500
You know, John is writing from Ephesus.

538
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,420
That's where he's writing this book from.

539
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:35,580
And I want you to think about Ephesus being a center of idol worship.

540
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:40,220
We understand that Paul went into Ephesus and people were saved, a church was established

541
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,220
at Ephesus.

542
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,700
In fact, that church is written to in the book of Revelation, those seven letters that

543
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,140
are written back to the churches, the church at Ephesus being the first of those.

544
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:54,580
But we find that in Ephesus, it was a place of idol worship and Acts chapter number 19,

545
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,580
you don't need to turn there.

546
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:00,940
I just want to read two verses to you that describe for us the scene of idolatry in the

547
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,620
city of Ephesus.

548
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,980
In Acts 19 and verse number 28, they pronounce this.

549
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:11,260
They say, when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath and cried out saying, great

550
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,040
is Diana of the Ephesians.

551
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:19,059
And then a few verses later in verse number 34, it says, but when they knew that he was

552
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:28,180
a Jew, all with one voice, about the space of two hours, cried out, great is Diana of

553
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,180
the Ephesians.

554
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:33,100
I don't know if you've ever really meditated upon that verse in Acts 19 and verse 34, but

555
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,179
I spent some time this week meditating upon that.

556
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:41,059
Two hours is a long time.

557
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:48,780
And the Bible says in verse 34 that for the space of two hours, all with one voice, cried

558
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,859
out, great is Diana of the Ephesians.

559
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:54,660
Wow.

560
00:28:54,660 --> 00:29:00,380
The idolatry that was present there in Ephesus and Paul writing from the city of Ephesus,

561
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,419
no doubt, obviously under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, this danger of

562
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:05,419
idols.

563
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:13,059
This morning, idolatry in our world looks different than it looked in John's world.

564
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:20,299
Idolatry here in our community looks different than it does in some places around the globe.

565
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:23,739
There are some places around the globe that when you talk about idolatry, you actually

566
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:29,859
see little figurines and you see little idols and incense being burned to these images and

567
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:30,859
so on and so forth.

568
00:29:30,859 --> 00:29:35,220
And that would be very consistent with much of what you see of idolatry in the Old Testament

569
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,320
and even that which you would see in Ephesus.

570
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:44,919
But idolatry truly is anything that would take the place of God.

571
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:50,820
Anything in your life or my life that would take that first place.

572
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,760
The Bible tells us in Colossians chapter 1 that in all things, He, Christ, must have

573
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,559
the preeminence.

574
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:59,119
We find that.

575
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:07,479
for us, it could be my workplace. It could be our bank account. It could be our

576
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:13,579
health. It could be our children. It could be, you just start filling it in. You

577
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:17,239
start thinking about all these things. Sports. Man, we live in a world today

578
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:23,359
where sports can become an idol for people. And we find here this morning

579
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:28,079
that John is closing out this portion of Scripture and he says, listen,

580
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:32,279
there's some hindrances to fellowship. There's a warning that's being given

581
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:37,759
and we must recognize the peril of sin. Then we see the blessedness of abiding

582
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:42,479
in Him. So we recognize, we recognize the peril of sin, but then number two

583
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:46,999
this morning, remember the protection of God. As we continue to move forward, we

584
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:52,079
we see the warning of the hindrances of sin in our fellowship, but we then see

585
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,439
the blessedness of abiding in Him and we're reminded of the protection of God.

586
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:01,719
I'm so thankful that the Bible tells us here in verse number 18, we know that

587
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:07,399
whosoever is born of God sinneth not. Now I'll break that down in just a moment,

588
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:10,239
but I want to focus on the beginning part when it says we know that whosoever

589
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:15,239
is born of God. And I think about that phrase because in, and he started

590
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:19,799
the fifth chapter of the book of 1st John, he used that phrase born of God

591
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:26,359
twice. In verse number one of 1st John 5, he said whosoever believeth that Jesus

592
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:31,679
is the Christ is born of God. And then in verse number four, he says whosoever is

593
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,239
born of God overcometh the world. I dealt with this several weeks ago. What does it

594
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:39,799
mean to be born of God? It means that I recognize that I'm a sinner and that

595
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:44,839
Christ is the only Savior. And I receive Him as my personal Savior, understand

596
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:48,599
that He died for me, that He was buried, and then He rose again conquering sin,

597
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:54,119
death, and the grave. It's just as Jesus said to Nicodemus, marvel not that I say

598
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:59,839
unto you, unto thee, ye must be born again. Nicodemus was the one that came

599
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:05,199
to Jesus by night, and he says listen, marvel not that I say unto thee, ye must

600
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:10,919
be born again. And ye must be born again. If you've not been born of God, you've

601
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:16,119
only had one birth, that's the physical birth, and you have a birthday. But we

602
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:20,959
find that the importance of being born again, being born of God, and we find

603
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,399
that he mentions this truth in 1st John chapter number 5 of being born of God. He

604
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,239
said this in chapter 3 in verse number 1, that what manner of love, behold

605
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:36,360
what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be

606
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:42,619
called the sons of God. Man, John chapter number 10, we're not going to take the

607
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:47,799
time to turn there, but we find in verses 27 through 30, the fact that we are

608
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:53,879
secure in the hand of God. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and I give unto

609
00:32:53,879 --> 00:32:59,459
them eternal life, and they shall never perish. Those are precious words that

610
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:05,819
Jesus spoke that John would have heard with his own ears. And Peter would say

611
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:11,759
this in 1st Peter 1 and verse number 5, that we are kept by the power of God. So

612
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:17,119
Jesus says, and John and Peter both here, that we're secure in his hand, and Peter

613
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:21,679
says that we're kept by the power of God, and John speaks about being born of God

614
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,559
and that protection that we have that God gives us, and I am so thankful for

615
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:32,000
the protection of God. It says in verse 18, we know that whosoever is born of God

616
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,799
sinneth not. Now we've dealt with this in previous messages, but it's important to

617
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:41,159
note once again that the verb tense of the particular word is important and

618
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:45,720
gives us clarity. In previous messages in chapter 2 and 3, we dealt

619
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,919
with this in 1st John 2 and 3, but the verb here, when it talks about sinneth

620
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,479
not, is conjugated in the present tense. I'm not trying to be too difficult here,

621
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:59,000
but really what it indicates is ongoing action. So it doesn't mean that you'll

622
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,839
never sin, it means that you're not going to have that habitual sin in your life.

623
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:09,000
Why? Because we have been delivered from the power of sin, and we can overcome

624
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,559
through the Lord Jesus Christ. We're not going to clean up our own lives for

625
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:18,199
ourselves, but with God's power we can have victory over sin. We're to live in

626
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:23,239
victory. And so we find that that's what he deals with here, but then continue in

627
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:28,320
verse number 18, it says this, but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, notice

628
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,919
what he says, and that wicked one toucheth him not. That's precious promise

629
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:39,359
that God gives us, and it's a reminder to us of the protection of God. Not

630
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:43,639
only does God keep his children, but we find that he gives us this truth that

631
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:49,639
that wicked one toucheth him not. Who's the wicked one? Our enemy, our adversary,

632
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:59,919
Satan. And the promise that is given is that our omnipotent Savior is in

633
00:34:59,919 --> 00:35:05,579
control of all things, and he protects us, and though our God is omnipotent and has

634
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:12,299
all power, we understand this morning that our adversary is limited. Our God has unlimited

635
00:35:12,299 --> 00:35:20,260
power, but our adversary is limited in his power. And let me say it this way, he is subject

636
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:28,059
to God. Read the book of Job. You find very plainly that the enemy, the adversary, the

637
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:34,500
wicked one is who he's referred to here, he is in subject to God Almighty. And it says

638
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:40,940
that he toucheth him not. That word, toucheth, means to adhere to or to cling to. It doesn't

639
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:48,419
just mean this touch like this. It means to hold on to, to cling, to grasp. And here,

640
00:35:48,419 --> 00:35:52,979
the Bible says, listen, I'm so thankful that I'm secure in the hands of God, that I'm kept

641
00:35:52,979 --> 00:35:59,459
by the power of God, and the wicked one, he cannot adhere to or cling to me. Yes, he's

642
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:04,059
gonna attack you, he's gonna send forth his fiery darts, all of those things, he's the

643
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:10,660
accuser of the brethren, but we have the protection of God. As we abide in him, we can rejoice

644
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:16,299
in the blessedness, and we can be reminded this morning of God's divine protection upon

645
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:23,820
his children, and that security that we have in Christ. I'm so thankful this morning, and

646
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,899
I hope that you're so thankful this morning to be reminded of this protection that God

647
00:36:28,899 --> 00:36:36,419
gives us, and that the wicked one toucheth him not. I'm so thankful for the security

648
00:36:36,419 --> 00:36:41,779
that God gives me. And I hope you're so thankful this morning for the security that God gives

649
00:36:41,779 --> 00:36:46,500
you. See, I have children. Many of you have children. You know what we want to do for

650
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:52,619
our children? We want to protect them, provide them security. Right? Isn't that what you

651
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:56,739
want to do for your children? That's what I'm going to do for my children. But here's

652
00:36:56,739 --> 00:37:04,139
the thing. I'm limited. So are you. Sometimes there's a danger that comes into the life

653
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:11,500
of my children, and I'm limited. I'm not everywhere at the same time, and neither are you. And

654
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:16,820
so they're in a place that I'm not, and there's a danger. How many times we as parents have

655
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:30,419
said, I wish I was there. Right? I'm not omnipresent, but my God is. I'm not omnipotent.

656
00:37:30,419 --> 00:37:35,859
Sometimes I'm there when my children face danger, but I don't have the power, and neither

657
00:37:35,859 --> 00:37:48,760
do you. I'm not capable of helping them, and how difficult it is, but my God is omnipotent.

658
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:55,179
He's omnipresent, and He's omnipotent. He's always there, and He's always able, and He

659
00:37:55,179 --> 00:37:59,699
protects us. And I'm so thankful for that this morning.

660
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:05,419
Let me give you one final thought this morning. We need to rejoice for the provision of God.

661
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:11,059
We need to recognize the peril of sin. It hinders our fellowship with God. We must remember

662
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:16,940
the protection of God, and then we must rejoice for the provision of God. Notice with me as

663
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:22,779
we continue reading here in verse number 20 what a great verse of Scripture this is. He

664
00:38:22,779 --> 00:38:28,199
uses the word know a few times here in this verse of Scripture, and again, how much God

665
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:34,859
wants us to know the truth. And He says this in verse 20, and we know that the Son of God

666
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:40,020
is come. Let me just pause right there as we talk about and rejoicing for the provision

667
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:44,299
of God this time of year. We speak about the incarnation, the birth of Christ. Listen,

668
00:38:44,299 --> 00:38:51,419
I'm thankful that He provided Himself. He left the throne room of heaven. He left all

669
00:38:51,419 --> 00:38:59,739
of the glory and all of the splendor of heaven, and though He was rich, He became poor for

670
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:06,059
our sakes, that we might be made rich. Think about that wonderful truth, and it says in

671
00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:13,460
verse number 20, and we know that the Son of God is come. He already has come. It is

672
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:21,859
truth. It is settled truth that God was manifest in the flesh, that Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

673
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:27,380
that He came and He dwelt among us. Remember, John started the passage by talking about

674
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:34,260
in verse number 2 of 1 John 1, for the life was manifested, and we have seen it and bear

675
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:40,099
witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested

676
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:47,979
unto us. John says, I was an eyewitness. I heard, I saw, I handled of the word of life.

677
00:39:47,979 --> 00:39:54,380
Man, that's awesome. And we ought to rejoice this morning that God was willing to provide

678
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:58,739
Himself. He came to the sin-cursed world.

679
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:07,739
We understand this morning that if He didn't come, there's no salvation apart from Jesus Christ.

680
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:12,739
Without the incarnation, there is no salvation.

681
00:40:12,739 --> 00:40:14,739
But He came.

682
00:40:14,739 --> 00:40:20,739
When the fullness of time was come, God sent forth His Son, born of the Virgin,

683
00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:24,739
for what purpose? To redeem them that were under the law.

684
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:31,739
Oh, I'm so thankful that Jesus Christ, God's Son, God in the flesh, came.

685
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:33,739
He provided Himself.

686
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:35,739
Not only that, notice in verse number 20,

687
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:42,739
And hath given us understanding that we may know Him that is true,

688
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:46,739
and we are in Him that is true, even in His Son Jesus Christ.

689
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:50,739
This is the true God and eternal life.

690
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,739
Man, this is a powerful verse of Scripture.

691
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:54,739
We find that He provided Himself.

692
00:40:54,739 --> 00:40:56,739
We find that He provided truth.

693
00:40:56,739 --> 00:40:58,739
He has given us this truth here.

694
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:01,739
He talks about having understanding, knowing Him that is true.

695
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:05,739
The Bible says of Jesus Christ that He is truth.

696
00:41:05,739 --> 00:41:08,739
He then speaks of His word as being truth.

697
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:12,739
This morning, we ought to rejoice in the fact that not only has He provided Himself,

698
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:14,739
but then He's provided truth.

699
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:18,739
If He did not provide and preserve this book, how would we know truth?

700
00:41:18,739 --> 00:41:21,739
How would we even know that Jesus came?

701
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:23,739
But we have this record.

702
00:41:23,739 --> 00:41:26,739
We have this book because He gave us truth.

703
00:41:26,739 --> 00:41:28,739
We find that He's provided that to us.

704
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:31,739
We find that He provides understanding.

705
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,739
Did you see what it said there in 1 John 5 and verse 20?

706
00:41:33,739 --> 00:41:38,739
It says, and hath given us an understanding.

707
00:41:38,739 --> 00:41:42,739
I'm so thankful that He's provided this understanding,

708
00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:48,739
and we understand this morning that this understanding comes through the Holy Spirit.

709
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:52,739
He says in John 16 and verse number 13 that He, the Holy Spirit,

710
00:41:52,739 --> 00:41:58,739
He is the Spirit of truth, and He will guide us into all truth.

711
00:41:58,739 --> 00:42:00,739
And we ought to be so thankful.

712
00:42:00,739 --> 00:42:02,739
You say, how do you understand these things?

713
00:42:02,739 --> 00:42:05,739
The Holy Spirit of God gives me understanding.

714
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:07,739
It's not that I'm smarter than somebody else.

715
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:09,739
It's not that you're smarter than somebody else.

716
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:12,739
It's not that we're, no, no, it's God that gives us understanding.

717
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,739
By the way, that keeps us humble.

718
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:15,739
Amen?

719
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:17,739
Keeps us humble.

720
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:19,739
We find here that He's provided Himself.

721
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:21,739
He's provided truth.

722
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,739
He's provided us with understanding.

723
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:25,739
I think about this in verse number 20.

724
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:29,739
Again, it says this, and we know that the Son of God has come

725
00:42:29,739 --> 00:42:31,739
and hath given us an understanding.

726
00:42:31,739 --> 00:42:37,739
Notice what this says, that we may know Him that is true.

727
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:41,739
Oh, I'm so thankful that He allows me to know Him.

728
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:44,739
He allows you to know Him.

729
00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:47,739
You ever in a situation where somebody says,

730
00:42:47,739 --> 00:42:50,739
hey, do you know so-and-so?

731
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:53,739
And really, if we were to answer the question accurately,

732
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:56,739
we would say we know about them.

733
00:42:56,739 --> 00:42:59,739
We don't really know them.

734
00:42:59,739 --> 00:43:01,739
Do you understand what I'm saying?

735
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:04,739
There's some historical figures, I mean, people that are alive today,

736
00:43:04,739 --> 00:43:06,739
that we could say, hey, do you know so-and-so?

737
00:43:06,739 --> 00:43:10,739
And you say, yeah, but we really just know about them.

738
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:12,739
We don't know them.

739
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:20,739
What is to know somebody intimately versus knowing about somebody?

740
00:43:20,739 --> 00:43:24,739
Just a few weeks ago, I was at the funeral for Stephen Trout.

741
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:27,739
He was a dear friend of mine, and I heard people talking about

742
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:29,739
how they were friends with him, and really,

743
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:32,739
and I'm not saying this to be unkind or to be boastful or whatsoever,

744
00:43:32,739 --> 00:43:35,739
but it had been years since they had talked to him,

745
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:39,739
and they really didn't know anything really knowing him.

746
00:43:39,739 --> 00:43:42,739
They went to school with him. They knew about him.

747
00:43:42,739 --> 00:43:45,739
It's a different thing when you know somebody,

748
00:43:45,739 --> 00:43:48,739
when you know what somebody likes, when you know how somebody...

749
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:50,739
Do you understand what I'm saying?

750
00:43:50,739 --> 00:43:52,739
And you know somebody.

751
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:55,739
And we think about this truth this morning,

752
00:43:55,739 --> 00:44:01,739
that the all-powerful, almighty God of the universe

753
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:06,739
lets us know him.

754
00:44:06,739 --> 00:44:12,739
That should just cause our mind to explode this morning, seriously.

755
00:44:12,739 --> 00:44:15,739
Paul says in Philippians 3 that I may know him,

756
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:18,739
the power of his resurrection,

757
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:22,739
the fellowship of his sufferings he speaks about.

758
00:44:22,739 --> 00:44:24,739
Begin to think about that truth this morning.

759
00:44:24,739 --> 00:44:28,739
Moses said that I may know him.

760
00:44:28,739 --> 00:44:33,739
I don't want to just know about God. I want to know him.

761
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:36,739
If I'm going to know God and I'm going to know him intimately,

762
00:44:36,739 --> 00:44:39,739
it's because it's through this book.

763
00:44:39,739 --> 00:44:41,739
How do I know him?

764
00:44:41,739 --> 00:44:44,739
Well, he's revealed himself to us in the pages of Scripture.

765
00:44:44,739 --> 00:44:48,739
I preached a message this week at school chapel

766
00:44:48,739 --> 00:44:51,739
over at Fairfax Baptist Temple Academy,

767
00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:54,739
and I preached from Proverbs 3.

768
00:44:54,739 --> 00:45:00,739
In verse 26, the Bible says that the Lord shall be thy confidence.

769
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,739
And I said to those young people, I said,

770
00:45:02,739 --> 00:45:04,739
how can you make God your confidence?

771
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:06,739
The Lord shall be thy confidence.

772
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:09,739
And I said this, part of the message, it wasn't the entirety of the message,

773
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:12,739
is that the only way God's going to be my confidence,

774
00:45:12,739 --> 00:45:14,739
the one that I rely on, the one that I'm trusting,

775
00:45:14,739 --> 00:45:17,739
is when I get to know him.

776
00:45:17,739 --> 00:45:20,739
And I get to know him through this book.

777
00:45:20,739 --> 00:45:23,739
And if the Lord shall be thy confidence,

778
00:45:23,739 --> 00:45:26,739
and he's revealed himself to us in the pages of Scripture,

779
00:45:26,739 --> 00:45:30,739
and we rejoice this morning because 1 John 5 and verse number 20

780
00:45:30,739 --> 00:45:35,739
tells us that we may know him that is true,

781
00:45:35,739 --> 00:45:40,739
and we, notice as it continues, are in him that is true.

782
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:44,739
Think about the truth that we can abide in him.

783
00:45:44,739 --> 00:45:46,739
He said in John chapter number 15,

784
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:49,739
abide in me, and I in you.

785
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:52,739
And we can rejoice this morning

786
00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:55,739
in the fact that I can abide in him.

787
00:45:55,739 --> 00:45:59,739
See, when we close out this book, he ends it this way,

788
00:45:59,739 --> 00:46:02,739
even in his son Jesus Christ,

789
00:46:02,739 --> 00:46:06,739
this is the true God and eternal life.

790
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:11,739
I'm so thankful this morning that God has given us a record,

791
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:15,739
that God's given us his book, the Bible, the word of God.

792
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:20,739
And I must and you must recognize the peril of sin.

793
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:23,739
As we think about the importance of this book and the theme

794
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,739
and the subject of fellowship, and saying,

795
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:27,739
I want to have that fellowship with God,

796
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:29,739
and I see the product of answered prayer,

797
00:46:29,739 --> 00:46:32,739
and praying according to his will is helping me to draw closer to him.

798
00:46:32,739 --> 00:46:35,739
I don't want to hinder that fellowship.

799
00:46:35,739 --> 00:46:38,739
And so John says, as God has given us a warning,

800
00:46:38,739 --> 00:46:41,739
listen, sin is what's going to hinder that fellowship.

801
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:44,739
Oh God, help me to walk in the light.

802
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:46,739
Help me to walk in righteousness.

803
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:48,739
Help me to walk in holiness.

804
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,739
Help me to walk in truth.

805
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:56,739
Oh God, to not let anything between my soul and my Savior.

806
00:46:56,739 --> 00:46:58,739
But then we can rejoice this morning

807
00:46:58,739 --> 00:47:03,739
as we are reminded of the blessedness of abiding in him,

808
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:07,739
and we're reminded that God gives us this divine protection,

809
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:11,739
that we're kept by the power of God,

810
00:47:11,739 --> 00:47:14,739
and that we can rejoice for his provision.

811
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:19,739
He provided himself, and thus provided salvation.

812
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:21,739
He's provided truth.

813
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:23,739
He's given us the word of God.

814
00:47:23,739 --> 00:47:27,739
He's given us an understanding through the Spirit of God.

815
00:47:27,739 --> 00:47:31,739
He's given us this morning the ability to know him,

816
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:33,739
and to abide in him.

817
00:47:33,739 --> 00:47:35,739
That ought to cause us to rejoice greatly.

818
00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:38,739
When we close a book like 1 John,

819
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:42,739
I hope that our study has caused us to desire

820
00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:46,739
to draw closer to him,

821
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:49,739
that we would say, I want to walk in the light

822
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:51,739
as he is in the light.

823
00:47:51,739 --> 00:47:53,739
And yes, I'm going to have fellowship with him,

824
00:47:53,739 --> 00:47:55,739
but I'm also, according to the verse of Scripture,

825
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,739
going to have fellowship one with another.

826
00:47:57,739 --> 00:48:01,739
What joy that God would give us such truth

827
00:48:01,739 --> 00:48:06,739
and say, I want you to know these things.

828
00:48:06,739 --> 00:48:08,739
Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.

829
00:48:08,739 --> 00:48:09,739
Let's pray.

830
00:48:09,739 --> 00:48:12,739
Father, we love you this morning.

831
00:48:12,739 --> 00:48:14,739
We thank you so much for loving us.

832
00:48:14,739 --> 00:48:17,739
We thank you for the precious word of God.

833
00:48:17,739 --> 00:48:22,739
We thank you, God, for how you have provided us

834
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:24,739
with a perfect preserved book.

835
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:27,739
We thank you for the Lord Jesus Christ,

836
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:31,739
for his perfect sinless life,

837
00:48:31,739 --> 00:48:33,739
the perfect sacrifice.

838
00:48:33,739 --> 00:48:35,739
We thank you for salvation through his name,

839
00:48:35,739 --> 00:48:37,739
through his blood.

840
00:48:37,739 --> 00:48:39,739
God, I pray that if there's one here this morning

841
00:48:39,739 --> 00:48:41,739
that's not sure of heaven,

842
00:48:41,739 --> 00:48:44,739
God, I pray that today would be the day of their salvation.

843
00:48:44,739 --> 00:48:47,739
They'd get it settled.

844
00:48:47,739 --> 00:48:49,739
They would not leave this place without knowing for sure

845
00:48:49,739 --> 00:48:52,739
that heaven is their home.

846
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:55,739
God, I pray for every believer this morning.

847
00:48:55,739 --> 00:49:01,739
Oh, God, I pray you would help us to beware,

848
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:04,739
to recognize the peril of sin.

849
00:49:04,739 --> 00:49:07,739
Help us to walk with thee and to walk in the light

850
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:09,739
as you're in the light.

851
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:13,739
Help us, Lord, to rejoice as we remember your protection

852
00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:15,739
and your provision.

853
00:49:15,739 --> 00:49:19,739
I pray that you'd help us, Lord, to draw closer to thee.

854
00:49:19,739 --> 00:49:21,739
Help us to come to that place, as the songwriter said,

855
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:25,739
that we truly would let nothing come

856
00:49:25,739 --> 00:49:28,739
between my soul and my Savior.

857
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:30,739
Help us to abide in you.

858
00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:33,739
Lord, use us for your honor and for your glory.

859
00:49:33,739 --> 00:49:37,739
I pray that you'd work in hearts and lives as only you can

860
00:49:37,739 --> 00:49:40,739
as we have opportunity to respond to you this morning.

861
00:49:40,739 --> 00:49:44,739
I pray that every decision that is made would be honoring

862
00:49:44,739 --> 00:49:46,739
and glorifying to thee.

863
00:49:46,739 --> 00:49:47,739
We'll thank you for it.

864
00:49:47,739 --> 00:49:49,739
Would you stand with me?
