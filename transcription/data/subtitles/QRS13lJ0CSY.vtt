WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
5, and Lord willing, we're gonna finish

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.719
the book of 1 John this morning.

00:00:04.719 --> 00:00:07.739
And we started it back in January,

00:00:07.739 --> 00:00:10.439
studying through the book of 1 John

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:13.600
and our theme, Walking in the Light.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.239
And we started this book and it's been our theme all year.

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:21.360
We've had the privilege of singing for all of our services

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.879
the theme song, I Walk and I Talk with the King.

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:27.159
And what a joy and blessing it is

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:29.200
to know the Lord Jesus Christ

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.079
as our personal savior.

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.439
And as we look at this portion of scripture,

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:35.840
I do trust that it'll be a blessing to you.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.840
Of course, last week I preached a different message.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.080
I wasn't in the book of 1 John,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.759
but a couple of weeks ago,

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:44.020
we looked at verses 14 and 15

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.040
in 1 John chapter number five.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.959
And as we looked at verses 14 and 15,

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:51.040
I dealt with the subject matter of confident prayer.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.799
And the Bible says in verse 14,

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:55.619
and this is the confidence that we have in him,

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:57.599
that if we ask anything according to his will,

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:58.599
he heareth us.

00:00:58.599 --> 00:01:00.520
And if we know that he hear us,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.639
whatsoever we ask,

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:06.000
we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.620
As we concluded that message a couple of weeks ago,

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.879
we acknowledged the product of praying according to his will.

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:16.540
And we said this, that when we pray according to his will,

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.760
that he has told us that he would answer us.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.339
And really the desire and what we see as the product

00:01:23.339 --> 00:01:26.180
is a closer walk with the Lord.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.739
I dealt with this.

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:31.139
I spent much time on this particular point

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:33.019
in the message a couple of weeks ago.

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:36.500
And really it's amazing how God has designed it as such.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.199
When we pray according to his will,

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:39.940
we say, how do I know his will?

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.860
Well, we know his will through his word.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.660
And so we get into the word of God

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.940
so that we can know how to pray according to his will.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.699
And then as we pray according to his will,

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:50.660
he hears us and he answers us.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.099
And when he answers us,

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:55.279
that encourages us because we've had answered prayer

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:57.319
and that encourages us.

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.080
And then we wanna pray more

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.900
because we wanna see more answered prayer.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.419
And so we dig into the word of God more

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:04.940
so that we can know his will,

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.639
so that we can pray according to his will.

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:08.160
And then he answers our prayer.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.800
And we think about this cycle

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.279
and we see how that God and his infinite wisdom

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:18.279
has designed it so that it draws us closer to him.

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:21.279
And we might be familiar,

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:23.960
some of us might be familiar with that song,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.160
just a closer walk with thee.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.520
And the songwriter said this,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.880
not the entirety of the song,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.440
but they said, just a closer walk with thee.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.279
Grant it, Jesus is my plea.

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.000
Daily walking close to thee.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.539
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:45.619
It ought to be the desire of every child of God

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:48.199
to have a closer walk with the Lord.

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:51.880
And we find that God has given us this truth in his word

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.320
with regard to the product of this answered prayer,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.279
of this praying according to his will,

00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:00.360
is that we'll have that closer walk with him,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.800
have that sweet fellowship.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.679
We understand that one of the themes

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:06.679
of the book of 1 John, as we've dealt with it all year,

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:08.559
is really the theme of fellowship.

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:10.720
And he deals with that in the first few verses

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.220
of the book of 1 John in the first chapter.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.199
If you'll turn back there just for a moment

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:16.779
in verses three and four,

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:19.800
John immediately starts dealing with this subject,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.339
this topic, if you will,

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:23.059
the theme of fellowship.

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.899
In verse three, he says,

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:28.899
that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you,

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.940
that ye also may have fellowship with us.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.300
And truly, our fellowship is with the Father

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.339
and with his son, Jesus Christ.

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:41.380
And these things write we unto you,

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.940
that your joy may be full.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.380
In verse number five, this then is the message

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.940
which we have heard of him and declare unto you

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.860
that God is light and in him is no darkness at all.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.979
If we say that we have fellowship with him

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:58.539
and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth.

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:02.539
And what a joy it is to have fellowship with the Lord.

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:04.119
To be able to enter into his presence,

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:07.699
I was chatting via text with my father-in-law this week.

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:09.899
And as I was chatting with this past week,

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:12.580
I was chatting with him a little bit via text.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.639
And we were talking about the trip

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.540
that Holly and I had recently made to Israel

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.739
and talking about the Garden of Gethsemane.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.579
And of course, if you were here when I gave that overview

00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:25.739
of our trip to Israel on Sunday night a few weeks ago,

00:04:25.739 --> 00:04:27.619
I mentioned that really the Garden of Gethsemane

00:04:27.619 --> 00:04:30.459
was probably the highlight of the trip.

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:32.679
I just truly enjoyed being there.

00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:35.739
And when Jesus was in Jerusalem,

00:04:35.739 --> 00:04:38.880
the Garden of Gethsemane was the place where he was.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.339
It was his place.

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:43.700
John tells us that he resorted thither often.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.779
And you just are in that place and what a blessing it was.

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:49.260
But here's what I said to my father-in-law.

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:50.859
And I wanna say it to you as well.

00:04:50.859 --> 00:04:53.339
And I hope that it's a blessing to you.

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:54.660
And here's the truth.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.119
As much of a blessing as it was

00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:59.500
to be in the Garden of Gethsemane.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.640
And as we were there, the group of us,

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.140
as Holly and I were there in the Garden of Gethsemane,

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.140
we sang together, we wept together, we prayed together.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.079
It was amazing.

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:13.260
But here's what's even more amazing.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.500
I don't have to go to the Garden of Gethsemane

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.739
to meet with my God.

00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:20.260
And that's awesome.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.959
Because I can meet with my God

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:24.859
and you can meet with your God anywhere,

00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:28.220
anytime, for any length of time,

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.820
you can enter into his presence.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.100
And that is awesome.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.940
Don't misunderstand.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.859
I'm thankful for the opportunity to have been there,

00:05:34.859 --> 00:05:37.820
but I'm so thankful and so much more thankful

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.420
that I don't have to go there to meet with my God.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.540
I met with him this morning.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.299
I met with him right here this morning.

00:05:47.299 --> 00:05:50.260
And I prayed for you from right here this morning.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.500
And then I went into my office

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.019
and I met with him in my office,

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:57.019
at my desk, reading this book.

00:05:57.019 --> 00:05:59.100
You met with him wherever you met with him.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.179
I've met with him at Panera.

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:02.980
You say, at Panera, I have.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.700
I've met with him at Chick-fil-A, praise God, amen.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.820
You can meet with God anywhere.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.959
And that's awesome.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.220
And we look at this book

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.200
and we understand the theme of fellowship

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.320
and we understand that John has spent much time

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.600
going through and providing us with truth

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.600
in the book of 1 John

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.239
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:27.799
to help us to know some things.

00:06:27.799 --> 00:06:30.359
He wants us to know that we're saved.

00:06:30.359 --> 00:06:34.279
I'm so thankful that God desires for his children

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:39.279
to know that they know that they know that they're saved.

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:41.480
Listen, I'm thankful that my parents,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.880
and they're here this morning,

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.600
desired for my brother and I when we were growing up

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.279
that we knew that they were our parents,

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:49.440
that we were their kids, right?

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.359
I'm thankful that they didn't treat us

00:06:51.359 --> 00:06:54.059
like we were somebody else's kids.

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:57.160
No, they made us know that we were their children.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.200
We have three children, God's blessed us,

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.440
and we want our children to know

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.760
that God has entrusted us with them

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.200
and they're our children.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.920
And God is my heavenly father.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.200
He wants me to know that I'm his child

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.239
and he's given us evidences

00:07:13.239 --> 00:07:17.420
that would help us to be able to have confidence

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.660
that we're saved,

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.720
that we don't have to go through life wondering,

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.320
am I saved, am I not saved,

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.079
am I going to heaven when I die?

00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:25.720
Is it based upon this letter?

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.000
No, it's all based on the finished work of Christ

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.679
at Calvary, his death barrel and glorious resurrection.

00:07:31.679 --> 00:07:35.279
We place our faith and trust in him alone

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:37.760
and he promised to save us.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.359
And we can rejoice in that

00:07:39.359 --> 00:07:41.200
and God wants us to know that.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.959
Not only does he want us to know that we're his children,

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:45.239
but he wants us to know that we can have fellowship

00:07:45.239 --> 00:07:46.200
with him.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.480
He's never busy.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.600
He's never too busy for you.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.399
But he also wants us to know that there are some things

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:57.359
that can hinder that fellowship.

00:07:57.359 --> 00:07:59.839
And as we conclude the book of 1 John,

00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:03.339
I really believe that here in this portion of scripture,

00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:07.880
we find really a warning of how our fellowship

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.880
with the Lord can be hindered,

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.940
but then we are reminded of the blessedness

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.519
of abiding in him.

00:08:16.519 --> 00:08:19.079
And in verse number 19,

00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:22.480
I'm going to look at verses 16 through 21 this morning,

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.040
but I want to draw your attention to verse 19,

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.000
give you the title, we'll jump right in.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.480
In verse 19, it says this,

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:32.280
and we know that we are of God.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.280
That word know is used so often in this book,

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.239
to know, to have that knowledge, that certainty,

00:08:41.239 --> 00:08:43.000
that confidence.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.359
You ever been in a situation where you know something?

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:47.159
I often say it this way to somebody,

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:48.760
I'll use Michael as an illustration,

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.799
I'll meet Michael and I'll say,

00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:51.599
hey, Michael, are you 100% sure if you're to die

00:08:51.599 --> 00:08:52.440
that you'd go to heaven?

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.919
Now that's not the first thing that I say to Michael,

00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:55.559
but I say that to Michael and he says,

00:08:55.559 --> 00:08:56.760
well, you know, I think so.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.880
And I was like, well, God wants you to know.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.919
And I'll say something like this.

00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:02.880
Do you know that your name is Michael?

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.400
You know what everyone says to me?

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.179
Yes, they know what their name is.

00:09:08.719 --> 00:09:10.280
And then I'll say this.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.179
What if I told you your name was Tom, John,

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:15.719
I'll just pick a name.

00:09:15.719 --> 00:09:17.400
Could I convince you that that's your name?

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.479
And they're like, no.

00:09:18.479 --> 00:09:20.239
And they look at me like I'm crazy.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.640
But I say in that same way that you know

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.159
that your name is Michael,

00:09:25.159 --> 00:09:27.840
God wants you to know that you're his child.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.880
He wants you to know that with confidence

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.020
and with certainty.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:36.020
And here it says, and we know that we are of God.

00:09:36.419 --> 00:09:37.960
We know that we are of God.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.119
As we use that as our title this morning,

00:09:40.119 --> 00:09:42.320
I mentioned that the passage starts out

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.159
with really a warning and helps us to understand

00:09:46.159 --> 00:09:49.200
how that our fellowship with God can be hindered.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.960
And if you are taking notes, notice with me,

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.599
number one, recognize the peril of sin.

00:09:54.599 --> 00:09:56.039
Recognize the peril of sin.

00:09:56.039 --> 00:09:57.960
In verse number 16, the Bible says this

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.760
in first John five and verse 16.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:05.980
If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.860
give him life for them that sin not unto death.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:15.260
There is a sin unto death, I do not say that he shall pray for it.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:20.180
All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not unto death."

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.980
And you say, that sounds confusing.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:27.540
Probably one of the most debated portions of Scripture in the book of 1 John, verse

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:32.540
16 and 17, and really as you go forward even into verse 18 as well.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.700
But I hope that this morning that we can find that it's very clear what God is teaching

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.900
us here in these verses of Scripture.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:44.060
In my own life, but also in the lives of my brothers and sisters in Christ, we must recognize

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.780
the peril of sin.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:51.340
We find that he says in verse number 17 that all unrighteousness is sin, and we understand

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.340
that.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:56.100
We understand this morning that as we go to the Word of God and we look to the Word of

00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:00.740
God, that God defines what is sinful behavior, what is sin.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:05.020
We must acknowledge that we have sinned before we could ever be saved, and we understand

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:09.500
the Bible says all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:14.260
But here's the amazing thing, as we think about believers and we think about the sin

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.860
in the life of a believer and we understand that we've been saved by the blood of the

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.780
Lord Jesus Christ, we studied the first chapter and really into the second chapter of the

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:27.740
book of 1 John, and we were reminded of some wonderful promises that we need to rehearse

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.120
this morning.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.940
Number one is this, there's a promise of forgiveness.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:37.960
In 1 John chapter number 1 and verse number 9, he says, if we confess our sins, now remember

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:44.420
he's writing to save people, so after we're saved, we still sin.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.180
Have you sinned since you've been saved?

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.940
Sure you have.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.140
Does that mean that you're not saved?

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:56.260
That doesn't mean that you're not saved, but you've sinned since you've been saved.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:01.740
Now you've been saved from the penalty of sin, but you've not yet been saved from the

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.820
presence of sin.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.900
I'm thankful that we've been saved from the power of sin.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.060
You don't, you no longer have to sin.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:12.620
Sin no longer has dominion over you, as Paul says in the book of Romans, but we find now

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:18.460
that as we, as believers, when there's sin in our life, we have this great promise that

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:26.980
if we confess our sins, he, God, is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.180
us from all unrighteousness.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:35.660
That ought to cause us to be thankful this morning, that we have this promise of forgiveness,

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:39.500
but not only a promise of forgiveness, but we have the promise in 1 John 2 and verse

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:44.980
number 1 that Jesus Christ the righteous is our advocate.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:49.320
The Bible says this in 1 John 2 and verse number 1, my little children, these things

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.300
write I unto you that ye sin not.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:57.180
And obviously as a child of God, I ought to desire to live a life of obedience.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:03.180
When we baptize someone, you'll hear it this morning, that you're raised to walk in newness

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.460
of life.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:09.980
And that desire on the part of a child of God to live a life of obedience, but we still

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:14.940
have this flesh and there still will be sin, but our desire should be that we sin not.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.800
That's what he says, that you sin not.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:21.500
But then he says this, and if any man sin, we have an advocate.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:27.060
We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:31.920
And I love this promise in 1 John 2 and verse number 1 that we have an advocate.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.940
We really could look at that today and use the terminology of being a defense attorney.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.940
And here's the amazing thing, and I said this months ago as we studied 1 John chapter number

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:48.820
2, that Jesus Christ the righteous, our advocate, our defense attorney, he does not argue our

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:49.820
innocence.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:50.820
Why?

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.380
Because we're guilty.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:58.080
How could he argue our innocence if we're guilty?

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:03.420
He doesn't argue our innocence, rather he acknowledges our guilt, but then says this,

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.300
I've paid for it.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.080
Isn't that awesome?

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:14.840
Because the Lord, that we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.800
And these are promises that are precious to us as believers, and we ought to understand

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.020
that and we ought to be encouraged by that.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:26.760
As we go back to 1 John 5 and verse number 16, notice what he says, if any man see his

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:31.480
brother sin a sin, which is not unto death.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.740
Now I'm going to try to unpackage this for you and help you this morning and help myself

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:36.740
as well.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:42.420
He says this, he shall ask, it goes back to praying that we looked at in verses 14 and

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.420
15.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.740
He shall ask, notice what it says, and he shall give him life for them that sin not

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.420
unto death.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.420
So what's he saying?

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:57.180
Well, if we as brothers and sisters in Christ see a brother or sister sinning in error,

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:06.380
then we can engage in intercessory prayer for them that their fellowship might be restored.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:07.520
We're praying.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:12.020
Listen, we have, there are churches, we don't necessarily have this ministry in our church,

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:18.240
though we have certainly discussed and we pray one for another, but a prodigal prayer

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.360
list that people will deal with, a prodigal prayer ministry.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:28.100
And we think about people, listen, we know people that are, they've erred, they've sinned,

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.020
and we are able to pray for them.

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.140
They've sinned a sin that's not unto death.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.140
You say, what does that mean?

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.339
Well, we all sin.

00:15:35.339 --> 00:15:37.260
Not every sin is a sin unto death.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.140
By the way, aren't you thankful for that?

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:43.300
The church would have ceased to exist immediately, right?

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:48.420
There'd be no church today if every sin in the life of a believer was a sin unto death.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.820
The church would just stop.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.940
It would just, it would not exist.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.860
And so he says, if you see a brother that sinned a sin that's not unto death, he shall

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:59.700
ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.260
Really it's the idea of intercessory prayer.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.619
By the way, Moses was a great example of this.

00:16:03.619 --> 00:16:07.140
We don't have time to go back to the book of Exodus, but if we did, you can go to the

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:12.980
32nd chapter, and you can see specifically where Moses is, he is interceding on the behalf

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:19.140
of erring brothers and sisters of the children of Israel that were erring at that particular

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.460
time, and Moses prayed for them.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:28.140
And we have in this passage of Scripture, as we mentioned last week or two weeks ago,

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.740
that if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:35.160
Well, he just said here that if you see a brother sin that's a sin that's not unto death,

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.559
he shall ask, you pray for them.

00:16:37.559 --> 00:16:38.700
You pray for them.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:44.540
Not condemning them, but seeking to have their fellowship with God restored.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:52.140
I've often said that two pillars of biblical Christianity are forgiveness and reconciliation.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:57.040
And I am so thankful that our God forgives and he reconciles.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.880
And what a blessing that is.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.520
But we find that here in this text of Scripture that it does say to us at the end of verse

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:08.000
number 16, there is a sin unto death.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.400
I do not say that he shall pray for it.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.160
And so we look at this verse, and people always want to know, what's the sin unto death?

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.680
Well, actually, God doesn't define it.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.680
How's that for an answer?

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.880
You say, we're waiting for an answer.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.339
I don't know.

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:24.559
The Bible doesn't define what a sin unto death is.

00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:27.300
There's some people that would try to look at blasphemy and what have you, but really

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:31.279
contextually in the book of First John, he's speaking about believers.

00:17:31.279 --> 00:17:34.040
And so we find here that he says that there's a sin unto death.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.380
I do not say that he shall pray for it.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:40.920
The way that you would pray for a brother that sinned a sin that's not unto death.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.619
He says, if there's a sin unto death, you don't pray for them in that same way.

00:17:44.619 --> 00:17:48.279
Verse 17, all unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not unto death.

00:17:48.279 --> 00:17:53.400
And so we try to unpackage this and understand what is a sin unto death, though God does

00:17:53.400 --> 00:18:02.040
not define this sin, but we find that in his infinite wisdom and in his righteous judgment,

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:09.180
that he has made it known to us as his children, that it is possible for the sinning believer

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:14.800
to face physical death as a judgment.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:20.600
Not only has he told us this, that there is a sin unto death, by the way, that ought to

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:26.720
cause us to be concerned and walk righteously, amen?

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.440
We find that there are a couple of biblical examples.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.600
Turn back to the book of Acts, if you will, we'll look at New Testament examples, turn

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.359
to Acts chapter number 5, and we look in this passage, I'm not going to read the entirety

00:18:38.359 --> 00:18:39.359
of it.

00:18:39.359 --> 00:18:42.600
For your notes, if you want to write down verses 1 through 11, that's the entirety of

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:47.720
the portion of Scripture, but I will not take time to read all of the passage this morning.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:52.239
Many of us would be familiar with the account here of Ananias and Sapphira.

00:18:52.239 --> 00:18:57.000
The Bible tells us in Acts 5 in verse number 1, but a certain man named Ananias with Sapphira,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.840
his wife, sold a possession.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.799
And notice what they did in verse number 2, kept back part of the price, his wife also

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:09.720
being privy of it, and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles' feet.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:14.320
Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, to keep

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.200
back part of the price of the land?

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.000
Because it remained, was it not thine own?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.200
And after it was sold, was it not thine own power?

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.320
Why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart?

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.400
Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.640
And Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and gave up the ghost.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.640
You know what that means?

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.400
That means he died.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.119
You say, he just lied.

00:19:38.119 --> 00:19:40.640
I know, that's how we look at it.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.040
Just a lie.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.040
Everyone lies.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:48.320
You better be careful.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.080
Understand the seriousness of sin.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.760
And here, the Bible says that he gave up the ghost, but notice the result of it.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.200
It says, and great fear came on all them that heard these things.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:05.640
By the way, if this happened in our midst, I think most of us would have great fear as

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.640
well.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:11.200
It'd be a sobering reality to the importance of righteousness.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.840
Amen?

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.280
Our God is holy.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.080
It tells us that about three hours later in verse number 7 that his wife came in, she

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.880
didn't know what had happened, and she gave the same story.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:26.040
And it tells us in verse number 10, then fell she down straightway at his feet and yielded

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.040
up the ghost.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.040
She died as well.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.480
And the young men came in and found her dead, and carrying her forth, buried her by her

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.480
husband.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.200
Again in verse 11, it says that great fear came upon all the church and upon as many

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.840
as heard these things.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:43.560
The establishment of the church in the book of Acts in the first century, and we find

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:48.400
that in this particular incident that really what's happening is sin is starting to creep

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.280
into the church.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.480
And God deals with it very severely.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.080
Why?

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.560
Because he's concerned about righteousness.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.320
He's concerned about holy living.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:03.560
And we find at the start of the church, when the church is just in its infancy, if we could

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:08.920
use that terminology this morning, we find that what God is doing is he's helping for

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.640
the church to understand the importance of holiness.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:17.200
See, we don't want the church to be corrupted by sin.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.840
And so God deals with it very severely.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.920
We find that not only does he deal with it severely, but then he tells us in 1 Corinthians

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:27.120
chapter number 11, when we think about the church in Corinth and here in this portion

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.120
of Scripture.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:32.720
In fact, I'll be preaching from 1 Corinthians 11 this evening as we observe the Lord's Supper.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:37.920
But we find in 1 Corinthians 11, at the end of the passage of Scripture dealing specifically

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:42.680
with the Lord's Supper, the Bible says in verse number 30, for this cause, the fact

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:47.440
that people were drinking and eating unworthily the Lord's Supper, for this cause many are

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.840
weak and sickly among you and many sleep.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:55.040
That word sleep, as we know, it means to die, all right?

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:59.800
Remember with Lazarus, when he was sick and Jesus said to the disciples, he's asleep.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.960
And they said, well, listen, if he's asleep, then let him sleep.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.520
And he spoke plainly and said, he's dead.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.520
He's dead.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:11.120
And here, the text of Scripture, this word sleep means to die.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:16.400
And so there are people in Corinth that died because of their sin.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.720
And so we find that as we look back in 1 John chapter number 5, that the Bible says that

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.600
there is a sin unto death.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.920
I don't know what it is, but I don't really want to find out.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.680
That make sense this morning?

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:34.400
And so the truth that God has revealed to us in understanding that in His infinite wisdom

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:39.840
and in His righteous judgment that He's made it known to us as His people that there is

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.520
a sin unto death, I don't want to play with sin.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.760
And neither should you.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.240
You guys know I don't like snakes.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.600
I don't like any kind of snake.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.700
I just don't.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.660
But if it's poisonous, I definitely don't like it.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:59.980
You will never find me, never will you find me messing with a rattlesnake, a copperhead,

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:00.980
any of that.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.060
I'm just not going to do it.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.060
Why?

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.500
Because that thing might bite me and it's poisonous and I might die.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.500
And here's the truth.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.500
I tell my kids this all the time.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.740
If I got bit by a rattlesnake, I'd just have a heart attack.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:15.420
There wouldn't be the whole thing of getting the anti-venom and all that stuff.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.980
Just I'd have a heart attack and die.

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:22.780
And so the reality is that I'm not going to play with a rattlesnake because I understand

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.640
the danger.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:30.180
In a real sense in the life of a believer, listen, I don't want to mess around and dabble

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.580
in sin.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:34.740
All sin, all unrighteousness is sin.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.780
It's a violation against the Holy God.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:45.340
But I don't want to have from a human perspective an untimely death because God sees fit that,

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.700
hey, that's a sin unto death.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:52.900
And he's going to remove me from this world or remove you from this world because you

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.940
have brought reproach against the name of God.

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:56.940
Someone used this illustration.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.940
I thought it was a good illustration.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:05.820
An illustration of children at a dinner party and the children misbehaving and the parent

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:09.180
saying eventually to the child, listen, if you continue that, I'm going to send you to

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.580
your bedroom.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:19.940
I'm going to remove you from this place because you are bringing a reproach against our family.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.140
You're not going to be permitted to be here.

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:28.660
In that type of a fashion, God in his infinite wisdom, he says, child, you're coming home

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:30.900
because you've sinned a sin unto death.

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.460
Now the amazing thing, D.L.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:36.300
Moody used to say this all the time that when he spoke about the truth, well, I'll say that

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.300
just for a moment.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.300
Let me say this.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:45.100
Without recognizing the peril of sin, sin in the life of a believer hinders fellowship.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.700
Sin in the life of a believer hinders fellowship.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.820
When I have sin in my life, when you have sin in your life, it hinders our fellowship.

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:52.820
D.L.

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:57.980
Moody often said, sin will keep me from this book or this book will keep me from sin.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:02.860
And the reality is in our lives, we ought to desire to walk righteously and wholly with

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:08.260
our God and understanding the peril of sin and understanding, listen, that sin, that

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:11.779
sin is going to hinder my fellowship with my God.

00:25:11.779 --> 00:25:14.779
And so why would I want to hinder my fellowship with God?

00:25:14.779 --> 00:25:17.580
I want to have that fullness of joy.

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:19.180
I want to be in his fellowship.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.100
I want to be in his presence.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:26.240
And we find here that sin in the life of a believer hinders fellowship.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.380
Number two, sin in the life of a believer results in chastisement.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.180
Now the Bible tells us whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth.

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:37.980
In Hebrews chapter number 12, verses 5 through 7, you can read of chastisement there.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.660
And I am so thankful that God chastens us.

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:43.260
He deals with us as children.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:46.340
He chastens us because he loves us.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.860
I don't like being chastened, but I'm thankful that God would chasten us.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:53.740
And really, we ought to learn to be thankful for chastisement because it is a birthmark

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:57.180
of a believer, that God deals with us.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.420
God says, you're my child, you're sinning, I'm going to chasten you.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:02.420
Why?

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.779
Because I love you.

00:26:03.779 --> 00:26:07.900
If you don't face chastisement, you better check to see if you're saved.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:12.420
Hebrews chapter number 12 deals with that very specifically in verses 5 through 7.

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:17.540
We think about what John is relaying here and communicating to these believers that

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.540
he's writing to.

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.279
He says, recognize the peril of sin.

00:26:20.279 --> 00:26:21.740
This is what hinders fellowship.

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:27.500
He says at the end of verse number 19, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:32.360
No wonder he told us in 1 John 2 that we're to love not the world, neither the things

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.960
that are in the world.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:41.640
No wonder that James would tell us that loving the world is enmity and that we cannot love

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:46.240
the world and love God at the same time and understanding this truth that he would deal

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.240
with.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.440
And we find here that John says, the whole world lieth in wickedness.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:56.980
Notice what else he says about the hindrance to fellowship, recognizing the peril of sin.

00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:02.140
Verse 21, little children, keep yourselves from idols.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:03.140
Amen.

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:08.540
You say, man, that's an interesting way to end the book of 1 John.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.300
Little children, keep yourselves from idols.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.300
Amen.

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.059
There's no, you read the Pauline epistles and you read about all the people that Paul

00:27:16.059 --> 00:27:20.540
saying greet this one and greet that one and so on and so forth, grace and peace and mercy

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.020
and so on.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.740
John says, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, little children, keep yourselves

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:25.740
from idols.

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:26.740
Amen.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.500
Wow.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:29.500
You know, John is writing from Ephesus.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.420
That's where he's writing this book from.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:35.580
And I want you to think about Ephesus being a center of idol worship.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:40.220
We understand that Paul went into Ephesus and people were saved, a church was established

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.220
at Ephesus.

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:45.700
In fact, that church is written to in the book of Revelation, those seven letters that

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:49.140
are written back to the churches, the church at Ephesus being the first of those.

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:54.580
But we find that in Ephesus, it was a place of idol worship and Acts chapter number 19,

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.580
you don't need to turn there.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:28:00.940
I just want to read two verses to you that describe for us the scene of idolatry in the

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.620
city of Ephesus.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.980
In Acts 19 and verse number 28, they pronounce this.

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:11.260
They say, when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath and cried out saying, great

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:14.040
is Diana of the Ephesians.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:19.059
And then a few verses later in verse number 34, it says, but when they knew that he was

00:28:19.059 --> 00:28:28.180
a Jew, all with one voice, about the space of two hours, cried out, great is Diana of

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:29.180
the Ephesians.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:33.100
I don't know if you've ever really meditated upon that verse in Acts 19 and verse 34, but

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:36.179
I spent some time this week meditating upon that.

00:28:36.179 --> 00:28:41.059
Two hours is a long time.

00:28:41.059 --> 00:28:48.780
And the Bible says in verse 34 that for the space of two hours, all with one voice, cried

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:52.859
out, great is Diana of the Ephesians.

00:28:52.859 --> 00:28:54.660
Wow.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:29:00.380
The idolatry that was present there in Ephesus and Paul writing from the city of Ephesus,

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:04.419
no doubt, obviously under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, this danger of

00:29:04.419 --> 00:29:05.419
idols.

00:29:05.419 --> 00:29:13.059
This morning, idolatry in our world looks different than it looked in John's world.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:20.299
Idolatry here in our community looks different than it does in some places around the globe.

00:29:20.299 --> 00:29:23.739
There are some places around the globe that when you talk about idolatry, you actually

00:29:23.739 --> 00:29:29.859
see little figurines and you see little idols and incense being burned to these images and

00:29:29.859 --> 00:29:30.859
so on and so forth.

00:29:30.859 --> 00:29:35.220
And that would be very consistent with much of what you see of idolatry in the Old Testament

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:39.320
and even that which you would see in Ephesus.

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:44.919
But idolatry truly is anything that would take the place of God.

00:29:44.919 --> 00:29:50.820
Anything in your life or my life that would take that first place.

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:54.760
The Bible tells us in Colossians chapter 1 that in all things, He, Christ, must have

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.559
the preeminence.

00:29:57.559 --> 00:29:59.119
We find that.

00:29:59.119 --> 00:30:07.479
for us, it could be my workplace. It could be our bank account. It could be our

00:30:07.479 --> 00:30:13.579
health. It could be our children. It could be, you just start filling it in. You

00:30:13.579 --> 00:30:17.239
start thinking about all these things. Sports. Man, we live in a world today

00:30:17.239 --> 00:30:23.359
where sports can become an idol for people. And we find here this morning

00:30:23.359 --> 00:30:28.079
that John is closing out this portion of Scripture and he says, listen,

00:30:28.079 --> 00:30:32.279
there's some hindrances to fellowship. There's a warning that's being given

00:30:32.279 --> 00:30:37.759
and we must recognize the peril of sin. Then we see the blessedness of abiding

00:30:37.759 --> 00:30:42.479
in Him. So we recognize, we recognize the peril of sin, but then number two

00:30:42.479 --> 00:30:46.999
this morning, remember the protection of God. As we continue to move forward, we

00:30:46.999 --> 00:30:52.079
we see the warning of the hindrances of sin in our fellowship, but we then see

00:30:52.079 --> 00:30:56.439
the blessedness of abiding in Him and we're reminded of the protection of God.

00:30:56.599 --> 00:31:01.719
I'm so thankful that the Bible tells us here in verse number 18, we know that

00:31:01.719 --> 00:31:07.399
whosoever is born of God sinneth not. Now I'll break that down in just a moment,

00:31:07.399 --> 00:31:10.239
but I want to focus on the beginning part when it says we know that whosoever

00:31:10.239 --> 00:31:15.239
is born of God. And I think about that phrase because in, and he started

00:31:15.239 --> 00:31:19.799
the fifth chapter of the book of 1st John, he used that phrase born of God

00:31:19.799 --> 00:31:26.359
twice. In verse number one of 1st John 5, he said whosoever believeth that Jesus

00:31:26.359 --> 00:31:31.679
is the Christ is born of God. And then in verse number four, he says whosoever is

00:31:31.679 --> 00:31:36.239
born of God overcometh the world. I dealt with this several weeks ago. What does it

00:31:36.239 --> 00:31:39.799
mean to be born of God? It means that I recognize that I'm a sinner and that

00:31:39.799 --> 00:31:44.839
Christ is the only Savior. And I receive Him as my personal Savior, understand

00:31:44.839 --> 00:31:48.599
that He died for me, that He was buried, and then He rose again conquering sin,

00:31:48.599 --> 00:31:54.119
death, and the grave. It's just as Jesus said to Nicodemus, marvel not that I say

00:31:54.119 --> 00:31:59.839
unto you, unto thee, ye must be born again. Nicodemus was the one that came

00:31:59.839 --> 00:32:05.199
to Jesus by night, and he says listen, marvel not that I say unto thee, ye must

00:32:05.199 --> 00:32:10.919
be born again. And ye must be born again. If you've not been born of God, you've

00:32:10.919 --> 00:32:16.119
only had one birth, that's the physical birth, and you have a birthday. But we

00:32:16.119 --> 00:32:20.959
find that the importance of being born again, being born of God, and we find

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.399
that he mentions this truth in 1st John chapter number 5 of being born of God. He

00:32:26.399 --> 00:32:31.239
said this in chapter 3 in verse number 1, that what manner of love, behold

00:32:31.239 --> 00:32:36.360
what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:42.619
called the sons of God. Man, John chapter number 10, we're not going to take the

00:32:42.619 --> 00:32:47.799
time to turn there, but we find in verses 27 through 30, the fact that we are

00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:53.879
secure in the hand of God. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and I give unto

00:32:53.879 --> 00:32:59.459
them eternal life, and they shall never perish. Those are precious words that

00:32:59.459 --> 00:33:05.819
Jesus spoke that John would have heard with his own ears. And Peter would say

00:33:05.819 --> 00:33:11.759
this in 1st Peter 1 and verse number 5, that we are kept by the power of God. So

00:33:11.759 --> 00:33:17.119
Jesus says, and John and Peter both here, that we're secure in his hand, and Peter

00:33:17.239 --> 00:33:21.679
says that we're kept by the power of God, and John speaks about being born of God

00:33:21.679 --> 00:33:26.559
and that protection that we have that God gives us, and I am so thankful for

00:33:26.559 --> 00:33:32.000
the protection of God. It says in verse 18, we know that whosoever is born of God

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.799
sinneth not. Now we've dealt with this in previous messages, but it's important to

00:33:36.799 --> 00:33:41.159
note once again that the verb tense of the particular word is important and

00:33:41.159 --> 00:33:45.720
gives us clarity. In previous messages in chapter 2 and 3, we dealt

00:33:45.759 --> 00:33:49.919
with this in 1st John 2 and 3, but the verb here, when it talks about sinneth

00:33:49.919 --> 00:33:54.479
not, is conjugated in the present tense. I'm not trying to be too difficult here,

00:33:54.479 --> 00:33:59.000
but really what it indicates is ongoing action. So it doesn't mean that you'll

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.839
never sin, it means that you're not going to have that habitual sin in your life.

00:34:03.839 --> 00:34:09.000
Why? Because we have been delivered from the power of sin, and we can overcome

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.559
through the Lord Jesus Christ. We're not going to clean up our own lives for

00:34:13.559 --> 00:34:18.199
ourselves, but with God's power we can have victory over sin. We're to live in

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:23.239
victory. And so we find that that's what he deals with here, but then continue in

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:28.320
verse number 18, it says this, but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, notice

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:33.919
what he says, and that wicked one toucheth him not. That's precious promise

00:34:33.919 --> 00:34:39.359
that God gives us, and it's a reminder to us of the protection of God. Not

00:34:39.359 --> 00:34:43.639
only does God keep his children, but we find that he gives us this truth that

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:49.639
that wicked one toucheth him not. Who's the wicked one? Our enemy, our adversary,

00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:59.919
Satan. And the promise that is given is that our omnipotent Savior is in

00:34:59.919 --> 00:35:05.579
control of all things, and he protects us, and though our God is omnipotent and has

00:35:05.579 --> 00:35:12.299
all power, we understand this morning that our adversary is limited. Our God has unlimited

00:35:12.299 --> 00:35:20.260
power, but our adversary is limited in his power. And let me say it this way, he is subject

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:28.059
to God. Read the book of Job. You find very plainly that the enemy, the adversary, the

00:35:28.059 --> 00:35:34.500
wicked one is who he's referred to here, he is in subject to God Almighty. And it says

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:40.940
that he toucheth him not. That word, toucheth, means to adhere to or to cling to. It doesn't

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:48.419
just mean this touch like this. It means to hold on to, to cling, to grasp. And here,

00:35:48.419 --> 00:35:52.979
the Bible says, listen, I'm so thankful that I'm secure in the hands of God, that I'm kept

00:35:52.979 --> 00:35:59.459
by the power of God, and the wicked one, he cannot adhere to or cling to me. Yes, he's

00:35:59.459 --> 00:36:04.059
gonna attack you, he's gonna send forth his fiery darts, all of those things, he's the

00:36:04.059 --> 00:36:10.660
accuser of the brethren, but we have the protection of God. As we abide in him, we can rejoice

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:16.299
in the blessedness, and we can be reminded this morning of God's divine protection upon

00:36:16.299 --> 00:36:23.820
his children, and that security that we have in Christ. I'm so thankful this morning, and

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:28.899
I hope that you're so thankful this morning to be reminded of this protection that God

00:36:28.899 --> 00:36:36.419
gives us, and that the wicked one toucheth him not. I'm so thankful for the security

00:36:36.419 --> 00:36:41.779
that God gives me. And I hope you're so thankful this morning for the security that God gives

00:36:41.779 --> 00:36:46.500
you. See, I have children. Many of you have children. You know what we want to do for

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:52.619
our children? We want to protect them, provide them security. Right? Isn't that what you

00:36:52.619 --> 00:36:56.739
want to do for your children? That's what I'm going to do for my children. But here's

00:36:56.739 --> 00:37:04.139
the thing. I'm limited. So are you. Sometimes there's a danger that comes into the life

00:37:04.139 --> 00:37:11.500
of my children, and I'm limited. I'm not everywhere at the same time, and neither are you. And

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:16.820
so they're in a place that I'm not, and there's a danger. How many times we as parents have

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:30.419
said, I wish I was there. Right? I'm not omnipresent, but my God is. I'm not omnipotent.

00:37:30.419 --> 00:37:35.859
Sometimes I'm there when my children face danger, but I don't have the power, and neither

00:37:35.859 --> 00:37:48.760
do you. I'm not capable of helping them, and how difficult it is, but my God is omnipotent.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:55.179
He's omnipresent, and He's omnipotent. He's always there, and He's always able, and He

00:37:55.179 --> 00:37:59.699
protects us. And I'm so thankful for that this morning.

00:37:59.699 --> 00:38:05.419
Let me give you one final thought this morning. We need to rejoice for the provision of God.

00:38:06.019 --> 00:38:11.059
We need to recognize the peril of sin. It hinders our fellowship with God. We must remember

00:38:11.059 --> 00:38:16.940
the protection of God, and then we must rejoice for the provision of God. Notice with me as

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:22.779
we continue reading here in verse number 20 what a great verse of Scripture this is. He

00:38:22.779 --> 00:38:28.199
uses the word know a few times here in this verse of Scripture, and again, how much God

00:38:28.199 --> 00:38:34.859
wants us to know the truth. And He says this in verse 20, and we know that the Son of God

00:38:34.859 --> 00:38:40.020
is come. Let me just pause right there as we talk about and rejoicing for the provision

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:44.299
of God this time of year. We speak about the incarnation, the birth of Christ. Listen,

00:38:44.299 --> 00:38:51.419
I'm thankful that He provided Himself. He left the throne room of heaven. He left all

00:38:51.419 --> 00:38:59.739
of the glory and all of the splendor of heaven, and though He was rich, He became poor for

00:38:59.739 --> 00:39:06.059
our sakes, that we might be made rich. Think about that wonderful truth, and it says in

00:39:06.059 --> 00:39:13.460
verse number 20, and we know that the Son of God is come. He already has come. It is

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:21.859
truth. It is settled truth that God was manifest in the flesh, that Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

00:39:21.859 --> 00:39:27.380
that He came and He dwelt among us. Remember, John started the passage by talking about

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:34.260
in verse number 2 of 1 John 1, for the life was manifested, and we have seen it and bear

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:40.099
witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested

00:39:40.099 --> 00:39:47.979
unto us. John says, I was an eyewitness. I heard, I saw, I handled of the word of life.

00:39:47.979 --> 00:39:54.380
Man, that's awesome. And we ought to rejoice this morning that God was willing to provide

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:58.739
Himself. He came to the sin-cursed world.

00:39:58.739 --> 00:40:07.739
We understand this morning that if He didn't come, there's no salvation apart from Jesus Christ.

00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:12.739
Without the incarnation, there is no salvation.

00:40:12.739 --> 00:40:14.739
But He came.

00:40:14.739 --> 00:40:20.739
When the fullness of time was come, God sent forth His Son, born of the Virgin,

00:40:20.739 --> 00:40:24.739
for what purpose? To redeem them that were under the law.

00:40:24.739 --> 00:40:31.739
Oh, I'm so thankful that Jesus Christ, God's Son, God in the flesh, came.

00:40:31.739 --> 00:40:33.739
He provided Himself.

00:40:33.739 --> 00:40:35.739
Not only that, notice in verse number 20,

00:40:35.739 --> 00:40:42.739
And hath given us understanding that we may know Him that is true,

00:40:42.739 --> 00:40:46.739
and we are in Him that is true, even in His Son Jesus Christ.

00:40:46.739 --> 00:40:50.739
This is the true God and eternal life.

00:40:50.739 --> 00:40:52.739
Man, this is a powerful verse of Scripture.

00:40:52.739 --> 00:40:54.739
We find that He provided Himself.

00:40:54.739 --> 00:40:56.739
We find that He provided truth.

00:40:56.739 --> 00:40:58.739
He has given us this truth here.

00:40:58.739 --> 00:41:01.739
He talks about having understanding, knowing Him that is true.

00:41:01.739 --> 00:41:05.739
The Bible says of Jesus Christ that He is truth.

00:41:05.739 --> 00:41:08.739
He then speaks of His word as being truth.

00:41:08.739 --> 00:41:12.739
This morning, we ought to rejoice in the fact that not only has He provided Himself,

00:41:12.739 --> 00:41:14.739
but then He's provided truth.

00:41:14.739 --> 00:41:18.739
If He did not provide and preserve this book, how would we know truth?

00:41:18.739 --> 00:41:21.739
How would we even know that Jesus came?

00:41:21.739 --> 00:41:23.739
But we have this record.

00:41:23.739 --> 00:41:26.739
We have this book because He gave us truth.

00:41:26.739 --> 00:41:28.739
We find that He's provided that to us.

00:41:28.739 --> 00:41:31.739
We find that He provides understanding.

00:41:31.739 --> 00:41:33.739
Did you see what it said there in 1 John 5 and verse 20?

00:41:33.739 --> 00:41:38.739
It says, and hath given us an understanding.

00:41:38.739 --> 00:41:42.739
I'm so thankful that He's provided this understanding,

00:41:42.739 --> 00:41:48.739
and we understand this morning that this understanding comes through the Holy Spirit.

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:52.739
He says in John 16 and verse number 13 that He, the Holy Spirit,

00:41:52.739 --> 00:41:58.739
He is the Spirit of truth, and He will guide us into all truth.

00:41:58.739 --> 00:42:00.739
And we ought to be so thankful.

00:42:00.739 --> 00:42:02.739
You say, how do you understand these things?

00:42:02.739 --> 00:42:05.739
The Holy Spirit of God gives me understanding.

00:42:05.739 --> 00:42:07.739
It's not that I'm smarter than somebody else.

00:42:07.739 --> 00:42:09.739
It's not that you're smarter than somebody else.

00:42:09.739 --> 00:42:12.739
It's not that we're, no, no, it's God that gives us understanding.

00:42:12.739 --> 00:42:14.739
By the way, that keeps us humble.

00:42:14.739 --> 00:42:15.739
Amen?

00:42:15.739 --> 00:42:17.739
Keeps us humble.

00:42:17.739 --> 00:42:19.739
We find here that He's provided Himself.

00:42:19.739 --> 00:42:21.739
He's provided truth.

00:42:21.739 --> 00:42:23.739
He's provided us with understanding.

00:42:23.739 --> 00:42:25.739
I think about this in verse number 20.

00:42:25.739 --> 00:42:29.739
Again, it says this, and we know that the Son of God has come

00:42:29.739 --> 00:42:31.739
and hath given us an understanding.

00:42:31.739 --> 00:42:37.739
Notice what this says, that we may know Him that is true.

00:42:37.739 --> 00:42:41.739
Oh, I'm so thankful that He allows me to know Him.

00:42:41.739 --> 00:42:44.739
He allows you to know Him.

00:42:44.739 --> 00:42:47.739
You ever in a situation where somebody says,

00:42:47.739 --> 00:42:50.739
hey, do you know so-and-so?

00:42:50.739 --> 00:42:53.739
And really, if we were to answer the question accurately,

00:42:53.739 --> 00:42:56.739
we would say we know about them.

00:42:56.739 --> 00:42:59.739
We don't really know them.

00:42:59.739 --> 00:43:01.739
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:43:01.739 --> 00:43:04.739
There's some historical figures, I mean, people that are alive today,

00:43:04.739 --> 00:43:06.739
that we could say, hey, do you know so-and-so?

00:43:06.739 --> 00:43:10.739
And you say, yeah, but we really just know about them.

00:43:10.739 --> 00:43:12.739
We don't know them.

00:43:12.739 --> 00:43:20.739
What is to know somebody intimately versus knowing about somebody?

00:43:20.739 --> 00:43:24.739
Just a few weeks ago, I was at the funeral for Stephen Trout.

00:43:24.739 --> 00:43:27.739
He was a dear friend of mine, and I heard people talking about

00:43:27.739 --> 00:43:29.739
how they were friends with him, and really,

00:43:29.739 --> 00:43:32.739
and I'm not saying this to be unkind or to be boastful or whatsoever,

00:43:32.739 --> 00:43:35.739
but it had been years since they had talked to him,

00:43:35.739 --> 00:43:39.739
and they really didn't know anything really knowing him.

00:43:39.739 --> 00:43:42.739
They went to school with him. They knew about him.

00:43:42.739 --> 00:43:45.739
It's a different thing when you know somebody,

00:43:45.739 --> 00:43:48.739
when you know what somebody likes, when you know how somebody...

00:43:48.739 --> 00:43:50.739
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:43:50.739 --> 00:43:52.739
And you know somebody.

00:43:52.739 --> 00:43:55.739
And we think about this truth this morning,

00:43:55.739 --> 00:44:01.739
that the all-powerful, almighty God of the universe

00:44:01.739 --> 00:44:06.739
lets us know him.

00:44:06.739 --> 00:44:12.739
That should just cause our mind to explode this morning, seriously.

00:44:12.739 --> 00:44:15.739
Paul says in Philippians 3 that I may know him,

00:44:15.739 --> 00:44:18.739
the power of his resurrection,

00:44:18.739 --> 00:44:22.739
the fellowship of his sufferings he speaks about.

00:44:22.739 --> 00:44:24.739
Begin to think about that truth this morning.

00:44:24.739 --> 00:44:28.739
Moses said that I may know him.

00:44:28.739 --> 00:44:33.739
I don't want to just know about God. I want to know him.

00:44:33.739 --> 00:44:36.739
If I'm going to know God and I'm going to know him intimately,

00:44:36.739 --> 00:44:39.739
it's because it's through this book.

00:44:39.739 --> 00:44:41.739
How do I know him?

00:44:41.739 --> 00:44:44.739
Well, he's revealed himself to us in the pages of Scripture.

00:44:44.739 --> 00:44:48.739
I preached a message this week at school chapel

00:44:48.739 --> 00:44:51.739
over at Fairfax Baptist Temple Academy,

00:44:51.739 --> 00:44:54.739
and I preached from Proverbs 3.

00:44:54.739 --> 00:45:00.739
In verse 26, the Bible says that the Lord shall be thy confidence.

00:45:00.739 --> 00:45:02.739
And I said to those young people, I said,

00:45:02.739 --> 00:45:04.739
how can you make God your confidence?

00:45:04.739 --> 00:45:06.739
The Lord shall be thy confidence.

00:45:06.739 --> 00:45:09.739
And I said this, part of the message, it wasn't the entirety of the message,

00:45:09.739 --> 00:45:12.739
is that the only way God's going to be my confidence,

00:45:12.739 --> 00:45:14.739
the one that I rely on, the one that I'm trusting,

00:45:14.739 --> 00:45:17.739
is when I get to know him.

00:45:17.739 --> 00:45:20.739
And I get to know him through this book.

00:45:20.739 --> 00:45:23.739
And if the Lord shall be thy confidence,

00:45:23.739 --> 00:45:26.739
and he's revealed himself to us in the pages of Scripture,

00:45:26.739 --> 00:45:30.739
and we rejoice this morning because 1 John 5 and verse number 20

00:45:30.739 --> 00:45:35.739
tells us that we may know him that is true,

00:45:35.739 --> 00:45:40.739
and we, notice as it continues, are in him that is true.

00:45:40.739 --> 00:45:44.739
Think about the truth that we can abide in him.

00:45:44.739 --> 00:45:46.739
He said in John chapter number 15,

00:45:46.739 --> 00:45:49.739
abide in me, and I in you.

00:45:49.739 --> 00:45:52.739
And we can rejoice this morning

00:45:52.739 --> 00:45:55.739
in the fact that I can abide in him.

00:45:55.739 --> 00:45:59.739
See, when we close out this book, he ends it this way,

00:45:59.739 --> 00:46:02.739
even in his son Jesus Christ,

00:46:02.739 --> 00:46:06.739
this is the true God and eternal life.

00:46:06.739 --> 00:46:11.739
I'm so thankful this morning that God has given us a record,

00:46:11.739 --> 00:46:15.739
that God's given us his book, the Bible, the word of God.

00:46:15.739 --> 00:46:20.739
And I must and you must recognize the peril of sin.

00:46:20.739 --> 00:46:23.739
As we think about the importance of this book and the theme

00:46:23.739 --> 00:46:25.739
and the subject of fellowship, and saying,

00:46:25.739 --> 00:46:27.739
I want to have that fellowship with God,

00:46:27.739 --> 00:46:29.739
and I see the product of answered prayer,

00:46:29.739 --> 00:46:32.739
and praying according to his will is helping me to draw closer to him.

00:46:32.739 --> 00:46:35.739
I don't want to hinder that fellowship.

00:46:35.739 --> 00:46:38.739
And so John says, as God has given us a warning,

00:46:38.739 --> 00:46:41.739
listen, sin is what's going to hinder that fellowship.

00:46:41.739 --> 00:46:44.739
Oh God, help me to walk in the light.

00:46:44.739 --> 00:46:46.739
Help me to walk in righteousness.

00:46:46.739 --> 00:46:48.739
Help me to walk in holiness.

00:46:48.739 --> 00:46:50.739
Help me to walk in truth.

00:46:50.739 --> 00:46:56.739
Oh God, to not let anything between my soul and my Savior.

00:46:56.739 --> 00:46:58.739
But then we can rejoice this morning

00:46:58.739 --> 00:47:03.739
as we are reminded of the blessedness of abiding in him,

00:47:03.739 --> 00:47:07.739
and we're reminded that God gives us this divine protection,

00:47:07.739 --> 00:47:11.739
that we're kept by the power of God,

00:47:11.739 --> 00:47:14.739
and that we can rejoice for his provision.

00:47:14.739 --> 00:47:19.739
He provided himself, and thus provided salvation.

00:47:19.739 --> 00:47:21.739
He's provided truth.

00:47:21.739 --> 00:47:23.739
He's given us the word of God.

00:47:23.739 --> 00:47:27.739
He's given us an understanding through the Spirit of God.

00:47:27.739 --> 00:47:31.739
He's given us this morning the ability to know him,

00:47:31.739 --> 00:47:33.739
and to abide in him.

00:47:33.739 --> 00:47:35.739
That ought to cause us to rejoice greatly.

00:47:35.739 --> 00:47:38.739
When we close a book like 1 John,

00:47:38.739 --> 00:47:42.739
I hope that our study has caused us to desire

00:47:42.739 --> 00:47:46.739
to draw closer to him,

00:47:46.739 --> 00:47:49.739
that we would say, I want to walk in the light

00:47:49.739 --> 00:47:51.739
as he is in the light.

00:47:51.739 --> 00:47:53.739
And yes, I'm going to have fellowship with him,

00:47:53.739 --> 00:47:55.739
but I'm also, according to the verse of Scripture,

00:47:55.739 --> 00:47:57.739
going to have fellowship one with another.

00:47:57.739 --> 00:48:01.739
What joy that God would give us such truth

00:48:01.739 --> 00:48:06.739
and say, I want you to know these things.

00:48:06.739 --> 00:48:08.739
Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.

00:48:08.739 --> 00:48:09.739
Let's pray.

00:48:09.739 --> 00:48:12.739
Father, we love you this morning.

00:48:12.739 --> 00:48:14.739
We thank you so much for loving us.

00:48:14.739 --> 00:48:17.739
We thank you for the precious word of God.

00:48:17.739 --> 00:48:22.739
We thank you, God, for how you have provided us

00:48:22.739 --> 00:48:24.739
with a perfect preserved book.

00:48:24.739 --> 00:48:27.739
We thank you for the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:48:27.739 --> 00:48:31.739
for his perfect sinless life,

00:48:31.739 --> 00:48:33.739
the perfect sacrifice.

00:48:33.739 --> 00:48:35.739
We thank you for salvation through his name,

00:48:35.739 --> 00:48:37.739
through his blood.

00:48:37.739 --> 00:48:39.739
God, I pray that if there's one here this morning

00:48:39.739 --> 00:48:41.739
that's not sure of heaven,

00:48:41.739 --> 00:48:44.739
God, I pray that today would be the day of their salvation.

00:48:44.739 --> 00:48:47.739
They'd get it settled.

00:48:47.739 --> 00:48:49.739
They would not leave this place without knowing for sure

00:48:49.739 --> 00:48:52.739
that heaven is their home.

00:48:52.739 --> 00:48:55.739
God, I pray for every believer this morning.

00:48:55.739 --> 00:49:01.739
Oh, God, I pray you would help us to beware,

00:49:01.739 --> 00:49:04.739
to recognize the peril of sin.

00:49:04.739 --> 00:49:07.739
Help us to walk with thee and to walk in the light

00:49:07.739 --> 00:49:09.739
as you're in the light.

00:49:09.739 --> 00:49:13.739
Help us, Lord, to rejoice as we remember your protection

00:49:13.739 --> 00:49:15.739
and your provision.

00:49:15.739 --> 00:49:19.739
I pray that you'd help us, Lord, to draw closer to thee.

00:49:19.739 --> 00:49:21.739
Help us to come to that place, as the songwriter said,

00:49:21.739 --> 00:49:25.739
that we truly would let nothing come

00:49:25.739 --> 00:49:28.739
between my soul and my Savior.

00:49:28.739 --> 00:49:30.739
Help us to abide in you.

00:49:30.739 --> 00:49:33.739
Lord, use us for your honor and for your glory.

00:49:33.739 --> 00:49:37.739
I pray that you'd work in hearts and lives as only you can

00:49:37.739 --> 00:49:40.739
as we have opportunity to respond to you this morning.

00:49:40.739 --> 00:49:44.739
I pray that every decision that is made would be honoring

00:49:44.739 --> 00:49:46.739
and glorifying to thee.

00:49:46.739 --> 00:49:47.739
We'll thank you for it.

00:49:47.739 --> 00:49:49.739
Would you stand with me?
