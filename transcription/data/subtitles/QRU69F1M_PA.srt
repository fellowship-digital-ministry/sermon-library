1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
here, and I thought it appropriate this evening to review this passage of Scripture. I'm

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,960
thankful, as I've often said over the years, that God's Word all at the same time will

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:21,680
convict us, it will comfort us, and it'll correct us, change us. I'm so thankful for

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,120
the power of God's Word. The Bible, we often say as Baptist people, the Bible is our sole

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:34,520
authority for faith and practice, and that is so vital, and it's important that we understand

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:40,560
this evening that it's the Lord that established the local church, it's the Lord who has provided

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,919
for us in His precious Word the instruction that we need with regard to how the church

8
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:53,799
is to function, and how's the church supposed to operate, and we could ask questions this

9
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:59,799
evening, perhaps some have been asked these questions by others, why is the church structured

10
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:04,120
the way that it is? Well, we ought to be able to go to God's Word, and we ought to be able

11
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:10,959
to describe from the pages of this precious book that the Lord is the head of the church.

12
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:18,360
Amen? It is His church, He's the head of it, and He has ordained that there would be pastors.

13
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,319
It's an office that He's established, the office of a pastor, a bishop, the words used

14
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:28,839
interchangeably, of course, dealing with a little bit different aspect of that same office,

15
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:33,440
but we find the office of the pastor. Then we say, well, why do we have deacons? Well,

16
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,480
because the Bible says that you ought to have deacons, and there are qualifications. Someone

17
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,319
says, I want to be a pastor. Okay, well, there are qualifications that God gives in His Word,

18
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:49,080
with being a deacon. We find those truths in the pages of Scripture. There's a problem

19
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,000
in America right now, there's some large Southern Baptist churches actually that are ordaining

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,959
women to be pastors, and there's some people that say, well, you know, it's the 21st century,

21
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:04,319
and so on and so forth. Well, God's Word is settled forever, and God said that if a man

22
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,320
desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good thing, and one of the requirements

23
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,320
is that he be the husband of one wife. And for a long time, we were able to say, that's

24
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:21,320
possible only for a man to be the husband of one wife, and no matter what our society

25
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:27,320
would say about redefining terms, it is still only a male that can be the husband of one

26
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:33,320
wife. And so we find that the Bible gives us the answers for how the church is established

27
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,320
and how it is structured, and why do we operate the way that we operate. We could ask the

28
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:45,320
question, what is the purpose of the church? Why do we gather together? What's the purpose?

29
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:51,320
And we understand that our purpose is to glorify God, and we're to lift up the Lord Jesus Christ

30
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,320
and exalt Him. We understand the importance of edifying one another. You read through

31
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,320
the New Testament, and you see all of the instruction that God gives to His disciples

32
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:06,320
and you see all of the instruction that God gives with regard to one another commands.

33
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,320
And then we could ask this question that's pertinent to our subject this evening, why

34
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:17,320
is it that we observe the Lord's Supper? Why do we observe the Lord's Supper? And we find

35
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:25,320
that it's not because of tradition, it's not because of some religious father, forefathers,

36
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:31,320
and so on and so forth. No, it's because God has established that the local church

37
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,320
should observe the Lord's Supper. We find that the Lord's Supper was instituted by the

38
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,320
Lord Jesus Christ before His crucifixion. And we can read of that in the gospel accounts

39
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,320
and we understand that He instituted it. And then as we look to the New Testament, we find

40
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:53,320
that God provides instruction to the churches with regard to the observance of the Lord's

41
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,320
Supper. I believe this evening that this passage here in 1 Corinthians 11, which is

42
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:03,320
written to the local church there at Corinth, is probably the most complete teaching on

43
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:08,320
the subject that is before us with regard to the Lord's Supper that you're going to

44
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,320
find within the New Testament. It's interesting and it's worth noting that this instruction

45
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:19,320
that is provided to the church at Corinth in 1 Corinthians 11, this instruction is given

46
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,320
in order to correct the way in which they were observing the Lord's Supper. They weren't

47
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,320
doing it properly and so therefore God provides them with instruction. He's correcting that

48
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:37,320
which they were doing that was incorrect. In fact, in verse 17 and again in verse 22,

49
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:44,320
you will see the phrase where the Bible says, I praise you not. They weren't doing the

50
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,320
things that they were supposed to or they weren't observing it the way that they were

51
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:53,320
supposed to. So we pick it up in verse number 23 and the Bible says this, for I have received

52
00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:00,320
of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you. I'm thankful that the Apostle Paul,

53
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,320
as he's writing to this local church, of course we understand that all Scripture is given

54
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,320
by inspiration of God, but Paul isn't just sitting there saying, well let me give you

55
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,320
my opinion on how this is supposed to work and this is probably the most practical way.

56
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,320
No, he says, I'm telling you I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you.

57
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,320
Notice he says that the Lord Jesus, the same night which he was betrayed, took bread.

58
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,320
So what's he referring back to is referring back to as we would study in the gospel records

59
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,320
where this, the Lord's Supper, was instituted by Christ before his crucifixion.

60
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Verse 24, when he had given thanks, he break it, that bread, and said,

61
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:49,320
take ye, this is my body which is broken for you, this do in remembrance of me.

62
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,320
After the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped, saying, this cup is the

63
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:59,320
New Testament in my blood, this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.

64
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:05,320
We've seen in verse number 24 and again in verse number 25 that phrase of in remembrance of me.

65
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,320
In verse number 26 the Bible says for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup

66
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,320
you do show the Lord's death till he come.

67
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,320
I can't tell you how many times I've been asked over the years is how often are we supposed

68
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,320
to observe the Lord's Supper.

69
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,320
Well, the Bible just says as often as you do and there is no prescribed time frame

70
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,320
in which you are to do to observe the Lord's Supper and so you'll find that there are churches

71
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,320
that observe it on varying schedules and calendars and what have you.

72
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,320
But we find that the instruction is for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup

73
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,320
you do show the Lord's death till he come.

74
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,320
Notice verse 27, wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord

75
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:54,320
unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.

76
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
See, this is exactly what the church was doing in Corinth.

77
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,320
They were not approaching the Lord's table in a reverent manner in the manner in which

78
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
they were supposed to.

79
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:08,320
And so Paul is dealing with them and he's saying that you've eaten this, you're unworthy

80
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,320
in your approach and he says that you're guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.

81
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,320
Notice, but let a man examine himself.

82
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,320
And so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh

83
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:26,320
unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body.

84
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,320
For this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep.

85
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,320
For if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are

86
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,320
chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world.

87
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,320
It's important by way of introduction that we understand this evening that this instruction

88
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,320
with regard to the Lord's Supper is written to the local church.

89
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:53,320
We'd understand this evening that the local church is made up of individuals that are

90
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,320
saved and baptized.

91
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,320
So I become a member of a church.

92
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,320
You know, I have somebody come and say, hey, I want to join the church.

93
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,320
Okay, that's wonderful.

94
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,320
First, talk to me about when you got saved.

95
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,320
Why?

96
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,320
Well, because church membership requires, the prerequisite for church membership is

97
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,320
that you're saved and that you're scripturally baptized.

98
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,320
And so we find that he is writing here, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

99
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,320
he's writing to a church that's made up of believers.

100
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,320
So we understand that the Lord's Supper is for God's people.

101
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,320
The Lord's Supper is not for everyone.

102
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,320
The Lord's Supper is not for lost people.

103
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
Amen?

104
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
The Lord's Supper is for saved people.

105
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,320
And not only is the Lord's Supper for saved people, it's not for lost people, but we'd

106
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,320
also say this, that the Lord's Supper is a memorial.

107
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,320
It cannot save you.

108
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,320
It cannot, there's no extra grace.

109
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,320
There's nothing that happens to these elements when we pray here in just a little while and

110
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,320
all that takes place, no, they still remain the same elements that they are, but they're

111
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
a picture, they're a memorial.

112
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,320
Jesus said, this is my body when he took that bread, and he said, take, eat, this is my

113
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,320
body, which is broken for you, this do in remembrance of me.

114
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,320
Then when he speaks about the cup, he says, this cup is the New Testament in my blood,

115
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,320
this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.

116
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,320
And so we understand this evening, we speak about the Lord's Supper, the Lord's table,

117
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,320
that there's no saving grace in these elements.

118
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,320
There's no ability for these elements to do anything to help you get to heaven.

119
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,320
That's all been settled at Calvary.

120
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
Amen.

121
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,320
I'm thankful for the finished work of Christ at Calvary, the death, burial, and glorious

122
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,320
resurrection of our Savior.

123
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,320
And we understand this evening that this is a memorial.

124
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,320
It's a picture.

125
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
It's important.

126
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
It's necessary.

127
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,320
We find that there are two ordinances that God has given us as New Testament churches.

128
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
One, the Lord's Supper.

129
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
The other is baptism.

130
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Isn't it interesting that both of them remind us of the...

131
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,280
death, burial, and resurrection of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

132
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,160
Why? Because without that truth we have nothing.

133
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,360
If Christ did not... somebody asked this question during Easter.

134
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,360
A question was posed to a number of people and I was one of them.

135
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,760
What's more important, Christmas or Easter? And I said the answer is yes.

136
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,360
Listen, if he wasn't born he couldn't die.

137
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,640
Right? He was born to die. If he didn't die he couldn't rise.

138
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,480
Right? They're all... they're equally necessary.

139
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,160
And in God's infinite wisdom he sent forth his Son, born of a virgin,

140
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,360
for what purpose? To redeem mankind.

141
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,880
And both of the ordinances that the Lord has given to the local church remind us

142
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,160
of that which is so important to our faith,

143
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,680
the death, burial, and resurrection. It is our faith.

144
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,560
And we find this evening that this do in remembrance of me.

145
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,880
So we're going to think about the Lord's Supper, the Lord's Table,

146
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,240
as we observe it this evening. Just a few thoughts for you tonight.

147
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,000
Number one, if you are taking notes, it is a time to remember.

148
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,480
It's a time to remember. I started to use the word reflect

149
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,080
and I think that it could be an appropriate word as well.

150
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,560
But I think about the word remember and the context in which we find in the Old Testament

151
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,160
where so often the people of God were given this bit of instruction of

152
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,480
beware lest thou forget. And we find over and over,

153
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,440
as you would look at the nation of Israel, the children of Israel,

154
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,880
how that they would receive that reminder that they would beware lest they forget.

155
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,800
And then you would find the indictment that is brought against the children of Israel

156
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,400
where they're told that you have forgotten God days without number.

157
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,120
Begin to think about this truth of a time to remember.

158
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:06,200
So often in our society today things go so quickly and our pace of life is so rapid

159
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,880
and there's just our schedules are so packed and I understand how busy it is.

160
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:18,840
We think about this truth of Psalms where the psalmist says be still and know that I'm God.

161
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,720
And I think about the Lord's Supper provides for us a time to remember.

162
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,960
A time to remember what? Well, I believe that what we would remember

163
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,600
is the greatest sacrifice that it was ever made. Sometimes we talk about sacrifice.

164
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,200
In fact, there are times in which people will speak about those that are servants of the Lord

165
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,520
and they'll speak about their sacrifice of service or duty.

166
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,760
There's a preacher of yesteryear that said,

167
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,600
do not call my duty for God's service, it's but a privilege.

168
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,320
What a great perspective. But there are some that use that term sacrifice

169
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,800
and I would say that the greatest sacrifice of all time, of all of the history of humankind,

170
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,200
the greatest sacrifice is when the Lord Jesus Christ went up a hill called Calvary.

171
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,440
When God in flesh took your place and my place on the cross, it's the greatest sacrifice.

172
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:19,080
And I'm so thankful that this, the Lord's Supper, gives us an opportunity to remember

173
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,120
what he did for us. I would say this evening that that greatest sacrifice was a sacrifice

174
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:30,120
that was motivated by love. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son,

175
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,480
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life,

176
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,280
whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.

177
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:43,400
And this greatest sacrifice was motivated by love and I'm thankful for his great love.

178
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:50,920
This evening we read in verses 24 and 25 how that we remember that great sacrifice.

179
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,600
Notice the Bible says, and when he had given thanks, he break it and said,

180
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,400
take, eat, notice this is my body which is broken for you.

181
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:07,160
You see the personal aspect, it was broken for you. I'm thankful that the Lord Jesus Christ was

182
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:15,880
willing to endure such pain and suffering. It says that his body was broken for you.

183
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,480
We understand that his bones were not broken. You can read of the prophecy in the Psalms about not

184
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,920
a bone being broken, but they were out of joint and we can see the great suffering in how his

185
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,960
body, you think about the cat of nine tails and how they would whip him and they buffeted him and

186
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:37,240
all that they did and he says, this is my body which is broken for you. And then he speaks about

187
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:43,640
the blood. As Baptists we've often said it's the book, the blood and the blessed hope. And I'm so

188
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:49,000
thankful for the blood of Christ. And he says in verse 25, and after the same manner also he took

189
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,559
the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood, this do you as

190
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:59,640
often as you drink it in remembrance of me. Listen, without the shedding of blood there is no remission.

191
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,679
That's what God says in the book of Hebrews. And the blood is absolutely necessary. The blood is

192
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:09,559
the only way to have forgiveness. You know that there are some modern translations that take the

193
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:15,720
blood out of the scriptures. A passage of scripture, you don't need to turn there, that's so

194
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,720
vital and so important that we'd understand the teaching of forgiveness and reconciliation.

195
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,559
Colossians in chapter number 1 and verse number 14, the Bible says in whom we have redemption

196
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:36,520
through his blood even the forgiveness of sins. What a powerful verse of scripture. What a

197
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:42,119
simple truth of God's word but how powerful it is. And yet we find that many of the modern

198
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:47,720
translations today, you know what they take out of that verse of scripture? Through his blood.

199
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,679
There's no way to have redemption or forgiveness if there's no mention of the blood.

200
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,679
Without the shedding of blood there is no remission. We find that as we observe the

201
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:05,960
Lord's table, this opportunity for us to have a time to remember, to remember the great price

202
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:17,000
that was paid for our salvation. Listen, salvation is a free gift for us. It cost our Savior everything.

203
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:24,839
You think about buying a gift for someone and you buy a gift for them, they give you the gift,

204
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:30,760
you're the recipient of a gift, it didn't cost you anything. But it cost the individual that gave you

205
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:37,800
that gift a certain sum of money. We find that as we think of this gift, it did not cost money,

206
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:44,360
it was not purchased with gold and silver, with corruptible things. But according to what Peter

207
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:51,320
says, we find that it was paid for, it was purchased with the precious blood of Christ.

208
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:57,240
No wonder that John, he says, John the Baptist as he sees Jesus,

209
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:06,440
behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world. This greatest sacrifice was

210
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:12,920
motivated by love but this greatest sacrifice results in reconciliation. It's a wonderful thing

211
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:20,040
to be reconciled to God. We're in enmity with God, we were separated from God, we were His enemies,

212
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:25,480
we could not approach God but because of Jesus, because of what He did on that cross,

213
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:35,399
He offers that forgiveness. That which was not possible of our own merit, of our own work,

214
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:41,000
is now possible through the blood of Christ, reconciled, that work of reconciliation.

215
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:47,559
What a blessing. The Lord's Table gives us an opportunity for a time to remember. I would say

216
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:52,760
number two this evening, if you're taking notes, a time not only to remember but a time to rejoice.

217
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,480
Time to rejoice. I'm so thankful that Jesus was willing to go to that cross. Aren't you? I mean,

218
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,119
we ought to rejoice greatly for the great salvation that we have through Jesus Christ.

219
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:09,960
What a blessing to know that He was willing and He went to the cruel cross, He paid the

220
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:17,640
awful price, the awful penalty so that we could be redeemed and we rejoice in the finished work

221
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:28,520
of Christ. He said on the cross, it is finished. Hallelujah. What a blessing. I hope that regularly

222
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:38,039
in your life that you rejoice to know that you're saved. You rejoice in remembering what Christ did

223
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:44,600
for you on the cross of Calvary. I would say this evening that not only would it be a time to rejoice

224
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,640
because of the finished work of Christ at Calvary, but we'd find from verse number 26, continue

225
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,200
reading with me there in 1 Corinthians 11, the Bible says for as often as you eat this bread

226
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:04,119
and drink this cup, notice ye do show the Lord's death till He come. I hope that you're rejoicing

227
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:08,280
in that wonderful promise. We say that we rejoice because of the finished work of Christ

228
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:15,000
and we should rejoice because of the future coming of Christ. It says that ye do show His death

229
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,119
till He come. I don't know when He's going to come, but I know He's coming. Amen? I don't know

230
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:29,880
the date nor the hour and neither do you. No man does, but we can rest assured that God always does

231
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,280
what He says He's going to do. And we find that He gave that wonderful promise that He's coming

232
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:40,760
again and He wants the church to be reminded that time of remembrance, that time of reflection.

233
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:46,840
He wants us to rejoice in understanding that He finished, He completed the work for our redemption

234
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:52,919
there at the cross of Calvary, but He wants us to understand and to rejoice in His future coming.

235
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,760
You think about the motivation of the coming of Christ, the promise of His coming and what it

236
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,239
should do.

237
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:06,519
in the life of a believer and how it should motivate us to live for Jesus every single day.

238
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:13,359
We'd live with that awareness, that understanding that today could be the day.

239
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:20,779
The reality is that we understand that the Bible teaches that there's the imminent return of the Lord Jesus Christ,

240
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:23,779
that the rapture could take place at any moment.

241
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:29,479
But the Bible also teaches, as I mentioned this morning, that our life is but a vapor

242
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:34,019
that appears for a little time and then vanisheth away.

243
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:37,859
And so really there are two factors that we should consider every single day.

244
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:39,979
Number one, Jesus could come back.

245
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:46,319
Number two, I could take my final breath and depart this world in death every single day.

246
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:55,239
Those two truths are great motivators for God's people to live every day for His honor and for His glory.

247
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:58,479
Because what if today were the last day?

248
00:20:58,479 --> 00:21:03,739
What if you knew that today was the last day you'd ever live upon this earth?

249
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:06,199
What is it that you would do?

250
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:12,659
There are people that receive medical diagnosis of cancer and various ailments and what have you,

251
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:19,079
and doctors will give estimates with regard to how much time they believe they would have to live upon this earth.

252
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:22,659
And they begin to talk, and you've heard the term, I've heard the term.

253
00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:31,539
People talk about having a bucket list, a list of things they'd like to do while they have time here upon this earth.

254
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:40,499
So many of the things that would fill people's bucket lists for God's people are not even things that we should really even...

255
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:46,039
I mean, they don't take that priority, that level of importance.

256
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:50,259
See, this evening, Jesus is coming again.

257
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:52,259
I'm rejoicing in that truth.

258
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:58,259
Jesus said, I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also.

259
00:21:58,259 --> 00:21:59,259
Listen for the trumpet.

260
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:02,039
The songwriter said, Jesus is coming.

261
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:07,839
And 1 John 3 says it this way.

262
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:16,179
I think about John writing, and John had heard that wonderful promise of Jesus when he said, I will come again.

263
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:22,179
And in 1 John 3, John the Apostle, he says this in verse number 1,

264
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:28,179
Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.

265
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:34,179
Therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not, beloved, now are we the sons of God.

266
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,519
Notice in verse 2, it says, And it doth not yet appear what we shall be,

267
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:46,519
but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.

268
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:52,519
It's interesting, I'll read verse number 3 in just a moment, but if you were to go back to verse number 28 of chapter number 2

269
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:58,519
and notice this truth that is given, he says, And now, little children, abide in him.

270
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:01,519
We just sang a song about abiding.

271
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:09,859
That when he shall appear, not if he shall appear, it's a certain truth, it's a fact to be understood.

272
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:15,859
When he shall appear, we may have confidence, and notice what it says,

273
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:22,859
and not be ashamed before him it is coming.

274
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:28,859
You know, I believe, certainly possible, likely,

275
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:35,199
that there will be some of God's people that are going to be ashamed at the appearing of Jesus Christ.

276
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:39,199
I don't want to be in that company. I really don't.

277
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:45,199
And he says, in verse number 3 of chapter number 3, when he talks about, again, he said in verse number 2,

278
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:50,199
when he shall appear, we see that in verse 28 of chapter 2, and now he says in chapter 3, in verse number 3,

279
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:54,199
And every man that hath this hope in him.

280
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:58,539
We're talking about the book, the blood, and the blessed hope,

281
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:01,539
and he says, every man that hath this hope in him.

282
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:11,539
Remember, hope, biblically speaking, the biblical definition of hope is that confident expectation.

283
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:14,539
It's not the hope that the world talks about.

284
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:17,539
I hope this is going to happen. I hope I get this, or I hope this.

285
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,539
No, no, no. This is confident expectation.

286
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:30,539
Every man that hath this hope in him, notice what it says, purifieth himself, even as he is pure.

287
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:34,539
We know that he is holy. He is pure.

288
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,539
We find that we are to purify ourselves.

289
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:41,539
We find that the Bible teaches us, the Bible says this, that we are to be holy. Why?

290
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:44,539
For he is holy. Be holy, for I am holy.

291
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:49,539
That's what the Lord says in all manner of conversation.

292
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:52,539
We see that there's a time to remember, a time to rejoice,

293
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:57,539
and oh, how we should rejoice greatly when we partake of the Lord's Supper,

294
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:01,539
reminded of the finished work of Christ,

295
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:07,539
reminded of the future coming of Christ, and it causes the people of God to rejoice greatly.

296
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:14,539
But I would say number three this evening, not only a time to remember, a time to rejoice,

297
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:18,539
but I would say it's a time to repent. A time to repent.

298
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:21,539
This is what the Bible says in verse number 27.

299
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:25,539
Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily

300
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:28,539
shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.

301
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:32,539
If you were to go back into verse number 17 of this chapter, you'd note that the Bible says,

302
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:36,539
Now in this that I declare unto you, I praise you not,

303
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:40,539
that ye come together, not for the better, but for the worse.

304
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:44,539
He's talking about what they were doing, what their behavior was,

305
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:48,539
and he's saying, I praise you not, you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing,

306
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:50,539
so he's going to correct them. Notice in verse 18,

307
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:53,539
For first of all, when ye come together in the church,

308
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:57,539
I hear that there be divisions among you, and I partly believe it.

309
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:00,539
For there must be also heresies among you,

310
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:04,539
that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.

311
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:08,539
When ye come together, therefore, into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's Supper.

312
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:11,539
For in eating everyone taketh before other his own supper,

313
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:14,539
and one is hungry, and another is drunken. What?

314
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:17,539
Have ye not houses to eat and to drink in?

315
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:21,539
Or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not?

316
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:27,539
What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.

317
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:30,539
And so then he says in verse number 27, when he's giving this instruction,

318
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:34,539
Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily,

319
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:37,539
shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.

320
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:39,539
This is a serious matter.

321
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:41,539
It's not something to take lightly.

322
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:43,539
It's time to repent.

323
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:45,539
Notice he says this in verse 28,

324
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:48,539
But let a man examine himself.

325
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:50,539
Let a man examine himself.

326
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:58,539
And so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.

327
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:00,539
As we look at this passage of Scripture,

328
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:03,539
we find that this idea of this time to repent,

329
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,539
or to not partake unworthily,

330
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:08,539
and so what is the remedy?

331
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:11,539
He says that we're to let a man examine himself.

332
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:14,539
Self-examination is necessary. It's important.

333
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:19,539
I would say it's a missing practice in many of our lives.

334
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:23,539
We find that the Bible teaches this truth of self-examination,

335
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:29,539
and it's so imperative that we get and we understand and grasp this teaching

336
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:31,539
that we would examine ourselves.

337
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:33,539
I've often said this over the years,

338
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:37,539
Self-examination is going to require honesty.

339
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:40,539
It's going to require honesty.

340
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:43,539
Self-examination is going to require humility.

341
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:46,539
Listen, I had lunch with a man on Friday,

342
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:50,539
a man that our families prayed for the whole month of April.

343
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:51,539
Love thy neighbor.

344
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:54,539
I've tried to encourage you to pray for or choose a neighbor.

345
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,539
Prayed for their family the entire month of April.

346
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:59,539
Had lunch with him on Friday

347
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:02,539
for the purpose of sharing the Gospel with them.

348
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:04,539
He's a different world religion, doesn't matter.

349
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:06,539
Sharing the Gospel with them, trying to give them the truth.

350
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:07,539
Here's what he said to me.

351
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:09,539
He looked at me and this is what he said.

352
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:12,539
I'm better than 90% of the people in the world.

353
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:14,539
That's what he said.

354
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:17,539
That's what he said.

355
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:20,539
Self-examination requires humility.

356
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:22,539
Requires honesty.

357
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:23,539
And here's the reality.

358
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:25,539
It doesn't matter if you're better than everybody

359
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:27,539
that you can think about all the people.

360
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,539
And you know who we like to compare ourselves to?

361
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:32,539
The real bad people.

362
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:33,539
You know how many people have told me over the years

363
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:35,539
I've never killed anybody?

364
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:36,539
Seriously.

365
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:38,539
You start asking people if they know for sure

366
00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:40,539
they're going to go to heaven when they die.

367
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:43,539
Because the common thought amongst people

368
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:45,539
is that, well, if I'm better than others,

369
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:48,539
if my good is more than my bad.

370
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,539
I've had countless number of people say,

371
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:52,539
I've never killed anybody.

372
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:53,539
You know what I say?

373
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:54,539
Well, that's good.

374
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:58,539
I'm glad.

375
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:01,539
But the standard is Jesus.

376
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,539
And he's perfect.

377
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:04,539
He's perfect.

378
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:07,539
But let a man examine himself.

379
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:10,539
Listen, this process of self-examination

380
00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:13,539
requires honesty and humility.

381
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:16,539
It's an important process.

382
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:18,539
We could call it a discipline this evening

383
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:20,539
and we could think about this discipline

384
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:24,539
or this process and this self-examination.

385
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:26,539
Understanding that one day we're going to stand

386
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:30,539
before the judge of all the earth.

387
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:32,539
We find that the Bible says,

388
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:34,539
but let a man examine himself

389
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:38,539
and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.

390
00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:41,539
So as we understand contextually what's taking place,

391
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:44,539
he's saying, listen, you're not doing things right.

392
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:45,539
I praise you not.

393
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:48,539
So here's the instruction for how you do it.

394
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,539
Don't partake of it unworthily.

395
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:54,539
And the way that you prevent partaking of it unworthily

396
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:56,539
is to examine yourself.

397
00:29:56,539 --> 00:29:59,539
Then he says, but let a man examine himself.

398
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:03,539
examine themselves, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup." So what's

399
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:09,019
the process? Well, the process is not to say, well, I'm unworthy so I'm not going to partake.

400
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:14,179
That's why I've titled it, given the third point here, that it's a time to repent. A

401
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:19,419
time to repent. Listen, when we examine ourselves and we get alone with God and we say as the

402
00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:30,839
psalmist said, search me, O God. Show me if there be any wicked way in me. God's going

403
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:36,559
to point out some things in our lives. You know why? We all got this flesh. There's not

404
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:44,659
one of us tonight that's perfect. Not one of us. There's sins of omission, there's sins

405
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:52,279
of commission. You know how easy, listen, the Bible says what's not a faith is sin.

406
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:59,379
How many times we can sin with our tongue? Tongue's a little member. Oh, it causes so

407
00:30:59,379 --> 00:31:07,659
many problems, James chapter number 3. Right? Be angry and sin not. I shared that verse

408
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:13,559
last Sunday night. Jesus, the Son of God, God in flesh, he was angry, he didn't sin,

409
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:18,639
but the problem is that many of us, we don't really know how to do that. Many times our

410
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:25,719
anger turns into sinful behavior. This evening, this idea of let a man examine himself, the

411
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:31,279
purpose I would say of self-examination is repentance. That we would get that thing right,

412
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:36,239
that we would have that, as the songwriter said, there's nothing between my soul and

413
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:42,039
my Savior. That we would be in that place of that self-examination. He says, so let

414
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:46,799
him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. Notice what he says in verse 29, for he that

415
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:51,759
eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning

416
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:58,319
the Lord's body. And if you look within context here, it's interesting because the damnation

417
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:03,199
to himself that's mentioned in verse number 29, it's given further explanation I believe

418
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:08,919
in verse number 32 when the Bible says that when we are judged, we are chastened of the

419
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:14,239
Lord. Again, the truth that we find in this passage of Scripture that this Lord's table,

420
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:18,839
the Lord's supper is for God's people, it's not for lost people, it's for saved people.

421
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:25,759
And here's what God said, for whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth. Listen, we ought to

422
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:33,079
thank God when He chastens us. You know why? It's a birthmark of belonging to Jesus. Because

423
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:39,879
He says, if He doesn't chasten you, then you don't belong to Him. And so guess what?

424
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:48,639
Our good Heavenly Father does. Sometimes He has to correct us. He chastens us. We find

425
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:54,919
here that He says that that individual, that believer that is eating and drinking unworthily,

426
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:58,879
he's eating and drinking damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. And then Paul

427
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,879
goes on to say, for this cause, because the behavior there in Corinth and the way in which

428
00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:08,999
they were observing the Lord's table, the Lord's supper, the manner that he's speaking of,

429
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:14,359
he says, for this cause, many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep. That word

430
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:19,359
sleep is the same way that Jesus used it speaking about Lazarus. Remember He said to the disciples,

431
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:23,479
he's asleep. And, well, if he's asleep, I mean, let him be. And Jesus said, he's dead.

432
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:32,799
So, He says here, listen, every sickness in the life of a believer is not chastening. It's

433
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:37,279
important for us to understand that. Every sickness is not chastening. But you know what

434
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:44,999
happens in my life? If I got some sickness going on, I'm, Lord, self-examination time. It's a good

435
00:33:44,999 --> 00:33:50,399
practice. Lord, is there something I, are you chastening me? Is there something I need to,

436
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:55,719
but when we understand this truth of chastening, He says, for many are sick, weak, excuse me,

437
00:33:55,719 --> 00:33:59,599
and sickly among you and many sleep. Then He says this, if we would judge ourselves,

438
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:04,679
we should not be judged. For when we are judged, we are chastened to the Lord that we should not

439
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:09,359
be condemned with the world. So, we would understand this evening as we've titled this

440
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,439
point a time to repent, where to not eat unworthily, the process of self-examination leads us to

441
00:34:15,439 --> 00:34:20,679
repentance. Listen, when we get alone with God and we go through that process of self-examination,

442
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:24,759
Lord, search me, show me if there'd be any wicked way in me. When God shows it to us,

443
00:34:24,759 --> 00:34:31,559
guess what? We confess it. We confess it. He that covereth his sin, the Bible says,

444
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:41,239
shall not prosper. By the way, who knows about your sin? God. Right? No one's ever pulled

445
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:54,559
anything over on God. Right? Adam, where are you? Did God know where he was? Sure He

446
00:34:54,559 --> 00:35:01,359
did. Did God know why He had the leaves on? Sure He did. Adam wasn't hiding anything from

447
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:08,319
God. He hid from God, but God knew all about it. We could speak of so many examples. Achan,

448
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:16,199
the one that troubleth Israel, he hid some things, but God systematically brought Achan

449
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:23,279
to the very forefront of Joshua to see who it was that was the troubler of Israel. You

450
00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:26,159
could go on and on. You can look through the pages of Scripture. Listen, God knows about

451
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:31,719
our sin. Sometimes people think, well, nobody else knows about this. He that covereth his

452
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:38,439
sin shall not prosper, but whoso confesseth and forsaketh shall, they shall have forgiveness.

453
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:42,759
The Bible says in 1 John chapter 1 and verse number 9, the Bible says that if we confess

454
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:47,839
our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

455
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:54,439
That's a wonderful promise of God's Word. What a wonderful promise. This evening, listen,

456
00:35:54,439 --> 00:36:01,719
it's foolish, it's foolish to try to hide our sin. We can't do it. The Word is that

457
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:07,719
they should have mercy. Aren't you thankful for God's mercy? God's mercy. He that covereth

458
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:14,279
his sin shall not prosper, but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them, his sin, shall have mercy.

459
00:36:14,279 --> 00:36:20,479
Listen, our God is a merciful God. He's a gracious God. He's a God that is described

460
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:29,919
this way. He is ready to pardon. He is ready to forgive. So if I have sin in my life, this

461
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:34,119
evening if you have sin in your life, we think about this Lord's Supper, this Lord's table.

462
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:40,519
It's a time to repent. Get right with God. I want nothing between my soul and my Savior.

463
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:51,199
I want to be right with God. The Lord's Supper is a precious time for believers. A time to

464
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:58,399
remember, to remember of the greatest sacrifice that was motivated by love that results in

465
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:04,199
reconciliation. That great sacrifice. What an important thing that we remember what Christ

466
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:11,319
did for us. The time to rejoice. I hope tonight that you rejoice in the finished work of Christ.

467
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:17,479
I hope tonight that you rejoice in the future coming of Christ. He's coming again. Oh how

468
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:22,639
that wonderful truth should motivate us daily to live for Him, to serve Him every day of

469
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:32,679
our lives. But it's a time to repent. Time to repent. God, search me. Show me. Reveal

470
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:37,239
in my life. Uncover those things in my life where I've sinned, where I need to get it

471
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:43,919
right with You, Lord. Help me not to have a hard heart. I close with this thought from

472
00:37:43,919 --> 00:37:49,439
the Apostle Paul as he's standing and giving defense before Felix in Acts 24. In verse

473
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:56,279
number 16, the Bible says that he, Paul, says this, and herein do I exercise myself to have

474
00:37:56,279 --> 00:38:07,479
always a conscience void of offense toward God and toward men. He says, I exercise myself.

475
00:38:07,479 --> 00:38:12,119
I'm laboring. I'm striving. For what purpose to have always a conscience that is void of

476
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:18,959
offense? I don't believe Paul wanted to have sin in his life. He wanted to be clean. He

477
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:22,199
understood, oh, wretched man that I am. I mean, he understood that he still had the

478
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:29,359
flesh. But he says, I die daily. I'm crucified with Christ. Why did God use Paul the way

479
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:33,000
that He did? Well, there's so many answers to that question, but I believe that this

480
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:41,159
is one of them, that he sought to walk and live a clean life, pure in the eyes of God.

481
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:46,079
This evening is a time to repent. I don't know what you have to repent of, but I know

482
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:52,519
that we're all sinners. I know that we all ought to say, God, search me, show me, help

483
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:59,839
me, Lord, to honestly, humbly evaluate, examine my life. God, as you show me, I'm so thankful

484
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:04,279
that you're a God who's gracious and merciful and ready to pardon. I can get that right

485
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:09,479
with you, Lord. I can have forgiveness because we're going to partake of the Lord's Supper

486
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:16,039
and I want to do it with joy. I want to do it with that rejoicing and that remembering.

487
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:22,839
Why? Because I've done that process of repenting and preparing my heart to be able to partake

488
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:28,079
of the Lord's Table. Let's pray together. Father, we love you. How we thank you for

489
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,599
loving us. We thank you for the precious Word of God. We thank you for the instruction that

490
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:40,000
you provide us with in your Word regarding the Christian life and the church and the

491
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Lord's Supper. God, I pray that as we have a moment of invitation, as we proceed into

492
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,519
the next phase of our service of observing the Lord's Supper, I pray, God, that you'd

493
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:55,880
help us to examine ourselves. I pray that we do business with you, Lord. I pray that

494
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,599
as we would have this time of examination, perhaps…

495
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,999
Perhaps there'd be some that would come to this old-fashioned altar, maybe we'd make

496
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:05,419
our own pew and altar.

497
00:40:05,419 --> 00:40:08,199
God help us.

498
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:11,799
Help us, Lord, to have this time of examination.

499
00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:14,159
Help us to be right with you, Lord.

500
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:17,279
I pray that you'd use us, Lord, for honor and for your glory.

501
00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:24,319
Help us to rejoice as we remember what you've done for us to provide us with salvation full

502
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:25,959
and free.

503
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:29,919
Thank you for the promise that you're soon going to come again, pray that you'd help

504
00:40:29,919 --> 00:40:31,439
us to be found faithful.

505
00:40:31,439 --> 00:40:36,359
Lord, would you move and work in hearts and lives as only you can.

506
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:37,359
We'll thank you for it.

507
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,319
In Christ's name we pray, this evening.
