WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
here, and I thought it appropriate this evening to review this passage of Scripture. I'm

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.960
thankful, as I've often said over the years, that God's Word all at the same time will

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:21.680
convict us, it will comfort us, and it'll correct us, change us. I'm so thankful for

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.120
the power of God's Word. The Bible, we often say as Baptist people, the Bible is our sole

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:34.520
authority for faith and practice, and that is so vital, and it's important that we understand

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.560
this evening that it's the Lord that established the local church, it's the Lord who has provided

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.919
for us in His precious Word the instruction that we need with regard to how the church

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:53.799
is to function, and how's the church supposed to operate, and we could ask questions this

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:59.799
evening, perhaps some have been asked these questions by others, why is the church structured

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:04.120
the way that it is? Well, we ought to be able to go to God's Word, and we ought to be able

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.959
to describe from the pages of this precious book that the Lord is the head of the church.

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:18.360
Amen? It is His church, He's the head of it, and He has ordained that there would be pastors.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.319
It's an office that He's established, the office of a pastor, a bishop, the words used

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:28.839
interchangeably, of course, dealing with a little bit different aspect of that same office,

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:33.440
but we find the office of the pastor. Then we say, well, why do we have deacons? Well,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.480
because the Bible says that you ought to have deacons, and there are qualifications. Someone

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.319
says, I want to be a pastor. Okay, well, there are qualifications that God gives in His Word,

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:49.080
with being a deacon. We find those truths in the pages of Scripture. There's a problem

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.000
in America right now, there's some large Southern Baptist churches actually that are ordaining

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.959
women to be pastors, and there's some people that say, well, you know, it's the 21st century,

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:04.319
and so on and so forth. Well, God's Word is settled forever, and God said that if a man

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:09.320
desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good thing, and one of the requirements

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.320
is that he be the husband of one wife. And for a long time, we were able to say, that's

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.320
possible only for a man to be the husband of one wife, and no matter what our society

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.320
would say about redefining terms, it is still only a male that can be the husband of one

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.320
wife. And so we find that the Bible gives us the answers for how the church is established

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.320
and how it is structured, and why do we operate the way that we operate. We could ask the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.320
question, what is the purpose of the church? Why do we gather together? What's the purpose?

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.320
And we understand that our purpose is to glorify God, and we're to lift up the Lord Jesus Christ

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.320
and exalt Him. We understand the importance of edifying one another. You read through

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.320
the New Testament, and you see all of the instruction that God gives to His disciples

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.320
and you see all of the instruction that God gives with regard to one another commands.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.320
And then we could ask this question that's pertinent to our subject this evening, why

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.320
is it that we observe the Lord's Supper? Why do we observe the Lord's Supper? And we find

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:25.320
that it's not because of tradition, it's not because of some religious father, forefathers,

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.320
and so on and so forth. No, it's because God has established that the local church

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.320
should observe the Lord's Supper. We find that the Lord's Supper was instituted by the

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.320
Lord Jesus Christ before His crucifixion. And we can read of that in the gospel accounts

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.320
and we understand that He instituted it. And then as we look to the New Testament, we find

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.320
that God provides instruction to the churches with regard to the observance of the Lord's

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.320
Supper. I believe this evening that this passage here in 1 Corinthians 11, which is

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.320
written to the local church there at Corinth, is probably the most complete teaching on

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.320
the subject that is before us with regard to the Lord's Supper that you're going to

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.320
find within the New Testament. It's interesting and it's worth noting that this instruction

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.320
that is provided to the church at Corinth in 1 Corinthians 11, this instruction is given

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.320
in order to correct the way in which they were observing the Lord's Supper. They weren't

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.320
doing it properly and so therefore God provides them with instruction. He's correcting that

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.320
which they were doing that was incorrect. In fact, in verse 17 and again in verse 22,

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:44.320
you will see the phrase where the Bible says, I praise you not. They weren't doing the

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.320
things that they were supposed to or they weren't observing it the way that they were

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.320
supposed to. So we pick it up in verse number 23 and the Bible says this, for I have received

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:00.320
of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you. I'm thankful that the Apostle Paul,

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.320
as he's writing to this local church, of course we understand that all Scripture is given

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.320
by inspiration of God, but Paul isn't just sitting there saying, well let me give you

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.320
my opinion on how this is supposed to work and this is probably the most practical way.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.320
No, he says, I'm telling you I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.320
Notice he says that the Lord Jesus, the same night which he was betrayed, took bread.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.320
So what's he referring back to is referring back to as we would study in the gospel records

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.320
where this, the Lord's Supper, was instituted by Christ before his crucifixion.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.320
Verse 24, when he had given thanks, he break it, that bread, and said,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:49.320
take ye, this is my body which is broken for you, this do in remembrance of me.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.320
After the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped, saying, this cup is the

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.320
New Testament in my blood, this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.320
We've seen in verse number 24 and again in verse number 25 that phrase of in remembrance of me.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.320
In verse number 26 the Bible says for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.320
you do show the Lord's death till he come.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.320
I can't tell you how many times I've been asked over the years is how often are we supposed

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.320
to observe the Lord's Supper.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:25.320
Well, the Bible just says as often as you do and there is no prescribed time frame

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.320
in which you are to do to observe the Lord's Supper and so you'll find that there are churches

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.320
that observe it on varying schedules and calendars and what have you.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.320
But we find that the instruction is for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.320
you do show the Lord's death till he come.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.320
Notice verse 27, wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:54.320
unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.320
See, this is exactly what the church was doing in Corinth.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.320
They were not approaching the Lord's table in a reverent manner in the manner in which

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.320
they were supposed to.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:08.320
And so Paul is dealing with them and he's saying that you've eaten this, you're unworthy

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.320
in your approach and he says that you're guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.320
Notice, but let a man examine himself.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.320
And so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:26.320
unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.320
For this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.320
For if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.320
chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:44.320
It's important by way of introduction that we understand this evening that this instruction

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.320
with regard to the Lord's Supper is written to the local church.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:53.320
We'd understand this evening that the local church is made up of individuals that are

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.320
saved and baptized.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.320
So I become a member of a church.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.320
You know, I have somebody come and say, hey, I want to join the church.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.320
Okay, that's wonderful.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.320
First, talk to me about when you got saved.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.320
Why?

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.320
Well, because church membership requires, the prerequisite for church membership is

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.320
that you're saved and that you're scripturally baptized.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.320
And so we find that he is writing here, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.320
he's writing to a church that's made up of believers.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.320
So we understand that the Lord's Supper is for God's people.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.320
The Lord's Supper is not for everyone.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.320
The Lord's Supper is not for lost people.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.320
Amen?

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.320
The Lord's Supper is for saved people.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.320
And not only is the Lord's Supper for saved people, it's not for lost people, but we'd

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:44.320
also say this, that the Lord's Supper is a memorial.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.320
It cannot save you.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.320
It cannot, there's no extra grace.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.320
There's nothing that happens to these elements when we pray here in just a little while and

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:58.320
all that takes place, no, they still remain the same elements that they are, but they're

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.320
a picture, they're a memorial.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.320
Jesus said, this is my body when he took that bread, and he said, take, eat, this is my

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.320
body, which is broken for you, this do in remembrance of me.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:14.320
Then when he speaks about the cup, he says, this cup is the New Testament in my blood,

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.320
this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:22.320
And so we understand this evening, we speak about the Lord's Supper, the Lord's table,

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.320
that there's no saving grace in these elements.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.320
There's no ability for these elements to do anything to help you get to heaven.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.320
That's all been settled at Calvary.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.320
Amen.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:39.320
I'm thankful for the finished work of Christ at Calvary, the death, burial, and glorious

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.320
resurrection of our Savior.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.320
And we understand this evening that this is a memorial.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.320
It's a picture.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.320
It's important.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.320
It's necessary.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:52.320
We find that there are two ordinances that God has given us as New Testament churches.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.320
One, the Lord's Supper.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.320
The other is baptism.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.320
Isn't it interesting that both of them remind us of the...

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:04.280
death, burial, and resurrection of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.160
Why? Because without that truth we have nothing.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.360
If Christ did not... somebody asked this question during Easter.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.360
A question was posed to a number of people and I was one of them.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:22.760
What's more important, Christmas or Easter? And I said the answer is yes.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:28.360
Listen, if he wasn't born he couldn't die.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.640
Right? He was born to die. If he didn't die he couldn't rise.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.480
Right? They're all... they're equally necessary.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:43.160
And in God's infinite wisdom he sent forth his Son, born of a virgin,

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.360
for what purpose? To redeem mankind.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:51.880
And both of the ordinances that the Lord has given to the local church remind us

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.160
of that which is so important to our faith,

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.680
the death, burial, and resurrection. It is our faith.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:03.560
And we find this evening that this do in remembrance of me.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.880
So we're going to think about the Lord's Supper, the Lord's Table,

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.240
as we observe it this evening. Just a few thoughts for you tonight.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.000
Number one, if you are taking notes, it is a time to remember.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.480
It's a time to remember. I started to use the word reflect

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.080
and I think that it could be an appropriate word as well.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:27.560
But I think about the word remember and the context in which we find in the Old Testament

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:33.160
where so often the people of God were given this bit of instruction of

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.480
beware lest thou forget. And we find over and over,

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.440
as you would look at the nation of Israel, the children of Israel,

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:47.880
how that they would receive that reminder that they would beware lest they forget.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.800
And then you would find the indictment that is brought against the children of Israel

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.400
where they're told that you have forgotten God days without number.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.120
Begin to think about this truth of a time to remember.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:06.200
So often in our society today things go so quickly and our pace of life is so rapid

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.880
and there's just our schedules are so packed and I understand how busy it is.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:18.840
We think about this truth of Psalms where the psalmist says be still and know that I'm God.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:25.720
And I think about the Lord's Supper provides for us a time to remember.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.960
A time to remember what? Well, I believe that what we would remember

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.600
is the greatest sacrifice that it was ever made. Sometimes we talk about sacrifice.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:40.200
In fact, there are times in which people will speak about those that are servants of the Lord

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.520
and they'll speak about their sacrifice of service or duty.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.760
There's a preacher of yesteryear that said,

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.600
do not call my duty for God's service, it's but a privilege.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.320
What a great perspective. But there are some that use that term sacrifice

00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:01.800
and I would say that the greatest sacrifice of all time, of all of the history of humankind,

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:06.200
the greatest sacrifice is when the Lord Jesus Christ went up a hill called Calvary.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:12.440
When God in flesh took your place and my place on the cross, it's the greatest sacrifice.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:19.080
And I'm so thankful that this, the Lord's Supper, gives us an opportunity to remember

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:24.120
what he did for us. I would say this evening that that greatest sacrifice was a sacrifice

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:30.120
that was motivated by love. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son,

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.480
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life,

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.280
whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:43.400
And this greatest sacrifice was motivated by love and I'm thankful for his great love.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:50.920
This evening we read in verses 24 and 25 how that we remember that great sacrifice.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.600
Notice the Bible says, and when he had given thanks, he break it and said,

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:59.400
take, eat, notice this is my body which is broken for you.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:07.160
You see the personal aspect, it was broken for you. I'm thankful that the Lord Jesus Christ was

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:15.880
willing to endure such pain and suffering. It says that his body was broken for you.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:21.480
We understand that his bones were not broken. You can read of the prophecy in the Psalms about not

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:26.920
a bone being broken, but they were out of joint and we can see the great suffering in how his

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.960
body, you think about the cat of nine tails and how they would whip him and they buffeted him and

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:37.240
all that they did and he says, this is my body which is broken for you. And then he speaks about

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:43.640
the blood. As Baptists we've often said it's the book, the blood and the blessed hope. And I'm so

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:49.000
thankful for the blood of Christ. And he says in verse 25, and after the same manner also he took

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.559
the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood, this do you as

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:59.640
often as you drink it in remembrance of me. Listen, without the shedding of blood there is no remission.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:04.679
That's what God says in the book of Hebrews. And the blood is absolutely necessary. The blood is

00:15:04.679 --> 00:15:09.559
the only way to have forgiveness. You know that there are some modern translations that take the

00:15:09.559 --> 00:15:15.720
blood out of the scriptures. A passage of scripture, you don't need to turn there, that's so

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:21.720
vital and so important that we'd understand the teaching of forgiveness and reconciliation.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:27.559
Colossians in chapter number 1 and verse number 14, the Bible says in whom we have redemption

00:15:28.119 --> 00:15:36.520
through his blood even the forgiveness of sins. What a powerful verse of scripture. What a

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:42.119
simple truth of God's word but how powerful it is. And yet we find that many of the modern

00:15:42.119 --> 00:15:47.720
translations today, you know what they take out of that verse of scripture? Through his blood.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:52.679
There's no way to have redemption or forgiveness if there's no mention of the blood.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:58.679
Without the shedding of blood there is no remission. We find that as we observe the

00:15:58.679 --> 00:16:05.960
Lord's table, this opportunity for us to have a time to remember, to remember the great price

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:17.000
that was paid for our salvation. Listen, salvation is a free gift for us. It cost our Savior everything.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:24.839
You think about buying a gift for someone and you buy a gift for them, they give you the gift,

00:16:24.839 --> 00:16:30.760
you're the recipient of a gift, it didn't cost you anything. But it cost the individual that gave you

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:37.800
that gift a certain sum of money. We find that as we think of this gift, it did not cost money,

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:44.360
it was not purchased with gold and silver, with corruptible things. But according to what Peter

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:51.320
says, we find that it was paid for, it was purchased with the precious blood of Christ.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:57.240
No wonder that John, he says, John the Baptist as he sees Jesus,

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:06.440
behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world. This greatest sacrifice was

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:12.920
motivated by love but this greatest sacrifice results in reconciliation. It's a wonderful thing

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:20.040
to be reconciled to God. We're in enmity with God, we were separated from God, we were His enemies,

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:25.480
we could not approach God but because of Jesus, because of what He did on that cross,

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:35.399
He offers that forgiveness. That which was not possible of our own merit, of our own work,

00:17:35.399 --> 00:17:41.000
is now possible through the blood of Christ, reconciled, that work of reconciliation.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:47.559
What a blessing. The Lord's Table gives us an opportunity for a time to remember. I would say

00:17:47.559 --> 00:17:52.760
number two this evening, if you're taking notes, a time not only to remember but a time to rejoice.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:59.480
Time to rejoice. I'm so thankful that Jesus was willing to go to that cross. Aren't you? I mean,

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:04.119
we ought to rejoice greatly for the great salvation that we have through Jesus Christ.

00:18:04.119 --> 00:18:09.960
What a blessing to know that He was willing and He went to the cruel cross, He paid the

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:17.640
awful price, the awful penalty so that we could be redeemed and we rejoice in the finished work

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:28.520
of Christ. He said on the cross, it is finished. Hallelujah. What a blessing. I hope that regularly

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:38.039
in your life that you rejoice to know that you're saved. You rejoice in remembering what Christ did

00:18:38.039 --> 00:18:44.600
for you on the cross of Calvary. I would say this evening that not only would it be a time to rejoice

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:49.640
because of the finished work of Christ at Calvary, but we'd find from verse number 26, continue

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:54.200
reading with me there in 1 Corinthians 11, the Bible says for as often as you eat this bread

00:18:54.200 --> 00:19:04.119
and drink this cup, notice ye do show the Lord's death till He come. I hope that you're rejoicing

00:19:04.119 --> 00:19:08.280
in that wonderful promise. We say that we rejoice because of the finished work of Christ

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:15.000
and we should rejoice because of the future coming of Christ. It says that ye do show His death

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:22.119
till He come. I don't know when He's going to come, but I know He's coming. Amen? I don't know

00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:29.880
the date nor the hour and neither do you. No man does, but we can rest assured that God always does

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:34.280
what He says He's going to do. And we find that He gave that wonderful promise that He's coming

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:40.760
again and He wants the church to be reminded that time of remembrance, that time of reflection.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:46.840
He wants us to rejoice in understanding that He finished, He completed the work for our redemption

00:19:47.559 --> 00:19:52.919
there at the cross of Calvary, but He wants us to understand and to rejoice in His future coming.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:58.760
You think about the motivation of the coming of Christ, the promise of His coming and what it

00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.239
should do.

00:19:59.239 --> 00:20:06.519
in the life of a believer and how it should motivate us to live for Jesus every single day.

00:20:06.519 --> 00:20:13.359
We'd live with that awareness, that understanding that today could be the day.

00:20:13.359 --> 00:20:20.779
The reality is that we understand that the Bible teaches that there's the imminent return of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:20:20.779 --> 00:20:23.779
that the rapture could take place at any moment.

00:20:23.779 --> 00:20:29.479
But the Bible also teaches, as I mentioned this morning, that our life is but a vapor

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:34.019
that appears for a little time and then vanisheth away.

00:20:34.019 --> 00:20:37.859
And so really there are two factors that we should consider every single day.

00:20:37.859 --> 00:20:39.979
Number one, Jesus could come back.

00:20:39.979 --> 00:20:46.319
Number two, I could take my final breath and depart this world in death every single day.

00:20:46.319 --> 00:20:55.239
Those two truths are great motivators for God's people to live every day for His honor and for His glory.

00:20:55.239 --> 00:20:58.479
Because what if today were the last day?

00:20:58.479 --> 00:21:03.739
What if you knew that today was the last day you'd ever live upon this earth?

00:21:03.739 --> 00:21:06.199
What is it that you would do?

00:21:06.199 --> 00:21:12.659
There are people that receive medical diagnosis of cancer and various ailments and what have you,

00:21:12.659 --> 00:21:19.079
and doctors will give estimates with regard to how much time they believe they would have to live upon this earth.

00:21:19.079 --> 00:21:22.659
And they begin to talk, and you've heard the term, I've heard the term.

00:21:22.659 --> 00:21:31.539
People talk about having a bucket list, a list of things they'd like to do while they have time here upon this earth.

00:21:31.539 --> 00:21:40.499
So many of the things that would fill people's bucket lists for God's people are not even things that we should really even...

00:21:40.499 --> 00:21:46.039
I mean, they don't take that priority, that level of importance.

00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:50.259
See, this evening, Jesus is coming again.

00:21:50.259 --> 00:21:52.259
I'm rejoicing in that truth.

00:21:52.259 --> 00:21:58.259
Jesus said, I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also.

00:21:58.259 --> 00:21:59.259
Listen for the trumpet.

00:21:59.259 --> 00:22:02.039
The songwriter said, Jesus is coming.

00:22:02.039 --> 00:22:07.839
And 1 John 3 says it this way.

00:22:08.179 --> 00:22:16.179
I think about John writing, and John had heard that wonderful promise of Jesus when he said, I will come again.

00:22:16.179 --> 00:22:22.179
And in 1 John 3, John the Apostle, he says this in verse number 1,

00:22:22.179 --> 00:22:28.179
Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.

00:22:28.179 --> 00:22:34.179
Therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not, beloved, now are we the sons of God.

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:38.519
Notice in verse 2, it says, And it doth not yet appear what we shall be,

00:22:38.519 --> 00:22:46.519
but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.

00:22:46.519 --> 00:22:52.519
It's interesting, I'll read verse number 3 in just a moment, but if you were to go back to verse number 28 of chapter number 2

00:22:52.519 --> 00:22:58.519
and notice this truth that is given, he says, And now, little children, abide in him.

00:22:58.519 --> 00:23:01.519
We just sang a song about abiding.

00:23:01.859 --> 00:23:09.859
That when he shall appear, not if he shall appear, it's a certain truth, it's a fact to be understood.

00:23:09.859 --> 00:23:15.859
When he shall appear, we may have confidence, and notice what it says,

00:23:15.859 --> 00:23:22.859
and not be ashamed before him it is coming.

00:23:22.859 --> 00:23:28.859
You know, I believe, certainly possible, likely,

00:23:29.199 --> 00:23:35.199
that there will be some of God's people that are going to be ashamed at the appearing of Jesus Christ.

00:23:35.199 --> 00:23:39.199
I don't want to be in that company. I really don't.

00:23:39.199 --> 00:23:45.199
And he says, in verse number 3 of chapter number 3, when he talks about, again, he said in verse number 2,

00:23:45.199 --> 00:23:50.199
when he shall appear, we see that in verse 28 of chapter 2, and now he says in chapter 3, in verse number 3,

00:23:50.199 --> 00:23:54.199
And every man that hath this hope in him.

00:23:54.539 --> 00:23:58.539
We're talking about the book, the blood, and the blessed hope,

00:23:58.539 --> 00:24:01.539
and he says, every man that hath this hope in him.

00:24:01.539 --> 00:24:11.539
Remember, hope, biblically speaking, the biblical definition of hope is that confident expectation.

00:24:11.539 --> 00:24:14.539
It's not the hope that the world talks about.

00:24:14.539 --> 00:24:17.539
I hope this is going to happen. I hope I get this, or I hope this.

00:24:17.539 --> 00:24:20.539
No, no, no. This is confident expectation.

00:24:20.539 --> 00:24:30.539
Every man that hath this hope in him, notice what it says, purifieth himself, even as he is pure.

00:24:30.539 --> 00:24:34.539
We know that he is holy. He is pure.

00:24:34.539 --> 00:24:36.539
We find that we are to purify ourselves.

00:24:36.539 --> 00:24:41.539
We find that the Bible teaches us, the Bible says this, that we are to be holy. Why?

00:24:41.539 --> 00:24:44.539
For he is holy. Be holy, for I am holy.

00:24:44.539 --> 00:24:49.539
That's what the Lord says in all manner of conversation.

00:24:49.539 --> 00:24:52.539
We see that there's a time to remember, a time to rejoice,

00:24:52.539 --> 00:24:57.539
and oh, how we should rejoice greatly when we partake of the Lord's Supper,

00:24:57.539 --> 00:25:01.539
reminded of the finished work of Christ,

00:25:01.539 --> 00:25:07.539
reminded of the future coming of Christ, and it causes the people of God to rejoice greatly.

00:25:07.539 --> 00:25:14.539
But I would say number three this evening, not only a time to remember, a time to rejoice,

00:25:14.539 --> 00:25:18.539
but I would say it's a time to repent. A time to repent.

00:25:18.539 --> 00:25:21.539
This is what the Bible says in verse number 27.

00:25:21.539 --> 00:25:25.539
Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily

00:25:25.539 --> 00:25:28.539
shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.

00:25:28.539 --> 00:25:32.539
If you were to go back into verse number 17 of this chapter, you'd note that the Bible says,

00:25:32.539 --> 00:25:36.539
Now in this that I declare unto you, I praise you not,

00:25:36.539 --> 00:25:40.539
that ye come together, not for the better, but for the worse.

00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:44.539
He's talking about what they were doing, what their behavior was,

00:25:44.539 --> 00:25:48.539
and he's saying, I praise you not, you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing,

00:25:48.539 --> 00:25:50.539
so he's going to correct them. Notice in verse 18,

00:25:50.539 --> 00:25:53.539
For first of all, when ye come together in the church,

00:25:53.539 --> 00:25:57.539
I hear that there be divisions among you, and I partly believe it.

00:25:57.539 --> 00:26:00.539
For there must be also heresies among you,

00:26:00.539 --> 00:26:04.539
that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.

00:26:04.539 --> 00:26:08.539
When ye come together, therefore, into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's Supper.

00:26:08.539 --> 00:26:11.539
For in eating everyone taketh before other his own supper,

00:26:11.539 --> 00:26:14.539
and one is hungry, and another is drunken. What?

00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:17.539
Have ye not houses to eat and to drink in?

00:26:17.539 --> 00:26:21.539
Or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not?

00:26:21.539 --> 00:26:27.539
What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.

00:26:27.539 --> 00:26:30.539
And so then he says in verse number 27, when he's giving this instruction,

00:26:30.539 --> 00:26:34.539
Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily,

00:26:34.539 --> 00:26:37.539
shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.

00:26:37.539 --> 00:26:39.539
This is a serious matter.

00:26:39.539 --> 00:26:41.539
It's not something to take lightly.

00:26:41.539 --> 00:26:43.539
It's time to repent.

00:26:43.539 --> 00:26:45.539
Notice he says this in verse 28,

00:26:45.539 --> 00:26:48.539
But let a man examine himself.

00:26:48.539 --> 00:26:50.539
Let a man examine himself.

00:26:50.539 --> 00:26:58.539
And so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.

00:26:58.539 --> 00:27:00.539
As we look at this passage of Scripture,

00:27:00.539 --> 00:27:03.539
we find that this idea of this time to repent,

00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:06.539
or to not partake unworthily,

00:27:06.539 --> 00:27:08.539
and so what is the remedy?

00:27:08.539 --> 00:27:11.539
He says that we're to let a man examine himself.

00:27:11.539 --> 00:27:14.539
Self-examination is necessary. It's important.

00:27:14.539 --> 00:27:19.539
I would say it's a missing practice in many of our lives.

00:27:19.539 --> 00:27:23.539
We find that the Bible teaches this truth of self-examination,

00:27:23.539 --> 00:27:29.539
and it's so imperative that we get and we understand and grasp this teaching

00:27:29.539 --> 00:27:31.539
that we would examine ourselves.

00:27:31.539 --> 00:27:33.539
I've often said this over the years,

00:27:33.539 --> 00:27:37.539
Self-examination is going to require honesty.

00:27:37.539 --> 00:27:40.539
It's going to require honesty.

00:27:40.539 --> 00:27:43.539
Self-examination is going to require humility.

00:27:43.539 --> 00:27:46.539
Listen, I had lunch with a man on Friday,

00:27:46.539 --> 00:27:50.539
a man that our families prayed for the whole month of April.

00:27:50.539 --> 00:27:51.539
Love thy neighbor.

00:27:51.539 --> 00:27:54.539
I've tried to encourage you to pray for or choose a neighbor.

00:27:54.539 --> 00:27:56.539
Prayed for their family the entire month of April.

00:27:56.539 --> 00:27:59.539
Had lunch with him on Friday

00:27:59.539 --> 00:28:02.539
for the purpose of sharing the Gospel with them.

00:28:02.539 --> 00:28:04.539
He's a different world religion, doesn't matter.

00:28:04.539 --> 00:28:06.539
Sharing the Gospel with them, trying to give them the truth.

00:28:06.539 --> 00:28:07.539
Here's what he said to me.

00:28:07.539 --> 00:28:09.539
He looked at me and this is what he said.

00:28:09.539 --> 00:28:12.539
I'm better than 90% of the people in the world.

00:28:12.539 --> 00:28:14.539
That's what he said.

00:28:14.539 --> 00:28:17.539
That's what he said.

00:28:17.539 --> 00:28:20.539
Self-examination requires humility.

00:28:20.539 --> 00:28:22.539
Requires honesty.

00:28:22.539 --> 00:28:23.539
And here's the reality.

00:28:23.539 --> 00:28:25.539
It doesn't matter if you're better than everybody

00:28:25.539 --> 00:28:27.539
that you can think about all the people.

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:29.539
And you know who we like to compare ourselves to?

00:28:29.539 --> 00:28:32.539
The real bad people.

00:28:32.539 --> 00:28:33.539
You know how many people have told me over the years

00:28:33.539 --> 00:28:35.539
I've never killed anybody?

00:28:35.539 --> 00:28:36.539
Seriously.

00:28:36.539 --> 00:28:38.539
You start asking people if they know for sure

00:28:38.539 --> 00:28:40.539
they're going to go to heaven when they die.

00:28:40.539 --> 00:28:43.539
Because the common thought amongst people

00:28:43.539 --> 00:28:45.539
is that, well, if I'm better than others,

00:28:45.539 --> 00:28:48.539
if my good is more than my bad.

00:28:48.539 --> 00:28:50.539
I've had countless number of people say,

00:28:50.539 --> 00:28:52.539
I've never killed anybody.

00:28:52.539 --> 00:28:53.539
You know what I say?

00:28:53.539 --> 00:28:54.539
Well, that's good.

00:28:54.539 --> 00:28:58.539
I'm glad.

00:28:58.539 --> 00:29:01.539
But the standard is Jesus.

00:29:01.539 --> 00:29:03.539
And he's perfect.

00:29:03.539 --> 00:29:04.539
He's perfect.

00:29:04.539 --> 00:29:07.539
But let a man examine himself.

00:29:07.539 --> 00:29:10.539
Listen, this process of self-examination

00:29:10.539 --> 00:29:13.539
requires honesty and humility.

00:29:13.539 --> 00:29:16.539
It's an important process.

00:29:16.539 --> 00:29:18.539
We could call it a discipline this evening

00:29:18.539 --> 00:29:20.539
and we could think about this discipline

00:29:20.539 --> 00:29:24.539
or this process and this self-examination.

00:29:24.539 --> 00:29:26.539
Understanding that one day we're going to stand

00:29:26.539 --> 00:29:30.539
before the judge of all the earth.

00:29:30.539 --> 00:29:32.539
We find that the Bible says,

00:29:32.539 --> 00:29:34.539
but let a man examine himself

00:29:34.539 --> 00:29:38.539
and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.

00:29:38.539 --> 00:29:41.539
So as we understand contextually what's taking place,

00:29:41.539 --> 00:29:44.539
he's saying, listen, you're not doing things right.

00:29:44.539 --> 00:29:45.539
I praise you not.

00:29:45.539 --> 00:29:48.539
So here's the instruction for how you do it.

00:29:48.539 --> 00:29:50.539
Don't partake of it unworthily.

00:29:50.539 --> 00:29:54.539
And the way that you prevent partaking of it unworthily

00:29:54.539 --> 00:29:56.539
is to examine yourself.

00:29:56.539 --> 00:29:59.539
Then he says, but let a man examine himself.

00:29:59.539 --> 00:30:03.539
examine themselves, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup." So what's

00:30:03.539 --> 00:30:09.019
the process? Well, the process is not to say, well, I'm unworthy so I'm not going to partake.

00:30:09.019 --> 00:30:14.179
That's why I've titled it, given the third point here, that it's a time to repent. A

00:30:14.179 --> 00:30:19.419
time to repent. Listen, when we examine ourselves and we get alone with God and we say as the

00:30:19.419 --> 00:30:30.839
psalmist said, search me, O God. Show me if there be any wicked way in me. God's going

00:30:30.839 --> 00:30:36.559
to point out some things in our lives. You know why? We all got this flesh. There's not

00:30:36.559 --> 00:30:44.659
one of us tonight that's perfect. Not one of us. There's sins of omission, there's sins

00:30:44.659 --> 00:30:52.279
of commission. You know how easy, listen, the Bible says what's not a faith is sin.

00:30:52.279 --> 00:30:59.379
How many times we can sin with our tongue? Tongue's a little member. Oh, it causes so

00:30:59.379 --> 00:31:07.659
many problems, James chapter number 3. Right? Be angry and sin not. I shared that verse

00:31:07.659 --> 00:31:13.559
last Sunday night. Jesus, the Son of God, God in flesh, he was angry, he didn't sin,

00:31:13.559 --> 00:31:18.639
but the problem is that many of us, we don't really know how to do that. Many times our

00:31:18.639 --> 00:31:25.719
anger turns into sinful behavior. This evening, this idea of let a man examine himself, the

00:31:25.719 --> 00:31:31.279
purpose I would say of self-examination is repentance. That we would get that thing right,

00:31:31.279 --> 00:31:36.239
that we would have that, as the songwriter said, there's nothing between my soul and

00:31:36.239 --> 00:31:42.039
my Savior. That we would be in that place of that self-examination. He says, so let

00:31:42.039 --> 00:31:46.799
him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. Notice what he says in verse 29, for he that

00:31:46.799 --> 00:31:51.759
eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning

00:31:51.759 --> 00:31:58.319
the Lord's body. And if you look within context here, it's interesting because the damnation

00:31:58.319 --> 00:32:03.199
to himself that's mentioned in verse number 29, it's given further explanation I believe

00:32:03.199 --> 00:32:08.919
in verse number 32 when the Bible says that when we are judged, we are chastened of the

00:32:08.919 --> 00:32:14.239
Lord. Again, the truth that we find in this passage of Scripture that this Lord's table,

00:32:14.239 --> 00:32:18.839
the Lord's supper is for God's people, it's not for lost people, it's for saved people.

00:32:18.839 --> 00:32:25.759
And here's what God said, for whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth. Listen, we ought to

00:32:25.759 --> 00:32:33.079
thank God when He chastens us. You know why? It's a birthmark of belonging to Jesus. Because

00:32:33.079 --> 00:32:39.879
He says, if He doesn't chasten you, then you don't belong to Him. And so guess what?

00:32:39.879 --> 00:32:48.639
Our good Heavenly Father does. Sometimes He has to correct us. He chastens us. We find

00:32:48.639 --> 00:32:54.919
here that He says that that individual, that believer that is eating and drinking unworthily,

00:32:54.919 --> 00:32:58.879
he's eating and drinking damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. And then Paul

00:32:58.919 --> 00:33:04.879
goes on to say, for this cause, because the behavior there in Corinth and the way in which

00:33:04.879 --> 00:33:08.999
they were observing the Lord's table, the Lord's supper, the manner that he's speaking of,

00:33:08.999 --> 00:33:14.359
he says, for this cause, many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep. That word

00:33:14.359 --> 00:33:19.359
sleep is the same way that Jesus used it speaking about Lazarus. Remember He said to the disciples,

00:33:19.359 --> 00:33:23.479
he's asleep. And, well, if he's asleep, I mean, let him be. And Jesus said, he's dead.

00:33:23.479 --> 00:33:32.799
So, He says here, listen, every sickness in the life of a believer is not chastening. It's

00:33:32.799 --> 00:33:37.279
important for us to understand that. Every sickness is not chastening. But you know what

00:33:37.279 --> 00:33:44.999
happens in my life? If I got some sickness going on, I'm, Lord, self-examination time. It's a good

00:33:44.999 --> 00:33:50.399
practice. Lord, is there something I, are you chastening me? Is there something I need to,

00:33:50.759 --> 00:33:55.719
but when we understand this truth of chastening, He says, for many are sick, weak, excuse me,

00:33:55.719 --> 00:33:59.599
and sickly among you and many sleep. Then He says this, if we would judge ourselves,

00:33:59.599 --> 00:34:04.679
we should not be judged. For when we are judged, we are chastened to the Lord that we should not

00:34:04.679 --> 00:34:09.359
be condemned with the world. So, we would understand this evening as we've titled this

00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:15.439
point a time to repent, where to not eat unworthily, the process of self-examination leads us to

00:34:15.439 --> 00:34:20.679
repentance. Listen, when we get alone with God and we go through that process of self-examination,

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:24.759
Lord, search me, show me if there'd be any wicked way in me. When God shows it to us,

00:34:24.759 --> 00:34:31.559
guess what? We confess it. We confess it. He that covereth his sin, the Bible says,

00:34:31.559 --> 00:34:41.239
shall not prosper. By the way, who knows about your sin? God. Right? No one's ever pulled

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:54.559
anything over on God. Right? Adam, where are you? Did God know where he was? Sure He

00:34:54.559 --> 00:35:01.359
did. Did God know why He had the leaves on? Sure He did. Adam wasn't hiding anything from

00:35:01.359 --> 00:35:08.319
God. He hid from God, but God knew all about it. We could speak of so many examples. Achan,

00:35:08.319 --> 00:35:16.199
the one that troubleth Israel, he hid some things, but God systematically brought Achan

00:35:16.199 --> 00:35:23.279
to the very forefront of Joshua to see who it was that was the troubler of Israel. You

00:35:23.279 --> 00:35:26.159
could go on and on. You can look through the pages of Scripture. Listen, God knows about

00:35:26.159 --> 00:35:31.719
our sin. Sometimes people think, well, nobody else knows about this. He that covereth his

00:35:31.719 --> 00:35:38.439
sin shall not prosper, but whoso confesseth and forsaketh shall, they shall have forgiveness.

00:35:38.439 --> 00:35:42.759
The Bible says in 1 John chapter 1 and verse number 9, the Bible says that if we confess

00:35:42.759 --> 00:35:47.839
our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

00:35:47.839 --> 00:35:54.439
That's a wonderful promise of God's Word. What a wonderful promise. This evening, listen,

00:35:54.439 --> 00:36:01.719
it's foolish, it's foolish to try to hide our sin. We can't do it. The Word is that

00:36:01.719 --> 00:36:07.719
they should have mercy. Aren't you thankful for God's mercy? God's mercy. He that covereth

00:36:07.719 --> 00:36:14.279
his sin shall not prosper, but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them, his sin, shall have mercy.

00:36:14.279 --> 00:36:20.479
Listen, our God is a merciful God. He's a gracious God. He's a God that is described

00:36:20.479 --> 00:36:29.919
this way. He is ready to pardon. He is ready to forgive. So if I have sin in my life, this

00:36:29.919 --> 00:36:34.119
evening if you have sin in your life, we think about this Lord's Supper, this Lord's table.

00:36:34.119 --> 00:36:40.519
It's a time to repent. Get right with God. I want nothing between my soul and my Savior.

00:36:40.519 --> 00:36:51.199
I want to be right with God. The Lord's Supper is a precious time for believers. A time to

00:36:51.199 --> 00:36:58.399
remember, to remember of the greatest sacrifice that was motivated by love that results in

00:36:58.399 --> 00:37:04.199
reconciliation. That great sacrifice. What an important thing that we remember what Christ

00:37:04.199 --> 00:37:11.319
did for us. The time to rejoice. I hope tonight that you rejoice in the finished work of Christ.

00:37:11.319 --> 00:37:17.479
I hope tonight that you rejoice in the future coming of Christ. He's coming again. Oh how

00:37:17.479 --> 00:37:22.639
that wonderful truth should motivate us daily to live for Him, to serve Him every day of

00:37:22.639 --> 00:37:32.679
our lives. But it's a time to repent. Time to repent. God, search me. Show me. Reveal

00:37:32.679 --> 00:37:37.239
in my life. Uncover those things in my life where I've sinned, where I need to get it

00:37:37.239 --> 00:37:43.919
right with You, Lord. Help me not to have a hard heart. I close with this thought from

00:37:43.919 --> 00:37:49.439
the Apostle Paul as he's standing and giving defense before Felix in Acts 24. In verse

00:37:49.439 --> 00:37:56.279
number 16, the Bible says that he, Paul, says this, and herein do I exercise myself to have

00:37:56.279 --> 00:38:07.479
always a conscience void of offense toward God and toward men. He says, I exercise myself.

00:38:07.479 --> 00:38:12.119
I'm laboring. I'm striving. For what purpose to have always a conscience that is void of

00:38:12.119 --> 00:38:18.959
offense? I don't believe Paul wanted to have sin in his life. He wanted to be clean. He

00:38:18.959 --> 00:38:22.199
understood, oh, wretched man that I am. I mean, he understood that he still had the

00:38:22.199 --> 00:38:29.359
flesh. But he says, I die daily. I'm crucified with Christ. Why did God use Paul the way

00:38:29.359 --> 00:38:33.000
that He did? Well, there's so many answers to that question, but I believe that this

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:41.159
is one of them, that he sought to walk and live a clean life, pure in the eyes of God.

00:38:41.159 --> 00:38:46.079
This evening is a time to repent. I don't know what you have to repent of, but I know

00:38:46.079 --> 00:38:52.519
that we're all sinners. I know that we all ought to say, God, search me, show me, help

00:38:52.519 --> 00:38:59.839
me, Lord, to honestly, humbly evaluate, examine my life. God, as you show me, I'm so thankful

00:38:59.839 --> 00:39:04.279
that you're a God who's gracious and merciful and ready to pardon. I can get that right

00:39:04.279 --> 00:39:09.479
with you, Lord. I can have forgiveness because we're going to partake of the Lord's Supper

00:39:09.479 --> 00:39:16.039
and I want to do it with joy. I want to do it with that rejoicing and that remembering.

00:39:16.039 --> 00:39:22.839
Why? Because I've done that process of repenting and preparing my heart to be able to partake

00:39:22.839 --> 00:39:28.079
of the Lord's Table. Let's pray together. Father, we love you. How we thank you for

00:39:28.079 --> 00:39:33.599
loving us. We thank you for the precious Word of God. We thank you for the instruction that

00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:40.000
you provide us with in your Word regarding the Christian life and the church and the

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Lord's Supper. God, I pray that as we have a moment of invitation, as we proceed into

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.519
the next phase of our service of observing the Lord's Supper, I pray, God, that you'd

00:39:50.519 --> 00:39:55.880
help us to examine ourselves. I pray that we do business with you, Lord. I pray that

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:59.599
as we would have this time of examination, perhaps…

00:39:59.599 --> 00:40:02.999
Perhaps there'd be some that would come to this old-fashioned altar, maybe we'd make

00:40:02.999 --> 00:40:05.419
our own pew and altar.

00:40:05.419 --> 00:40:08.199
God help us.

00:40:08.199 --> 00:40:11.799
Help us, Lord, to have this time of examination.

00:40:11.799 --> 00:40:14.159
Help us to be right with you, Lord.

00:40:14.159 --> 00:40:17.279
I pray that you'd use us, Lord, for honor and for your glory.

00:40:17.279 --> 00:40:24.319
Help us to rejoice as we remember what you've done for us to provide us with salvation full

00:40:24.319 --> 00:40:25.959
and free.

00:40:25.959 --> 00:40:29.919
Thank you for the promise that you're soon going to come again, pray that you'd help

00:40:29.919 --> 00:40:31.439
us to be found faithful.

00:40:31.439 --> 00:40:36.359
Lord, would you move and work in hearts and lives as only you can.

00:40:36.359 --> 00:40:37.359
We'll thank you for it.

00:40:37.359 --> 00:40:40.319
In Christ's name we pray, this evening.
