00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320
We look forward this evening to look at 2 Kings 5.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.640
We'll be looking at verses 9-19, but let me just give you a quick review from our last

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.239
week's study.

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:18.760
Last week we studied verses 1-8 of 2 Kings 5, and you'll recall from that study that

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.319
Naaman was a mighty man.

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:24.719
The Bible tells us that he was a great man with his mastery, he was honorable, it tells

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:30.639
us that he was a mighty man in valor, but the Bible tells us that he was a leper.

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:36.159
And we would think about this condition of this man, Naaman, and we'd understand as we

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:40.599
look at the text of Scripture that it would appear that evidently there was much that

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:46.439
was done in order to find a cure for Naaman, but there was no success.

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:51.360
There was that little maid that had been taken captive from Israel, and she spoke up to her

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.599
mistress, it's recorded in 2 Kings chapter number 5 and verse number 3, and she speaks

00:00:56.599 --> 00:01:01.639
up and she says, would God, my Lord, were with the prophet that is in Samaria, for he

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:04.959
would recover him of his leprosy.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:12.040
And I think about this little maid speaking up and pointing someone to the Lord, and talking

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.080
about Elisha, of course, as the prophet in Israel, but he would point people to the Lord,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.400
he was the representative that God had chosen for this particular time in Israel's history.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.519
And we find that after this little maid makes this declaration and reveals this thing to

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:34.800
the mistress, or to her mistress, that we find that there's some steps that are taken,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.639
and the king of Syria sends a letter to the king of Israel, and we understand that Jehoram

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:46.959
receives that letter, and as he receives that letter, he's told, I'm going to send my servant

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:50.319
to thee that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.959
Can you imagine receiving such a letter?

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:58.919
And Jehoram understands this is completely beyond his ability, and he actually asks the

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:03.319
question, am I God to kill and to make alive in verse number 7?

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:11.240
And we find that Elisha understands as to what's going on, the confusion of Jehoram

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.160
is met with the confidence of Elisha, for Elisha instructs the king Jehoram, the king

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.960
of Israel, he instructs him to have Naaman come to him.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.600
As we begin this text of scripture that we're looking at this evening, we find in verse

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.600
number 9 that the Bible tells us, so Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.160
and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.199
If you're taking notes this evening, Naaman stood at the door of Elisha.

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:50.279
That's the title for the message this evening, Naaman stood at the door of Elisha, 2 Kings

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:57.960
5 verses 9 through 19, and this is our 24th lesson through the life of Elijah and Elisha,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.960
and I have greatly enjoyed the opportunity, it's been a blessing to me to study afresh

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.559
and to prepare these messages and to see how God is always at work and to see how God

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:11.360
reveals his power.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.759
As we look at the passage of scripture, and as I've read verse number 9 already, it's

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:21.399
interesting that we note really the scene and we find that Naaman, the Bible says, came

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:23.919
with horses and with his chariot.

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:29.679
I'm not sure how many people accompany Naaman on this journey, but we find that however

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:36.320
many are in this group of people that they arrive at the house of Elisha, and Naaman

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.839
comes and he stands at the door of the house of Elisha.

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:44.119
Can you imagine the expectation that this one Naaman has?

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:49.440
Remember, it was that little maid that had been taken captive from Israel that was a

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:57.520
servant to Naaman's wife, and she spoke up and said, would to God my servant were, my

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:03.800
Lord, excuse me, were with the prophet that is in Samaria, for he would recover him of

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.360
his leprosy.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.000
The King Jehoram can do nothing about it, but we find that Elisha says, tell him to

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
come.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.799
He shall know that there is a prophet in Israel, and we find that Naaman arrives.

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.559
Now, as Naaman arrives, we find that he has these expectations, and we'll note those in

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:28.679
just a couple of verses of Scripture and see what takes place, but I want you to notice

00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:36.519
that as Naaman arrives with the host that is there with him, that he does not have Elisha

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:42.279
come out and meet him as he expected, but Elisha sends a messenger, and we find that

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:49.119
in verse number 10, he, Elisha, sends his messenger to deliver the instruction to Naaman.

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:50.119
Look at it in verse number 10.

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:55.640
The Bible says, and Elisha sent a messenger unto him saying, here's the instruction that

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.160
Elisha would provide to Naaman.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:05.600
The instruction is actually very simple, and the instruction is this, go and wash in Jordan

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.519
seven times.

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:11.839
Go and wash in Jordan seven times.

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:17.640
Now, if you've been along with us through our journey of the study of the life of Elijah

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.959
and Elisha, and in particular, the life of Elisha, in several of our recent studies,

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:27.480
we find that there's often some simple instruction that is given.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.040
There's a problem, and there's some simple instruction.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:38.000
Remember it was the woman there that had two sons, that widow woman in chapter number four,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.839
and we find that she had this problem, and he's given, Elisha gives her some simple instruction,

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:47.880
go gather all the vessels that you can gather.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:54.880
We find that prior to that, we find that we understand that Elisha gives some instruction

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:01.079
about making these ditches, and make it full of ditches.

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:04.480
In chapter number three, the valley was to be full of ditches.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:12.160
We find again over and over that Elisha would give this instruction, and it was simple instruction,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.279
but we find that as the instruction was followed, as it was obeyed, that God worked.

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:19.959
Elisha was a prophet of God.

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:25.640
Elisha spoke the word of the Lord, and though it's not recorded in the scriptures as often

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:32.799
as it is with Elijah, that he would preface his statements with that preface of thus saith

00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:38.959
the Lord, we find that Elisha, as a prophet of God, he was speaking the word of God, and

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:43.359
no doubt, see, Elisha had expected that Naaman would come, right?

00:06:43.359 --> 00:06:47.079
He gave Jehoram the answer, tell him to come to me.

00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:53.119
And so Elisha understood that Naaman was going to come, and as he came, and whatever period

00:06:53.119 --> 00:07:00.959
of time lapses between the letter and the actual coming of Naaman, we find that Elisha

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:06.519
had received instruction from the Lord, and he faithfully delivers that instruction, and

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:11.079
it's simple instruction, go and wash in Jordan seven times.

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:18.359
I want you to know that in verse number 10, there is a promise that is based upon obedience.

00:07:18.359 --> 00:07:26.119
The Bible says in verse number 10, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt

00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:27.119
be clean.

00:07:27.119 --> 00:07:28.839
Isn't that a great promise?

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:35.519
I mean, this is an absolute, he says this, that thy flesh shall come again to thee, and

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:37.640
thou shalt be clean.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.959
You think about the certainty of the promise, and we understand that this promise that is

00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:47.959
given in verse number 10 is based upon obedience, and we find that truth throughout the word

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:54.679
of God, and I'm so thankful that our God has given us wonderful promises, and we find that

00:07:54.679 --> 00:08:00.480
in most of those cases, as we look at the promises of God, we find that obedience is

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.279
necessary.

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:06.359
We find that it was there in Moses, in the book of Deuteronomy, he says to the children

00:08:06.359 --> 00:08:12.000
of Israel, speaking on the behalf of God, I set before thee today a blessing and a curse,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.920
a blessing if you obey, a curse if you disobey.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:22.359
And we find here that there is simple instruction, and with that simple instruction, go and wash

00:08:22.359 --> 00:08:28.000
in Jordan seven times, and there's a promise that is based on obedience.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.400
I want you to understand that though it's simple instruction, it is specific instruction.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.280
There was a specific place that he was supposed to go, right?

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.280
Jordan.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.200
He was to go to the river Jordan.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.080
He could not just pick any body of water to go to.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.640
He could not just determine that, well, I'm going to go over here or go over there.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.919
No, there was simple instruction, but it was specific.

00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:55.559
Go to Jordan, go and wash in Jordan, and there was a specific number of times, seven times.

00:08:55.559 --> 00:08:57.559
What if he only did six?

00:08:57.559 --> 00:08:58.559
What if he said, you know what?

00:08:58.559 --> 00:08:59.559
Three is enough.

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:02.000
No, no, there's specific instruction.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.799
Jordan is the place, and seven is the number of times.

00:09:05.799 --> 00:09:09.840
We find here that Elisha sends a messenger.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.799
Elisha himself doesn't even go out to meet Naaman.

00:09:13.799 --> 00:09:14.799
He sends a messenger.

00:09:14.799 --> 00:09:18.280
Now, that's going to really disappoint Naaman, we'll see in the next verse of scripture.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.960
And I believe that part of the reason in which this is, is because it was not for Elisha

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.000
to receive any credit or glory.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.440
It was so that God would be glorified.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.760
You know, in your life and in my life, it's not so that we would be honored or glorified,

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.559
that someone would lift us up.

00:09:35.559 --> 00:09:41.080
No, it's so that people would see our wonderful Savior, that they would understand that we

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:49.520
serve a mighty God, and that anything in me, anything in you that is good is the direct

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.559
result of God's blessing in our lives.

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:58.880
And we find that Elisha, perhaps if he had gone out, and maybe if he did that which Naaman

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.039
had expected, perhaps...

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:07.079
Perhaps Naaman would look at Elisha as being the source instead of recognizing it was God

00:10:07.079 --> 00:10:09.399
that gave the healing.

00:10:09.399 --> 00:10:15.919
We find that Naaman is angry, as I mentioned, he was not very happy with the fact that Elisha

00:10:15.919 --> 00:10:16.919
sent a messenger.

00:10:16.919 --> 00:10:19.599
He wanted to see Elisha.

00:10:19.599 --> 00:10:22.399
Elisha was the one that he was told about by the little maid.

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:26.839
The little maid didn't say about the servant or the messenger.

00:10:26.839 --> 00:10:29.839
The little maid spoke about the prophet.

00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:32.079
The prophet sends a messenger.

00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:36.639
We find that Naaman, the verse in verse number 11, the verse begins by telling us that Naaman

00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:37.639
was wroth.

00:10:37.639 --> 00:10:39.399
I mean, he's angry.

00:10:39.399 --> 00:10:40.439
He goes away.

00:10:40.439 --> 00:10:42.879
Can you see in your mind's eye, can you see what's happening?

00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:49.879
Can you see that this group of people that traveled with Naaman, they arrive with pomp

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:55.399
and circumstance perhaps and they come and they're there at Elisha's house and a messenger

00:10:55.399 --> 00:11:01.119
comes out and says, Elisha said, go to Jordan and dip yourself, wash seven times there in

00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:06.119
Jordan and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean.

00:11:06.119 --> 00:11:08.839
And Naaman is wroth and he leaves.

00:11:08.839 --> 00:11:10.799
He went away.

00:11:10.799 --> 00:11:20.079
Notice what he says, behold, I thought he will surely come out to me and stand and call

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:27.239
on the name of the Lord his God and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper.

00:11:27.239 --> 00:11:33.579
He was expecting some kind of display by Elisha that Elisha would come out and Elisha would

00:11:33.579 --> 00:11:40.299
do something and he was expecting that sort of an encounter.

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:41.939
His expectations were not met.

00:11:41.939 --> 00:11:43.979
He was angry.

00:11:43.979 --> 00:11:49.959
He went away and he's sharing his disgust and his disdain for the circumstances with

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:52.239
those that traveled with him.

00:11:52.239 --> 00:11:55.979
He continues and he speaks about the rivers of Damascus.

00:11:55.979 --> 00:12:02.899
He says, are not Abana and Farpar rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel?

00:12:02.899 --> 00:12:05.899
May I not wash in them and be clean?

00:12:05.899 --> 00:12:09.559
So he turned and went away in a rage.

00:12:09.559 --> 00:12:15.439
Now consider with me the truth of what he's speaking here.

00:12:15.439 --> 00:12:22.159
The Jordan was known for being a pretty muddy river and we find that the rivers farther

00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:28.479
north in Syria and Damascus, the rivers of Damascus that he references, Abana and Farpar,

00:12:28.479 --> 00:12:35.959
that they were cleaner rivers than that which are there in Israel, the Jordan specifically

00:12:35.959 --> 00:12:37.199
that is mentioned.

00:12:37.199 --> 00:12:43.079
And he asked this question, may I not wash in them and be clean?

00:12:43.079 --> 00:12:44.079
What's the answer?

00:12:44.079 --> 00:12:45.079
No.

00:12:45.079 --> 00:12:46.079
No.

00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:51.399
Remember, there was simple instruction, but it was specific instruction.

00:12:51.399 --> 00:12:55.599
See, you can't just do things your own way.

00:12:55.599 --> 00:13:01.119
The prophet of God delivered the message from God and the message was to go to Jordan and

00:13:01.119 --> 00:13:03.999
wash yourself seven times.

00:13:03.999 --> 00:13:09.519
You couldn't go to the rivers of Damascus and bathe or wash in them and be clean.

00:13:09.519 --> 00:13:11.399
That would not be the result.

00:13:11.399 --> 00:13:14.679
But he went away in a rage.

00:13:14.679 --> 00:13:20.639
It reminds me as we would take a pause here and look at this situation, we find this disease

00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:27.639
of leprosy and we find that there is a prescription that is given as far as the direction that

00:13:27.639 --> 00:13:30.879
he would take in order to have healing in his life.

00:13:30.879 --> 00:13:37.079
And we find that he must follow exactly that which the prophet had given.

00:13:37.079 --> 00:13:41.239
There's a problem for mankind, it's called sin.

00:13:41.239 --> 00:13:45.839
There's only one solution for sin and it's the blood of Jesus Christ.

00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:48.199
There are some that say, but can I be a good person?

00:13:48.199 --> 00:13:49.199
Can I do this?

00:13:49.199 --> 00:13:50.279
Can I do that?

00:13:50.279 --> 00:13:51.359
Can I go to church?

00:13:51.359 --> 00:13:52.599
Can I give money to church?

00:13:52.599 --> 00:13:54.359
Can I help people?

00:13:54.359 --> 00:13:56.759
No.

00:13:56.759 --> 00:14:01.599
The only solution for sin is the blood of Jesus Christ.

00:14:01.599 --> 00:14:05.119
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:14:05.119 --> 00:14:11.719
We find that the Bible tells us that the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal

00:14:11.719 --> 00:14:16.839
life through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

00:14:16.839 --> 00:14:19.819
Jesus said this, he said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:14:19.819 --> 00:14:22.679
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:14:22.679 --> 00:14:28.159
Peter stood there in Acts chapter four after the miracle of the lame man that was healed

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:32.759
and all of the uproar that takes place in the city there, and he says this, neither

00:14:32.759 --> 00:14:36.859
is there salvation in any other for there's none other name under heaven given among men

00:14:36.859 --> 00:14:39.239
whereby we must be saved.

00:14:39.239 --> 00:14:40.239
What was that name?

00:14:40.239 --> 00:14:42.959
That was the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.

00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:49.239
If you'll remember there in Acts chapter four that Peter, in fact, before he mentions that

00:14:49.239 --> 00:14:54.779
verse that I just quoted in verse number 12 of Acts four, he made this statement.

00:14:54.779 --> 00:15:00.679
He said, if we're being asked by what power, by what name have we done this, I want you

00:15:00.679 --> 00:15:05.879
to understand that it was not in our power, it was not in our name.

00:15:05.879 --> 00:15:10.399
Understand that it was by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.

00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:16.359
In fact, when he said to that man that was lame, he was begging for silver and gold.

00:15:16.359 --> 00:15:21.719
Remember in Acts three, he said, look at me, and he said this to that man that was

00:15:21.719 --> 00:15:28.799
begging, he said, silver and gold have I none, but such as I have give I thee in the name

00:15:28.799 --> 00:15:35.319
of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.

00:15:35.319 --> 00:15:41.839
We find here that Naaman has this idea that unfortunately many people in our society today

00:15:41.839 --> 00:15:46.919
still deal with, and that is, can I do something my way?

00:15:46.919 --> 00:15:50.839
Maybe this seems like a viable option.

00:15:50.839 --> 00:15:53.639
Maybe this seems like an acceptable path.

00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:55.959
No, there's only one way to heaven.

00:15:55.959 --> 00:16:03.199
In fact, we sing songs with children, one way God said to get to heaven, Jesus is the

00:16:03.199 --> 00:16:04.199
only way.

00:16:04.199 --> 00:16:10.079
No other way, no other way, and what a blessing that God has taught us that in the scriptures.

00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:14.039
I'm thankful that Jesus Christ is the lamb of God that was slain before the foundation

00:16:14.039 --> 00:16:19.199
of the world, and he paid for the sins of mankind, and he is the savior of the world,

00:16:19.199 --> 00:16:23.479
and he, I hope this evening, that you can say he is my savior.

00:16:23.479 --> 00:16:28.479
And as we think about this passage of scripture, and kind of took a little side path there

00:16:28.479 --> 00:16:34.879
to understand an application for us today, but let's get back to the account at hand

00:16:34.879 --> 00:16:39.999
in 2 Kings chapter number five, I want you to see that the servants of Naaman make an

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:42.719
appeal in verse number 13.

00:16:42.719 --> 00:16:47.199
The Bible says, and his servants came near and spake unto him and said, my father, if

00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:52.679
the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldst thou not have done it?

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:57.559
How much rather then, when he sayeth to thee, wash and be clean.

00:16:57.559 --> 00:17:00.799
I'm thankful for the appeal of these servants.

00:17:00.799 --> 00:17:03.839
I'm thankful that they stopped Naaman.

00:17:03.839 --> 00:17:06.919
Remember he's angry, he's departing in rage.

00:17:06.919 --> 00:17:11.159
The Bible says that he turned and went away in a rage, and these servants, they come near

00:17:11.159 --> 00:17:16.599
and they speak some reason and logic into Naaman's ear.

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:21.519
They say to Naaman, listen, if the prophet had given you some instruction to do some

00:17:21.519 --> 00:17:25.239
great thing, you would have done it.

00:17:25.239 --> 00:17:31.639
So how much rather then, when he sayeth to thee, wash and be clean, Naaman gives heed

00:17:31.639 --> 00:17:35.399
to that appeal of the servant.

00:17:35.399 --> 00:17:42.479
We find that he concedes, and in verse number 14, it says, then went he down and dipped

00:17:42.479 --> 00:17:49.119
himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God.

00:17:49.119 --> 00:17:53.399
Now I want to stop there, and most of us are familiar with the passage of Scripture, and

00:17:53.399 --> 00:17:54.839
we know what's going to happen.

00:17:54.839 --> 00:17:59.319
But I want you to consider that the Bible says, then he went down, then went he down.

00:17:59.319 --> 00:18:01.679
You think about the humility, right?

00:18:01.679 --> 00:18:03.319
You see humility here.

00:18:03.319 --> 00:18:07.479
See this man, Naaman, he no doubt was a prideful man.

00:18:07.479 --> 00:18:13.199
He came from Syria with all of these groups of people, and we find that the Bible tells

00:18:13.199 --> 00:18:17.959
us that he was the captain of the host of the king of Syria.

00:18:17.959 --> 00:18:21.279
He was a great man with his master, honorable.

00:18:21.279 --> 00:18:27.319
The Bible tells us that he was a mighty man in valor, and he comes and we find that he

00:18:27.319 --> 00:18:30.919
went down, and humility is so important.

00:18:30.919 --> 00:18:35.399
I believe that it was a humbling thing for him to go into the Jordan.

00:18:35.399 --> 00:18:37.559
Remember what he said about the rivers of Damascus.

00:18:37.559 --> 00:18:38.559
Can't I go there?

00:18:38.559 --> 00:18:40.279
They're better.

00:18:40.279 --> 00:18:47.559
But he went down, and the Bible says that he dipped himself seven times in Jordan.

00:18:47.559 --> 00:18:51.559
That's exact obedience to what the command of the Lord was.

00:18:51.559 --> 00:18:58.000
The command that the Lord delivered through the prophet Elisha, given by the messenger

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:06.399
of Elisha, was to go and wash in Jordan seven times, and we find that Naaman obeys.

00:19:06.399 --> 00:19:11.599
He goes, and he dips himself seven times in Jordan according to the saying of the man

00:19:11.599 --> 00:19:12.599
of God.

00:19:12.599 --> 00:19:16.759
See, there was an act of not only humility and an act of obedience, but there was an

00:19:16.759 --> 00:19:19.759
act of faith.

00:19:19.759 --> 00:19:24.639
We find that often, as I've mentioned through our study of the life of Elijah and the life

00:19:24.639 --> 00:19:31.279
of Elisha, that often we say ... I'm mindful of the passage a few weeks ago in chapter

00:19:31.279 --> 00:19:34.959
number four with the death in the pot.

00:19:34.959 --> 00:19:40.959
Remember, they put those wild gourds in there, and man, they were going to have that pottage,

00:19:40.959 --> 00:19:43.719
and they knew not that they were poisonous.

00:19:43.719 --> 00:19:46.039
As they began to eat, they said that they could not.

00:19:46.039 --> 00:19:51.079
There was death in the pot, and Elisha says, bring me some meal, and he casts in the pot.

00:19:51.079 --> 00:19:52.079
Bring me some flour.

00:19:52.079 --> 00:19:55.199
I mean, how's that going to do anything?

00:19:55.199 --> 00:19:56.559
It was simple instruction.

00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:59.919
Bring me meal, and he puts it in the pot, and there was healing.

00:19:59.919 --> 00:20:07.539
in that pottage. I jokingly said when we studied that passage of Scripture that

00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:13.099
after Elisha put that meal, that flour into the, he cast in the pot, that he

00:20:13.099 --> 00:20:16.699
said, pour out for the people that they may eat and there was no harm in the pot.

00:20:16.699 --> 00:20:21.579
And I asked the question, who would eat? And I believe it was Brother Mark said,

00:20:21.579 --> 00:20:27.499
Pastor, you're our leader, we follow you. But the reality is that a lot of

00:20:27.499 --> 00:20:33.079
these passages of Scripture, it's simple instruction and sometimes it's

00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:37.399
the simplicity of the instruction that really messes us up. We think it's got to

00:20:37.399 --> 00:20:40.219
be harder, it's got to be more challenging, there's got to be something

00:20:40.219 --> 00:20:44.719
more to it, there's got to be something that I have to do. We think about it with

00:20:44.719 --> 00:20:48.879
regard to salvation as we spoke about a few moments ago. There's nothing that you

00:20:48.879 --> 00:20:55.159
can do because Christ paid it all and his payment is sufficient. There's no

00:20:55.159 --> 00:21:02.779
more that can be paid, he paid it all. He said, it is finished. When he gave up the

00:21:02.779 --> 00:21:07.999
ghost, when he died on the cross of Calvary, he paid for your sin and for my

00:21:07.999 --> 00:21:13.639
sin. And we find that the obedience to the simplicity of the command, to the

00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:18.039
simple instruction, and we find here that the Bible gives us the result at the end

00:21:18.039 --> 00:21:23.019
of verse number 14, it says this, and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of

00:21:23.019 --> 00:21:27.939
a little child and he was clean. Now can you imagine what happens during this

00:21:27.939 --> 00:21:32.859
particular time? I mean, in my mind's eye, I'd like to kind of see Naaman doing

00:21:32.859 --> 00:21:37.419
this and being part of the group of people that traveled from Syria and

00:21:37.419 --> 00:21:42.999
observing and watching and we find that he dips and maybe Naaman after one, he

00:21:42.999 --> 00:21:46.519
says, look I'm still the same, there's no change, and after a second time and a

00:21:46.519 --> 00:21:50.499
third and a fourth and a fifth and a sixth and there's no noticeable

00:21:50.499 --> 00:21:54.939
difference, I mean nothing has changed, I'm the same as I was then, but then he

00:21:54.939 --> 00:22:01.819
dips one more time and he comes up and he's clean. This is amazing. I don't know

00:22:01.819 --> 00:22:06.739
what it is to be a leper. I hope that I would never experience what it is to be

00:22:06.739 --> 00:22:12.579
a leper, but we find that this man, because he took this journey, because

00:22:12.579 --> 00:22:18.059
there was a little maid that said, would to God that my Lord were with the

00:22:18.059 --> 00:22:24.099
prophet that's there in Samaria, and we find that she had that faith that he

00:22:24.099 --> 00:22:29.979
would recover him of his leprosy, that Naaman goes and Elisha sends his

00:22:29.979 --> 00:22:35.099
messenger and the instruction is given, initially it's rejected, but then

00:22:35.099 --> 00:22:39.899
finally after the appeal of the servants of Naaman, we find that there's

00:22:39.899 --> 00:22:46.739
obedience and this man Naaman now comes out of the River Jordan clean. The Bible

00:22:46.819 --> 00:22:53.899
says that his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child. What did

00:22:53.899 --> 00:23:00.779
Elisha say? Through his messenger he said, and thy flesh shall come again to thee

00:23:00.779 --> 00:23:10.019
and thou shalt be clean. That's exactly what happens. Isn't that awesome? I mean I

00:23:10.019 --> 00:23:16.099
can't imagine the thrill of Naaman in this particular instance in his life and

00:23:16.179 --> 00:23:20.339
I mean we see the result and we'll look at several things here in just a moment

00:23:20.339 --> 00:23:26.179
in verses 15 through 19 and see how he responds to all that has happened, but I

00:23:26.179 --> 00:23:30.579
like to think about the day in which I trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as my

00:23:30.579 --> 00:23:35.459
personal Savior. I like to think about the feeling, those of you that have

00:23:35.459 --> 00:23:39.139
trusted Christ your Savior, it's not a feeling but there is a feeling you know

00:23:39.139 --> 00:23:43.859
and it's one of those things that man to know that we're forgiven, to know that

00:23:43.859 --> 00:23:48.499
heaven is our home and obviously the longer you've been saved the more you

00:23:48.499 --> 00:23:53.419
understand about the transaction that was made on that day and we sing songs

00:23:53.419 --> 00:23:59.219
like heaven came down and glory filled my soul and we speak about the day that

00:23:59.219 --> 00:24:04.939
we trust that Christ is our Savior and what a joy as we sing those songs and I

00:24:04.939 --> 00:24:09.379
think about that wonderful hymn there's a new name written down in glory and

00:24:09.499 --> 00:24:15.299
it's mine oh yes it's mine and when we sing that song I hope for you and I know

00:24:15.299 --> 00:24:20.099
for me I'll speak for myself that as I sing that song I think back to that day

00:24:20.099 --> 00:24:25.419
on August 31st 1997 when I understood that I was a sinner in need of a Savior

00:24:25.419 --> 00:24:29.979
and that Jesus was the only Savior and in simple faith and obedience to what he

00:24:29.979 --> 00:24:35.259
said in his word I cried out and asked him to be my Savior and he saved my soul

00:24:35.259 --> 00:24:42.659
and he gave me direction he gave me a purpose and I was I was forgiven you

00:24:42.659 --> 00:24:46.299
think about the truth of there in first John 3 and verse number one behold what

00:24:46.299 --> 00:24:49.739
manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the

00:24:49.739 --> 00:24:55.499
children of the sons of God to think that we've been adopted in the family

00:24:55.499 --> 00:25:01.859
were just just to think about our position in Christ and I don't know what

00:25:01.859 --> 00:25:05.619
it is to be a leper that's been made clean but I know what it is to be a

00:25:05.619 --> 00:25:11.859
sinner that's been saved I hope that you know what it is to experience salvation

00:25:11.859 --> 00:25:17.899
through the Lord Jesus Christ in verses 15 through 18 really 15 through 19 we

00:25:17.899 --> 00:25:22.139
have the opportunity to see how Naaman had experienced the power of God and

00:25:22.139 --> 00:25:29.219
then acknowledges that he Jehovah is the God of all the earth notice in verse

00:25:29.219 --> 00:25:34.259
number 15 and returned to the man of God he and all his company and came and

00:25:34.259 --> 00:25:39.539
stood before him and said I mean can you imagine I don't know how long it took

00:25:39.539 --> 00:25:43.579
them I believe that they kind of went pretty quickly I believe that name it

00:25:43.579 --> 00:25:46.499
was excited about what had taken place I believe that this company they were

00:25:46.499 --> 00:25:51.939
excited and they come back to the house of Elisha and notice what what Naaman

00:25:51.939 --> 00:25:59.139
acknowledges through his declaration he says behold now I know that there is no

00:25:59.139 --> 00:26:06.059
God in all the earth but in Israel now therefore I pray thee take a blessing of

00:26:06.059 --> 00:26:11.019
thy servant I want you to understand in verse number 15 what he's acknowledging

00:26:11.019 --> 00:26:17.939
is that all of those false gods that he would be familiar with the Syrians again

00:26:17.939 --> 00:26:22.339
as many other people groups that we find within the Word of God and of course the

00:26:22.339 --> 00:26:28.179
nation of Israel was guilty even during this very time of idolatry and thinking

00:26:28.179 --> 00:26:33.659
about the polytheistic view of many nations and groups of people remember it

00:26:33.659 --> 00:26:39.379
was Elijah that said to the people of God during the reign there of King Ahab

00:26:39.379 --> 00:26:43.579
because of all of the idolatry that was taking place how long haughty between

00:26:43.579 --> 00:26:50.379
two opinions if God be God if the Lord be God then serve him if Baal then serve

00:26:50.379 --> 00:26:56.379
him and we find that God answered by fire there at Mount Carmel and what a

00:26:56.379 --> 00:27:01.019
blessing that is and we find that the acknowledgement of Naaman is that all of

00:27:01.019 --> 00:27:07.139
those false gods all of those idols any false deity that I've ever engaged in

00:27:07.139 --> 00:27:12.699
any kind of idol worship of they are not gods there's only one God in all the

00:27:12.699 --> 00:27:17.659
earth what a great acknowledgement he desires to give Elisha a blessing and we

00:27:17.659 --> 00:27:21.979
find that Elisha in verse number 16 it says but he said as the Lord liveth

00:27:21.979 --> 00:27:25.739
before whom I stand I will receive none and he urged him to take it but he

00:27:25.739 --> 00:27:31.099
refused Naaman wanted to give him something and Elisha says no can I tell

00:27:31.099 --> 00:27:37.219
you that the the blessing of the Lord cannot be purchased as we've likened

00:27:37.219 --> 00:27:40.499
throughout our study this evening this passage of Scripture to that of

00:27:40.499 --> 00:27:47.059
salvation there is nothing that you can do to pay for salvation it's been paid

00:27:47.059 --> 00:27:54.899
in full we've mentioned that already we find that Elisha refuses this offer in

00:27:54.899 --> 00:27:59.819
verse 17 and Naaman said I want you to notice his request I mean it's an

00:27:59.819 --> 00:28:05.819
interesting request in verse number 17 he says shall there not then I pray thee

00:28:05.819 --> 00:28:15.859
be given to thy servant two mules burden of earth he's asking for dirt

00:28:15.859 --> 00:28:23.619
two mules burden of earth he's made a request for soil for dirt if you will

00:28:23.619 --> 00:28:30.979
and he says I want to take two mules burdens worth of earth and take it back

00:28:31.139 --> 00:28:37.899
with me notice why for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering

00:28:37.899 --> 00:28:47.500
nor sacrifice unto other gods but unto the Lord he's gonna take that earth that

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:53.459
dirt the two mules burden worth he's gonna take it back to Syria and it's

00:28:53.459 --> 00:28:58.739
implied in the text of Scripture that he would take that earth that dirt and he

00:28:58.739 --> 00:29:03.019
would place an altar of some sort upon it so that he could make offerings unto

00:29:03.019 --> 00:29:08.619
the Lord God Jehovah he said I'm not gonna make offerings any longer no burnt

00:29:08.619 --> 00:29:12.619
offerings nor sacrifices unto other gods why because what he acknowledged in

00:29:12.619 --> 00:29:16.619
verse number 15 see he experienced the power of God and he acknowledged that

00:29:16.619 --> 00:29:24.380
God Jehovah is the God of the earth and then he says this it's interesting in

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:30.700
verse 18 see because in his position as the captain of the host of the king of

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:35.380
Syria there were some things that he was required to do and he knew that and he

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.820
knew that when he went back though he was a changed man because of his

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:43.500
understanding of who God is and the acknowledgement that those false gods

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.979
are idols and they're not to be worshipped he understood that there were

00:29:46.979 --> 00:29:50.380
some things that were going to happen when he returned and he says this in

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:55.820
verse 18 in this thing the Lord pardoned thy servant that when my master

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:59.940
goeth into the house of rim on to worship there and he leaneth on

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:04.840
my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow down myself in the house

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.640
of Rimmon, the Lord pardon thy servant in this thing."

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:13.500
It's interesting what he's saying here in verse number 18, see, isn't it just wonderful

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:21.300
to see how after the experience of this individual, Naaman, and his encounter with the true God

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:29.540
of Heaven, that immediately he has this element of conviction about the fact that he would

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:35.900
have to go into this place of false worship because of the position he had, and he says

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:42.940
this on two occasions in this verse of Scripture, that the Lord pardon thy servant.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:46.700
He has a heart of sensitivity.

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:53.220
Immediately after his encounter with the God of Heaven, and we find that he said unto him,

00:30:53.220 --> 00:31:00.100
Elisha replies, and he says, go in peace, so he departed from him a little way.

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:05.020
We know that he only gets a little ways from the house of Elisha because Gehazi chases

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.980
him, and we'll deal with that next week, and deal with the remaining part of chapter number

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:15.300
five, but I want you to consider this evening as we think about this Bible account.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:19.700
Isn't it awesome to see how God is able to work?

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:30.540
I mean, God gives this leper, this man in Syria who was a mighty man, who had all of

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:36.300
these great things said about him, but he was a leper, how that God sovereignly places

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:44.380
this little maid in that place so that she could testify about the prophet of God in

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.060
Samaria, about Elisha.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:56.100
Then, through these series of events, he comes to the house of Naaman, excuse me, to Elisha.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:01.139
Naaman comes to the house of Elisha, and as he arrives to the house of Elisha, he receives

00:32:01.139 --> 00:32:02.139
this instruction.

00:32:02.139 --> 00:32:09.220
Oh, he's disappointed, he's angry in fact, but then as he follows the instruction, as

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:18.100
he obeys specifically the instruction that was given, he's healed, he's healed.

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:25.979
Our God is able, and what a blessing to see how God blesses obedience, and this evening

00:32:25.979 --> 00:32:30.900
as we've likened the passage of Scripture and used the illustration or the analogy of

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:36.220
salvation, I trust that you know the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, that

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:42.339
you understand that it was simple repentance, turning from your sin and from your way and

00:32:42.339 --> 00:32:46.779
turning to the Lord Jesus Christ, understanding that he paid it all.

00:32:46.779 --> 00:32:52.979
I trust this evening that you've experienced the power of God, that you've been saved,

00:32:52.979 --> 00:32:58.500
that you know that you belong to Jesus, that there's a time in your life that you can understand

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.580
that you were born again.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:04.260
It's not about being religious, you can be religious and be lost.

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:10.059
We find that there in John chapter number three, Nicodemus, he was religious and lost.

00:33:10.059 --> 00:33:13.779
Jesus in fact said to Nicodemus, you must be born again.

00:33:13.779 --> 00:33:14.779
What do you mean by that?

00:33:14.779 --> 00:33:18.100
He didn't mean baptism or taking some elements, no.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:23.139
He meant that you would be born again, that you're born not just of water but of spirit,

00:33:23.139 --> 00:33:27.220
and we find that he speaks about that second birth.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:31.619
If any man be in Christ, he's a new creature, Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number

00:33:31.619 --> 00:33:35.940
17, old things are passed away, behold all things are become new.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:40.540
We find that salvation, the second birth, being born again, not of corruptible seed

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:45.380
but of incorruptible by the word of God that liveth and abideth forever.

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:49.460
I trust that you have placed your faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:53.260
savior and that you know for sure that heaven is your home.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:59.580
What a blessing to read the Old Testament accounts, to be encouraged by the power of

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:00.580
God.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:08.059
I'm thankful that Elisha was willing to deliver the message and that Naaman followed reluctantly

00:34:08.059 --> 00:34:10.979
at first there, but he followed the instruction.

00:34:10.979 --> 00:34:12.779
We find that he was healed.

00:34:12.779 --> 00:34:13.779
Let's pray.

00:34:13.779 --> 00:34:14.979
Father, we love you.

00:34:14.979 --> 00:34:16.100
We thank you for loving us.

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:19.739
We thank you for the privilege that you've given us to gather together, and Lord, for

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:24.660
those that have been able to log on this evening, we thank you for the technology and for the

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:27.299
opportunity to broadcast our services.

00:34:27.299 --> 00:34:32.580
We pray that you would help those that have listened tonight, Lord, that you'd encourage

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.140
them through thy word.

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:38.299
I pray, Father, that you would help us to be strengthened in our walk with thee.

00:34:38.299 --> 00:34:40.980
I pray that you would watch over us, give us good health.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:44.899
I pray that you would be glorified in our lives, and we'll thank you for all that you'll

00:34:44.899 --> 00:34:45.899
do.

00:34:45.899 --> 00:34:47.660
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
