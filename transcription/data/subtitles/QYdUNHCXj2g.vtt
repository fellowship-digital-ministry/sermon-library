00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.619
Chapter number four, good to have the Beals family

00:00:02.619 --> 00:00:04.239
with us again this evening.

00:00:04.239 --> 00:00:08.199
And they're stopping in to visit with Matt,

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:11.319
make sure he's still doing all that he's supposed to do.

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:14.319
And we got to meet Lydia's parents not long ago.

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:16.159
And now we get to meet Matt's parents

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:17.799
and brother and sister.

00:00:17.799 --> 00:00:19.120
And his sister, Holly,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.459
is going to finish her senior year of college.

00:00:21.459 --> 00:00:23.719
And so they're heading down to South Carolina from here.

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:25.079
And so if you'd pray for their travels,

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:26.319
I know they'd appreciate that.

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:27.360
Second Kings chapter four,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.799
we'll be looking at verses one through seven.

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:30.959
Admittedly, at the beginning of this message,

00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:34.200
we'll note that this is a familiar passage of scripture.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.400
I trust it'll be a blessing to you

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.880
as we consider the content here.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.040
Of course, with it being a familiar passage of scripture,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.200
the danger sometimes in our lives

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.840
is that we can say, oh yeah, I know that.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.880
I've heard that, I know what happens.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.919
And we just kind of put it on autopilot, so to speak.

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:53.139
And I'm not sure, I have not kept count.

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:56.240
At some points, I wish that I had kept record

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:59.639
of how many times I've read the Bible cover to cover.

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:02.799
But I know that for a number of years,

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:05.639
it's been at least two times per year.

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:07.599
Last year, I read the Bible cover to cover twice.

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:10.080
And in the New Testament, two more times on top of that.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.900
This year, I'm on track to read it through three times.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.900
And I try very hard to keep it fresh in my life

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.559
and come to that place where,

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:21.080
yes, I've read the Bible cover to cover,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.959
but this book is like no other book.

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:24.900
There are a lot of books that I've read

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.419
that I've never read a second time.

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:28.260
Amen?

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.459
You have some like that?

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:31.139
You had some that you had to read in college

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:33.779
that was mandatory reading, and you read it,

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:36.699
and you labored through it, and you said,

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:39.300
I will never read this book again.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.839
I can't wait to get to the end.

00:01:40.839 --> 00:01:41.680
Amen?

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.500
Dean's waving his hand.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.760
He's like, amen.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.919
There's some books that you've read

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:45.940
that you say, man, that's a good book.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:46.779
I'll read that again.

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:48.680
There's a few books that I have in my library

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.699
that I've read more than once.

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:53.059
But this book is a living book.

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:54.940
And it's the word of God.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.900
And I try in my own life personally,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.000
I try through the preaching ministry

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.480
to keep it fresh and keep it applicable in our lives.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.500
And trust me, a blessing to you this evening.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.260
Hudson Taylor, missionary to China.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.020
Many of you are familiar with that name.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.619
He is given credit for making this statement.

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:17.259
God's work done God's way will never lack God's supply.

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:20.139
What a great truth that he understood in his own life.

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.699
In fact, if you were to read the story of Hudson Taylor

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:25.580
and there's a number of really neat nuggets

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.699
as you would read his life account,

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:30.020
many books that are written with regard

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.300
to some of his ministry, of course,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.779
serving there in China and all that God did.

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:35.979
But how God increased his faith

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:39.339
in one particular incident early in his life,

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:40.940
he was working for a medical doctor

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.679
and he had to regularly remind the doctor for his pay.

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:46.339
And could you imagine if every week

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:48.800
you had to go remind your boss that it was payday?

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.139
And it just got to the point in Hudson Taylor's life

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.020
that he decided that in order to increase his faith,

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.979
he would stop asking his boss for his pay

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:01.380
because he knew that God could remind his boss

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.320
that he was to be paid.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.259
And so he said, I'm not gonna ask anymore.

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:07.020
And God worked and God blessed.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.539
It was something just little that God used in his life

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:12.259
to increase his faith.

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:15.940
And as of course, he would go to China many years later

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.380
and face a whole number of obstacles,

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.039
he knew that God was able.

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:23.119
And he knew that God would take care of him.

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:25.479
He knew that God would provide for him.

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:28.679
And his greatest desire, as I understand,

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:30.679
and as I've done some reading about his life

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:34.479
was that he would do God's work God's way.

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:37.720
And believing and trusting that God would provide.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.720
And as we look at this particular portion of Scripture,

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.520
we would be reminded that of course,

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.800
this widow woman cries unto Elisha

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.279
and of course, being an Old Testament account.

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:49.639
But I look at this account,

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.199
I look at the life of Hudson Taylor

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:53.800
and I consider our own lives this evening.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.039
And I am reminded of this great truth

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:58.759
that we serve the same God.

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:00.619
Amen, we serve the same God.

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:04.440
In fact, our bulletin this morning, this evening for today,

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.639
it reminds us the truth of Hebrews 13, eight,

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:12.639
Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and today and forever.

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:18.440
God says in Malachi, I am the Lord, I change not.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.600
I'm so thankful for the immutability of the Lord.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.359
And we find that we serve the same God

00:04:24.359 --> 00:04:27.959
and he is able to do exceeding abundantly

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:30.600
above all that we ask or think, amen.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.399
And notice in the passage of Scriptures,

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:34.839
we briefly examined this familiar text.

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:36.920
I really wanna note three things.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.799
And I told Brianna, she said,

00:04:38.799 --> 00:04:40.320
you had four Ps this morning.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.760
I said, we're gonna stick with Ps this evening as well.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.799
There's gonna be a problem, a plan and another principle.

00:04:45.799 --> 00:04:47.359
And so I want you to notice as we read here

00:04:47.359 --> 00:04:48.600
in verse number one, the Bible says,

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.279
now there cried a certain woman

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:54.720
of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha,

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.720
saying, thy servant, my husband, is dead.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.760
And thou knowest that thy servant did fear the Lord.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.000
Notice, and the creditor is come to take unto him

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.140
my two sons to be bondmen.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.959
And Elisha said unto her, what shall I do for thee?

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:18.000
Tell me, what hast thou in the house?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.160
And she said, thine handmaid hath not anything in the house

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.000
save a pot of oil.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.880
In verse number seven, we'll read all the texts

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.399
as we go through the message this evening.

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:31.239
The Bible says, then she came and told the man of God.

00:05:31.239 --> 00:05:35.760
And he said, go sell the oil and pay thy debt

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.359
and live thou and thy children of the rest.

00:05:40.359 --> 00:05:44.480
Elisha says, what is it that you have in the house?

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.760
And she says, thine handmaid hath not anything in the house

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.119
save a pot of oil.

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:55.040
The reality is that she understood,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.100
even through her communication with Elisha,

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.519
that what she had was not sufficient

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:02.799
to take care of her problem.

00:06:02.799 --> 00:06:04.980
But God, but God.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.279
If you're taking notes,

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:08.760
I've titled the message this evening,

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.720
The Provision of the Lord, The Provision of the Lord.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.839
I want you to note the problem.

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:15.559
It's revealed to us in verse number one.

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:18.720
We find that here, as this woman comes to Elisha,

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.279
we understand that Elisha has been now in this position

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:26.279
of being this prophet of God and he has been used of God.

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:28.799
And we have the opportunity to read here

00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:32.760
how that this woman now comes to this prophet,

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.760
this servant of the Lord, Elisha.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.279
And notice that the Bible says,

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:39.799
thy servant, my husband, is dead.

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:44.000
Now, he was of the sons of the prophets.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.399
We know that he was a servant of the Lord

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:47.880
that feared the Lord.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.579
And we find here that he's now dead,

00:06:50.579 --> 00:06:53.279
but there was a debt that they had.

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:54.399
There was a debt that they had.

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:57.040
And in 2 Kings 4, in verse number one,

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.920
the problem of this woman is revealed to Elisha.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.459
And the problem, the husband is dead,

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:06.899
but notice that as the creditor comes,

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:09.380
the Bible tells us that the creditor has come

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.739
to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.739
Now, I want you to notice the way

00:07:16.739 --> 00:07:20.059
in which she approached the man of God.

00:07:20.059 --> 00:07:23.899
The Bible says, now there cried a certain woman

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:26.899
of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha.

00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:28.519
I believe that in her life,

00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:30.739
this problem was as serious as any problem

00:07:30.739 --> 00:07:32.899
that you have in your life.

00:07:32.899 --> 00:07:35.019
Sometimes we can look at the problems of others

00:07:35.019 --> 00:07:37.359
and say, well, that's not really that big of a deal.

00:07:37.359 --> 00:07:39.220
Well, it's not your problem, it's their problem,

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.179
and to them, it's a big deal.

00:07:41.179 --> 00:07:42.220
Amen?

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.660
And we ought to be thankful

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.299
that their problem isn't our problem,

00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:46.660
and our problem isn't their problem,

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.059
because God gave you your problem for you.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.100
Amen?

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.459
Seriously.

00:07:52.459 --> 00:07:54.359
Because God could take care of all of our problems

00:07:54.359 --> 00:07:56.320
if He so desired to.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.500
But you know, there are times in which

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.140
He will give us trials and tribulations

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.980
and troubles and problems to develop us.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.700
You've often heard me say over the years

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.940
that God is able to deliver us,

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.380
but oftentimes we find that He would choose

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.140
to develop us through the trial.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.739
The reality is that there are times

00:08:17.739 --> 00:08:20.260
in which we face the trial, we face the problem,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.260
and we don't so much like the development process, right?

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.600
We just want the deliverance.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.859
I'd be happy, Lord, if you'd just take care of this problem,

00:08:28.859 --> 00:08:31.339
if I didn't have to endure this situation,

00:08:31.339 --> 00:08:32.880
if I didn't have to deal with this,

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.380
I don't have time for it, I don't have money for it,

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.359
I don't have, fill in the blank, right?

00:08:37.359 --> 00:08:39.260
Whatever your problem is.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.820
Someone said, I think wisely said,

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.400
if everyone in a room, doesn't matter the size of the room,

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.099
if we took everyone in the room this evening,

00:08:46.099 --> 00:08:48.119
I'm not sure how many of us are here tonight,

00:08:48.119 --> 00:08:49.460
but if we took every one of us,

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.859
and we had a board up here, and we gave you a sticky note,

00:08:52.859 --> 00:08:54.440
and we said, write your problem,

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.179
the biggest problem that you have,

00:08:56.179 --> 00:08:58.739
on that sticky note, and put it up on the board,

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.299
and then everybody go sit down,

00:09:00.299 --> 00:09:02.340
and then you can pick a problem that you want off the board,

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.020
you'd probably go pick your own problem.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.280
Why, because I don't want your problem,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.340
and you don't want my problem.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.659
But this problem that this woman had was serious.

00:09:12.659 --> 00:09:16.940
She cried, the Bible says that there cried a certain woman

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.020
of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha,

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:25.020
she says, my husband's dead, but we had a debt,

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:31.020
and the creditors are come, and now these creditors,

00:09:31.859 --> 00:09:35.859
they're going to come and take away my two sons,

00:09:35.859 --> 00:09:36.859
to be bondmen.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.960
How was it that this debt would be satisfied?

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.059
It would be through the sons becoming bondmen.

00:09:44.059 --> 00:09:46.020
That's a serious problem.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.260
Can you imagine the heartache of a wife losing her husband,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.179
and then as a mother, understanding that now

00:09:53.179 --> 00:09:54.880
she's gonna lose her children?

00:09:55.719 --> 00:09:56.640
I mean, can you put yourself in her situation

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.960
just for a moment?

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.960
I can't quite fully understand.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:05.120
didn't grasp the extent of her problem as it's revealed to us here, and quite frankly

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:11.560
it's one verse of Scripture, but yet we find the depth of the problem in which she faced.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:16.900
I'm thankful that I've never had to endure a problem such as this.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:21.200
In just a few weeks, Lord willing, Holly and I will celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.640
As you know, we celebrate it today, and very thankful for your kind words, 10 years here

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.400
as pastor, and it's kind of exciting.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.880
We now have pastored for half of our time of being married in this place, and that's

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:33.880
a wonderful blessing.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.000
We're very thankful for it.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.380
But I'm thankful that I've not had to experience the death of a spouse.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:50.640
Some have, and some can understand the heartache and the difficulty of that situation.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:56.600
She's lost her husband, but now it's very likely, it's very real in her life, that because

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.640
of this debt, the creditors have said, here's how we're going to solve this.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.840
Your two sons are going to become our bondmen.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.120
There's a problem.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.960
The problem's revealed to us in verse number one.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.560
We'll get to it at the end of the message, but you'll find that the problem is resolved

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.000
in verse number seven.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.680
I'm thankful for resolved problems, aren't you?

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:21.400
The reality is that we can look at our lives and we can say, we've encountered some storms

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:27.240
and we have faced some trials and we've dealt with some difficulties and we've had some

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:36.040
problems, but God has been faithful, and God has worked on our behalf, and God has shown

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:41.560
up and worked miraculously, and God has given wisdom, and God has provided, and God has

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.960
answered, and God has been God.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.400
I'm thankful for resolved problems.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:54.560
I've often said, in the world, there are a lot of problem identifiers, but there are

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.480
few problem solvers.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:02.640
The more time you spend in any role of leadership, the more you find that statement to be true.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.400
But the reality is that I'm thankful that our God is able to solve problems.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.400
Amen?

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.840
I mean, you say, I've got a problem.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.520
Well, God's able.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.800
It doesn't matter what your problem is, but pastor, you don't understand the extent of

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.920
my problem.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.680
It's okay because I'm not the one that's going to be able to solve your problem.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.760
Amen?

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.480
But God can.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.480
God can.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:28.720
Elisha, in of himself, was not going to be able to solve the problem of this woman.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.600
It was not within Elisha's power.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.480
It was not within, listen, Elisha didn't just say, pull out his billfold and say, okay,

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.480
how much is the debt?

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.480
Okay, here you go.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.480
Here's the money.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.480
Go take care of it.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.480
That's not what he does.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.480
Right?

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.640
So we find the problem.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.640
It's revealed.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.440
We'll know as we end the message this evening that it's resolved in verse number seven.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.920
But notice with me, not only the problem, but then right in the middle of our text,

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.440
there's the plan.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.440
The plan.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:03.880
Elisha said unto her, in verse number two, what shall I do for thee?

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:09.040
Tell me what hast thou in the house.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:17.720
She said, thine handmaid hath not anything in the house, save a pot of oil.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:22.080
In verses two through four, we'll see that the plan is explained.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:27.680
We'll find that here, Elisha is going to explain this plan to this woman that is dealing with

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.680
this problem that has now been given to Elisha.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.000
He says, what shall I do for thee?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.320
I think that if he stopped there for any length of time, that she would interject and say,

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.320
solve my problem.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.200
I mean, why I came to you for this reason, right?

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.160
And he says, what shall I do for thee?

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.360
And he then says this, what hast thou in thine house, in the house?

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.680
And she said, all I have is a pot of oil.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:58.680
He said this in verse number three, go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors,

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:05.720
even empty vessels, borrow not a few.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.720
Does that confuse you?

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.240
I mean, I understand we know the end of the story, but be in the position of this woman

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.880
for a moment.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.640
You go to Elisha, you're crying to the man of God, you've explained to him your problem,

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.200
it's been revealed to him.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.640
He's now said to you, what do you want me to do for you?

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.640
What do you have in the house?

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.800
And she says, all I have is a pot of oil.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.920
He says, okay, here's the plan.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.120
He's going to explain the plan.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.680
He says, I want you to go, and I want you to borrow vessels, and I want you to go abroad

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:37.600
of all thy neighbors, and I want you to get empty vessels, and he ends it with this statement,

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.480
borrow not a few.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.640
I like the details.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.920
If I could be honest and transparent with you this evening, if I were in these shoes,

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:51.240
and I've tried to do that as I study the scriptures, put myself into the accounts, I'd probably

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.060
go out and just borrow a couple.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.480
Why am I doing this?

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.440
It seems to be pointless.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:02.800
It seems to not have any regard to what I'm really dealing with.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.160
I mean, my problem is that my husband's dead.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.240
My problem is that my boys are going to become creditors.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.600
That's what this woman is facing in a problem.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.680
And the man of God says, go borrow some empty vessels.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.160
Borrow not a few.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.160
Borrow not a few.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.520
Then he says this, he continues to explain the plan in verse number four.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:33.480
It says this, and when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.480
thy sons.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:43.200
And notice what it says, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.120
aside that which is full.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.560
So you have this pot of oil.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.560
You've told me.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.560
I've asked, what do you have in the house?

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.560
I have nothing.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.200
So he gave a pot of oil, and he says, okay, go borrow vessels.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.520
Borrow not a few.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:03.320
And when you come back with all of those vessels, then I want you to shut the door.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:07.600
You and your sons will be in the house, and I want you to take that vessel that you have,

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.120
and I want you to pour out into all of these vessels that you've borrowed.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.600
And then when those vessels are full, then set those aside.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:25.480
Now, if you're a kind of an individual that likes to analyze things, and sometimes we

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.960
can have the paralysis of analysis, and we've talked about some of that, and you're just

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:35.080
kind of practical, you say, look, I know that that pot of oil that I have is not going to

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:40.080
fill up any number of empty vessels, right?

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:46.560
Human reasoning sometimes begins to prevail in the circumstances, begin to face our problems,

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:50.600
and we seek the face of God, and we say we have a problem, and we're looking for God's

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:55.760
Word to God's Word, and we're looking for God to provide us with answers, and God's

00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.640
Word has the answers, and we go to the Word of God, and we say, well, there's no way that

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.120
that can make sense.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:06.280
There's no way that that's going to work.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.200
His ways are not our ways.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.840
He says, lean not on thine own understanding in all thy ways, right?

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:13.840
Trust in the Lord, how?

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:18.320
In all thine heart, verse number five, and then he tells us that we're to lean not on

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:25.400
our own understanding, in all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:30.240
Do you think that this woman knew the size of the pot that she had at home?

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.720
Sure she did.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:39.480
You know as the individual that maybe if I would look at it as our home, Holly knows

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:44.000
the vessels that we have in our kitchen, right?

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.200
And I could say to Holly, what do we have?

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:50.800
And she knows the items that we have, and if she said she had a pot of oil, she'd know

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.480
about the size of the pot of oil.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.680
It's mindful of what we find back in 1 Kings chapter 17 with the widow woman at Zarephath,

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:03.840
and you think about the situation with the meal and Elisha, and she says, look, we're

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.300
going to go eat this meal, and we're going to die.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:11.900
We've got nothing left, and Elijah said, that's fine, but make for me first, right?

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:16.380
I mean, read 1 Kings 17.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.700
This woman knew the size of the pot that she had.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.140
The plan was explained.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:27.000
We find that the plan is then executed.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.059
I'm thankful for the obedience of this woman and her sons.

00:18:33.059 --> 00:18:39.500
Now, the Bible tells us that she went from him in verse number 5, and shut the door unto

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:45.020
her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her, and she poured out.

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:51.520
Now, it's only one verse of Scripture, verse number 5, but can you imagine the excitement

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.740
that must have taken place in that one verse of Scripture?

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.940
I don't know the duration of verse number 5.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:04.140
I don't know how long it took, but I know that the Bible says that she was given the

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:08.740
instruction of borrow not a few, and we find that it says when it came to pass in verse

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.780
number 6 that when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, bring me yet a

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:17.780
vessel, and he said unto her, there is not a vessel more.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.140
I mean, we borrowed every vessel we could find.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:26.179
We went to everyone, and the man of God said, borrow not a few, and we just brought everything

00:19:26.179 --> 00:19:28.740
we could get.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:33.940
And again, I don't know how long the process took, but can you imagine as mom is there

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.900
with these two boys, and they have all of these pots, and I hope in your sanctified

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:42.500
imagination this evening that you can see a vessel, a pot of oil, and you can see all

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:47.300
of these empty pots, and she says to her son, bring that one over, and she pours it out

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:51.780
and fills it up, and perhaps that vessel was bigger than even the vessel that she started

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.460
with, and she says, okay, bring another one, and they bring another one, and I mean, can

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.460
you imagine the excitement?

00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.900
How can this be?

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.740
Right?

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.820
But God, the provision of the Lord.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:12.620
I mean, every vessel is full.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:17.240
Boys, I need you to go get more.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.080
But there are no more.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.300
There are no more vessels for us to get.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.260
And the Bible ends in verse number 6 and says,

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:28.480
And the oil stayed, and the oil stayed.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.020
It wasted not.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.680
And I don't know, the Scriptures do not tell us

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.040
how many vessels were borrowed.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.640
The Bible doesn't tell us how many vessels were filled,

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.740
but the Bible, what it does tell us

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:46.920
is that all of them that were brought were full.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.980
Miraculous.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.920
Isn't that something that you'd like to see happen?

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.680
I mean, just see God work in a way in which

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.440
it can only be explained that God did it.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.400
I don't know how God did it.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:03.120
I don't know how God is moving in this situation,

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.400
but they're there, and they've shut the door,

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.160
and they're inside, and they filled up

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.360
all of these vessels.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.200
The plan was explained, and I'm thankful

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.680
that the plan was executed.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.120
There was obedience on the part of not only this woman,

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.760
but there was obedience on the part of her sons.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.320
Here's the thing about the sons.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.840
I'm sure that no son here has ever given their mom trouble.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.440
Ha, ha, ha.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.440
Right?

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.800
Sons sometimes have a way of giving mom trouble

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.800
when they won't give dad trouble in the same fashion.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.800
I was guilty of that.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.800
Dean's acknowledging.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.760
Absolutely.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.400
There were times in which I'd give mom trouble,

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.160
and she'd say, I'm going to call dad, and then all of a sudden,

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.280
just those few words changed the whole situation.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.320
Oh, please don't call dad.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.200
I mean, I'll do whatever you want me to do.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.200
I just get right in line with whatever the situation is,

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:56.680
right?

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.840
Because I don't want dad to be called, right?

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.760
Because that was bad news.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.320
There are times in which Joseph, he's sitting back there,

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.080
there are times in which Joseph will give Holly a hard time.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:13.080
And it's almost all I got to do is say, hey.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.960
And it's good.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.960
It's just good.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.240
It's amazing how it works.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.840
These boys, as far as we can tell from the Scriptures,

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.440
they just obey what mom said.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.320
You ever tell a boy to go clean his room?

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.280
Moms?

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.640
Go clean your room.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.320
Well, how do I got to clean my room?

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.520
It is clean.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.280
And then 42 seconds later, they come back.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.100
I'm done.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.440
You cleaned your room that fast?

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.080
Yeah.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.920
Come on, you guys got sons, right?

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.400
I mean, you know how it works.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.760
She'll borrow some vessels.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.560
What?

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.480
Why?

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.560
Well, is there any question?

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:59.440
The plan was explained by the man of God.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.160
And the plan was executed.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.400
We find that here in the text of Scripture,

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.480
there was obedience on the part of this woman that

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.440
cried unto Elisha.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.680
There was obedience on the part of the sons.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.000
They went out and they borrowed the vessels.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.640
They brought them in.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.560
As mom poured, they held and set aside.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.600
They got to see God work.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.600
We find that in verse number 7, the problem is resolved.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.120
I mentioned as part of the first point,

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:35.040
the Bible says, then she came and told the man of God.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.840
Can you imagine?

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.000
I mean, it's just a simple statement,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.440
but can you imagine the excitement

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.000
when she came back to Elisha?

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.760
I mean, in my mind's eye, I can only

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.080
see that this woman that came in verse number 1 crying

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.040
unto Elisha because of her problem,

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:53.120
that she now returns to Elisha with a level of excitement

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.200
of Elisha, Elisha, Elisha.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:55.960
Guess what?

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.960
We borrowed every vessel we could find,

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.200
and we took that pot of oil, and we did just like you said,

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:06.000
Elisha, and every vessel is full.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.840
And yet the oil stayed.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.000
Now what?

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.240
Now what do we do?

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.600
She comes to Elisha.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:22.200
And he says, go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:28.760
And then he says, and live thou and thy children of the rest.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:34.280
God provided in a miraculous way for this family.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.360
She came with a level of excitement in verse number 7.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.360
It's quite different than her approach in verse number 1,

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.680
when she's heavy hearted over her circumstances,

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.000
over her problem.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.200
Her problem that was revealed in verse number 1

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.800
is now resolved in verse number 7.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.520
We find that it's all because there

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:55.440
was a plan that was explained and a plan that was executed.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.240
And this evening, as we look at the problem

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:01.960
and the plan of 2 Kings 4, I'm mindful of a principle

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.200
that we must understand as we look here

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.360
to this Old Testament passage of Scripture

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.120
and seek to make application in our lives.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:14.800
The reality is that you have problems.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.360
I don't say that in a mean way.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.120
We all have problems.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.120
We have troubles.

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.160
Amen?

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.200
Your troubles, your problems differ

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.360
from what this lady experienced in 2 Kings 4.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.520
They differ from the person sitting behind you

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.800
or in front of you.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.520
But we have problems.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.980
And so what is a principle that we

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.680
can glean from this portion of Scripture

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.220
that we might be able to apply in our lives this evening?

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.560
Well, I would say this, that as we look at the principle

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.560
number 1, we must determine the plan of God.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.400
What is it that God wants us to do?

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.720
Just as this woman in her problem,

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.520
she sought the man of God.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.280
She went to the right source.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.160
She went to Elisha to find with her problem what

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.500
it was that she is to do.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.080
And we find as we look at the truth of being New Testament

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.480
believers that we can run to the cross,

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.560
that we can run to our Savior, that we

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.880
can take Him our problems and our troubles

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.480
and we can leave them with Him.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.160
And we can ask Him for wisdom and guidance and direction

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:17.120
for how to deal with the problems in which we encounter.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.800
We say, God, I want to determine Your plan.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.160
And we're seeking His face.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.560
It's aligned with what I preached this morning.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.600
Speak, Lord, for Thy servant here is.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.760
I want to know, God, what Your plan is.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.440
I want to know what You want me to do

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.920
and how You want me to operate.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.880
Remember, as we started this evening

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:38.760
with the quote that is attributed to Hudson Taylor

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:43.640
that God's work done God's way will never lack God's supply.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.800
Someone also said this, that many times when

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:55.400
we seek to engage in the work of God that we do our own work

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.200
and then we pray and ask God to bless it.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.920
They said a far better way is for us

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:04.720
to determine how God wants us to do His work

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.640
and then do it and pray that God blesses.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.080
See, there are times in which we will sit around

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.440
and we'll have discussion on what

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.120
we ought to do instead of just doing what we know

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.880
God's already told us to do.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.560
We've not determined the plan of God,

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.880
maybe because we don't like it.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.480
We've tried to reason through it.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.120
We've tried to come up with some other approach

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.280
on how to handle the problems in which we're facing.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:32.400
Listen, as a people we're facing problems, individuals,

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.920
families, churches, our nation.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.200
We have so many problems.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.400
And we must determine what the plan of God is.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.080
In your life, in your home, in our church,

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.360
we have to determine what is God's plan.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.760
Is God still on His throne?

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.240
Indeed.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.480
Is He still saving sinners?

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.080
Indeed.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.160
His hand is not slack.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.000
His hand is not short.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Amen?

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.520
We believe the Word of God.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.960
Listen, with all of the problems

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.880
I said this morning how that God will give us insight

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.680
with regard to future events as He did to Samuel

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:16.040
there in 1 Samuel 3, that as we look at those things

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.760
and we understand those things, we're

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.480
not to be downhearted over them.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.400
We're not to be discouraged over them.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.240
No, the admonition to the child of God

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:26.440
is to continue thou in the things which thou hast learned.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.680
To preach the Word, to be instant in season,

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.080
out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.840
We find that our job remains to keep our eyes upon Jesus,

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.520
to remain steadfast to the plan that He's given us to do.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.920
Determine the plan of God.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.360
When we determine the plan of God,

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:48.240
we need to do what God says.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.760
Sometimes that's the hardest part for us, is just doing.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.720
Just doing.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.760
There are things in our lives that we know we ought to do.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.640
There are things in our lives that we know that would benefit

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.600
us if we would do them, right?

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.760
We were in Missouri.

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.920
How many of you have ever been to Missouri?

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.559
It's one of the hilliest places I've ever been.

00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:11.800
Oh my word, man.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.680
There are hills everywhere.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.240
I mean, where we were in Branson,

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.520
there was no flat anything.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.559
I mean, it was just hill and hill and hill.

00:29:19.559 --> 00:29:22.280
And someone commented, Joseph, I think it was,

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.000
heard the guy say, I don't know how

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.559
anyone could be overweight in Branson.

00:29:26.559 --> 00:29:28.400
Because they were walking through the park

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.119
that we were in.

00:29:29.119 --> 00:29:31.800
And I mean, you're just up and down and up and down.

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.000
But the reality is that there are times in which we

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.840
know that there are some things that are good for us.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.600
There are some things that we ought to do

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.840
that we just don't do them.

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.400
The things that I would, I do not.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.600
Who said that?

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.760
Paul.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:44.720
Yeah?

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.160
The things that I would, I do not.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.280
The things that I would not, that I do.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.000
Right?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.040
And we see that there are times in which we know.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.680
We've been able to determine the plan of God.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.080
But the question is whether or not

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.320
we're doing what God has told us to do.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.760
Are we actually doing it?

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.300
are we being doers of the Word

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.560
and not hearers only?

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.820
See, what a shame it would have been

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:12.160
in 2 Kings 4 for this woman

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.300
to come to the man of God

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:17.620
to reveal the problem in which she was dealing with,

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.120
to tell him to pour out her heart

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.600
crying unto the man of God

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.460
and saying, listen, my husband's dead.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:24.500
We had a debt.

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.620
The creditor has come.

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.580
The two sons are going to become bondmen.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.980
I don't know what to do.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.340
I have nothing.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.740
There's no way I can pay it.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.420
And he gives her the plan.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.380
And how sad it would be

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.020
for her to just walk away and say,

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.740
well, that's a really good idea,

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:45.980
but I'm going to just try something else.

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.900
I don't think we would read 2 Kings 4

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.980
1-7 the same way.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.580
Do you?

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.180
I don't think we'd come to verse 7.

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.660
You know what I think we'd do?

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.940
If we really looked at this passage of Scripture

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.060
and dealt with it

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:01.860
in the way in which sometimes we behave

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.500
and I said we, I didn't say you,

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.060
I said we because I'm including myself in it,

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.100
is that we go and we seek

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.500
and we present our problem,

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.820
we seek direction,

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.500
we find out the plan,

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.940
and then we go and v. 5 would read,

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:18.020
so she went from him and did something else

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:21.020
or sought some other counsel.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.180
And it would not read in v. 5

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.900
that we went out and did

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.900
what we were told to do.

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.380
And without v. 5 and 6,

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.500
we do not have v. 7.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.660
In fact, in my humble opinion,

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.060
what you would find

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.100
is if we were to read this text of Scripture,

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.660
perhaps the way in which sometimes we

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:40.620
deal with the problems in our lives

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:41.900
is we determine the plan,

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.060
we're given information,

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.900
we're given a plan,

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.820
and we go and we try it some other way.

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:47.820
We do some other thing.

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:49.740
We rely on our own understanding.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.260
And then eventually what happens

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:52.740
is she's going to come back

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:53.660
to the man of God and say,

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.820
okay, what was that that you wanted me to do?

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:57.180
What was that that I was supposed to do?

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.620
You understand what I'm saying, right?

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:01.620
And the reality is that we don't read it that way.

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.980
And we have here before us a great example

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.940
of doing what God has said for us to do.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.340
God has set a premium on obedience.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:18.340
He has set a premium on obedience.

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.900
There are times in our lives

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:23.700
I've said to our children at various points

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:28.700
in parenting, just obey.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.300
It's so simple.

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.980
And every time, Armando, I make that statement,

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.180
the Lord smites me.

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.100
He just smites my heart.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.060
Why?

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:41.340
Because it's as if the Lord says, just obey.

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.460
It's so simple.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.900
Because I look at one of my children and I say,

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.580
I've told you exactly what it is that I want you to do.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:54.540
Why is it that you can't do what I'm telling you to do?

00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:00.300
Those of you with little kids, you understand how that works.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:02.260
Our kids are older now.

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:05.180
It doesn't happen in the same way, at least not as often.

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:12.100
But the reality is that God has given us His word.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:19.540
And He says to us, your job is to do it.

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.460
To do what I've commanded you to do.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:28.660
I'm mindful of what is said in the book of John.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.140
Turn over, if you will, to John chapter number two.

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.580
I'm gonna close with this.

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:38.620
The context is the first miracle.

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:40.700
Miracle in Cana.

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:43.100
The Lord Jesus Christ and His disciples

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.300
were called to the marriage.

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:50.300
The Bible tells us that His mother, Mary,

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:51.820
was there as well.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.140
Without getting into the content,

00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:01.540
the context specifically of this miracle,

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:07.620
I wanna take a phrase that's given to us in verse number five

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:12.620
and use it as a way of closing our service this evening.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.340
The Bible says in verse number five

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.300
that His mother saith unto the servants.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:26.100
Whatsoever He saith unto you, do it.

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:29.700
That's pretty clear, isn't it?

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:32.820
Do you know, if you're familiar with the content,

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.820
the context of this particular miracle,

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:36.660
what Jesus told them to do?

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.820
Really didn't make a whole lot of sense.

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:42.260
But they did it.

00:34:43.779 --> 00:34:46.260
And the Bible ends and tells us,

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.779
this was the beginning of miracles,

00:34:47.779 --> 00:34:49.140
but in this particular text,

00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:51.580
and I want you to note that it says

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:54.660
that the servants which drew the water knew.

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.700
See, they were doing what the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.619
God in flesh, told them to do.

00:35:00.619 --> 00:35:03.460
What great counsel that Mary gave to these servants.

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:07.420
Whatsoever He saith unto you, do it.

00:35:08.339 --> 00:35:12.500
For us, as the people of God in 2021,

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:16.540
we need to take that same counsel.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:19.059
Say, whatsoever He saith unto you, do it.

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.619
Say, yeah, yeah, but it doesn't work anymore.

00:35:22.619 --> 00:35:23.460
Says who?

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:26.860
If it wasn't gonna work anymore,

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.820
God would've given us an updated Bible.

00:35:29.779 --> 00:35:30.619
Amen?

00:35:30.619 --> 00:35:31.980
God would've said, these things are gonna work

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:33.100
in these particular eras,

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.220
and then when you get to this era,

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:36.300
then start doing this, and then change and do this.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.460
No, this is God's work.

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:41.700
And we must do God's work God's way.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:43.540
Amen?

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:49.100
Pragmatism is not the plan that we seek to embrace

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.020
or to implement.

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:55.059
No, we desire to know what is God's plan.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.700
I'm thankful for this portion of scripture

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:00.059
in 2 Kings 4.

00:36:00.059 --> 00:36:02.140
I know it's a familiar passage,

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.820
but I hope tonight that you've been encouraged

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:08.420
by seeing how God is able to work the provision of the Lord.

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:10.820
I don't know what your problem is.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.820
You don't know what all my problems are.

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:16.619
And it's not necessary for us to have a session

00:36:16.619 --> 00:36:18.900
in which we all share our problems with each other

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.059
and feel bad for each other.

00:36:21.059 --> 00:36:22.300
No, no.

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.260
Seek God.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:28.820
Take it to the Lord, casting all your cares upon him.

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:29.660
Why?

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.339
For he careth for you.

00:36:31.339 --> 00:36:33.820
Aren't you thankful that he cares about you?

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:36.020
You know that he knows what your problem is?

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.940
You say, I don't wanna tell anybody my problem.

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.900
He already knows what your problem is, right?

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.740
He already knows.

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:45.860
So what are you embarrassed about?

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.580
What are you ashamed of?

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.180
Just pour your heart out to God.

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.820
How many times do we see in the Psalms

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:54.300
where the psalmist is transparent with the Lord?

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.460
Help, Lord.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:56.940
I don't know what to do.

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.740
You ever feel that way?

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.540
Sometimes when I pray, I just say, God, I'm stupid.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:03.059
I know we're not supposed to say that word for little kids.

00:37:03.059 --> 00:37:04.580
I'm sorry, forgive me.

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:07.580
But I truly, I say, God, I just don't know what to do.

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.180
Are you ever there in your life?

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.619
I don't know what to do.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:16.619
But God, I know that you're the omniscient God.

00:37:16.619 --> 00:37:20.260
And I know that you have a plan and you have a purpose.

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.980
And God, I desire to hear,

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:28.140
to do your work, your plan.

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:29.940
The provision of the Lord.

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:33.140
Listen, he's never failed and he's not gonna begin failing.

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.339
Amen?

00:37:35.339 --> 00:37:36.540
The provision of the Lord.

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:41.300
God's work done God's way will never lack God's supply.

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:42.140
Let's pray together.

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.380
Father, we love you.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.059
We thank you for loving us.

00:37:46.059 --> 00:37:48.380
Thank you for this Old Testament account.

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:49.980
Familiar passage of scripture.

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.660
But oh, how your word is a living book.

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.460
Ministers to our hearts.

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:58.200
Helps us in our time of need.

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:01.100
I pray that somehow, someway tonight,

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:04.339
you've used your word to help someone.

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.500
I know that we have problems.

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:13.420
We know that you have a plan.

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:17.740
I pray that you would help us to determine

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.660
what your plan is and then to do it.

00:38:22.339 --> 00:38:24.140
We think about those words of Mary,

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:27.779
whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.740
Help us, God, to do,

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:36.419
to fulfill the work, the plan that you've given us to do.

00:38:37.299 --> 00:38:39.020
Would you move and work as only you can.

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.419
We give you the honor and glory for it.

00:38:40.419 --> 00:38:41.260
In Christ's name we pray.

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:42.460
Would you stand with us?
