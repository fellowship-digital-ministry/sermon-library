1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,039
evening, Genesis chapter number 28, Genesis chapter number 28 tonight, and we'll finish

2
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:06,079
this chapter.

3
00:00:06,079 --> 00:00:11,359
We started last Sunday evening looking at the first nine verses of Genesis chapter 28

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:14,640
and be looking at verses 10 through 22 this evening.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,719
And we've noted, of course, as we've studied through these last several chapters of the

6
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,440
book of Genesis, things with regard to the life of Jacob.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,840
And now the focus, of course, had shifted from Abraham to Isaac, and now it's going

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,799
to shift from Isaac to Jacob, and begin to follow his life over the next several chapters

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,040
and look at all that takes place.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,840
In fact, his death, of course, recorded near the end of the book of Genesis.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,840
And as we look at the passage of Scripture this evening and looking at the life of Jacob,

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,040
of course, I mentioned this even this morning, that the events previously recorded to this

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,000
passage of Scripture have resulted in Jacob, of course, leaving home, being instructed

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,520
to do so.

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,360
And he's received that instruction in our previous text of Scripture.

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,360
But it's interesting because really up to this point in the life of Jacob, there's really

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:09,559
nothing of any significance in his life with regard to spiritual aspect, right?

18
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:15,519
The spiritual aspect in Jacob's life, there's really nothing of significance in the Scriptures.

19
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,919
It was in the 25th chapter of the book of Genesis that we read of the birth of Jacob.

20
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,919
It was in the 25th chapter at the end of the chapter that we read how that he obtained

21
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:25,919
Esau's birthright.

22
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:30,239
It was in chapter number 26 where the family is in Gerar.

23
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,080
Remember, there was a famine.

24
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,279
And it's interesting because all of the chapter, chapter number 26, there's not one reference

25
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:41,160
to Jacob in the entire chapter.

26
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:47,239
And much there about Isaac and all that takes place and the interactions with the Philistines

27
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,239
and what have you.

28
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,120
So there's nothing that is specifically mentioned about Jacob.

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,040
And then of course, as we've studied chapter number 27 over the last several Sunday evenings,

30
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,440
we've had the opportunity to see that it was in that chapter where there's much deception

31
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,599
and carnality on the part of Jacob.

32
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,720
We come to Genesis chapter 28.

33
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,039
We read how that as we studied last week that Isaac called Jacob, he blessed him, and he

34
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,039
charged him.

35
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,520
It's interesting because God records for us that as Jacob is receiving this charge from

36
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,199
Isaac in verse number three, it says, and God Almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful.

37
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,360
It's interesting.

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,759
That's the God's name, El Shaddai, the Lord God Almighty.

39
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:33,559
And of course, God had revealed himself to Abraham and as being El Shaddai back in Genesis

40
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:34,559
chapter number 17.

41
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:41,039
And so it's interesting that God uses Isaac to give this charge to Jacob and he hears

42
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,300
those words.

43
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,520
He speaks to him about a blessing, but we find that as we pick it up this evening in

44
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,639
verse number 10, the Bible says that Jacob went out from Beersheba and he went toward

45
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,039
Haran and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the sun

46
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,039
was set.

47
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,559
And he took the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that

48
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:00,479
place to sleep.

49
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,479
It says in verse number 12 that he dreamed and behold, a ladder set up on the earth and

50
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,919
the top of it reached to heaven.

51
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:09,759
Behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.

52
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:15,440
And behold, the Lord stood above it and said, and we're going to look at all that he said

53
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,759
I'm going to pause there and give you the title for the message we'll dig in tonight.

54
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,039
The Lord spoke to Jacob.

55
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:25,100
What a blessing to think about God speaking to his people.

56
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,399
What a blessing to consider this evening that we have the written Word of God, the complete

57
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:36,000
Word of God, the whole canon of Scripture and that God uses his Word in our lives.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,720
God speaks to us through his Word.

59
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,800
We understand that Jacob did not have a Bible as we have a Bible.

60
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,679
The Lord speaks to Jacob and I'm thankful that every time that I open the pages of this

61
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:49,080
precious book, that God Almighty speaks to me.

62
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
That's wonderful.

63
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
It's precious.

64
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,800
I mentioned to somebody as they were leaving this morning, of course, I preached on prayer

65
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,119
this morning and we just had a brief conversation with someone as they were leaving.

66
00:03:58,119 --> 00:04:04,039
And I said, you know, the reality is at least I will be very transparent with you this evening.

67
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:07,639
It is easier for me, that's what I said to the person at the back door this morning.

68
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:12,559
It is much easier for me to read the Word of God than it is for me to pray.

69
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:13,800
It's just the way it is in my life.

70
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
I don't know.

71
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,000
You might say it's easier for me to pray than it is to read.

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But I have no problem.

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,119
I can sit down and read the Bible for an hour, for longer.

74
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,279
I can just read and read.

75
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,239
I love reading the Bible.

76
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:27,079
But it just seems like every time you go to pray, there's just distraction.

77
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,079
I pray.

78
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,200
I'm not suggesting I don't pray.

79
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm saying that it's easier for me to read than it is for praying.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,679
It's more natural for me.

81
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:37,160
Every time I open the Word of God, God speaks to me.

82
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,160
And I love it.

83
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
It's precious.

84
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,679
And here in this passage of Scripture, the Bible tells us no longer is Jacob receiving

85
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:47,279
something from Isaac with regard to God.

86
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,160
Now God is speaking directly to Jacob.

87
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,239
And that's exciting to me.

88
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:53,000
It's encouraging to me.

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,040
And what a blessing to think about the truth of this passage of Scripture and to think

90
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,739
about the way in which God reveals great truth to Jacob.

91
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:06,980
If you're taking notes this evening, notice in verses 10 and 11, as we begin looking through

92
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,700
this passage, his departure.

93
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,500
Very quickly, not much that we'll discuss here.

94
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,500
But I do want you to note that the Bible says that he went out from Beersheba and he went

95
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,739
toward Haran.

96
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:18,619
Now Haran was the chief city of Paddan Aram.

97
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:24,579
And according to verse number two of Genesis 28, he was instructed by his father Isaac

98
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:29,859
to go to Paddan Aram and to the house of Bethuel, thy mother's father, and take thee a wife

99
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,019
from then, so the daughters of Laban, thy mother's brother.

100
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:37,140
And so we see that in verse number 10, that when the Bible tells us that he went out from

101
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,260
Beersheba and he went toward Haran, that he went in obedience.

102
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,140
He followed the instruction that had been given.

103
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:49,380
And what a blessing, because we find that it's very important where he finds himself

104
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:55,260
here in this passage of Scripture and how God appears to him and God speaks to him.

105
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:00,380
And I find that that act of obedience that begins our portion of Scripture, our study

106
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,940
this evening, is of great significance and it's of great importance.

107
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,859
We find that the Bible tells us that he alighted upon a certain place.

108
00:06:07,859 --> 00:06:10,959
He tarried there all night because the sun was set.

109
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,059
It tells us that he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and

110
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:18,540
he laid down in that place to sleep.

111
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:24,179
And we find that his departure is recorded very quickly and we see that what notes that,

112
00:06:24,179 --> 00:06:29,380
what's important about those verses is you note the obedience of Jacob.

113
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:34,059
As we look at verses 12 down through verse number 15, I want you to capture with me and

114
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:35,679
look at the dream.

115
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:38,220
We see his departure, but we see his dream.

116
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,880
In verse number 12, we see what Jacob saw in this dream.

117
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,820
The Bible says that he dreamed, and behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top

118
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,220
of it reached to heaven.

119
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,579
Behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it.

120
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:58,820
So you see, as God would allow us by recorded, written word of God to allow us to see and

121
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,540
to hear, to understand what it was that Jacob dreamed in this passage of Scripture.

122
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,579
And it's very interesting because the Bible says that he sees this ladder that was set

123
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:10,619
up on the earth, and it says that the top of it reached to heaven.

124
00:07:10,619 --> 00:07:16,299
And I want you to notice, the Bible says that the angels of God ascending and descending

125
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:18,739
on it, on that ladder.

126
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,660
We find that this is what he saw.

127
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:24,500
So it's interesting, hold your place here, but turn to the book of John very quickly,

128
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,500
if you will.

129
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,500
The gospel of John.

130
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,459
And I want you to look in the first chapter of the gospel of John.

131
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:35,700
And you look in this first chapter, and remember, it was John the Baptist that spoke about Jesus

132
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:40,299
Christ being the Lamb of God, according to verse number 36.

133
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:45,519
And the Bible tells us that there were some that followed after Jesus, and there's some

134
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,700
interaction that takes place.

135
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,660
Remember, Jesus asked them, what seek ye?

136
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:56,179
And they told him in verse number 38 that they said unto him, where dwellest thou?

137
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:58,579
And he said to them in verse 39, come and see.

138
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:04,959
And we find that there's reference here with regard to Andrew and Simon Peter.

139
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,519
But skip down, if you will.

140
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:11,500
And I want you to notice in verse number 46, it says, in Nathanael, let me say in verse

141
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,980
45, because Philip findeth Nathanael and saith unto him, we have found him of whom Moses

142
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:22,420
and the law and the prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.

143
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,980
Nathanael said unto him, can any good thing come out of Nazareth?

144
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,899
Philip saith unto him, come and see.

145
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:34,780
Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and saith unto him, verse 47, behold, an Israelite indeed

146
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,020
in whom is no guile.

147
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,500
Nathanael said unto him, whence knowest thou me?

148
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,780
Jesus answered and said unto him, before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the

149
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,340
fig tree, I saw thee.

150
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,739
That's how Nathanael answers in verse 49.

151
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:53,260
He answers and says, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God.

152
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,219
Thou art the King of Israel.

153
00:08:56,219 --> 00:09:00,380
Jesus answers, and I want you to see what he says here in verse 50, and especially in

154
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,460
verse number 51 as it pertains to this dream that Jacob had.

155
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,219
In verse number 50, Jesus answered unto him, because I said unto thee, I saw thee under

156
00:09:08,219 --> 00:09:10,979
the fig tree, believest thou?

157
00:09:10,979 --> 00:09:15,659
Thou shalt see greater things than these, and he saith unto him, verily, verily, of

158
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:23,580
a truth of a truth, I say unto you, hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of

159
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:31,299
God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.

160
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:37,619
That ladder that Jacob saw in our passage of Scripture in Genesis 28, that's no other

161
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,780
than Jesus Christ.

162
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,580
He says he's the Son of Man, amen?

163
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,419
And it says that you're going to see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and

164
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,340
descending upon the Son of Man.

165
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,460
In Genesis chapter 28, in verse number 12, it says that he dreamed, and behold, a ladder

166
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,119
set up on the earth, and the top of it reached heaven, and behold, the angels of God ascending

167
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:58,179
and descending on it.

168
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:00,059
And Jesus ties it.

169
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:05,659
in with Nathanael in John chapter 1 and verse number 51, all the way back to this dream of

170
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:11,339
Jacob in Genesis chapter 28, and what precious truth that we see there. And so as we consider

171
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:16,539
this dream this evening, we note first of all what he saw, but I want you to pay close attention to

172
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:22,539
what he heard. Beginning in verse number 13 and down through verse number 15, Jacob heard some

173
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:29,019
powerful truth. The Bible says, and behold, the Lord stood above it and said, and God Almighty

174
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:38,059
is going to speak to him. And look, notice first of all that what he heard was regarding a place

175
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:45,259
in verse number 13. It says, I am the Lord God of Abraham, thy father, the God of Isaac, the land

176
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:53,499
whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it and to thy seed. We find that Jacob hears the voice of

177
00:10:53,579 --> 00:11:00,699
God. He follows, he departs, he goes toward Haran as he had been instructed to do so, and he goes

178
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:05,979
to sleep, and he dreams a dream, and we see the vision that he saw, but we note what he heard and

179
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:12,139
how the Lord spoke to him and gave him precious promises. And he begins in verse number 13

180
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:17,819
regarding a place, a land, and we know that this goes back to the Abrahamic covenant. We understand

181
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:23,659
that as we've studied in weeks gone by the details of the Abrahamic covenant, we see here

182
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:33,339
that God says to Jacob, I am the Lord God of Abraham, thy father, the God of Isaac, the land

183
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:41,019
whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it and to thy seed. Notice he continues in verse number 14,

184
00:11:41,979 --> 00:11:48,220
not only regarding a place, but now regarding a person, and that person being the Lord. Notice it

185
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:54,059
says, and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west,

186
00:11:54,059 --> 00:12:01,180
to the east, to the north, and to the south, and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families

187
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:07,339
of the earth be blessed. Of course, we understand seed plural with regard to the nation of Israel,

188
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:13,979
but when we think about seed singular, as God spoke to Abraham, remember in Galatians 3 in

189
00:12:13,979 --> 00:12:20,779
verse number 16, he says, I did not say seeds, but seed, speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ.

190
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:27,500
And what great truth. Of course, we know that Jacob would be married, he'd have the sons,

191
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:33,259
the tribes of Israel, so on and so forth. But we find that as he gives them this promise,

192
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:37,179
he talks about the way in which they'd spread abroad to the west, east, north, and south.

193
00:12:37,739 --> 00:12:44,380
But we think specifically about the promised Messiah, the messianic prophecy and the promise

194
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:50,539
and the line that I mentioned already in Galatians 3 in verse number 16, and what a precious truth.

195
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:58,619
And so as we begin to focus in and we see that Jacob, he goes to this place and he lies down

196
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:05,099
to sleep and he has this dream. And as he has this dream, he hears the voice of God. God begins

197
00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:11,899
to speak to him. God begins to reveal truth to him. We would say that God begins to reveal his

198
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:18,300
plan to him. In verse number 15, we find that he gives them truth regarding his plan and his

199
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:24,300
presence. He is now speaking about Jacob's life specifically. Notice in verse 15,

200
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:29,179
what encouraging promises are received here in this verse of Scripture.

201
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:37,419
And behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest,

202
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:41,899
and will bring thee again into this land, for I will not leave thee

203
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:49,899
until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. Isn't that precious? Isn't that encouraging?

204
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:57,020
How often we go to the Word of God and we are reminded of the precious truth of God giving

205
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:03,739
his promise with regard to his presence and how that he says, I will be with thee. We understand

206
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:08,940
that we have that great promise of Hebrews 13 in verse number 5 when the Word of God tells us,

207
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:15,419
I will never leave thee nor forsake thee, and how wonderful that truth is and how impactful that is.

208
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:20,619
I've often said over the years that the promise of his presence brings comfort in the life of the

209
00:14:20,619 --> 00:14:26,619
believer, and certainly that's true because we know, even as the psalmist says in Psalm 23,

210
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,980
that yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, why,

211
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:41,419
for thou art with me. And to know his presence is so encouraging. And that's how God starts out

212
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:50,059
when he speaks about the land and about the seed, and he then talks about the life of Jacob and his

213
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:57,660
presence, and he starts in verse 15 and says, and behold, I am with thee. Wow, that's precious.

214
00:14:58,859 --> 00:15:06,059
He says this, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest. Now, that's encouraging,

215
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:11,579
isn't it? And you think about the promise that God gives to Joshua in Joshua chapter number 9,

216
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:17,179
or Joshua chapter number 1, excuse me, with regard to going in and conquering the land,

217
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:21,660
and that God said he was going to be with them. And as he went through that place and fulfilled

218
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:27,019
the plan of God in his life for the nation of Israel, that God Almighty would be with him.

219
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:33,339
And here Jacob is receiving this promise that I am with thee, and I will keep thee in all places

220
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:39,339
whither thou goest. But then he tells them this, and I will bring thee again into this land.

221
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:45,419
I'll bring thee again into this land. And then he says this, for I will not leave thee

222
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:54,380
until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. These are encouraging promises.

223
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:59,980
And I want you to think about Jacob in this situation, and I want you to think about his

224
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,540
life up to this point, and all that we've studied, and all that we've seen. And again,

225
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,179
as I mentioned by way of introduction, there's very little of any spiritual significance that's

226
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:13,899
mentioned in the life of Jacob. I mean, we read of his birth, and then right after his birth,

227
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:18,619
you read how he's swindling his brother out of his birthright, and then you read about the

228
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:24,619
time in Gerar, and there's no reference whatsoever to Jacob. And then you read about his deception

229
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:28,940
and his carnality in chapter 27, and how he takes the blessing, and so on and so forth.

230
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,779
And there's really nothing of any significance from a spiritual perspective.

231
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:42,059
And now God Almighty has appeared to him, and God has spoken to him, and God is revealing himself.

232
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:49,419
He says, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, as he begins speaking to him in verse number 13,

233
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:55,339
and how that sets the record straight and helps Jacob to understand all of what he's experiencing

234
00:16:55,339 --> 00:17:00,779
in this moment. And God gives him these encouraging promises, and it's God who is

235
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:08,220
the eternal God that is able to make these kind of promises, that's able to say to Jacob that,

236
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:14,059
I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. And it reveals,

237
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:19,980
it reminds us of the power of God to accomplish his purpose and his will in our lives.

238
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:25,419
I'm so thankful this evening that God has a purpose and a will for your life and for my life.

239
00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:31,980
We find that the Word of God tells in the book of Philippians that he's begun a good work in us,

240
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:37,579
but he's going to continue it until the day of Jesus Christ and how precious that is. And it's

241
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:41,820
interesting because Paul says it this way under the inspirational Holy Spirit of God, being

242
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:48,619
confident of this thing, having the confidence to know that God is working and moving in our

243
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:55,660
lives and that he has a purpose for everything that we deal with. He's growing us. He's developing

244
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:04,540
us. And we find here that God Almighty gives these promises to Jacob. And we think about the point

245
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:10,220
where we are here at this passage of Scripture in the life of Jacob and you, yes, his departure,

246
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:16,299
but now his dream, and how he would respond and how this would impact his life. And I believe

247
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:22,220
that it had a profound impact in the life of Jacob, as we will see in the next verses of

248
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:28,139
Scripture that we'll look to. And we see that in these verses of Scripture that it's so well laid

249
00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:35,900
out as to how impactful this was in the life of Jacob. You remember the day in your life when

250
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:41,020
you met the Lord, you understood who he was, and you understood his plan for your life after

251
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:48,380
your salvation and understanding how he loved you and the promises. And here we find that Jacob

252
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:55,659
has this time with the Lord and his, really, I would use the terminology from a New Testament

253
00:18:55,659 --> 00:19:04,539
perspective, his conversion here in this passage of Scripture. As you continue and we focus our

254
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:12,619
attention on verses 16 through 22, I want you to notice his declarations. His departure, his dream,

255
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:17,580
and his declarations. Really, four things in which I've noted as I've looked at these verses

256
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:24,380
of Scripture to deal with what it is that he, Jacob, declares. First of all, I want you to

257
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,260
notice what he says in verse 16, and Jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said, notice what he said,

258
00:19:29,979 --> 00:19:36,940
"'Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.'" Now think about that. He said,

259
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:44,539
the Lord is in this place, Jehovah God. And he recognized, remember, as he went to that place,

260
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:49,340
as he lighted upon a certain place, according to verse number 11, I don't think he really thought

261
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:53,820
of any significance of the place where he lay. I don't think there was anything, really, that he

262
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,700
anticipated happening. He was on a journey. He was heading towards Haran. He was following the

263
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,140
direction of his...

264
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:06,440
father, no doubt there were various levels of emotions that Jacob would have been dealing

265
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,440
with.

266
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,360
He's leaving his home, he's leaving all that he knows, he's leaving not only the security

267
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:18,360
of his home and the people that he's close with, his mother, and so on and so forth.

268
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:24,160
He's got on his mind, no doubt, the thought of Esau's hatred and all of those things that

269
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,600
are happening and all of the emotions that take place, and he takes his journey.

270
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,280
He's wearied, he's going to sleep, I don't think he anticipates anything taking place

271
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:40,440
as we see here where he says, surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.

272
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,080
Surely the Lord is in this place.

273
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:48,640
Man, this was impactful in the life of Jacob, but I want you to notice what he continues

274
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,640
to say.

275
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:56,700
It says that here in verse 17, he was afraid and said, how dreadful is this place.

276
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:02,520
This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.

277
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,620
I want you to consider with me his response when it says that he was afraid and said,

278
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,100
how dreadful is this place.

279
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:14,460
The reality is that when you consider being in the presence of God and you understand

280
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:22,860
how awesome he is and how wonderful he is, that we respond in a response of reverence,

281
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,920
a response of awe.

282
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,520
We understand that he is God.

283
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,840
And here the Bible tells us that he says, this is none other but the house of God, and

284
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,120
this is the gate of heaven.

285
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,600
This is that second declaration that this is the house of God.

286
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,680
Notice what he does because of what he had recognized.

287
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,040
In verse number 18, it says that he rose up early in the morning.

288
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,920
Now there's a note there for us to understand the urgency in which he was operating, that

289
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,640
he rose early in the morning.

290
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,580
This was an immediate response.

291
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,340
He wasn't going to just kind of lay around and think about it and muse upon it.

292
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:04,620
He had this dream, God had spoken to him, and now he's going to respond.

293
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,880
He rises up early.

294
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,940
Notice it says in verse 18 that he took the stone that he had put for his pillows and

295
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:18,800
he set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it, a process of consecration.

296
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:26,160
We notice that in verse number 18, he pours that oil upon the top of it in this act of

297
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:31,320
consecration, and he's understanding that this is the house of God.

298
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,320
This is the place.

299
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,160
Remember, he made that declaration in verse number 16, surely the Lord is in this place,

300
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,500
and I knew it not.

301
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,040
In verse number 19, he calls the place Bethel.

302
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,400
Notice what he says, and he called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the

303
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,440
city was called Luz at the first.

304
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,640
So he gives this name of this place Bethel, this place where he set up this pillar, this

305
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,720
place in which he's poured the oil on top of the pillar, the place in which he's referred

306
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,400
to as being the house of God.

307
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:11,600
In fact, the word Bethel literally means house of God.

308
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,280
You see the impact that this event has had in the life of Jacob.

309
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,520
You see the way in which he's responding to what he's experienced, and you see how that

310
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,840
he's immediately taking action and the changes.

311
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,760
We don't see this type of behavior in the life of Jacob prior to this, do we?

312
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,440
You don't see this kind of behavior in the life of Jacob.

313
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,520
As we've studied the previous chapters, as we've studied the life of Jacob and the little

314
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,040
bit that God has given us, and especially in chapter 27 with so much provided to us

315
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,360
about the life of Jacob, you see no types of responses like this.

316
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,920
You see no recognition of God being God and what His plan and His purpose is, and we find

317
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,280
that Jacob is now responding and behaving in a different way.

318
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:00,400
He's a changed man because of what he experienced.

319
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,120
We think about this change and how it's evidenced through these declarations and through his

320
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:10,240
behavior, and no doubt when we think about our lives and we think about our conversion

321
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,000
and we think about the day in which we met the Lord Jesus Christ, there's some changes

322
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
in our life.

323
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Amen?

324
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,880
I'm not the person I used to be.

325
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,080
Aren't you glad that you're not the person you used to be?

326
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,680
Man, we sing the song with the kids and we talk about there's been a great change since

327
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,360
I've been born again, and we talk about the things that I used to do, I don't do them

328
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,480
anymore, the places I used to go, I don't go there anymore, the things I used to say.

329
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,240
We sing all of those and we deal with all of that.

330
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,240
Why?

331
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,840
Because there's been a great change since I've been born again.

332
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,680
Do you not see in the behavior of Jacob that there's a change?

333
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,800
He's a changed man.

334
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:52,320
We think about this change and we think about these declarations, we find that he understands

335
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,320
that he's in the place of God, that this is the house of God.

336
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:00,760
He sets up this pillar, and then notice that he vows a vow, he makes a vow, and really

337
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,360
there's multiple aspects of it in verses 20-22, but I want you to notice what he says

338
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:11,900
and how he's responding and how his response, again, gives further evidence to the change

339
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,400
in his life.

340
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:19,280
The Bible says that Jacob vowed a vow saying, if God will be with me and will keep me in

341
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:24,920
this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on so that I come

342
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,960
again to my father's house in peace, then shall the Lord be my God.

343
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,760
Now, I want to break this down for you in verse 20 and 21, and I want you to understand

344
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,200
something that's very significant and very important as we seek to interpret this passage

345
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,320
of Scripture.

346
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,720
In verse number 20, when Jacob vowed a vow and he said, if, that word, if, is different

347
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,360
than how we typically use the word, if.

348
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,280
That word, if, is, in what you just said, it's since.

349
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:59,160
The idea, the understanding is that Jacob is saying, since God will be with me.

350
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,200
He's not saying, he's not laying out there and says, okay, well, if God is going to do

351
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,460
all of these things, then I will do this.

352
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,120
He's not wheeling and dealing with God.

353
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,360
There's some people that kind of have that approach in life.

354
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,760
There's some people that kind of, God, if you get me out of this, then I'll do that,

355
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,760
and if you do this for me, then I'll do this.

356
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
That's not how God works.

357
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,760
It's not a barter system.

358
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,280
It's just not how it works with God, amen?

359
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:28,920
And we find that here, Jacob is not using the word as we often use it in our today's

360
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,920
language.

361
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,880
In fact, when you study through the Old Testament and the Hebrew language in particular, this

362
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:39,540
word, if, it carries with it, and actually through context, you can easily determine

363
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:45,000
if it's meaning if, as in if something's going to happen or if this happens, or if it's carrying

364
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,320
it with that idea of since.

365
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,240
In fact, in the New Testament, it's the same way.

366
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,200
You remember in the passage of Scripture in 1 Thessalonians 4.

367
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,400
Let me just quickly go there for you, and I'll just give you this side note, not really

368
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,040
part of the message, but hopefully it'll be a blessing to you.

369
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:04,080
1 Thessalonians chapter number 4, and we see this in the New Testament as well, where he

370
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:10,440
uses this terminology, and we find that he's given the great promise with regard to the

371
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:15,840
return of the Lord, and he says in verse number 13, but I would not have you to be ignorant,

372
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,800
brethren, 1 Thessalonians 4 and verse 13, concerning them which are asleep, that ye

373
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,440
sorrow not even as others which have no hope, for if we believe that Jesus died and rose

374
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,440
again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.

375
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,360
That word if, in verse number 14, is since.

376
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,280
Since we believe that Jesus died and rose again.

377
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,720
He's not saying if we believe this.

378
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,560
It's already been understood that they believe this truth, right?

379
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,840
Paul's not now wavering at some level.

380
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:47,080
The church in Thessalonica is not wavering at some level with regard to the death and

381
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,640
burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ, but he's saying since we believe this, based upon

382
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,880
our belief, understanding this great truth, here's how it impacts us, and so Jacob is

383
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,400
using the word in that sense, and it says, if God, since God will be with me.

384
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,700
Now where do you get this idea?

385
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,800
Verse number 15, right?

386
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Remember the promises that God gave him?

387
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:16,240
Remember we mentioned that dream, what he saw, but we mentioned specifically what he

388
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:24,040
heard, and the significance of what Jacob heard God say, and as God is speaking to him,

389
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,160
and God speaks to him about a seed and about a land, but God speaks to him about his own

390
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,920
life, and he tells him that Jacob, I'm going to be with thee, and I will keep thee in all

391
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:38,359
places where thou goest, and now Jacob is saying, as he vows this vow to the Lord, he

392
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:46,440
says, since God will be with me, and since he will keep me in this way that I go, and

393
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:52,960
he will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on, listen, our God's a good God.

394
00:28:52,960 --> 00:29:01,000
He takes good care of us, and Jacob has been impacted by what he heard God say.

395
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,320
Listen, I would say it this way for us as New Testament believers, he had faith in what

396
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,720
God said.

397
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,980
Amen?

398
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:16,020
He believed that God said to him, I will be with thee, and Jacob said, I believe that.

399
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:23,700
I believe that God made this promise to me, and I'm trusting the faithful God.

400
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,859
And that's precious.

401
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:32,299
He's going out, now, from the best of our knowledge as we look at the biblical history,

402
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:36,059
we know that he's been turned in the direction in which he's to go, he's been given that

403
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:41,420
instruction by Isaac, and he knows the home in which he's going to go, but as best as

404
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,940
we know, he doesn't even know his uncle.

405
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:50,020
There's no record of any family reunions that took place that we read of, and he's going

406
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:57,140
out, but God says, I'm going to be with you, and I'm going to provide for you.

407
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,420
I'm going to not leave you.

408
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,179
I'm going to...

409
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:06,659
fulfill my purpose in you." And Jacob believes God. He has faith in what God

410
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:12,419
said. The Bible says that he continues and he says, so that I come again in

411
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:16,859
verse number 21, to my father's house in peace. Now, notice what he says at the

412
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:23,099
end of verse number 21, then shall the Lord be my God. I want you to think about

413
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:28,339
the personal nature of this. Because when God first speaks to him in verse number

414
00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:37,419
13, he says, I am the Lord God of Abraham my father and the God of Isaac. We know

415
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:43,219
that Abraham's his grandfather. The Word of God uses that phraseology often and

416
00:30:43,219 --> 00:30:49,139
it's, there's no error, there's no discrepancy. But God, Jehovah, he was

417
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:55,939
Isaac's God, he was Abraham's God. And we find that now Jacob is making this great

418
00:30:55,979 --> 00:31:00,939
declaration and he's acknowledging the fact that the Lord is going to be my God.

419
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:07,299
You know how important it is for every individual to come to the place where

420
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:16,099
they acknowledge that he's my God? I know it seems maybe a little bit basic and

421
00:31:16,099 --> 00:31:21,699
elementary, but the reality is that God has no grandchildren. He only has

422
00:31:21,699 --> 00:31:28,699
children. Amen? And I understand for you grandparents out there, you love

423
00:31:28,699 --> 00:31:32,259
grandchildren, you think grandchildren are wonderful and all of the blessings

424
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:37,939
of grandchildren, and I get it, but the reality is that God has no grandchildren.

425
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:44,379
He only has children. And there has to come a point in your life when your

426
00:31:44,379 --> 00:31:49,979
parents' God is your God. There comes a point in our lives where it's no longer

427
00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:54,939
that it's just the God of my father, it's not just the the God of my mother, but we

428
00:31:54,939 --> 00:31:59,699
find that it's my God and that I have a personal relationship with the God of

429
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:08,019
heaven. It's so important. We find that no doubt it's beneficial for us, it's

430
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:12,939
helpful for us to be in a place, in a position in which we have the influence

431
00:32:12,939 --> 00:32:17,779
of godly people in our lives and we have the understanding that there are people

432
00:32:17,779 --> 00:32:22,139
that come into our lives and they have this influence in our lives and they

433
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:29,000
help us in our walk with God and they help us to to be what we're to be in the

434
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,179
Lord and in all of that influence, but the reality is that there's some point

435
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:40,779
in our lives where it must be that this God is my God. Joshua brings the people

436
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:46,139
to a place of decision. He says, ask for me in my house, we will serve the Lord.

437
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:51,299
But the decision is for you, nation of Israel. How are you going to respond? What

438
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:55,739
are you going to do? And we know that the Bible tells us and teaches us that they

439
00:32:55,739 --> 00:33:00,179
respond and they make the declaration, they make the decision that they too

440
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:05,339
would serve the Lord God. But we find that as we look throughout the Word of

441
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:11,939
God, I often think of this particular example in 2nd Chronicles 24. If you

442
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:16,459
want to turn there just for a moment and look at this passage and we can see

443
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:22,139
this over in Kings as well, but here in 2nd Chronicles chapter number 24 and I

444
00:33:22,139 --> 00:33:26,019
just want to draw your attention very quickly to a couple of points within

445
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:29,979
this passage of Scripture and I want you to think this evening of the

446
00:33:29,979 --> 00:33:34,939
significance of Jacob making this statement that he no longer is just the

447
00:33:34,939 --> 00:33:42,299
God of Abraham and Isaac but he's my God, the Lord Jehovah, he's my God. Here

448
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:47,139
in 2nd Chronicles 24 we read of Joash and he's going to be the king and the

449
00:33:47,139 --> 00:33:51,059
Bible tells us about Jehoiada who was the priest and Jehoiada was very

450
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:56,299
influential in the life of Joash. In fact the Bible tells us that as long as

451
00:33:56,299 --> 00:34:02,500
Jehoiada was living that Joash did the right thing and he served and he

452
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,539
followed the Lord so on and so forth but I want to draw your attention to

453
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:10,339
2nd Chronicles 24 and verse 15 for the Bible says that Jehoiada waxed old and

454
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:16,899
was full of days when he died. There's gonna come a time when that mentor,

455
00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:23,820
that influencer in your life is going to go home to be with the Lord and

456
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:31,899
that personal relationship that we have with God is of such importance because

457
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:38,899
when Jehoiada is off the scene when he dies, now what does that do to

458
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:43,820
Joash? Where is his place? What is his walk with God? That's why I try to teach

459
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:47,979
these young people to walk with God. That's why we're passing out these

460
00:34:47,979 --> 00:34:52,979
prayer lists on Wednesday evening and listing out the names of the kids in the

461
00:34:52,979 --> 00:34:56,299
nursery, the kids in the children's ministry, the teenagers this Wednesday

462
00:34:56,299 --> 00:34:59,500
and we're listing those young people. We want to pray that they get saved at a

463
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:05,619
young age and that they learn to walk with God. They learn to develop that

464
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:10,019
relationship, that fellowship with God. Notice in verse 17 it says,

465
00:35:10,019 --> 00:35:14,459
Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah and made obeisance to

466
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:18,539
the king. Then the king hearkened unto them, listen, they came with flattery and

467
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:23,940
they sought to influence Joash. His mentor was now gone and it was it

468
00:35:23,979 --> 00:35:31,739
becomes obvious, abundantly clear that he had no real walk with God personally. In

469
00:35:31,739 --> 00:35:37,380
fact, the Bible tells us that in verse number 21, they conspired against him and

470
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,820
stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of

471
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:43,059
the house of the Lord. You know who they they stoned here? They stoned

472
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:47,220
Zechariah. According to verse number 20, he came and he spoke against what was

473
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,779
happening and talked about how they were forsaking the Lord and Zechariah was the

474
00:35:51,779 --> 00:36:05,019
son of Jehoiada. And Joash says stone him. The importance of having that walk

475
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:14,940
with God. While Jehoiada was alive, Joash did right, but Jehoiada died. And here in

476
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:26,459
Genesis chapter 28, as Jacob is responding and declaring the change, he

477
00:36:26,459 --> 00:36:32,380
vows this vow and he says, I understand that God has made this promise, these

478
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:37,059
promises to me and I trust God, I believe God, I believe that he's going to do it

479
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:45,899
and the Lord, he's my God. How powerful that is. Notice in verse number 22, back

480
00:36:45,899 --> 00:36:53,859
in Genesis chapter 28, as we clean up or finish up this passage of scripture, he

481
00:36:53,859 --> 00:36:59,579
refers to the stone, which of course, if you go back in verse number 11, it was

482
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:02,699
the stones that he had set up for pillows. You look at verse number 18, it's the

483
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:08,100
stone that he now uses as a pillar and poured oil upon it and he says, this stone,

484
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:15,380
which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house. No longer is Jacob just out

485
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:21,579
looking for himself. Up to this point in Jacob's life, who was he most concerned

486
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:28,899
for? Himself, right? Esau comes and he's hungry. He'd been out, he's fainting.

487
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:34,380
What's Jacob looking for? I'll give you some pottage, you give me the birthright, right?

488
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,979
Chapter 27, what's Jacob trying to get? He's trying to get a blessing. Who's he looking for?

489
00:37:39,979 --> 00:37:45,419
Himself. Remember, when Rebecca says, here's what our plan's going to be, here's

490
00:37:45,419 --> 00:37:50,979
what you're going to do, he wasn't concerned with the plan not being right, he was

491
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:59,139
concerned about getting caught, right? But now all of a sudden, the evidence of the

492
00:37:59,139 --> 00:38:04,979
change in the life of Jacob, he now declares that this pillar that I've set

493
00:38:04,979 --> 00:38:10,179
up, this shall be God's house. Now notice the depth of what he reveals in this

494
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:15,100
final statement of verse number 22. It says this, and of all that thou shalt

495
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,100
give me, now I know there's no punctuation there but I want you to just

496
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:23,979
stop there just for a moment, and of all that thou shalt give me, you understand

497
00:38:23,979 --> 00:38:30,660
that he is the giver of all things. You understand that this evening? Everything

498
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:38,059
that we have is because of the good hand of God. Amen? Everything that we have. You

499
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:40,739
say, well you don't understand pastor, I have this really good mind and I was

500
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:47,059
able to go to school and get these... Who gave you that mind? You know about

501
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:53,820
Nebuchadnezzar? He was pretty powerful, wasn't he? He was the king of Babylon, the

502
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:59,979
most powerful empire at that time, the world empire. He was the king, had all the

503
00:38:59,979 --> 00:39:05,099
power. In fact, it's obvious when Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego decide

504
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:10,940
that they're not gonna bow down, they're gonna stand in courageous... and stand in

505
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:16,020
defiance with courage against that mandate that had been given by

506
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:21,099
Nebuchadnezzar, and they stand courageously. And he says, who is that

507
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:25,140
God that shall deliver you out of my hand? And then he found out who that God

508
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:33,619
was. What happened to Nebuchadnezzar? God gave him over. He was like an animal out

509
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:42,659
in the field, right? We must recognize this evening that everything that we

510
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:51,099
have is because of the good hand of God. Every good gift, right? James 1 verse 17,

511
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:56,659
it comes from where? It comes from above. It comes from God. Our God is good. And

512
00:39:56,659 --> 00:40:02,099
Jacob is acknowledging some powerful truth here.

513
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:06,179
that is important for every child of God to recognize.

514
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:10,019
In fact, later on, as God is preparing the children

515
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:12,839
of Israel for entrance into the land

516
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:16,979
and he's using Moses to give them instruction,

517
00:40:16,979 --> 00:40:19,099
God reminds them of this.

518
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:22,219
God reminds them of this in Deuteronomy 8,

519
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,419
in verse number 18, it says,

520
00:40:23,419 --> 00:40:25,699
"'But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God,

521
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:29,839
"'for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth,

522
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,459
"'that he may establish his covenant,

523
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:33,999
"'which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.'"

524
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:35,199
And so he says, listen,

525
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:37,719
Moses is given this instruction,

526
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:39,479
we have to recognize that it's God

527
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:42,759
that gives us the power to get this wealth.

528
00:40:42,759 --> 00:40:45,119
You use that terminology, you've heard it, no doubt,

529
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,319
where people talk about being a self-made man,

530
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,479
there's no such thing.

531
00:40:49,439 --> 00:40:51,159
There really isn't.

532
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:54,799
We find that God, in his grace and his mercy,

533
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:57,319
and he would give us the abilities that he gives us

534
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:00,799
and how important that we find this evening,

535
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:02,679
this statement of Jacob when he says,

536
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:04,739
"'Of all that thou shalt give me,'

537
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:08,979
recognizing that it's God that is the one that gives.

538
00:41:08,979 --> 00:41:12,339
This God that is the one that blesses.

539
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:15,759
Jacob is finally, I believe, coming to a place

540
00:41:15,759 --> 00:41:18,499
where he's understanding it's no longer needful.

541
00:41:18,499 --> 00:41:20,419
We've said this multiple times

542
00:41:20,419 --> 00:41:21,579
in the last several chapters,

543
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:24,319
living by faith does not require scheming.

544
00:41:26,059 --> 00:41:26,899
He's coming to this place

545
00:41:26,899 --> 00:41:29,779
where he's recognizing that God is the giver.

546
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:32,639
And he says, "'Of all that thou shalt give me,'

547
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:33,939
notice what he says,

548
00:41:33,939 --> 00:41:38,939
"'I will surely give the 10th unto thee.'"

549
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:40,999
I will surely give the 10th unto thee.

550
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,219
And so we find that he recognizes

551
00:41:43,219 --> 00:41:45,139
that the Lord is the giver of all things

552
00:41:45,139 --> 00:41:48,039
and he's committed to giving a tithe,

553
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,359
as we'd understand, a 10th unto thee.

554
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:51,639
And he's committed to that

555
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:53,599
and he's recognizing the significance

556
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,719
and the importance of that

557
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:57,519
and really the blessing of that.

558
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:58,919
This is pre-law.

559
00:41:58,939 --> 00:42:01,099
So many people wanna argue,

560
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:02,999
even as I mentioned this morning, with miracles.

561
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:06,979
They wanna dismiss and argue about miracles

562
00:42:06,979 --> 00:42:09,179
and try to explain away.

563
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:11,859
And people that wanna try to get out of giving a tithe,

564
00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:12,699
they try to explain away,

565
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:15,619
"'Well, we're not under the law,' and so on and so forth.

566
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:19,399
"'Abraham gave of the tithe, Jacob's committing to it.'"

567
00:42:19,399 --> 00:42:21,539
It's not necessarily just part of the law.

568
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:27,359
Giving to God is a blessing, is an absolute blessing.

569
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,459
By the way, you could never out-give God.

570
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:31,599
Somebody said this.

571
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,439
Letourneau actually was the one that said it.

572
00:42:33,439 --> 00:42:37,719
And he had actually suffered some really difficult days

573
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:41,399
leading up into the Great Depression in the 1930s.

574
00:42:41,399 --> 00:42:43,119
And he was a Christian man.

575
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,979
Many people had encouraged him to file bankruptcy

576
00:42:45,979 --> 00:42:46,859
and so on and so forth,

577
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:48,759
but he was committed to doing the right thing

578
00:42:48,759 --> 00:42:50,919
and to having integrity and to paying his bills

579
00:42:50,919 --> 00:42:51,879
and so on and so forth.

580
00:42:51,879 --> 00:42:53,939
And he was committed to giving to God.

581
00:42:53,939 --> 00:42:56,419
And here's what Letourneau said.

582
00:42:56,419 --> 00:42:58,339
He said, when I think about giving to God,

583
00:42:58,339 --> 00:42:59,819
your perspective has to be this.

584
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:04,339
It's not how much of my money I give to God,

585
00:43:04,339 --> 00:43:08,259
but it's how much of God's money I keep for myself.

586
00:43:08,259 --> 00:43:10,619
That's a different way to think about it.

587
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:12,419
I like that.

588
00:43:12,419 --> 00:43:15,999
By the way, Letourneau was famously known

589
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:20,099
for giving 90% to God and keeping 10% for himself.

590
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,659
I'm not suggesting anyone do that.

591
00:43:22,659 --> 00:43:24,259
You better pray about it, amen?

592
00:43:24,259 --> 00:43:26,219
You start doing that and you can't pay your electric bill

593
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:28,139
and you're gonna call me, amen?

594
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:30,499
But the reality is that, man,

595
00:43:30,499 --> 00:43:31,619
that's what a great perspective.

596
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:34,019
It's not how much of my money I give God,

597
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:36,679
but how much of God's money I keep for myself.

598
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:37,519
Why?

599
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:41,379
Because I'm recognizing that God, He gives me all of this.

600
00:43:41,379 --> 00:43:43,219
He's been so good to me.

601
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:45,459
I want you to think about this in 1 Chronicles 29,

602
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:47,459
and we'll finish here.

603
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:50,319
The life of David near the end of his life.

604
00:43:52,499 --> 00:43:54,299
And I don't have time to look at all of this

605
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:58,179
that the hour's gone, I need to wrap up the message,

606
00:43:58,179 --> 00:44:00,699
but I want you to see here in 1 Chronicles 29,

607
00:44:00,699 --> 00:44:02,539
perhaps you'd like to go back and read it later

608
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:06,259
this evening, this week, make a note to read this passage.

609
00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:10,339
It's just fabulous, the response of David and the people

610
00:44:10,339 --> 00:44:13,879
with the ability to give to the work of God.

611
00:44:13,879 --> 00:44:16,639
David is giving to a work that he'd never see fulfilled.

612
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:19,139
He'd never see the temple completed.

613
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:20,699
He'd never worship God in the temple,

614
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,699
but yet he's giving and he's preparing

615
00:44:22,699 --> 00:44:23,979
and he's offering willingly.

616
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:26,659
And I want you to see that they're rejoicing greatly

617
00:44:26,659 --> 00:44:28,339
because of the opportunity to give.

618
00:44:28,339 --> 00:44:30,179
In fact, it says in verse number nine,

619
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:32,379
then the people rejoiced, why?

620
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:33,979
For that they offered willingly,

621
00:44:33,979 --> 00:44:35,139
because with perfect heart,

622
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:37,099
they offered willingly to the Lord.

623
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:39,419
And David the king also rejoiced, how?

624
00:44:39,419 --> 00:44:40,999
With great joy.

625
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:45,699
Why could they rejoice at the giving?

626
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:47,859
Why could they rejoice in the manner in which they did?

627
00:44:47,859 --> 00:44:49,179
Well, it's because of their perspective.

628
00:44:49,179 --> 00:44:51,619
Notice in verse number 14, it says,

629
00:44:51,619 --> 00:44:53,739
but who am I and what is my people

630
00:44:54,499 --> 00:44:57,139
that we should be able to offer so willingly

631
00:44:57,139 --> 00:44:59,099
after this sort?

632
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:02,939
For all things come of thee and of thine own

633
00:45:02,939 --> 00:45:04,519
have we given thee.

634
00:45:05,659 --> 00:45:07,579
Man, we change our perspective

635
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:10,899
and it really changes our entire outlook, does it not?

636
00:45:10,899 --> 00:45:14,539
And here, Jacob, a man who is known for,

637
00:45:14,539 --> 00:45:18,739
as we've studied his life, he's known for me and myself

638
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:21,019
and how can I benefit and how can I get

639
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:23,179
and how can I, in this situation,

640
00:45:23,539 --> 00:45:25,859
how can I benefit the most?

641
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:28,439
But then he meets the Lord personally.

642
00:45:29,459 --> 00:45:31,939
He departed, had a dream,

643
00:45:32,979 --> 00:45:35,939
and in that dream, he saw a vision,

644
00:45:35,939 --> 00:45:38,739
but more than seeing a vision, he heard a voice.

645
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:41,099
And he heard the voice of God.

646
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:43,619
And God gave him some promise

647
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:45,619
with regard to the Abrahamic covenant

648
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:48,139
and with regard to the land and the seed,

649
00:45:48,139 --> 00:45:53,139
but God spoke about his life personally in verse number 15.

650
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:56,619
And all that God said he would do for Jacob.

651
00:45:56,619 --> 00:46:00,219
And Jacob responded and he made some declarations

652
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:03,899
and through his response and through these declarations,

653
00:46:03,899 --> 00:46:06,659
we see that he's a changed individual.

654
00:46:07,979 --> 00:46:11,139
And he concludes by saying,

655
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:12,899
of all that thou shalt give me,

656
00:46:12,899 --> 00:46:17,139
I will surely give the 10th unto thee.

657
00:46:17,139 --> 00:46:19,679
He understood that God had given him

658
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:21,499
some encouraging promises.

659
00:46:21,499 --> 00:46:25,299
And he said, the Lord shall be my God.

660
00:46:26,399 --> 00:46:28,219
The Lord shall be my God.

661
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:30,099
And here's how I'm gonna worship him.

662
00:46:30,099 --> 00:46:32,059
Here's how I'm gonna serve him.

663
00:46:32,059 --> 00:46:33,459
This evening, I'm so thankful

664
00:46:33,459 --> 00:46:35,219
that God revealed himself to me.

665
00:46:36,179 --> 00:46:38,619
Aren't you glad that God revealed himself to you?

666
00:46:39,499 --> 00:46:41,539
Man, that we can know him,

667
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:44,099
we can have that relationship with him.

668
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:45,699
But how's it impact us?

669
00:46:45,699 --> 00:46:47,179
How does it change our behavior?

670
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,499
How does it change our outlook?

671
00:46:48,499 --> 00:46:53,219
How does it change our perspective in life?

672
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:57,179
Because when we know him and we know his promises,

673
00:46:57,179 --> 00:46:59,419
it's going to have an impact in our lives.

674
00:46:59,419 --> 00:47:01,079
It's gonna change us.

675
00:47:02,379 --> 00:47:03,619
Father, we love you.

676
00:47:04,459 --> 00:47:06,099
We thank you for loving us.

677
00:47:07,139 --> 00:47:11,679
We thank you for the change in Jacob's life.

678
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:16,979
Up to this point, we've seen very little

679
00:47:17,939 --> 00:47:19,459
of anything spiritual.

680
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:24,339
But now we see a changed man

681
00:47:26,339 --> 00:47:31,339
making some powerful declarations, commitments.

682
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:38,099
God, I pray this evening that you'd help us

683
00:47:41,699 --> 00:47:44,459
to really evaluate and consider tonight

684
00:47:45,459 --> 00:47:48,859
the wonderful promises that you've given to us

685
00:47:48,859 --> 00:47:51,459
and how we respond to those promises,

686
00:47:53,139 --> 00:47:58,139
how we determine to live in obedience to you and to your word,

687
00:47:59,139 --> 00:48:04,139
how we become more concerned about your kingdom

688
00:48:08,459 --> 00:48:09,739
than my life.

689
00:48:10,739 --> 00:48:14,859
Just a few weeks ago, the teenager sang a powerful song

690
00:48:19,339 --> 00:48:21,259
about living their lives in such a way

691
00:48:21,259 --> 00:48:23,259
that you would be glorified

692
00:48:23,259 --> 00:48:27,219
and not looking for recognition or name

693
00:48:27,219 --> 00:48:29,379
or type of recognition here upon this earth,

694
00:48:29,379 --> 00:48:30,899
but living for you, Lord.

695
00:48:31,979 --> 00:48:34,539
God, I pray that even as we see that in Jacob's life

696
00:48:34,539 --> 00:48:37,099
in these last verses of Scripture,

697
00:48:37,099 --> 00:48:38,899
that it would be seen in our lives.

698
00:48:40,659 --> 00:48:42,219
It's about you, Lord.

699
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:45,859
As John the Baptist said of the Lord Jesus Christ,

700
00:48:45,859 --> 00:48:48,699
he must increase, I must decrease.

701
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:53,459
Help us to recognize that you're the giver of all things.

702
00:48:53,459 --> 00:48:56,459
Help us to be faithful and obedient to you and to your word,

703
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,579
to rejoice in the privilege and opportunity

704
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:00,979
that we have to give to you.

705
00:49:02,219 --> 00:49:03,819
I pray that you'd move and work as only you can

706
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:04,819
and we'll thank you for it.

707
00:49:04,819 --> 00:49:05,739
In Christ's name we pray.

708
00:49:05,739 --> 00:49:06,579
Would you stand with me?
