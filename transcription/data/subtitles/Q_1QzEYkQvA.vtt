WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.039
evening, Genesis chapter number 28, Genesis chapter number 28 tonight, and we'll finish

00:00:05.039 --> 00:00:06.079
this chapter.

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:11.359
We started last Sunday evening looking at the first nine verses of Genesis chapter 28

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:14.640
and be looking at verses 10 through 22 this evening.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.719
And we've noted, of course, as we've studied through these last several chapters of the

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:22.440
book of Genesis, things with regard to the life of Jacob.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.840
And now the focus, of course, had shifted from Abraham to Isaac, and now it's going

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.799
to shift from Isaac to Jacob, and begin to follow his life over the next several chapters

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:35.040
and look at all that takes place.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.840
In fact, his death, of course, recorded near the end of the book of Genesis.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.840
And as we look at the passage of Scripture this evening and looking at the life of Jacob,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.040
of course, I mentioned this even this morning, that the events previously recorded to this

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.000
passage of Scripture have resulted in Jacob, of course, leaving home, being instructed

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.520
to do so.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.360
And he's received that instruction in our previous text of Scripture.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.360
But it's interesting because really up to this point in the life of Jacob, there's really

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.559
nothing of any significance in his life with regard to spiritual aspect, right?

00:01:09.559 --> 00:01:15.519
The spiritual aspect in Jacob's life, there's really nothing of significance in the Scriptures.

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:19.919
It was in the 25th chapter of the book of Genesis that we read of the birth of Jacob.

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:24.919
It was in the 25th chapter at the end of the chapter that we read how that he obtained

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:25.919
Esau's birthright.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:30.239
It was in chapter number 26 where the family is in Gerar.

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:33.080
Remember, there was a famine.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.279
And it's interesting because all of the chapter, chapter number 26, there's not one reference

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:41.160
to Jacob in the entire chapter.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.239
And much there about Isaac and all that takes place and the interactions with the Philistines

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:48.239
and what have you.

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:51.120
So there's nothing that is specifically mentioned about Jacob.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.040
And then of course, as we've studied chapter number 27 over the last several Sunday evenings,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.440
we've had the opportunity to see that it was in that chapter where there's much deception

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.599
and carnality on the part of Jacob.

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:05.720
We come to Genesis chapter 28.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.039
We read how that as we studied last week that Isaac called Jacob, he blessed him, and he

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.039
charged him.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.520
It's interesting because God records for us that as Jacob is receiving this charge from

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.199
Isaac in verse number three, it says, and God Almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful.

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:23.360
It's interesting.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.759
That's the God's name, El Shaddai, the Lord God Almighty.

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:33.559
And of course, God had revealed himself to Abraham and as being El Shaddai back in Genesis

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:34.559
chapter number 17.

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:41.039
And so it's interesting that God uses Isaac to give this charge to Jacob and he hears

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:42.300
those words.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.520
He speaks to him about a blessing, but we find that as we pick it up this evening in

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.639
verse number 10, the Bible says that Jacob went out from Beersheba and he went toward

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:54.039
Haran and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the sun

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:55.039
was set.

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:58.559
And he took the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:00.479
place to sleep.

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:04.479
It says in verse number 12 that he dreamed and behold, a ladder set up on the earth and

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:06.919
the top of it reached to heaven.

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.759
Behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:15.440
And behold, the Lord stood above it and said, and we're going to look at all that he said

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.759
I'm going to pause there and give you the title for the message we'll dig in tonight.

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:22.039
The Lord spoke to Jacob.

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:25.100
What a blessing to think about God speaking to his people.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.399
What a blessing to consider this evening that we have the written Word of God, the complete

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:36.000
Word of God, the whole canon of Scripture and that God uses his Word in our lives.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.720
God speaks to us through his Word.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.800
We understand that Jacob did not have a Bible as we have a Bible.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.679
The Lord speaks to Jacob and I'm thankful that every time that I open the pages of this

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:49.080
precious book, that God Almighty speaks to me.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.080
That's wonderful.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.080
It's precious.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.800
I mentioned to somebody as they were leaving this morning, of course, I preached on prayer

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.119
this morning and we just had a brief conversation with someone as they were leaving.

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:04.039
And I said, you know, the reality is at least I will be very transparent with you this evening.

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:07.639
It is easier for me, that's what I said to the person at the back door this morning.

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:12.559
It is much easier for me to read the Word of God than it is for me to pray.

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:13.800
It's just the way it is in my life.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.800
I don't know.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.000
You might say it's easier for me to pray than it is to read.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
But I have no problem.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.119
I can sit down and read the Bible for an hour, for longer.

00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:22.279
I can just read and read.

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:24.239
I love reading the Bible.

00:04:24.239 --> 00:04:27.079
But it just seems like every time you go to pray, there's just distraction.

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:28.079
I pray.

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:29.200
I'm not suggesting I don't pray.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.000
I'm saying that it's easier for me to read than it is for praying.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.679
It's more natural for me.

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:37.160
Every time I open the Word of God, God speaks to me.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.160
And I love it.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.160
It's precious.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.679
And here in this passage of Scripture, the Bible tells us no longer is Jacob receiving

00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:47.279
something from Isaac with regard to God.

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:50.160
Now God is speaking directly to Jacob.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.239
And that's exciting to me.

00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:53.000
It's encouraging to me.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.040
And what a blessing to think about the truth of this passage of Scripture and to think

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.739
about the way in which God reveals great truth to Jacob.

00:05:02.739 --> 00:05:06.980
If you're taking notes this evening, notice in verses 10 and 11, as we begin looking through

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.700
this passage, his departure.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.500
Very quickly, not much that we'll discuss here.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.500
But I do want you to note that the Bible says that he went out from Beersheba and he went

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.739
toward Haran.

00:05:15.739 --> 00:05:18.619
Now Haran was the chief city of Paddan Aram.

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:24.579
And according to verse number two of Genesis 28, he was instructed by his father Isaac

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:29.859
to go to Paddan Aram and to the house of Bethuel, thy mother's father, and take thee a wife

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.019
from then, so the daughters of Laban, thy mother's brother.

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:37.140
And so we see that in verse number 10, that when the Bible tells us that he went out from

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.260
Beersheba and he went toward Haran, that he went in obedience.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.140
He followed the instruction that had been given.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.380
And what a blessing, because we find that it's very important where he finds himself

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:55.260
here in this passage of Scripture and how God appears to him and God speaks to him.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.380
And I find that that act of obedience that begins our portion of Scripture, our study

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.940
this evening, is of great significance and it's of great importance.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.859
We find that the Bible tells us that he alighted upon a certain place.

00:06:07.859 --> 00:06:10.959
He tarried there all night because the sun was set.

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:15.059
It tells us that he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:18.540
he laid down in that place to sleep.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:24.179
And we find that his departure is recorded very quickly and we see that what notes that,

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:29.380
what's important about those verses is you note the obedience of Jacob.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.059
As we look at verses 12 down through verse number 15, I want you to capture with me and

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:35.679
look at the dream.

00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:38.220
We see his departure, but we see his dream.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.880
In verse number 12, we see what Jacob saw in this dream.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.820
The Bible says that he dreamed, and behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.220
of it reached to heaven.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.579
Behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it.

00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:58.820
So you see, as God would allow us by recorded, written word of God to allow us to see and

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.540
to hear, to understand what it was that Jacob dreamed in this passage of Scripture.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.579
And it's very interesting because the Bible says that he sees this ladder that was set

00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:10.619
up on the earth, and it says that the top of it reached to heaven.

00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:16.299
And I want you to notice, the Bible says that the angels of God ascending and descending

00:07:16.299 --> 00:07:18.739
on it, on that ladder.

00:07:18.739 --> 00:07:20.660
We find that this is what he saw.

00:07:20.739 --> 00:07:24.500
So it's interesting, hold your place here, but turn to the book of John very quickly,

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.500
if you will.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.500
The gospel of John.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.459
And I want you to look in the first chapter of the gospel of John.

00:07:30.459 --> 00:07:35.700
And you look in this first chapter, and remember, it was John the Baptist that spoke about Jesus

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.299
Christ being the Lamb of God, according to verse number 36.

00:07:40.299 --> 00:07:45.519
And the Bible tells us that there were some that followed after Jesus, and there's some

00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:47.700
interaction that takes place.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.660
Remember, Jesus asked them, what seek ye?

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:56.179
And they told him in verse number 38 that they said unto him, where dwellest thou?

00:07:56.179 --> 00:07:58.579
And he said to them in verse 39, come and see.

00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:04.959
And we find that there's reference here with regard to Andrew and Simon Peter.

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:06.519
But skip down, if you will.

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:11.500
And I want you to notice in verse number 46, it says, in Nathanael, let me say in verse

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:16.980
45, because Philip findeth Nathanael and saith unto him, we have found him of whom Moses

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:22.420
and the law and the prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.980
Nathanael said unto him, can any good thing come out of Nazareth?

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.899
Philip saith unto him, come and see.

00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:34.780
Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and saith unto him, verse 47, behold, an Israelite indeed

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.020
in whom is no guile.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.500
Nathanael said unto him, whence knowest thou me?

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.780
Jesus answered and said unto him, before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.340
fig tree, I saw thee.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.739
That's how Nathanael answers in verse 49.

00:08:47.739 --> 00:08:53.260
He answers and says, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.219
Thou art the King of Israel.

00:08:56.219 --> 00:09:00.380
Jesus answers, and I want you to see what he says here in verse 50, and especially in

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.460
verse number 51 as it pertains to this dream that Jacob had.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.219
In verse number 50, Jesus answered unto him, because I said unto thee, I saw thee under

00:09:08.219 --> 00:09:10.979
the fig tree, believest thou?

00:09:10.979 --> 00:09:15.659
Thou shalt see greater things than these, and he saith unto him, verily, verily, of

00:09:15.659 --> 00:09:23.580
a truth of a truth, I say unto you, hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:31.299
God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.

00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:37.619
That ladder that Jacob saw in our passage of Scripture in Genesis 28, that's no other

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:38.780
than Jesus Christ.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.580
He says he's the Son of Man, amen?

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:46.419
And it says that you're going to see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.340
descending upon the Son of Man.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:52.460
In Genesis chapter 28, in verse number 12, it says that he dreamed, and behold, a ladder

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.119
set up on the earth, and the top of it reached heaven, and behold, the angels of God ascending

00:09:56.119 --> 00:09:58.179
and descending on it.

00:09:58.179 --> 00:10:00.059
And Jesus ties it.

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:05.659
in with Nathanael in John chapter 1 and verse number 51, all the way back to this dream of

00:10:05.659 --> 00:10:11.339
Jacob in Genesis chapter 28, and what precious truth that we see there. And so as we consider

00:10:11.339 --> 00:10:16.539
this dream this evening, we note first of all what he saw, but I want you to pay close attention to

00:10:16.539 --> 00:10:22.539
what he heard. Beginning in verse number 13 and down through verse number 15, Jacob heard some

00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:29.019
powerful truth. The Bible says, and behold, the Lord stood above it and said, and God Almighty

00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:38.059
is going to speak to him. And look, notice first of all that what he heard was regarding a place

00:10:38.059 --> 00:10:45.259
in verse number 13. It says, I am the Lord God of Abraham, thy father, the God of Isaac, the land

00:10:45.259 --> 00:10:53.499
whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it and to thy seed. We find that Jacob hears the voice of

00:10:53.579 --> 00:11:00.699
God. He follows, he departs, he goes toward Haran as he had been instructed to do so, and he goes

00:11:00.699 --> 00:11:05.979
to sleep, and he dreams a dream, and we see the vision that he saw, but we note what he heard and

00:11:05.979 --> 00:11:12.139
how the Lord spoke to him and gave him precious promises. And he begins in verse number 13

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:17.819
regarding a place, a land, and we know that this goes back to the Abrahamic covenant. We understand

00:11:17.819 --> 00:11:23.659
that as we've studied in weeks gone by the details of the Abrahamic covenant, we see here

00:11:23.659 --> 00:11:33.339
that God says to Jacob, I am the Lord God of Abraham, thy father, the God of Isaac, the land

00:11:33.339 --> 00:11:41.019
whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it and to thy seed. Notice he continues in verse number 14,

00:11:41.979 --> 00:11:48.220
not only regarding a place, but now regarding a person, and that person being the Lord. Notice it

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:54.059
says, and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west,

00:11:54.059 --> 00:12:01.180
to the east, to the north, and to the south, and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:07.339
of the earth be blessed. Of course, we understand seed plural with regard to the nation of Israel,

00:12:07.339 --> 00:12:13.979
but when we think about seed singular, as God spoke to Abraham, remember in Galatians 3 in

00:12:13.979 --> 00:12:20.779
verse number 16, he says, I did not say seeds, but seed, speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:12:20.779 --> 00:12:27.500
And what great truth. Of course, we know that Jacob would be married, he'd have the sons,

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:33.259
the tribes of Israel, so on and so forth. But we find that as he gives them this promise,

00:12:33.259 --> 00:12:37.179
he talks about the way in which they'd spread abroad to the west, east, north, and south.

00:12:37.739 --> 00:12:44.380
But we think specifically about the promised Messiah, the messianic prophecy and the promise

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:50.539
and the line that I mentioned already in Galatians 3 in verse number 16, and what a precious truth.

00:12:50.539 --> 00:12:58.619
And so as we begin to focus in and we see that Jacob, he goes to this place and he lies down

00:12:58.619 --> 00:13:05.099
to sleep and he has this dream. And as he has this dream, he hears the voice of God. God begins

00:13:05.099 --> 00:13:11.899
to speak to him. God begins to reveal truth to him. We would say that God begins to reveal his

00:13:11.899 --> 00:13:18.300
plan to him. In verse number 15, we find that he gives them truth regarding his plan and his

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:24.300
presence. He is now speaking about Jacob's life specifically. Notice in verse 15,

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:29.179
what encouraging promises are received here in this verse of Scripture.

00:13:29.179 --> 00:13:37.419
And behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest,

00:13:38.059 --> 00:13:41.899
and will bring thee again into this land, for I will not leave thee

00:13:42.619 --> 00:13:49.899
until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. Isn't that precious? Isn't that encouraging?

00:13:50.539 --> 00:13:57.020
How often we go to the Word of God and we are reminded of the precious truth of God giving

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:03.739
his promise with regard to his presence and how that he says, I will be with thee. We understand

00:14:03.739 --> 00:14:08.940
that we have that great promise of Hebrews 13 in verse number 5 when the Word of God tells us,

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:15.419
I will never leave thee nor forsake thee, and how wonderful that truth is and how impactful that is.

00:14:15.419 --> 00:14:20.619
I've often said over the years that the promise of his presence brings comfort in the life of the

00:14:20.619 --> 00:14:26.619
believer, and certainly that's true because we know, even as the psalmist says in Psalm 23,

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.980
that yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, why,

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:41.419
for thou art with me. And to know his presence is so encouraging. And that's how God starts out

00:14:41.419 --> 00:14:50.059
when he speaks about the land and about the seed, and he then talks about the life of Jacob and his

00:14:50.059 --> 00:14:57.660
presence, and he starts in verse 15 and says, and behold, I am with thee. Wow, that's precious.

00:14:58.859 --> 00:15:06.059
He says this, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest. Now, that's encouraging,

00:15:06.059 --> 00:15:11.579
isn't it? And you think about the promise that God gives to Joshua in Joshua chapter number 9,

00:15:11.579 --> 00:15:17.179
or Joshua chapter number 1, excuse me, with regard to going in and conquering the land,

00:15:17.179 --> 00:15:21.660
and that God said he was going to be with them. And as he went through that place and fulfilled

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:27.019
the plan of God in his life for the nation of Israel, that God Almighty would be with him.

00:15:27.019 --> 00:15:33.339
And here Jacob is receiving this promise that I am with thee, and I will keep thee in all places

00:15:33.339 --> 00:15:39.339
whither thou goest. But then he tells them this, and I will bring thee again into this land.

00:15:40.459 --> 00:15:45.419
I'll bring thee again into this land. And then he says this, for I will not leave thee

00:15:47.339 --> 00:15:54.380
until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. These are encouraging promises.

00:15:55.179 --> 00:15:59.980
And I want you to think about Jacob in this situation, and I want you to think about his

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:04.540
life up to this point, and all that we've studied, and all that we've seen. And again,

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:09.179
as I mentioned by way of introduction, there's very little of any spiritual significance that's

00:16:09.179 --> 00:16:13.899
mentioned in the life of Jacob. I mean, we read of his birth, and then right after his birth,

00:16:13.899 --> 00:16:18.619
you read how he's swindling his brother out of his birthright, and then you read about the

00:16:18.619 --> 00:16:24.619
time in Gerar, and there's no reference whatsoever to Jacob. And then you read about his deception

00:16:24.619 --> 00:16:28.940
and his carnality in chapter 27, and how he takes the blessing, and so on and so forth.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.779
And there's really nothing of any significance from a spiritual perspective.

00:16:34.299 --> 00:16:42.059
And now God Almighty has appeared to him, and God has spoken to him, and God is revealing himself.

00:16:42.059 --> 00:16:49.419
He says, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, as he begins speaking to him in verse number 13,

00:16:49.419 --> 00:16:55.339
and how that sets the record straight and helps Jacob to understand all of what he's experiencing

00:16:55.339 --> 00:17:00.779
in this moment. And God gives him these encouraging promises, and it's God who is

00:17:00.779 --> 00:17:08.220
the eternal God that is able to make these kind of promises, that's able to say to Jacob that,

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:14.059
I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. And it reveals,

00:17:14.059 --> 00:17:19.980
it reminds us of the power of God to accomplish his purpose and his will in our lives.

00:17:20.779 --> 00:17:25.419
I'm so thankful this evening that God has a purpose and a will for your life and for my life.

00:17:26.139 --> 00:17:31.980
We find that the Word of God tells in the book of Philippians that he's begun a good work in us,

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:37.579
but he's going to continue it until the day of Jesus Christ and how precious that is. And it's

00:17:37.579 --> 00:17:41.820
interesting because Paul says it this way under the inspirational Holy Spirit of God, being

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:48.619
confident of this thing, having the confidence to know that God is working and moving in our

00:17:48.619 --> 00:17:55.660
lives and that he has a purpose for everything that we deal with. He's growing us. He's developing

00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:04.540
us. And we find here that God Almighty gives these promises to Jacob. And we think about the point

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:10.220
where we are here at this passage of Scripture in the life of Jacob and you, yes, his departure,

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:16.299
but now his dream, and how he would respond and how this would impact his life. And I believe

00:18:16.299 --> 00:18:22.220
that it had a profound impact in the life of Jacob, as we will see in the next verses of

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:28.139
Scripture that we'll look to. And we see that in these verses of Scripture that it's so well laid

00:18:28.139 --> 00:18:35.900
out as to how impactful this was in the life of Jacob. You remember the day in your life when

00:18:36.539 --> 00:18:41.020
you met the Lord, you understood who he was, and you understood his plan for your life after

00:18:41.659 --> 00:18:48.380
your salvation and understanding how he loved you and the promises. And here we find that Jacob

00:18:49.099 --> 00:18:55.659
has this time with the Lord and his, really, I would use the terminology from a New Testament

00:18:55.659 --> 00:19:04.539
perspective, his conversion here in this passage of Scripture. As you continue and we focus our

00:19:04.539 --> 00:19:12.619
attention on verses 16 through 22, I want you to notice his declarations. His departure, his dream,

00:19:12.619 --> 00:19:17.580
and his declarations. Really, four things in which I've noted as I've looked at these verses

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:24.380
of Scripture to deal with what it is that he, Jacob, declares. First of all, I want you to

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:29.260
notice what he says in verse 16, and Jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said, notice what he said,

00:19:29.979 --> 00:19:36.940
"'Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.'" Now think about that. He said,

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:44.539
the Lord is in this place, Jehovah God. And he recognized, remember, as he went to that place,

00:19:44.539 --> 00:19:49.340
as he lighted upon a certain place, according to verse number 11, I don't think he really thought

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.820
of any significance of the place where he lay. I don't think there was anything, really, that he

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:58.700
anticipated happening. He was on a journey. He was heading towards Haran. He was following the

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.140
direction of his...

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:06.440
father, no doubt there were various levels of emotions that Jacob would have been dealing

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.440
with.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:12.360
He's leaving his home, he's leaving all that he knows, he's leaving not only the security

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:18.360
of his home and the people that he's close with, his mother, and so on and so forth.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:24.160
He's got on his mind, no doubt, the thought of Esau's hatred and all of those things that

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:28.600
are happening and all of the emotions that take place, and he takes his journey.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:33.280
He's wearied, he's going to sleep, I don't think he anticipates anything taking place

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:40.440
as we see here where he says, surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.080
Surely the Lord is in this place.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:48.640
Man, this was impactful in the life of Jacob, but I want you to notice what he continues

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.640
to say.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:56.700
It says that here in verse 17, he was afraid and said, how dreadful is this place.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:02.520
This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.620
I want you to consider with me his response when it says that he was afraid and said,

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.100
how dreadful is this place.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:14.460
The reality is that when you consider being in the presence of God and you understand

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:22.860
how awesome he is and how wonderful he is, that we respond in a response of reverence,

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.920
a response of awe.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.520
We understand that he is God.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.840
And here the Bible tells us that he says, this is none other but the house of God, and

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.120
this is the gate of heaven.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.600
This is that second declaration that this is the house of God.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.680
Notice what he does because of what he had recognized.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.040
In verse number 18, it says that he rose up early in the morning.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:51.920
Now there's a note there for us to understand the urgency in which he was operating, that

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.640
he rose early in the morning.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.580
This was an immediate response.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.340
He wasn't going to just kind of lay around and think about it and muse upon it.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:04.620
He had this dream, God had spoken to him, and now he's going to respond.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.880
He rises up early.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.940
Notice it says in verse 18 that he took the stone that he had put for his pillows and

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:18.800
he set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it, a process of consecration.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:26.160
We notice that in verse number 18, he pours that oil upon the top of it in this act of

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:31.320
consecration, and he's understanding that this is the house of God.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.320
This is the place.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:38.160
Remember, he made that declaration in verse number 16, surely the Lord is in this place,

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.500
and I knew it not.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:45.040
In verse number 19, he calls the place Bethel.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.400
Notice what he says, and he called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.440
city was called Luz at the first.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:58.640
So he gives this name of this place Bethel, this place where he set up this pillar, this

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.720
place in which he's poured the oil on top of the pillar, the place in which he's referred

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.400
to as being the house of God.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:11.600
In fact, the word Bethel literally means house of God.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.280
You see the impact that this event has had in the life of Jacob.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:20.520
You see the way in which he's responding to what he's experienced, and you see how that

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.840
he's immediately taking action and the changes.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.760
We don't see this type of behavior in the life of Jacob prior to this, do we?

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.440
You don't see this kind of behavior in the life of Jacob.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:35.520
As we've studied the previous chapters, as we've studied the life of Jacob and the little

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.040
bit that God has given us, and especially in chapter 27 with so much provided to us

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:44.360
about the life of Jacob, you see no types of responses like this.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:49.920
You see no recognition of God being God and what His plan and His purpose is, and we find

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:54.280
that Jacob is now responding and behaving in a different way.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:24:00.400
He's a changed man because of what he experienced.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.120
We think about this change and how it's evidenced through these declarations and through his

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:10.240
behavior, and no doubt when we think about our lives and we think about our conversion

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:14.000
and we think about the day in which we met the Lord Jesus Christ, there's some changes

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
in our life.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Amen?

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.880
I'm not the person I used to be.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:21.080
Aren't you glad that you're not the person you used to be?

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:25.680
Man, we sing the song with the kids and we talk about there's been a great change since

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.360
I've been born again, and we talk about the things that I used to do, I don't do them

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.480
anymore, the places I used to go, I don't go there anymore, the things I used to say.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.240
We sing all of those and we deal with all of that.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.240
Why?

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.840
Because there's been a great change since I've been born again.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.680
Do you not see in the behavior of Jacob that there's a change?

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.800
He's a changed man.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:52.320
We think about this change and we think about these declarations, we find that he understands

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.320
that he's in the place of God, that this is the house of God.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:25:00.760
He sets up this pillar, and then notice that he vows a vow, he makes a vow, and really

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:05.360
there's multiple aspects of it in verses 20-22, but I want you to notice what he says

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:11.900
and how he's responding and how his response, again, gives further evidence to the change

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.400
in his life.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:19.280
The Bible says that Jacob vowed a vow saying, if God will be with me and will keep me in

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:24.920
this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on so that I come

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:28.960
again to my father's house in peace, then shall the Lord be my God.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.760
Now, I want to break this down for you in verse 20 and 21, and I want you to understand

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:37.200
something that's very significant and very important as we seek to interpret this passage

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.320
of Scripture.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:43.720
In verse number 20, when Jacob vowed a vow and he said, if, that word, if, is different

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.360
than how we typically use the word, if.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:52.280
That word, if, is, in what you just said, it's since.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:59.160
The idea, the understanding is that Jacob is saying, since God will be with me.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:03.200
He's not saying, he's not laying out there and says, okay, well, if God is going to do

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.460
all of these things, then I will do this.

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.120
He's not wheeling and dealing with God.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.360
There's some people that kind of have that approach in life.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.760
There's some people that kind of, God, if you get me out of this, then I'll do that,

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.760
and if you do this for me, then I'll do this.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:17.760
That's not how God works.

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:18.760
It's not a barter system.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.280
It's just not how it works with God, amen?

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:28.920
And we find that here, Jacob is not using the word as we often use it in our today's

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.920
language.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.880
In fact, when you study through the Old Testament and the Hebrew language in particular, this

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:39.540
word, if, it carries with it, and actually through context, you can easily determine

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:45.000
if it's meaning if, as in if something's going to happen or if this happens, or if it's carrying

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.320
it with that idea of since.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.240
In fact, in the New Testament, it's the same way.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:52.200
You remember in the passage of Scripture in 1 Thessalonians 4.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:56.400
Let me just quickly go there for you, and I'll just give you this side note, not really

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.040
part of the message, but hopefully it'll be a blessing to you.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:04.080
1 Thessalonians chapter number 4, and we see this in the New Testament as well, where he

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:10.440
uses this terminology, and we find that he's given the great promise with regard to the

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:15.840
return of the Lord, and he says in verse number 13, but I would not have you to be ignorant,

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.800
brethren, 1 Thessalonians 4 and verse 13, concerning them which are asleep, that ye

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:24.440
sorrow not even as others which have no hope, for if we believe that Jesus died and rose

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:28.440
again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.360
That word if, in verse number 14, is since.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.280
Since we believe that Jesus died and rose again.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.720
He's not saying if we believe this.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.560
It's already been understood that they believe this truth, right?

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.840
Paul's not now wavering at some level.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:47.080
The church in Thessalonica is not wavering at some level with regard to the death and

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:51.640
burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ, but he's saying since we believe this, based upon

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:56.880
our belief, understanding this great truth, here's how it impacts us, and so Jacob is

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:03.400
using the word in that sense, and it says, if God, since God will be with me.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.700
Now where do you get this idea?

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.800
Verse number 15, right?

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.800
Remember the promises that God gave him?

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:16.240
Remember we mentioned that dream, what he saw, but we mentioned specifically what he

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:24.040
heard, and the significance of what Jacob heard God say, and as God is speaking to him,

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:28.160
and God speaks to him about a seed and about a land, but God speaks to him about his own

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:32.920
life, and he tells him that Jacob, I'm going to be with thee, and I will keep thee in all

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:38.359
places where thou goest, and now Jacob is saying, as he vows this vow to the Lord, he

00:28:38.359 --> 00:28:46.440
says, since God will be with me, and since he will keep me in this way that I go, and

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:52.960
he will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on, listen, our God's a good God.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:29:01.000
He takes good care of us, and Jacob has been impacted by what he heard God say.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.320
Listen, I would say it this way for us as New Testament believers, he had faith in what

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.720
God said.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.980
Amen?

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:16.020
He believed that God said to him, I will be with thee, and Jacob said, I believe that.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:23.700
I believe that God made this promise to me, and I'm trusting the faithful God.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.859
And that's precious.

00:29:26.859 --> 00:29:32.299
He's going out, now, from the best of our knowledge as we look at the biblical history,

00:29:32.299 --> 00:29:36.059
we know that he's been turned in the direction in which he's to go, he's been given that

00:29:36.059 --> 00:29:41.420
instruction by Isaac, and he knows the home in which he's going to go, but as best as

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:44.940
we know, he doesn't even know his uncle.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:50.020
There's no record of any family reunions that took place that we read of, and he's going

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:57.140
out, but God says, I'm going to be with you, and I'm going to provide for you.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.420
I'm going to not leave you.

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:00.179
I'm going to...

00:30:00.179 --> 00:30:06.659
fulfill my purpose in you." And Jacob believes God. He has faith in what God

00:30:06.659 --> 00:30:12.419
said. The Bible says that he continues and he says, so that I come again in

00:30:12.419 --> 00:30:16.859
verse number 21, to my father's house in peace. Now, notice what he says at the

00:30:16.859 --> 00:30:23.099
end of verse number 21, then shall the Lord be my God. I want you to think about

00:30:23.099 --> 00:30:28.339
the personal nature of this. Because when God first speaks to him in verse number

00:30:28.339 --> 00:30:37.419
13, he says, I am the Lord God of Abraham my father and the God of Isaac. We know

00:30:37.419 --> 00:30:43.219
that Abraham's his grandfather. The Word of God uses that phraseology often and

00:30:43.219 --> 00:30:49.139
it's, there's no error, there's no discrepancy. But God, Jehovah, he was

00:30:49.139 --> 00:30:55.939
Isaac's God, he was Abraham's God. And we find that now Jacob is making this great

00:30:55.979 --> 00:31:00.939
declaration and he's acknowledging the fact that the Lord is going to be my God.

00:31:00.939 --> 00:31:07.299
You know how important it is for every individual to come to the place where

00:31:07.299 --> 00:31:16.099
they acknowledge that he's my God? I know it seems maybe a little bit basic and

00:31:16.099 --> 00:31:21.699
elementary, but the reality is that God has no grandchildren. He only has

00:31:21.699 --> 00:31:28.699
children. Amen? And I understand for you grandparents out there, you love

00:31:28.699 --> 00:31:32.259
grandchildren, you think grandchildren are wonderful and all of the blessings

00:31:32.259 --> 00:31:37.939
of grandchildren, and I get it, but the reality is that God has no grandchildren.

00:31:37.939 --> 00:31:44.379
He only has children. And there has to come a point in your life when your

00:31:44.379 --> 00:31:49.979
parents' God is your God. There comes a point in our lives where it's no longer

00:31:50.179 --> 00:31:54.939
that it's just the God of my father, it's not just the the God of my mother, but we

00:31:54.939 --> 00:31:59.699
find that it's my God and that I have a personal relationship with the God of

00:31:59.699 --> 00:32:08.019
heaven. It's so important. We find that no doubt it's beneficial for us, it's

00:32:08.019 --> 00:32:12.939
helpful for us to be in a place, in a position in which we have the influence

00:32:12.939 --> 00:32:17.779
of godly people in our lives and we have the understanding that there are people

00:32:17.779 --> 00:32:22.139
that come into our lives and they have this influence in our lives and they

00:32:22.139 --> 00:32:29.000
help us in our walk with God and they help us to to be what we're to be in the

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.179
Lord and in all of that influence, but the reality is that there's some point

00:32:33.179 --> 00:32:40.779
in our lives where it must be that this God is my God. Joshua brings the people

00:32:40.779 --> 00:32:46.139
to a place of decision. He says, ask for me in my house, we will serve the Lord.

00:32:46.259 --> 00:32:51.299
But the decision is for you, nation of Israel. How are you going to respond? What

00:32:51.299 --> 00:32:55.739
are you going to do? And we know that the Bible tells us and teaches us that they

00:32:55.739 --> 00:33:00.179
respond and they make the declaration, they make the decision that they too

00:33:00.179 --> 00:33:05.339
would serve the Lord God. But we find that as we look throughout the Word of

00:33:05.339 --> 00:33:11.939
God, I often think of this particular example in 2nd Chronicles 24. If you

00:33:11.939 --> 00:33:16.459
want to turn there just for a moment and look at this passage and we can see

00:33:16.459 --> 00:33:22.139
this over in Kings as well, but here in 2nd Chronicles chapter number 24 and I

00:33:22.139 --> 00:33:26.019
just want to draw your attention very quickly to a couple of points within

00:33:26.019 --> 00:33:29.979
this passage of Scripture and I want you to think this evening of the

00:33:29.979 --> 00:33:34.939
significance of Jacob making this statement that he no longer is just the

00:33:34.939 --> 00:33:42.299
God of Abraham and Isaac but he's my God, the Lord Jehovah, he's my God. Here

00:33:42.299 --> 00:33:47.139
in 2nd Chronicles 24 we read of Joash and he's going to be the king and the

00:33:47.139 --> 00:33:51.059
Bible tells us about Jehoiada who was the priest and Jehoiada was very

00:33:51.059 --> 00:33:56.299
influential in the life of Joash. In fact the Bible tells us that as long as

00:33:56.299 --> 00:34:02.500
Jehoiada was living that Joash did the right thing and he served and he

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:05.539
followed the Lord so on and so forth but I want to draw your attention to

00:34:05.539 --> 00:34:10.339
2nd Chronicles 24 and verse 15 for the Bible says that Jehoiada waxed old and

00:34:10.339 --> 00:34:16.899
was full of days when he died. There's gonna come a time when that mentor,

00:34:16.899 --> 00:34:23.820
that influencer in your life is going to go home to be with the Lord and

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:31.899
that personal relationship that we have with God is of such importance because

00:34:31.899 --> 00:34:38.899
when Jehoiada is off the scene when he dies, now what does that do to

00:34:38.899 --> 00:34:43.820
Joash? Where is his place? What is his walk with God? That's why I try to teach

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.979
these young people to walk with God. That's why we're passing out these

00:34:47.979 --> 00:34:52.979
prayer lists on Wednesday evening and listing out the names of the kids in the

00:34:52.979 --> 00:34:56.299
nursery, the kids in the children's ministry, the teenagers this Wednesday

00:34:56.299 --> 00:34:59.500
and we're listing those young people. We want to pray that they get saved at a

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:05.619
young age and that they learn to walk with God. They learn to develop that

00:35:05.619 --> 00:35:10.019
relationship, that fellowship with God. Notice in verse 17 it says,

00:35:10.019 --> 00:35:14.459
Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah and made obeisance to

00:35:14.459 --> 00:35:18.539
the king. Then the king hearkened unto them, listen, they came with flattery and

00:35:18.539 --> 00:35:23.940
they sought to influence Joash. His mentor was now gone and it was it

00:35:23.979 --> 00:35:31.739
becomes obvious, abundantly clear that he had no real walk with God personally. In

00:35:31.739 --> 00:35:37.380
fact, the Bible tells us that in verse number 21, they conspired against him and

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.820
stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:43.059
the house of the Lord. You know who they they stoned here? They stoned

00:35:43.059 --> 00:35:47.220
Zechariah. According to verse number 20, he came and he spoke against what was

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:51.779
happening and talked about how they were forsaking the Lord and Zechariah was the

00:35:51.779 --> 00:36:05.019
son of Jehoiada. And Joash says stone him. The importance of having that walk

00:36:05.019 --> 00:36:14.940
with God. While Jehoiada was alive, Joash did right, but Jehoiada died. And here in

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:26.459
Genesis chapter 28, as Jacob is responding and declaring the change, he

00:36:26.459 --> 00:36:32.380
vows this vow and he says, I understand that God has made this promise, these

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:37.059
promises to me and I trust God, I believe God, I believe that he's going to do it

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:45.899
and the Lord, he's my God. How powerful that is. Notice in verse number 22, back

00:36:45.899 --> 00:36:53.859
in Genesis chapter 28, as we clean up or finish up this passage of scripture, he

00:36:53.859 --> 00:36:59.579
refers to the stone, which of course, if you go back in verse number 11, it was

00:36:59.579 --> 00:37:02.699
the stones that he had set up for pillows. You look at verse number 18, it's the

00:37:02.699 --> 00:37:08.100
stone that he now uses as a pillar and poured oil upon it and he says, this stone,

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:15.380
which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house. No longer is Jacob just out

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:21.579
looking for himself. Up to this point in Jacob's life, who was he most concerned

00:37:21.579 --> 00:37:28.899
for? Himself, right? Esau comes and he's hungry. He'd been out, he's fainting.

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:34.380
What's Jacob looking for? I'll give you some pottage, you give me the birthright, right?

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:39.979
Chapter 27, what's Jacob trying to get? He's trying to get a blessing. Who's he looking for?

00:37:39.979 --> 00:37:45.419
Himself. Remember, when Rebecca says, here's what our plan's going to be, here's

00:37:45.419 --> 00:37:50.979
what you're going to do, he wasn't concerned with the plan not being right, he was

00:37:50.979 --> 00:37:59.139
concerned about getting caught, right? But now all of a sudden, the evidence of the

00:37:59.139 --> 00:38:04.979
change in the life of Jacob, he now declares that this pillar that I've set

00:38:04.979 --> 00:38:10.179
up, this shall be God's house. Now notice the depth of what he reveals in this

00:38:10.179 --> 00:38:15.100
final statement of verse number 22. It says this, and of all that thou shalt

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:18.100
give me, now I know there's no punctuation there but I want you to just

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:23.979
stop there just for a moment, and of all that thou shalt give me, you understand

00:38:23.979 --> 00:38:30.660
that he is the giver of all things. You understand that this evening? Everything

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:38.059
that we have is because of the good hand of God. Amen? Everything that we have. You

00:38:38.059 --> 00:38:40.739
say, well you don't understand pastor, I have this really good mind and I was

00:38:40.739 --> 00:38:47.059
able to go to school and get these... Who gave you that mind? You know about

00:38:47.059 --> 00:38:53.820
Nebuchadnezzar? He was pretty powerful, wasn't he? He was the king of Babylon, the

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:59.979
most powerful empire at that time, the world empire. He was the king, had all the

00:38:59.979 --> 00:39:05.099
power. In fact, it's obvious when Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego decide

00:39:05.099 --> 00:39:10.940
that they're not gonna bow down, they're gonna stand in courageous... and stand in

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:16.020
defiance with courage against that mandate that had been given by

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:21.099
Nebuchadnezzar, and they stand courageously. And he says, who is that

00:39:21.099 --> 00:39:25.140
God that shall deliver you out of my hand? And then he found out who that God

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:33.619
was. What happened to Nebuchadnezzar? God gave him over. He was like an animal out

00:39:33.619 --> 00:39:42.659
in the field, right? We must recognize this evening that everything that we

00:39:42.659 --> 00:39:51.099
have is because of the good hand of God. Every good gift, right? James 1 verse 17,

00:39:51.099 --> 00:39:56.659
it comes from where? It comes from above. It comes from God. Our God is good. And

00:39:56.659 --> 00:40:02.099
Jacob is acknowledging some powerful truth here.

00:40:02.099 --> 00:40:06.179
that is important for every child of God to recognize.

00:40:06.179 --> 00:40:10.019
In fact, later on, as God is preparing the children

00:40:10.019 --> 00:40:12.839
of Israel for entrance into the land

00:40:12.839 --> 00:40:16.979
and he's using Moses to give them instruction,

00:40:16.979 --> 00:40:19.099
God reminds them of this.

00:40:19.099 --> 00:40:22.219
God reminds them of this in Deuteronomy 8,

00:40:22.219 --> 00:40:23.419
in verse number 18, it says,

00:40:23.419 --> 00:40:25.699
"'But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God,

00:40:25.699 --> 00:40:29.839
"'for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth,

00:40:29.839 --> 00:40:31.459
"'that he may establish his covenant,

00:40:31.479 --> 00:40:33.999
"'which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.'"

00:40:33.999 --> 00:40:35.199
And so he says, listen,

00:40:36.159 --> 00:40:37.719
Moses is given this instruction,

00:40:37.719 --> 00:40:39.479
we have to recognize that it's God

00:40:39.479 --> 00:40:42.759
that gives us the power to get this wealth.

00:40:42.759 --> 00:40:45.119
You use that terminology, you've heard it, no doubt,

00:40:45.119 --> 00:40:47.319
where people talk about being a self-made man,

00:40:47.319 --> 00:40:48.479
there's no such thing.

00:40:49.439 --> 00:40:51.159
There really isn't.

00:40:51.159 --> 00:40:54.799
We find that God, in his grace and his mercy,

00:40:54.799 --> 00:40:57.319
and he would give us the abilities that he gives us

00:40:57.319 --> 00:41:00.799
and how important that we find this evening,

00:41:00.799 --> 00:41:02.679
this statement of Jacob when he says,

00:41:02.679 --> 00:41:04.739
"'Of all that thou shalt give me,'

00:41:04.739 --> 00:41:08.979
recognizing that it's God that is the one that gives.

00:41:08.979 --> 00:41:12.339
This God that is the one that blesses.

00:41:12.339 --> 00:41:15.759
Jacob is finally, I believe, coming to a place

00:41:15.759 --> 00:41:18.499
where he's understanding it's no longer needful.

00:41:18.499 --> 00:41:20.419
We've said this multiple times

00:41:20.419 --> 00:41:21.579
in the last several chapters,

00:41:21.579 --> 00:41:24.319
living by faith does not require scheming.

00:41:26.059 --> 00:41:26.899
He's coming to this place

00:41:26.899 --> 00:41:29.779
where he's recognizing that God is the giver.

00:41:29.799 --> 00:41:32.639
And he says, "'Of all that thou shalt give me,'

00:41:32.639 --> 00:41:33.939
notice what he says,

00:41:33.939 --> 00:41:38.939
"'I will surely give the 10th unto thee.'"

00:41:39.319 --> 00:41:40.999
I will surely give the 10th unto thee.

00:41:40.999 --> 00:41:43.219
And so we find that he recognizes

00:41:43.219 --> 00:41:45.139
that the Lord is the giver of all things

00:41:45.139 --> 00:41:48.039
and he's committed to giving a tithe,

00:41:48.039 --> 00:41:50.359
as we'd understand, a 10th unto thee.

00:41:50.359 --> 00:41:51.639
And he's committed to that

00:41:51.639 --> 00:41:53.599
and he's recognizing the significance

00:41:53.599 --> 00:41:54.719
and the importance of that

00:41:54.719 --> 00:41:57.519
and really the blessing of that.

00:41:57.519 --> 00:41:58.919
This is pre-law.

00:41:58.939 --> 00:42:01.099
So many people wanna argue,

00:42:01.099 --> 00:42:02.999
even as I mentioned this morning, with miracles.

00:42:02.999 --> 00:42:06.979
They wanna dismiss and argue about miracles

00:42:06.979 --> 00:42:09.179
and try to explain away.

00:42:09.179 --> 00:42:11.859
And people that wanna try to get out of giving a tithe,

00:42:11.859 --> 00:42:12.699
they try to explain away,

00:42:12.699 --> 00:42:15.619
"'Well, we're not under the law,' and so on and so forth.

00:42:15.619 --> 00:42:19.399
"'Abraham gave of the tithe, Jacob's committing to it.'"

00:42:19.399 --> 00:42:21.539
It's not necessarily just part of the law.

00:42:23.199 --> 00:42:27.359
Giving to God is a blessing, is an absolute blessing.

00:42:27.359 --> 00:42:29.459
By the way, you could never out-give God.

00:42:30.759 --> 00:42:31.599
Somebody said this.

00:42:31.599 --> 00:42:33.439
Letourneau actually was the one that said it.

00:42:33.439 --> 00:42:37.719
And he had actually suffered some really difficult days

00:42:37.719 --> 00:42:41.399
leading up into the Great Depression in the 1930s.

00:42:41.399 --> 00:42:43.119
And he was a Christian man.

00:42:43.119 --> 00:42:45.979
Many people had encouraged him to file bankruptcy

00:42:45.979 --> 00:42:46.859
and so on and so forth,

00:42:46.859 --> 00:42:48.759
but he was committed to doing the right thing

00:42:48.759 --> 00:42:50.919
and to having integrity and to paying his bills

00:42:50.919 --> 00:42:51.879
and so on and so forth.

00:42:51.879 --> 00:42:53.939
And he was committed to giving to God.

00:42:53.939 --> 00:42:56.419
And here's what Letourneau said.

00:42:56.419 --> 00:42:58.339
He said, when I think about giving to God,

00:42:58.339 --> 00:42:59.819
your perspective has to be this.

00:42:59.819 --> 00:43:04.339
It's not how much of my money I give to God,

00:43:04.339 --> 00:43:08.259
but it's how much of God's money I keep for myself.

00:43:08.259 --> 00:43:10.619
That's a different way to think about it.

00:43:10.619 --> 00:43:12.419
I like that.

00:43:12.419 --> 00:43:15.999
By the way, Letourneau was famously known

00:43:15.999 --> 00:43:20.099
for giving 90% to God and keeping 10% for himself.

00:43:21.099 --> 00:43:22.659
I'm not suggesting anyone do that.

00:43:22.659 --> 00:43:24.259
You better pray about it, amen?

00:43:24.259 --> 00:43:26.219
You start doing that and you can't pay your electric bill

00:43:27.059 --> 00:43:28.139
and you're gonna call me, amen?

00:43:28.139 --> 00:43:30.499
But the reality is that, man,

00:43:30.499 --> 00:43:31.619
that's what a great perspective.

00:43:31.619 --> 00:43:34.019
It's not how much of my money I give God,

00:43:34.019 --> 00:43:36.679
but how much of God's money I keep for myself.

00:43:36.679 --> 00:43:37.519
Why?

00:43:37.519 --> 00:43:41.379
Because I'm recognizing that God, He gives me all of this.

00:43:41.379 --> 00:43:43.219
He's been so good to me.

00:43:43.219 --> 00:43:45.459
I want you to think about this in 1 Chronicles 29,

00:43:45.459 --> 00:43:47.459
and we'll finish here.

00:43:47.459 --> 00:43:50.319
The life of David near the end of his life.

00:43:52.499 --> 00:43:54.299
And I don't have time to look at all of this

00:43:54.299 --> 00:43:58.179
that the hour's gone, I need to wrap up the message,

00:43:58.179 --> 00:44:00.699
but I want you to see here in 1 Chronicles 29,

00:44:00.699 --> 00:44:02.539
perhaps you'd like to go back and read it later

00:44:02.539 --> 00:44:06.259
this evening, this week, make a note to read this passage.

00:44:06.259 --> 00:44:10.339
It's just fabulous, the response of David and the people

00:44:10.339 --> 00:44:13.879
with the ability to give to the work of God.

00:44:13.879 --> 00:44:16.639
David is giving to a work that he'd never see fulfilled.

00:44:16.639 --> 00:44:19.139
He'd never see the temple completed.

00:44:19.139 --> 00:44:20.699
He'd never worship God in the temple,

00:44:20.699 --> 00:44:22.699
but yet he's giving and he's preparing

00:44:22.699 --> 00:44:23.979
and he's offering willingly.

00:44:24.659 --> 00:44:26.659
And I want you to see that they're rejoicing greatly

00:44:26.659 --> 00:44:28.339
because of the opportunity to give.

00:44:28.339 --> 00:44:30.179
In fact, it says in verse number nine,

00:44:30.179 --> 00:44:32.379
then the people rejoiced, why?

00:44:32.379 --> 00:44:33.979
For that they offered willingly,

00:44:33.979 --> 00:44:35.139
because with perfect heart,

00:44:35.139 --> 00:44:37.099
they offered willingly to the Lord.

00:44:37.099 --> 00:44:39.419
And David the king also rejoiced, how?

00:44:39.419 --> 00:44:40.999
With great joy.

00:44:43.219 --> 00:44:45.699
Why could they rejoice at the giving?

00:44:45.699 --> 00:44:47.859
Why could they rejoice in the manner in which they did?

00:44:47.859 --> 00:44:49.179
Well, it's because of their perspective.

00:44:49.179 --> 00:44:51.619
Notice in verse number 14, it says,

00:44:51.619 --> 00:44:53.739
but who am I and what is my people

00:44:54.499 --> 00:44:57.139
that we should be able to offer so willingly

00:44:57.139 --> 00:44:59.099
after this sort?

00:44:59.099 --> 00:45:02.939
For all things come of thee and of thine own

00:45:02.939 --> 00:45:04.519
have we given thee.

00:45:05.659 --> 00:45:07.579
Man, we change our perspective

00:45:07.579 --> 00:45:10.899
and it really changes our entire outlook, does it not?

00:45:10.899 --> 00:45:14.539
And here, Jacob, a man who is known for,

00:45:14.539 --> 00:45:18.739
as we've studied his life, he's known for me and myself

00:45:18.739 --> 00:45:21.019
and how can I benefit and how can I get

00:45:21.019 --> 00:45:23.179
and how can I, in this situation,

00:45:23.539 --> 00:45:25.859
how can I benefit the most?

00:45:25.859 --> 00:45:28.439
But then he meets the Lord personally.

00:45:29.459 --> 00:45:31.939
He departed, had a dream,

00:45:32.979 --> 00:45:35.939
and in that dream, he saw a vision,

00:45:35.939 --> 00:45:38.739
but more than seeing a vision, he heard a voice.

00:45:38.739 --> 00:45:41.099
And he heard the voice of God.

00:45:41.099 --> 00:45:43.619
And God gave him some promise

00:45:43.619 --> 00:45:45.619
with regard to the Abrahamic covenant

00:45:45.619 --> 00:45:48.139
and with regard to the land and the seed,

00:45:48.139 --> 00:45:53.139
but God spoke about his life personally in verse number 15.

00:45:53.379 --> 00:45:56.619
And all that God said he would do for Jacob.

00:45:56.619 --> 00:46:00.219
And Jacob responded and he made some declarations

00:46:00.219 --> 00:46:03.899
and through his response and through these declarations,

00:46:03.899 --> 00:46:06.659
we see that he's a changed individual.

00:46:07.979 --> 00:46:11.139
And he concludes by saying,

00:46:11.139 --> 00:46:12.899
of all that thou shalt give me,

00:46:12.899 --> 00:46:17.139
I will surely give the 10th unto thee.

00:46:17.139 --> 00:46:19.679
He understood that God had given him

00:46:19.679 --> 00:46:21.499
some encouraging promises.

00:46:21.499 --> 00:46:25.299
And he said, the Lord shall be my God.

00:46:26.399 --> 00:46:28.219
The Lord shall be my God.

00:46:28.219 --> 00:46:30.099
And here's how I'm gonna worship him.

00:46:30.099 --> 00:46:32.059
Here's how I'm gonna serve him.

00:46:32.059 --> 00:46:33.459
This evening, I'm so thankful

00:46:33.459 --> 00:46:35.219
that God revealed himself to me.

00:46:36.179 --> 00:46:38.619
Aren't you glad that God revealed himself to you?

00:46:39.499 --> 00:46:41.539
Man, that we can know him,

00:46:41.539 --> 00:46:44.099
we can have that relationship with him.

00:46:44.099 --> 00:46:45.699
But how's it impact us?

00:46:45.699 --> 00:46:47.179
How does it change our behavior?

00:46:47.179 --> 00:46:48.499
How does it change our outlook?

00:46:48.499 --> 00:46:53.219
How does it change our perspective in life?

00:46:53.219 --> 00:46:57.179
Because when we know him and we know his promises,

00:46:57.179 --> 00:46:59.419
it's going to have an impact in our lives.

00:46:59.419 --> 00:47:01.079
It's gonna change us.

00:47:02.379 --> 00:47:03.619
Father, we love you.

00:47:04.459 --> 00:47:06.099
We thank you for loving us.

00:47:07.139 --> 00:47:11.679
We thank you for the change in Jacob's life.

00:47:14.339 --> 00:47:16.979
Up to this point, we've seen very little

00:47:17.939 --> 00:47:19.459
of anything spiritual.

00:47:22.859 --> 00:47:24.339
But now we see a changed man

00:47:26.339 --> 00:47:31.339
making some powerful declarations, commitments.

00:47:35.219 --> 00:47:38.099
God, I pray this evening that you'd help us

00:47:41.699 --> 00:47:44.459
to really evaluate and consider tonight

00:47:45.459 --> 00:47:48.859
the wonderful promises that you've given to us

00:47:48.859 --> 00:47:51.459
and how we respond to those promises,

00:47:53.139 --> 00:47:58.139
how we determine to live in obedience to you and to your word,

00:47:59.139 --> 00:48:04.139
how we become more concerned about your kingdom

00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:09.739
than my life.

00:48:10.739 --> 00:48:14.859
Just a few weeks ago, the teenager sang a powerful song

00:48:19.339 --> 00:48:21.259
about living their lives in such a way

00:48:21.259 --> 00:48:23.259
that you would be glorified

00:48:23.259 --> 00:48:27.219
and not looking for recognition or name

00:48:27.219 --> 00:48:29.379
or type of recognition here upon this earth,

00:48:29.379 --> 00:48:30.899
but living for you, Lord.

00:48:31.979 --> 00:48:34.539
God, I pray that even as we see that in Jacob's life

00:48:34.539 --> 00:48:37.099
in these last verses of Scripture,

00:48:37.099 --> 00:48:38.899
that it would be seen in our lives.

00:48:40.659 --> 00:48:42.219
It's about you, Lord.

00:48:42.219 --> 00:48:45.859
As John the Baptist said of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:48:45.859 --> 00:48:48.699
he must increase, I must decrease.

00:48:49.859 --> 00:48:53.459
Help us to recognize that you're the giver of all things.

00:48:53.459 --> 00:48:56.459
Help us to be faithful and obedient to you and to your word,

00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:59.579
to rejoice in the privilege and opportunity

00:48:59.579 --> 00:49:00.979
that we have to give to you.

00:49:02.219 --> 00:49:03.819
I pray that you'd move and work as only you can

00:49:03.819 --> 00:49:04.819
and we'll thank you for it.

00:49:04.819 --> 00:49:05.739
In Christ's name we pray.

00:49:05.739 --> 00:49:06.579
Would you stand with me?
