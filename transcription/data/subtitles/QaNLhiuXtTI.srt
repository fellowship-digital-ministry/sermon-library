1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
Proverbs chapter number 14 this evening, and the book of Proverbs, of course, the book

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,359
of wisdom, and I hope this evening that as we look at this verse of Scripture that we'd

3
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,000
be encouraged and challenged.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,040
And this verse of Scripture actually were provided with a contrast here in verse number

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:23,639
one of Proverbs 14, and I will focus our attention this evening on the first part of the verse,

6
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:27,319
but I will read the entirety of the verse and note the contrast, and then we'll look

7
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,079
at the text this evening.

8
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:36,200
Notice in Proverbs 14 in verse number one, the Bible says this, every wise woman buildeth

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:43,880
her house, but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,560
As we look at this contrast that is provided here, obviously you could preach a message

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,319
on the contrast between the wise and foolish and the behavior and the activity and the

12
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:57,119
result and so on and so forth, but I want to focus our attention this evening for just

13
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:59,919
a few minutes on this thought of building up.

14
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:05,680
And as we look at the first part of Proverbs 14 in verse number one, when the wise man

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,160
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God says, every wise woman buildeth her house.

16
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:17,360
I do not believe this evening that Solomon is speaking about lumber and nails and drywall.

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:24,199
Rather, I believe that as he's speaking here about the wise woman building her house, he's

18
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:27,559
speaking about the family.

19
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:34,000
He's speaking about the inhabitants of that home, the individuals, the family.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,599
As we begin to think about the phraseology here in the building up, I am reminded of

21
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,919
the New Testament word edify.

22
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:46,559
We're familiar with the word in the New Testament as we study throughout the New Testament and

23
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:52,120
how that we've been encouraged that we're to be engaged in edifying one another.

24
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,279
And as we begin to think this evening about this word edify in the New Testament, we will

25
00:01:56,279 --> 00:01:58,819
look at a number of verses in the New Testament.

26
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:02,080
The word edify literally means to build up.

27
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,680
It means to promote growth in another's life.

28
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,479
I want you to think about that from the perspective of the wise woman that is mentioned here in

29
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,039
Proverbs 14 in verse number one, every wise woman buildeth her house.

30
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:21,699
As we think about that New Testament admonition that we're to edify and the idea of not only

31
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:26,259
building up, but promoting growth in another's life.

32
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:32,740
And we can ask ourselves the question this evening, how can I promote growth, spiritual

33
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,380
growth in someone else's life?

34
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,259
How can God use me?

35
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:43,419
Can God use me to promote spiritual growth in someone else's life?

36
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:49,539
Obviously, God can use us to do that because he instructs us to edify one another.

37
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:54,080
And if he instructs us to do it, then not only are we capable of doing it through his

38
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,300
power and with his help, but we understand this evening that we are responsible to do

39
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,300
it.

40
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:08,220
We are responsible to have this ministry of edifying one another, building up.

41
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,339
This evening as we think about this subject and we think about the opportunity, even as

42
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:19,699
we mentioned this morning, not only for this on Mother's Day to think about moms building

43
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:24,660
up, edifying, promoting spiritual growth in the lives of their children.

44
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,720
But I think about broad application for us as the people of God and as the opportunity

45
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
that we have.

46
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,940
As you study the New Testament, you understand that there are many references about one another

47
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,300
commands.

48
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,279
And one of them is this one that we're speaking of this evening of edifying one another.

49
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:43,919
And we have that responsibility.

50
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,520
We can speak this evening specifically about mothers in their homes and building up their

51
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,360
house and promoting spiritual growth in the lives of their children.

52
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,199
But then we broadly apply it to each and every one of us here this evening.

53
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:01,639
And we can ask ourselves the question, who is it that God has placed in my life that

54
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:04,080
I am to be edifying?

55
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:11,919
Who is it that as I evaluate my life and my sphere of influence, who is it that I am

56
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,760
promoting spiritual growth in their lives?

57
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,200
Perhaps we could even evaluate it from this perspective.

58
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,959
Who is edifying me?

59
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:28,839
There should be someone that we can look to that we can understand that this person, you

60
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:35,100
know, as I evaluate my life, man, that person, they're constantly encouraging me, but they're

61
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,160
also edifying me.

62
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,640
They're promoting Christian growth in my life.

63
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,839
Those are good kind of people to hang around with, amen?

64
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:50,820
It's a blessing to be around someone that is challenging us in our walk with Christ.

65
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:57,239
It is good for us to be someone that is challenging someone else in their walk with Christ that

66
00:04:57,239 --> 00:05:02,160
we're edifying them, that we're promoting Christian growth in their lives.

67
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,359
And so how can we do that?

68
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:08,000
And let me offer just three quick thoughts this evening.

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,260
The list is obviously not exhaustive tonight.

70
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,880
We could spend several weeks dealing with ways in which we could edify one another,

71
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,359
but I just have three simple thoughts for you this evening.

72
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:21,359
I would say this.

73
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:23,600
Number one, we can offer praise.

74
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,679
And when I speak about offering praise, we can use our speech, as we think about this

75
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:34,179
truth of edifying, we can use our speech in such a way to edify one another.

76
00:05:34,179 --> 00:05:35,959
And we think about the power of the tongue.

77
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:39,679
And in fact, as we're here in the book of Proverbs, turn back a chapter or two, back

78
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:46,119
to Proverbs chapter number 12, and I want you to see what is said to us about our words.

79
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:50,540
Of course, as you study the entirety of the book of Proverbs, there is much that God says

80
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,600
about our words in the book of Proverbs throughout the whole of Scripture.

81
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,880
But really, as you focus on the book of Proverbs, you'll see many references to the tongue and

82
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,880
to our speech.

83
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,079
And here in Proverbs 12 and verse 25, notice the Bible says,

84
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:05,920
Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop.

85
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,600
But then notice this, but a good word maketh it glad.

86
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
A good word.

87
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,179
You know, has there ever been a time in your life where you had a heavy heart?

88
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:22,660
No doubt, every one of us, we've dealt with circumstances and situations in our lives

89
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,320
where we've had a season in our life where we've had a heavy heart over something that

90
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,559
has taken place.

91
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:34,119
And in the time of having that heavy heart, we can acknowledge this evening that a good

92
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:37,640
word maketh it glad.

93
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:44,160
The reality is that as we interact one with another as a body of believers, we have brothers

94
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,839
and sisters in Christ that at times, maybe at this particular season, they have a heavy

95
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:52,940
heart over something that's going on in their life.

96
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,399
Some circumstance that you or I, we may not even know about it.

97
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,640
But a good word maketh it glad.

98
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:05,179
It's amazing how God can use our speech to edify, to build up.

99
00:07:05,179 --> 00:07:09,040
Notice in Proverbs 18 and verse number 21.

100
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,920
In Proverbs 18 and verse number 21, it's very interesting when you think about the power

101
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,959
of our tongue in this verse of Scripture defines it this way.

102
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:24,440
It says this in Proverbs 18 and verse 21, death and life are in the power of the tongue.

103
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,799
They that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.

104
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:28,000
Think about that.

105
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,260
Death and life are in the power of the tongue.

106
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,880
How are we using our speech?

107
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,799
How are we using our tongue?

108
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:38,320
Are we using our words to edify someone, to build up?

109
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,600
The reality is that in the home, as we think about that launch point this evening from

110
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:48,679
Proverbs 14 and verse number one, no doubt a mother in the home as she's that wise woman

111
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:55,920
buildeth her house, that she can use her words to build up the family members.

112
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,760
We understand as a family of God, as a body of believers, that the power of our tongue,

113
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,720
are we using our speech to build up, to edify?

114
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,920
Notice again in Proverbs 25 and verse number 11.

115
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:17,320
In Proverbs 25 and verse number 11, notice here, the Bible says a word fitly spoken is

116
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,839
like apples of gold and pictures of silver.

117
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:24,600
A word fitly spoken.

118
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:26,839
A word fitly spoken.

119
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:32,799
It's amazing there are times in which the Holy Spirit of God will prompt us, maybe to

120
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,159
give a word of encouragement to someone.

121
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:42,280
In today's environment, I many times have this prompting where I'm praying for individuals

122
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:47,799
and God will just impress upon my heart that you need to send that person a text message.

123
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:53,080
We have that ability to be able to send a note to each other very quickly in our society

124
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
today.

125
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,960
There are times in which I receive text messages.

126
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,919
Sometimes I receive text messages from people that I haven't heard from in a long time.

127
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:04,919
I heard from one of our missionaries this morning and I've not heard a personal communication

128
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,080
from them in a little while.

129
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
It's been several months.

130
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,719
In fact, I've received communication to the church.

131
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:13,280
But I got a text message, hey brother, I'm just praying for you.

132
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,559
That was encouraging.

133
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:20,799
And the reality is that there are times in which we think about the power of our tongue

134
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:23,440
in a word fitly spoken.

135
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,840
It is described as being, it's like apples of gold and pictures of silver.

136
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,479
The book of Ephesians in the New Testament, we think about this truth of using our speech

137
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:37,000
and using our tongue in order to edify one another.

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,840
In Ephesians 4, we have at this latter part of this chapter in Ephesians 4, some very

139
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:51,320
instructive points that are made to the children of God and really practical lessons that are

140
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:57,039
given to us, very quick points that Paul is dealing with in the lives of the believers.

141
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,119
Notice in verse number 29, he says this,

142
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:04,719
Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth.

143
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:05,719
But notice what he says,

144
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:12,400
But that which is good to the use of edifying.

145
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Notice what it says,

146
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,960
That it may minister grace unto the hearers.

147
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,719
There's no doubt there's been a time in our lives when we've been the recipient of such

148
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:29,000
speech, that it has, someone has used their speech in the manner in which is dealt with

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,679
at the latter part of Ephesians 4.29.

150
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:39,960
They've used their speech in a way to edify and it's ministered grace in our lives.

151
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:45,000
And as we make that determination that I want to be engaged in that type of speech, that

152
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:52,400
I want to use speech that will edify one another, that will build up, that will encourage them,

153
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,000
that will promote Christian growth in their lives.

154
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,159
I think of this, not only that we can use our tongue in order to offer praise and to

155
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:07,200
give edification to people, but think about this, a simple thought.

156
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,039
Number two, remind them of God's promises.

157
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:17,719
We did not sing the song this evening, perhaps if we had gone through more opportunities

158
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:22,280
of favorites, someone along the line may have said, standing on the promises.

159
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,280
It's a great song.

160
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,960
And the reality is that when you think about the promises that God has given us in His

161
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,880
Word, they ought to cause us to rejoice greatly.

162
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,799
And we think about the promises and here's the reality is that there are times in our

163
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:40,359
lives in which we need to be reminded of God's promises.

164
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:44,599
There are times in our lives where we're dealing with difficulty and perhaps as we're

165
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:50,239
dealing with that difficulty that as someone would remind us of a promise that God has

166
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:56,679
given in His Word, it can encourage us, it can edify and build us up and promote some

167
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,479
growth in our lives.

168
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:04,880
But we also understand that God could use us to remind others of God's promises.

169
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,640
You know, if I don't know God's promises, I can't really encourage you with God's promises.

170
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,840
It seems pretty simple, but what a great understanding this evening.

171
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,520
I can't encourage you, I can't edify you with a promise from God's Word if I don't know

172
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,200
promises from God's Word.

173
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,599
And as we study the Word of God and we read the promises of God's Word and we begin to

174
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:35,479
take and to meditate upon those, then God will use us and use His Word to edify others.

175
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:40,119
Think about this, what Peter says in 2 Peter 1.

176
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:45,000
In 2 Peter 1, it's interesting as you begin to think about the life of Peter, and we often

177
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,960
can relate to Peter, and I have in my mind's eye a picture of Peter as a fisherman, just

178
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:59,520
a big kind of bold guy and, I mean, just kind of rough around the edges, so to speak.

179
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,960
But he got saved by the grace of God, and his life was changed, and all of a sudden

180
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,119
this fisherman, he starts using words like precious, and that's kind of interesting to

181
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:11,119
me.

182
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:16,119
You see it in his writings and here in 2 Peter 1 and verse number 4, notice what Peter says.

183
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:22,159
He says, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, whereby are given unto us exceeding

184
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:32,200
great and precious promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature,

185
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:38,599
having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.

186
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:42,039
Exceeding great and precious promises.

187
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:47,280
But when we speak about the promises of God, though we can speak about them collectively

188
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:53,599
as the promises of God, it is important for us to know them individually.

189
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:58,640
And as we know the promises of God individually, as we can run to the Word of God and we can

190
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:04,599
rehearse promises that God has given us in His Word, then God can use us to edify one

191
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:10,119
another through sharing a promise with a brother or sister in Christ.

192
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:12,140
Remember what God said.

193
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,280
Can I remind you of what God said?

194
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:20,760
You know, Peter says here as he's writing to these that are just dealing with some difficulty,

195
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:26,000
especially here in the book of 2 Peter, and he's dealing with these that have just suffered

196
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,359
and all that they're dealing with.

197
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,039
And notice what he says in verse number 13 of chapter 1.

198
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:35,159
He says, yea, I think it meant as long as I am in this tabernacle to stir you up by

199
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:37,960
putting you in remembrance.

200
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,039
And you think about that idea of putting someone in remembrance.

201
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,880
He says that I know that you know these things, but I want to remind you of these things.

202
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:52,359
You know, it's amazing how sometimes we can have great knowledge and remembrance of the

203
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:57,200
truth of God's Word and the promises of God's Word when someone else is going through a

204
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
trial.

205
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:04,320
But sometimes when we're going through the trial, all of a sudden we have like amnesia.

206
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
Right?

207
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,880
Doesn't that happen sometimes?

208
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
Seriously.

209
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:13,400
We're going through the trial and all of a sudden we are failing to be able to recall

210
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,719
the promises of God.

211
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:15,719
Why?

212
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:17,400
Because we're under it, so to speak.

213
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:23,679
We're dealing with the weight of the situation and the turmoil that we're dealing with and

214
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,760
oh, that God would use somebody else maybe to edify me and remind me of a promise that

215
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,599
God has given.

216
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:35,599
Quickly, number three, let them know that you're praying for them.

217
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:36,599
It's so simple.

218
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:43,119
It really is, but you know, it's so important to be engaged in the ministry of intercessory

219
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:44,119
prayer.

220
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:50,479
One of the greatest things that we could do for one another as believers, as brothers

221
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:55,239
and sisters in Christ, is to pray one for another.

222
00:15:55,239 --> 00:16:00,840
Sometimes we feel like we ought to be able to do something more, but if we really sit

223
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:06,260
back and just evaluate, it is absolutely the greatest thing we could ever do for someone

224
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,159
is pray for them, to pray for them.

225
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:14,039
We were talking at the house this afternoon and someone made a comment about praying for

226
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:19,880
someone else, and they made this comment with regard to the timing in which they would pray,

227
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,320
and it reminded me of something that I read of Dr. Lee Roberson many years ago.

228
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:31,320
Of course, he's with the Lord now, but Lee Roberson pastored a church down in Tennessee,

229
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,460
a huge Tennessee temple was down there, and just a huge church, thousands and thousands

230
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,460
of members, and he would often be asked by members of the church to pray for this or

231
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,460
pray for that.

232
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,780
And he found that if he didn't stop and do it right then, he would forget.

233
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:49,280
He would get clouded and something else would come up, and so on and so forth.

234
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,460
And so he would make it a point in his life and his ministry that he would just stop immediately

235
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:58,960
and he would pray for whatever that need is or was that the person would share with them.

236
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,979
Notice what Paul says to the believers in Philippi.

237
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,020
I hope these words would encourage you.

238
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:09,699
In fact, this evening we could spend, literally, we could spend an hour or two going through

239
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:14,420
all of the references within the Word of God where someone is saying, I'm praying for

240
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,420
you.

241
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:20,140
I mean, it's just, the references are many throughout the Word of God.

242
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:27,699
But I want you to see, and often we find that in the greetings that Paul offers to the either

243
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:31,660
individuals or churches that he's writing to, he will mention something about praying

244
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,660
for them.

245
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:42,219
As we think about the truth of God's Word, it's not just a cliche.

246
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:46,500
It's not just, oh, this has to be included in the introductory statements of this letter

247
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,819
or this correspondence that I'm praying for you.

248
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:58,780
No, it's, I mean, this was, Paul was engaging in the ministry of intercessory prayer on

249
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,300
behalf of these believers.

250
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:08,219
Notice in verse number three, he says, I thank my God upon every remembrance of you.

251
00:18:08,219 --> 00:18:18,300
Notice what he says, always in every prayer of mine for you all, making request with joy

252
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:23,099
for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now, being confident of this

253
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:29,099
very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day

254
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:34,300
of Jesus Christ, even as it is for me to think this of you all.

255
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:40,339
Notice what he says, because I have you in my heart, and as much as both in my bonds

256
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:46,660
and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.

257
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:53,579
For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ, and

258
00:18:53,579 --> 00:19:00,900
this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment,

259
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,939
that you may approve things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and without offense

260
00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:10,979
till the day of Christ being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus

261
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:15,819
Christ under the glory and praise of God.

262
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:20,060
Now when the believers at Philippi in this church, when they receive this letter and

263
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:25,219
they read those words, do you think they were being encouraged and being edified and

264
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:26,219
being built up?

265
00:19:26,219 --> 00:19:29,060
I mean, he's reminding them of promises.

266
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:33,339
He says in verse 6, it's something that we claim in our lives, being confident of this

267
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:39,099
very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day

268
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:40,099
of Jesus Christ.

269
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:44,500
Oh man, that's encouraging, that's building me up, that's edifying me.

270
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,900
And Paul says, here's how I'm praying for you.

271
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,180
He says, because you're in my heart, you're in my prayers.

272
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:56,739
Because he makes it clear in verse number 7, that he has them because I have you in

273
00:19:56,739 --> 00:19:58,260
my heart.

274
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:03,880
He says, I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, always in verse number 4, in every

275
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:09,219
prayer of mine, for you all making request with joy.

276
00:20:09,219 --> 00:20:15,060
It's an absolute blessing to be able to be engaged in the ministry of intercessory prayer.

277
00:20:15,219 --> 00:20:18,780
You know, when we tell someone that we're praying for them, first of all, we shouldn't

278
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,900
say it if we're not doing it.

279
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,160
That should go without saying.

280
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,540
But the reality is that we're seeking to edify, to build them up, to encourage them in the

281
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,300
ways of the Lord.

282
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,780
And as you study the prayers of Paul, we don't have time this evening to make much comment

283
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:38,739
on this, but the reality is that as you study the prayers of Paul throughout the New Testament

284
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:42,219
for those that he's ministering to, you know what he does is just what we read there in

285
00:20:42,219 --> 00:20:43,359
Philippians 1.

286
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,959
He doesn't just say, I'm praying for you, but he says, here's how I'm praying for you.

287
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:51,319
When someone's praying for you that you're growing in your walk with Christ and that

288
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:55,819
your walk with Christ is richer and deeper than it has been before, man, that's stirring

289
00:20:55,819 --> 00:21:01,839
us up and that's edifying us, that's promoting growth, Christian growth, spiritual growth

290
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,719
in our lives.

291
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:10,439
So Proverbs 14.1 says, every wise woman buildeth her house.

292
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:16,160
Sometimes we think this evening of a broad application as a family of God, a church,

293
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,839
a body of believers, brothers and sisters in Christ.

294
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:22,160
Who are we building up?

295
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,119
Who's building us up?

296
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:28,079
Someone ought to be edifying us, but we ought to be edifying someone else because we've

297
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:34,760
been given the instruction in the New Testament, the responsibility to edify one another.

298
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,439
And you know, the reality is you study the book of 1 Corinthians, when you think about

299
00:21:38,939 --> 00:21:43,479
spiritual growths and spiritual gifts, excuse me, and you look at the spiritual growths

300
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:49,000
in the book of 1 Corinthians, you'll find several times that Paul says that these are

301
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,599
to be used for the edifying of the church.

302
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:57,420
God didn't give us a spiritual gift so that we could say, look at the gift I have.

303
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,500
He gave us a spiritual gift so that we would edify one another.

304
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,959
And what a joy to be involved in the promotion of Christian spiritual growth in the life

305
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,239
of another.

306
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:09,239
Let's pray together.

307
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:10,239
Father, we love You.

308
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:15,760
We thank You for the opportunity to be here this evening, and it's such a joy to sing

309
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,839
the great hymns of the faith and to be encouraged through the words of those songs.

310
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:24,920
And I thank You for the ladies of our church.

311
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:30,000
I thank You for the day in which we've set upon our calendar in this nation to honor

312
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
mothers.

313
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,239
And God, we pray that as we've briefly looked at this thought from Proverbs 14.1 and looking

314
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:42,079
at these various portions of Scripture, that You would help us, Lord, to be engaged in

315
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:45,920
the ministry of building up.

316
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:52,040
I pray that we are being edified, but I pray, God, that we are edifying someone else.

317
00:22:52,040 --> 00:23:00,119
Would You help us to be purposed in fulfilling the responsibility that You've given us to

318
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:02,520
edify one another?

319
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:07,239
I pray, God, that as we leave this place in just a little while, that You would help us

320
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:10,560
as we go throughout our week to honor and glorify You.

321
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:16,160
We pray that in this moment of invitation that You would move and work as only You can.

322
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,560
We'll thank You for each decision that's made, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

323
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:19,680
Would You?
