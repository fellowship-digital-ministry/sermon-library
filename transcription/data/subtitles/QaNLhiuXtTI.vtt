00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
Proverbs chapter number 14 this evening, and the book of Proverbs, of course, the book

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.359
of wisdom, and I hope this evening that as we look at this verse of Scripture that we'd

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:12.000
be encouraged and challenged.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.040
And this verse of Scripture actually were provided with a contrast here in verse number

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.639
one of Proverbs 14, and I will focus our attention this evening on the first part of the verse,

00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:27.319
but I will read the entirety of the verse and note the contrast, and then we'll look

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:29.079
at the text this evening.

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:36.200
Notice in Proverbs 14 in verse number one, the Bible says this, every wise woman buildeth

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.880
her house, but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.560
As we look at this contrast that is provided here, obviously you could preach a message

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.319
on the contrast between the wise and foolish and the behavior and the activity and the

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:57.119
result and so on and so forth, but I want to focus our attention this evening for just

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.919
a few minutes on this thought of building up.

00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:05.680
And as we look at the first part of Proverbs 14 in verse number one, when the wise man

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.160
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God says, every wise woman buildeth her house.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.360
I do not believe this evening that Solomon is speaking about lumber and nails and drywall.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.199
Rather, I believe that as he's speaking here about the wise woman building her house, he's

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:27.559
speaking about the family.

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:34.000
He's speaking about the inhabitants of that home, the individuals, the family.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.599
As we begin to think about the phraseology here in the building up, I am reminded of

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.919
the New Testament word edify.

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:46.559
We're familiar with the word in the New Testament as we study throughout the New Testament and

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:52.120
how that we've been encouraged that we're to be engaged in edifying one another.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.279
And as we begin to think this evening about this word edify in the New Testament, we will

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:58.819
look at a number of verses in the New Testament.

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.080
The word edify literally means to build up.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.680
It means to promote growth in another's life.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.479
I want you to think about that from the perspective of the wise woman that is mentioned here in

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.039
Proverbs 14 in verse number one, every wise woman buildeth her house.

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:21.699
As we think about that New Testament admonition that we're to edify and the idea of not only

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:26.259
building up, but promoting growth in another's life.

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:32.740
And we can ask ourselves the question this evening, how can I promote growth, spiritual

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.380
growth in someone else's life?

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.259
How can God use me?

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:43.419
Can God use me to promote spiritual growth in someone else's life?

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:49.539
Obviously, God can use us to do that because he instructs us to edify one another.

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:54.080
And if he instructs us to do it, then not only are we capable of doing it through his

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.300
power and with his help, but we understand this evening that we are responsible to do

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.300
it.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:08.220
We are responsible to have this ministry of edifying one another, building up.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.339
This evening as we think about this subject and we think about the opportunity, even as

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:19.699
we mentioned this morning, not only for this on Mother's Day to think about moms building

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:24.660
up, edifying, promoting spiritual growth in the lives of their children.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.720
But I think about broad application for us as the people of God and as the opportunity

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.720
that we have.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.940
As you study the New Testament, you understand that there are many references about one another

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.300
commands.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.279
And one of them is this one that we're speaking of this evening of edifying one another.

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:43.919
And we have that responsibility.

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:48.520
We can speak this evening specifically about mothers in their homes and building up their

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.360
house and promoting spiritual growth in the lives of their children.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.199
But then we broadly apply it to each and every one of us here this evening.

00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:01.639
And we can ask ourselves the question, who is it that God has placed in my life that

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.080
I am to be edifying?

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:11.919
Who is it that as I evaluate my life and my sphere of influence, who is it that I am

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:16.760
promoting spiritual growth in their lives?

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.200
Perhaps we could even evaluate it from this perspective.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.959
Who is edifying me?

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:28.839
There should be someone that we can look to that we can understand that this person, you

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:35.100
know, as I evaluate my life, man, that person, they're constantly encouraging me, but they're

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.160
also edifying me.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.640
They're promoting Christian growth in my life.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.839
Those are good kind of people to hang around with, amen?

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:50.820
It's a blessing to be around someone that is challenging us in our walk with Christ.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:57.239
It is good for us to be someone that is challenging someone else in their walk with Christ that

00:04:57.239 --> 00:05:02.160
we're edifying them, that we're promoting Christian growth in their lives.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.359
And so how can we do that?

00:05:04.359 --> 00:05:08.000
And let me offer just three quick thoughts this evening.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.260
The list is obviously not exhaustive tonight.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.880
We could spend several weeks dealing with ways in which we could edify one another,

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.359
but I just have three simple thoughts for you this evening.

00:05:20.359 --> 00:05:21.359
I would say this.

00:05:21.359 --> 00:05:23.600
Number one, we can offer praise.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.679
And when I speak about offering praise, we can use our speech, as we think about this

00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:34.179
truth of edifying, we can use our speech in such a way to edify one another.

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:35.959
And we think about the power of the tongue.

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:39.679
And in fact, as we're here in the book of Proverbs, turn back a chapter or two, back

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:46.119
to Proverbs chapter number 12, and I want you to see what is said to us about our words.

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:50.540
Of course, as you study the entirety of the book of Proverbs, there is much that God says

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.600
about our words in the book of Proverbs throughout the whole of Scripture.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.880
But really, as you focus on the book of Proverbs, you'll see many references to the tongue and

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.880
to our speech.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.079
And here in Proverbs 12 and verse 25, notice the Bible says,

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:05.920
Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.600
But then notice this, but a good word maketh it glad.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.600
A good word.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.179
You know, has there ever been a time in your life where you had a heavy heart?

00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:22.660
No doubt, every one of us, we've dealt with circumstances and situations in our lives

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.320
where we've had a season in our life where we've had a heavy heart over something that

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.559
has taken place.

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:34.119
And in the time of having that heavy heart, we can acknowledge this evening that a good

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:37.640
word maketh it glad.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:44.160
The reality is that as we interact one with another as a body of believers, we have brothers

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.839
and sisters in Christ that at times, maybe at this particular season, they have a heavy

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:52.940
heart over something that's going on in their life.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.399
Some circumstance that you or I, we may not even know about it.

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:59.640
But a good word maketh it glad.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:05.179
It's amazing how God can use our speech to edify, to build up.

00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:09.040
Notice in Proverbs 18 and verse number 21.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.920
In Proverbs 18 and verse number 21, it's very interesting when you think about the power

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.959
of our tongue in this verse of Scripture defines it this way.

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:24.440
It says this in Proverbs 18 and verse 21, death and life are in the power of the tongue.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.799
They that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.

00:07:26.799 --> 00:07:28.000
Think about that.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.260
Death and life are in the power of the tongue.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.880
How are we using our speech?

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.799
How are we using our tongue?

00:07:33.799 --> 00:07:38.320
Are we using our words to edify someone, to build up?

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.600
The reality is that in the home, as we think about that launch point this evening from

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:48.679
Proverbs 14 and verse number one, no doubt a mother in the home as she's that wise woman

00:07:48.679 --> 00:07:55.920
buildeth her house, that she can use her words to build up the family members.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:01.760
We understand as a family of God, as a body of believers, that the power of our tongue,

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.720
are we using our speech to build up, to edify?

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.920
Notice again in Proverbs 25 and verse number 11.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:17.320
In Proverbs 25 and verse number 11, notice here, the Bible says a word fitly spoken is

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.839
like apples of gold and pictures of silver.

00:08:20.839 --> 00:08:24.600
A word fitly spoken.

00:08:24.799 --> 00:08:26.839
A word fitly spoken.

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:32.799
It's amazing there are times in which the Holy Spirit of God will prompt us, maybe to

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.159
give a word of encouragement to someone.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:42.280
In today's environment, I many times have this prompting where I'm praying for individuals

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:47.799
and God will just impress upon my heart that you need to send that person a text message.

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:53.080
We have that ability to be able to send a note to each other very quickly in our society

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.080
today.

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:56.960
There are times in which I receive text messages.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.919
Sometimes I receive text messages from people that I haven't heard from in a long time.

00:09:00.919 --> 00:09:04.919
I heard from one of our missionaries this morning and I've not heard a personal communication

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:07.080
from them in a little while.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.080
It's been several months.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.719
In fact, I've received communication to the church.

00:09:10.719 --> 00:09:13.280
But I got a text message, hey brother, I'm just praying for you.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.559
That was encouraging.

00:09:15.559 --> 00:09:20.799
And the reality is that there are times in which we think about the power of our tongue

00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:23.440
in a word fitly spoken.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.840
It is described as being, it's like apples of gold and pictures of silver.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.479
The book of Ephesians in the New Testament, we think about this truth of using our speech

00:09:33.479 --> 00:09:37.000
and using our tongue in order to edify one another.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.840
In Ephesians 4, we have at this latter part of this chapter in Ephesians 4, some very

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:51.320
instructive points that are made to the children of God and really practical lessons that are

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:57.039
given to us, very quick points that Paul is dealing with in the lives of the believers.

00:09:57.039 --> 00:10:00.119
Notice in verse number 29, he says this,

00:10:00.119 --> 00:10:04.719
Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth.

00:10:04.719 --> 00:10:05.719
But notice what he says,

00:10:05.719 --> 00:10:12.400
But that which is good to the use of edifying.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.400
Notice what it says,

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.960
That it may minister grace unto the hearers.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.719
There's no doubt there's been a time in our lives when we've been the recipient of such

00:10:21.719 --> 00:10:29.000
speech, that it has, someone has used their speech in the manner in which is dealt with

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.679
at the latter part of Ephesians 4.29.

00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:39.960
They've used their speech in a way to edify and it's ministered grace in our lives.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:45.000
And as we make that determination that I want to be engaged in that type of speech, that

00:10:45.719 --> 00:10:52.400
I want to use speech that will edify one another, that will build up, that will encourage them,

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:57.000
that will promote Christian growth in their lives.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.159
I think of this, not only that we can use our tongue in order to offer praise and to

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:07.200
give edification to people, but think about this, a simple thought.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.039
Number two, remind them of God's promises.

00:11:11.039 --> 00:11:17.719
We did not sing the song this evening, perhaps if we had gone through more opportunities

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:22.280
of favorites, someone along the line may have said, standing on the promises.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.280
It's a great song.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.960
And the reality is that when you think about the promises that God has given us in His

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.880
Word, they ought to cause us to rejoice greatly.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.799
And we think about the promises and here's the reality is that there are times in our

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:40.359
lives in which we need to be reminded of God's promises.

00:11:40.359 --> 00:11:44.599
There are times in our lives where we're dealing with difficulty and perhaps as we're

00:11:44.599 --> 00:11:50.239
dealing with that difficulty that as someone would remind us of a promise that God has

00:11:50.239 --> 00:11:56.679
given in His Word, it can encourage us, it can edify and build us up and promote some

00:11:56.679 --> 00:11:58.479
growth in our lives.

00:11:58.479 --> 00:12:04.880
But we also understand that God could use us to remind others of God's promises.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.640
You know, if I don't know God's promises, I can't really encourage you with God's promises.

00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:14.840
It seems pretty simple, but what a great understanding this evening.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:19.520
I can't encourage you, I can't edify you with a promise from God's Word if I don't know

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.200
promises from God's Word.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:27.599
And as we study the Word of God and we read the promises of God's Word and we begin to

00:12:27.599 --> 00:12:35.479
take and to meditate upon those, then God will use us and use His Word to edify others.

00:12:35.479 --> 00:12:40.119
Think about this, what Peter says in 2 Peter 1.

00:12:40.119 --> 00:12:45.000
In 2 Peter 1, it's interesting as you begin to think about the life of Peter, and we often

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.960
can relate to Peter, and I have in my mind's eye a picture of Peter as a fisherman, just

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:59.520
a big kind of bold guy and, I mean, just kind of rough around the edges, so to speak.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:04.960
But he got saved by the grace of God, and his life was changed, and all of a sudden

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:10.119
this fisherman, he starts using words like precious, and that's kind of interesting to

00:13:10.119 --> 00:13:11.119
me.

00:13:11.119 --> 00:13:16.119
You see it in his writings and here in 2 Peter 1 and verse number 4, notice what Peter says.

00:13:16.119 --> 00:13:22.159
He says, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, whereby are given unto us exceeding

00:13:22.159 --> 00:13:32.200
great and precious promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature,

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:38.599
having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.

00:13:38.599 --> 00:13:42.039
Exceeding great and precious promises.

00:13:42.039 --> 00:13:47.280
But when we speak about the promises of God, though we can speak about them collectively

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:53.599
as the promises of God, it is important for us to know them individually.

00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:58.640
And as we know the promises of God individually, as we can run to the Word of God and we can

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:04.599
rehearse promises that God has given us in His Word, then God can use us to edify one

00:14:04.599 --> 00:14:10.119
another through sharing a promise with a brother or sister in Christ.

00:14:10.119 --> 00:14:12.140
Remember what God said.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.280
Can I remind you of what God said?

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:20.760
You know, Peter says here as he's writing to these that are just dealing with some difficulty,

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:26.000
especially here in the book of 2 Peter, and he's dealing with these that have just suffered

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.359
and all that they're dealing with.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.039
And notice what he says in verse number 13 of chapter 1.

00:14:30.039 --> 00:14:35.159
He says, yea, I think it meant as long as I am in this tabernacle to stir you up by

00:14:35.159 --> 00:14:37.960
putting you in remembrance.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.039
And you think about that idea of putting someone in remembrance.

00:14:41.039 --> 00:14:45.880
He says that I know that you know these things, but I want to remind you of these things.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:52.359
You know, it's amazing how sometimes we can have great knowledge and remembrance of the

00:14:52.359 --> 00:14:57.200
truth of God's Word and the promises of God's Word when someone else is going through a

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.200
trial.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:04.320
But sometimes when we're going through the trial, all of a sudden we have like amnesia.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.320
Right?

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.880
Doesn't that happen sometimes?

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:07.880
Seriously.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:13.400
We're going through the trial and all of a sudden we are failing to be able to recall

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.719
the promises of God.

00:15:14.719 --> 00:15:15.719
Why?

00:15:15.719 --> 00:15:17.400
Because we're under it, so to speak.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:23.679
We're dealing with the weight of the situation and the turmoil that we're dealing with and

00:15:23.679 --> 00:15:28.760
oh, that God would use somebody else maybe to edify me and remind me of a promise that

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.599
God has given.

00:15:30.599 --> 00:15:35.599
Quickly, number three, let them know that you're praying for them.

00:15:35.599 --> 00:15:36.599
It's so simple.

00:15:36.599 --> 00:15:43.119
It really is, but you know, it's so important to be engaged in the ministry of intercessory

00:15:43.119 --> 00:15:44.119
prayer.

00:15:45.119 --> 00:15:50.479
One of the greatest things that we could do for one another as believers, as brothers

00:15:50.479 --> 00:15:55.239
and sisters in Christ, is to pray one for another.

00:15:55.239 --> 00:16:00.840
Sometimes we feel like we ought to be able to do something more, but if we really sit

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:06.260
back and just evaluate, it is absolutely the greatest thing we could ever do for someone

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.159
is pray for them, to pray for them.

00:16:09.159 --> 00:16:14.039
We were talking at the house this afternoon and someone made a comment about praying for

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:19.880
someone else, and they made this comment with regard to the timing in which they would pray,

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:25.320
and it reminded me of something that I read of Dr. Lee Roberson many years ago.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:31.320
Of course, he's with the Lord now, but Lee Roberson pastored a church down in Tennessee,

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.460
a huge Tennessee temple was down there, and just a huge church, thousands and thousands

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:39.460
of members, and he would often be asked by members of the church to pray for this or

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.460
pray for that.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:44.780
And he found that if he didn't stop and do it right then, he would forget.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:49.280
He would get clouded and something else would come up, and so on and so forth.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.460
And so he would make it a point in his life and his ministry that he would just stop immediately

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:58.960
and he would pray for whatever that need is or was that the person would share with them.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.979
Notice what Paul says to the believers in Philippi.

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:03.020
I hope these words would encourage you.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:09.699
In fact, this evening we could spend, literally, we could spend an hour or two going through

00:17:09.699 --> 00:17:14.420
all of the references within the Word of God where someone is saying, I'm praying for

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.420
you.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:20.140
I mean, it's just, the references are many throughout the Word of God.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:27.699
But I want you to see, and often we find that in the greetings that Paul offers to the either

00:17:27.699 --> 00:17:31.660
individuals or churches that he's writing to, he will mention something about praying

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.660
for them.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:42.219
As we think about the truth of God's Word, it's not just a cliche.

00:17:42.219 --> 00:17:46.500
It's not just, oh, this has to be included in the introductory statements of this letter

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.819
or this correspondence that I'm praying for you.

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:58.780
No, it's, I mean, this was, Paul was engaging in the ministry of intercessory prayer on

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.300
behalf of these believers.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:08.219
Notice in verse number three, he says, I thank my God upon every remembrance of you.

00:18:08.219 --> 00:18:18.300
Notice what he says, always in every prayer of mine for you all, making request with joy

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:23.099
for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now, being confident of this

00:18:23.099 --> 00:18:29.099
very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day

00:18:29.099 --> 00:18:34.300
of Jesus Christ, even as it is for me to think this of you all.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:40.339
Notice what he says, because I have you in my heart, and as much as both in my bonds

00:18:40.339 --> 00:18:46.660
and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:53.579
For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ, and

00:18:53.579 --> 00:19:00.900
this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment,

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:04.939
that you may approve things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and without offense

00:19:04.939 --> 00:19:10.979
till the day of Christ being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus

00:19:10.979 --> 00:19:15.819
Christ under the glory and praise of God.

00:19:15.819 --> 00:19:20.060
Now when the believers at Philippi in this church, when they receive this letter and

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:25.219
they read those words, do you think they were being encouraged and being edified and

00:19:25.219 --> 00:19:26.219
being built up?

00:19:26.219 --> 00:19:29.060
I mean, he's reminding them of promises.

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:33.339
He says in verse 6, it's something that we claim in our lives, being confident of this

00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:39.099
very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day

00:19:39.099 --> 00:19:40.099
of Jesus Christ.

00:19:40.099 --> 00:19:44.500
Oh man, that's encouraging, that's building me up, that's edifying me.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.900
And Paul says, here's how I'm praying for you.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:50.180
He says, because you're in my heart, you're in my prayers.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:56.739
Because he makes it clear in verse number 7, that he has them because I have you in

00:19:56.739 --> 00:19:58.260
my heart.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:03.880
He says, I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, always in verse number 4, in every

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:09.219
prayer of mine, for you all making request with joy.

00:20:09.219 --> 00:20:15.060
It's an absolute blessing to be able to be engaged in the ministry of intercessory prayer.

00:20:15.219 --> 00:20:18.780
You know, when we tell someone that we're praying for them, first of all, we shouldn't

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.900
say it if we're not doing it.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.160
That should go without saying.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:27.540
But the reality is that we're seeking to edify, to build them up, to encourage them in the

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.300
ways of the Lord.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:33.780
And as you study the prayers of Paul, we don't have time this evening to make much comment

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:38.739
on this, but the reality is that as you study the prayers of Paul throughout the New Testament

00:20:38.739 --> 00:20:42.219
for those that he's ministering to, you know what he does is just what we read there in

00:20:42.219 --> 00:20:43.359
Philippians 1.

00:20:43.359 --> 00:20:47.959
He doesn't just say, I'm praying for you, but he says, here's how I'm praying for you.

00:20:47.959 --> 00:20:51.319
When someone's praying for you that you're growing in your walk with Christ and that

00:20:51.319 --> 00:20:55.819
your walk with Christ is richer and deeper than it has been before, man, that's stirring

00:20:55.819 --> 00:21:01.839
us up and that's edifying us, that's promoting growth, Christian growth, spiritual growth

00:21:01.839 --> 00:21:04.719
in our lives.

00:21:04.719 --> 00:21:10.439
So Proverbs 14.1 says, every wise woman buildeth her house.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:16.160
Sometimes we think this evening of a broad application as a family of God, a church,

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.839
a body of believers, brothers and sisters in Christ.

00:21:19.839 --> 00:21:22.160
Who are we building up?

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.119
Who's building us up?

00:21:24.119 --> 00:21:28.079
Someone ought to be edifying us, but we ought to be edifying someone else because we've

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:34.760
been given the instruction in the New Testament, the responsibility to edify one another.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.439
And you know, the reality is you study the book of 1 Corinthians, when you think about

00:21:38.939 --> 00:21:43.479
spiritual growths and spiritual gifts, excuse me, and you look at the spiritual growths

00:21:43.479 --> 00:21:49.000
in the book of 1 Corinthians, you'll find several times that Paul says that these are

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.599
to be used for the edifying of the church.

00:21:53.599 --> 00:21:57.420
God didn't give us a spiritual gift so that we could say, look at the gift I have.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:01.500
He gave us a spiritual gift so that we would edify one another.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:06.959
And what a joy to be involved in the promotion of Christian spiritual growth in the life

00:22:06.959 --> 00:22:08.239
of another.

00:22:08.239 --> 00:22:09.239
Let's pray together.

00:22:09.239 --> 00:22:10.239
Father, we love You.

00:22:10.239 --> 00:22:15.760
We thank You for the opportunity to be here this evening, and it's such a joy to sing

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:21.839
the great hymns of the faith and to be encouraged through the words of those songs.

00:22:21.839 --> 00:22:24.920
And I thank You for the ladies of our church.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:30.000
I thank You for the day in which we've set upon our calendar in this nation to honor

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
mothers.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:37.239
And God, we pray that as we've briefly looked at this thought from Proverbs 14.1 and looking

00:22:37.239 --> 00:22:42.079
at these various portions of Scripture, that You would help us, Lord, to be engaged in

00:22:42.079 --> 00:22:45.920
the ministry of building up.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:52.040
I pray that we are being edified, but I pray, God, that we are edifying someone else.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:23:00.119
Would You help us to be purposed in fulfilling the responsibility that You've given us to

00:23:00.119 --> 00:23:02.520
edify one another?

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:07.239
I pray, God, that as we leave this place in just a little while, that You would help us

00:23:07.239 --> 00:23:10.560
as we go throughout our week to honor and glorify You.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:16.160
We pray that in this moment of invitation that You would move and work as only You can.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.560
We'll thank You for each decision that's made, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:19.680
Would You?
