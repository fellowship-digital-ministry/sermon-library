1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'll begin in the sixth chapter,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,960
but we will be looking at a number of verses

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,159
through the book of Nehemiah this evening.

4
00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:09,800
And several weeks ago in our first preparation

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,880
for revival sermon on a Sunday morning,

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,199
I preached from Nehemiah chapter number one

7
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:17,360
and dealt with the report that was received

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,180
and the response to the report.

9
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,200
And as we look at what's taking place here

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,200
in the book of Nehemiah, I'll mention several things

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,219
as we go through the message

12
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:26,920
with regard to the historical context.

13
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,600
But let me say this simply

14
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,840
by way of introduction this evening,

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,119
God has given each one of us a work to do.

16
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:36,159
He really has.

17
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,319
And I preached a message not long ago on a Sunday evening,

18
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:41,360
many members, one body,

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,080
and speaking about the local church

20
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,520
and the job that we have to do,

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,659
obviously corporately as a church,

22
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:49,080
we have responsibility biblically

23
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,240
to fulfill the purposes that God has given us.

24
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,860
But as were many members in making up one body

25
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,619
to accomplish that goal,

26
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:02,099
we understand that each one of us have our own part to do.

27
00:01:02,099 --> 00:01:04,620
And God's given each of us a work to do.

28
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,540
And I believe that as we seek to fulfill the work

29
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,860
that God has given to us, that we will face adversity.

30
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,260
Have you found it to be so?

31
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,660
And you look throughout the word of God

32
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,819
and you find that those who attempt to do something for God

33
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:22,980
are met with adversity or opposition

34
00:01:23,059 --> 00:01:25,260
and such is the case for us as well.

35
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,739
And we find that that adversity and that opposition

36
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:30,540
is found in the book of Nehemiah as well.

37
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,739
And we'll note some of that this evening.

38
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:36,080
But I also find that as we seek to fulfill the task,

39
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,540
the work that God has given us to do,

40
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,379
not only can we face the adversity and the opposition,

41
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:45,220
but the reality is that we as individuals,

42
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,339
we can grow weary, we can grow weary.

43
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:50,940
And we'll look at some verses in the New Testament

44
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,459
with regard to growing weary

45
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:54,739
as we near the end of the message this evening.

46
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:58,180
But I want you to notice in Nehemiah six and verse number nine

47
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,379
and it's the single verse of scripture that I've used

48
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:02,580
for in the bulletin there,

49
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,779
because we'll be in so much of the book of Nehemiah

50
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:07,319
this evening and looking at several verses.

51
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,300
But I wanna draw your attention by way of introduction

52
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,020
onto this verse of scripture.

53
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,419
The Bible says this,

54
00:02:13,339 --> 00:02:15,940
for they all made us afraid,

55
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,220
saying, notice what they said,

56
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,339
this is the enemy, the opposition.

57
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,139
They had Sanballat and Geshem had come

58
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:26,619
and thought to do mischief to Nehemiah

59
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:27,860
according to verse number two.

60
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,979
And we notice that it says that they made us afraid,

61
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:31,539
they all made us afraid saying,

62
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:36,539
their hands shall be weakened from the work.

63
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,259
And then notice this phrase,

64
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:43,259
that it be not done.

65
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:46,660
You know, the enemy wants to weaken our hands

66
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,179
so that the work is not fulfilled.

67
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,100
The work is not accomplished.

68
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,100
We find that it then says this,

69
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,339
Nehemiah, simple yet profound prayer.

70
00:02:57,339 --> 00:03:01,259
He says, now therefore, oh God,

71
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:06,139
strengthen my hands.

72
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:09,940
And I love this simple prayer of Nehemiah,

73
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,779
this prayer for strength.

74
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:13,979
And we understand as we study the New Testament

75
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:16,539
and Paul makes mention in second Corinthians four,

76
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:18,660
that though the outward man perish,

77
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:21,059
the inward man is renewed day by day

78
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:24,100
and we can speak about the inner man being strengthened

79
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,380
and absolutely that is essential

80
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,860
for the work that God has given us to do.

81
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,699
But we find in this text of Scripture

82
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:34,100
and really the work that is seeking to be accomplished here

83
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,259
was a work that required great physical strength.

84
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,100
And we find that there was much opposition

85
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,300
and through the process of not only the hard labor

86
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,220
and the opposition, there was some weakening, if you will.

87
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,259
There was some folks, they were growing weary

88
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:55,899
and so the prayer is to strengthen my hands.

89
00:03:55,899 --> 00:03:58,940
I've used that as the title for the message this evening.

90
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,220
And I want you to just notice a few things with me tonight.

91
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,300
Number one, notice what Nehemiah recognized.

92
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,899
Notice what he recognized.

93
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:08,820
And I'm gonna give you a number of things

94
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,300
that he recognized.

95
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,259
And so go back to the second chapter, if you will.

96
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:15,419
We won't make much mention of the first chapter.

97
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:18,260
It's in that chapter where Nehemiah receives the report

98
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,540
with regard to the condition in Jerusalem

99
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,339
and he prays before the Lord.

100
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:23,820
And we come to the second chapter

101
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,779
and we find that Nehemiah has sorrow of heart.

102
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:29,820
It is seen, it is obvious to Artaxerxes

103
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,420
as he enters into his presence

104
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,500
that Nehemiah has this sorrow of heart.

105
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,260
And we find that Nehemiah begins to express

106
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,260
what's taking place.

107
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,420
And as we begin to just go through the book of Nehemiah

108
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:45,100
and take note of some things that Nehemiah recognized,

109
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,619
I want you to see first of all,

110
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,420
in verse number 12 of chapter two,

111
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,019
notice what the Bible says.

112
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:55,739
And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me,

113
00:04:55,739 --> 00:05:00,739
neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart

114
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:03,179
to do at Jerusalem.

115
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:04,980
Neither was there any beast with me,

116
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,140
save the beast that I rode upon.

117
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,739
Number one of the things that Nehemiah recognized,

118
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:13,380
I want you to see that he recognized

119
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,260
that God Almighty had put something in his heart to do.

120
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:21,859
He recognized that it was God that put it there.

121
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:24,619
He recognized that as he had heard the report

122
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:26,260
after his inquiry was made,

123
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,899
that he heard what was taking place

124
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:31,059
and God put something in his heart.

125
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:32,579
And I just wonder tonight,

126
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,339
has God put something in your heart?

127
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:38,339
Are we confident as Nehemiah was confident,

128
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,540
where he says, listen, at this point,

129
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,140
we know that in just a few verses

130
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,339
as we begin to study through the book of Nehemiah,

131
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:46,380
that Nehemiah will reveal to these

132
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,779
that he's working amongst and ministering to

133
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:50,179
what God has put in his heart.

134
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:52,179
At this particular moment, it says,

135
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:54,820
neither told I any man, but notice what it says,

136
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,820
what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem.

137
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,820
God had a task for Nehemiah and that task,

138
00:06:07,179 --> 00:06:09,779
it was burning within his heart.

139
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:11,739
And he had this desire and he recognized

140
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:14,940
that it was God Almighty that put it there.

141
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,700
Notice he recognized in verse number 13,

142
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,260
what is it that he recognized?

143
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,779
Well, he recognized that the report was accurate.

144
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:25,899
In verse number 13, it says,

145
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:28,179
and I went out by night by the gate of the valley,

146
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,980
even before the dragon well into the dung port

147
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,040
and viewed the walls of Jerusalem,

148
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,660
which were broken down and the gates thereof

149
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,579
were consumed with fire.

150
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:42,100
He recognized that the report that he'd received

151
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,579
in chapter number one was an accurate report.

152
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:47,459
He found that he asked, he had inquired

153
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:49,779
as to the condition there in Jerusalem.

154
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:52,739
And we find that he was informed

155
00:06:52,739 --> 00:06:53,779
that those that were there

156
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:55,619
were in great affliction and reproach.

157
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:57,500
And it says at the end of verse number three,

158
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,899
the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down

159
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:02,579
and the gates thereof are burned with fire.

160
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:05,140
And now in verse number 13, at the end of the verse,

161
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,299
it says that he viewed the walls of Jerusalem,

162
00:07:08,299 --> 00:07:11,920
which were broken down and the gates thereof

163
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,980
were consumed with fire.

164
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,739
What he had previously heard about,

165
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:20,299
he now sees with his own eyes.

166
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:24,779
And he found out that the report was an accurate report.

167
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:27,220
And so he recognized the condition.

168
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,739
I want you to see as we continue reading here

169
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:31,540
in verse 17, number three,

170
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,660
what is it that Nehemiah recognized?

171
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,779
He recognized that God's hand was upon him.

172
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:39,500
It says in verse number 17,

173
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,619
then said I unto them,

174
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:42,660
you see the distress that we are in,

175
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,420
how Jerusalem lieth waste

176
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,739
and the gates thereof are burned with fire.

177
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:50,140
Come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem

178
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,820
that we be no more a reproach.

179
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,820
Then I told them of the hand of my God,

180
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,500
which was good upon me.

181
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,260
As also the king's words that he had spoken unto me.

182
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,500
And they said, let us rise up and build

183
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,459
so they strengthen their hands for this good work.

184
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:13,079
I want you to notice that he recognized

185
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,140
that God's hand was upon him.

186
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,339
God had put something in his heart,

187
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:20,700
but he also recognized that God's hand was upon him.

188
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,980
These are all good things, by the way,

189
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,420
because the reality is that if we don't recognize

190
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,179
these things that Nehemiah is recognizing,

191
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:31,459
when that opposition comes, when that adversity comes,

192
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:34,000
when we grow weary,

193
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,500
well, we may just go ahead and throw in the towel.

194
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,500
But Nehemiah recognized some things.

195
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,020
Notice number four, what is it that he recognized?

196
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,520
He recognized the power of God.

197
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,739
Notice in verse number 20,

198
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,659
it said this, then answered I them.

199
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:53,099
Well, let me get it in context with you.

200
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,299
In verse number 19, it says this,

201
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:57,140
but when Sanballat the Hornite and Tobiah the servant,

202
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,940
the Ammonite and Geshem the Arabian heard it,

203
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,380
they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said,

204
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,280
what is this thing that you do?

205
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,299
Will you rebel against the king?

206
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,419
Then answered I them and said unto them,

207
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:13,039
the God of heaven.

208
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,580
Don't you like that?

209
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,619
He is talking about, and they, the opposition,

210
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:19,580
the adversity, they're talking about a human king,

211
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:21,900
but he's talking about the king of kings.

212
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,380
And he says, the God of heaven,

213
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,380
he will prosper us.

214
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:31,539
He recognized God's power.

215
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:33,900
He said, therefore, we, his servants,

216
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,940
will arise and build,

217
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,539
but ye have no portion, nor right,

218
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:41,520
nor memorial in Jerusalem.

219
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,140
Oh, we have to recognize the power of God.

220
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,859
Listen, the work that we're engaged in,

221
00:09:45,859 --> 00:09:48,299
it's a work that God would put in our hearts,

222
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:49,979
and we know that it's our God,

223
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:52,960
the Lord God omnipotent that puts it in our hearts,

224
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,900
and we find that it is God's hand that would be upon us,

225
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,859
and we recognize that it is his power that enables us.

226
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:06,059
And he says that God, He will prosper us.

227
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:07,819
Number five.

228
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:10,299
Skip over to chapter number six, if you will.

229
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:15,899
In chapter number three, you read the work that's assigned,

230
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,059
the building of the walls.

231
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:19,379
In chapter number four, you read of all the attack.

232
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:21,179
It continues into chapter number five

233
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:23,179
and into the beginning of chapter number six

234
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:25,679
by way of compromise and what have you.

235
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,659
But I want you to notice what it is

236
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:29,339
that Nehemiah recognized.

237
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,459
Number five, he recognized that this work was, quote,

238
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:35,279
a great work.

239
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,779
Notice what he says in Nehemiah 6 in verse number three.

240
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,499
And I sent messengers unto them, saying,

241
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:50,139
I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down.

242
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:56,619
Why should the work cease whilst I leave it and come down to you?

243
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:58,659
He recognized that it was a great work.

244
00:10:58,659 --> 00:10:59,979
Let me say this.

245
00:10:59,979 --> 00:11:03,779
Every work for God is a great work.

246
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:04,419
Why?

247
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:06,499
Because He's a great God.

248
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,939
And He is the Lord God Almighty.

249
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:13,659
And listen, every work for God is a great work.

250
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:16,019
And we understand that as God had put it

251
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,219
in the heart of Nehemiah to build the walls,

252
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:22,379
as God had put this work in his heart

253
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:25,499
and He had given him the power and the strength to do it,

254
00:11:25,499 --> 00:11:28,579
we find that every work that we would do for God

255
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:31,219
is a great work.

256
00:11:31,219 --> 00:11:33,619
You say, well, the work that God's given me to do

257
00:11:33,619 --> 00:11:36,499
isn't the same work that God's given you to do.

258
00:11:36,499 --> 00:11:38,299
Correct.

259
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:40,579
But it's still a great work.

260
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:41,619
It's still a great work.

261
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:42,339
Why?

262
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:44,059
Because it's for God.

263
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:45,979
Because it's for God.

264
00:11:45,979 --> 00:11:49,539
And when we recognize that this work that we're doing

265
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:52,259
is a great work and that it's a work for God,

266
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:54,779
it will give us a perspective with regard

267
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:56,539
to I can't slow down.

268
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:58,059
I can't throw in the towel.

269
00:11:58,059 --> 00:11:59,059
I can't give up.

270
00:11:59,059 --> 00:11:59,579
Why?

271
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:03,419
Because this work, this is a great work.

272
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:07,219
God's given me this task to do.

273
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:10,579
Notice that He recognized whatever number we're on.

274
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:12,459
Number six, I guess it is.

275
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:15,179
I have them by letters in my notes.

276
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:17,379
And I'm giving them to you by numbers.

277
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:20,899
And so number six, if that's the right number,

278
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:22,739
I heard one preacher say number next.

279
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:25,019
And that way, you just know what next is, amen?

280
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,739
And what is number next?

281
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:30,219
It's whatever's next in your sequence, amen?

282
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:32,339
But number six, notice this.

283
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:37,939
He recognized that their strength is decayed.

284
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:40,139
Notice him back in chapter number four.

285
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:40,939
They're working.

286
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:41,899
They're doing the work.

287
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:44,419
And chapter number three gave us all of the details.

288
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:46,859
And you can go back and read it in chapter number three

289
00:12:46,859 --> 00:12:49,659
and the work that's assigned and all the parts of the wall

290
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:50,659
and what have you.

291
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:52,299
But we find that the work is being

292
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:54,299
attacked in the fourth chapter.

293
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:56,019
They persevere through this.

294
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:58,499
They're praying and seeking the face of God.

295
00:12:58,499 --> 00:13:01,739
But we find that as we look in Nehemiah 4,

296
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,939
notice in verse number seven, it says,

297
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:06,259
but it came to pass that when Sanballat and Tobiah

298
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:09,019
and the Arabians and the Ammonites and the Ashtodites

299
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:12,059
heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up

300
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:15,219
and that the breaches began to be stopped,

301
00:13:15,219 --> 00:13:19,939
then they were very rough and conspired all of them

302
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:23,219
together to come and to fight against Jerusalem

303
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,619
and to hinder it.

304
00:13:24,619 --> 00:13:26,819
Now, this enemy that's going to fight,

305
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:28,219
you think about all of those that

306
00:13:28,219 --> 00:13:29,779
were named in verse number seven.

307
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:31,379
This is a large host that's going

308
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:33,779
to come against the work of God.

309
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,259
The Bible says in verse number nine,

310
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:37,419
nevertheless, we made our prayer unto our God

311
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:40,779
and set a watch against them day and night because of them.

312
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,459
And then I want you to notice what Judah says in verse number

313
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:44,179
10.

314
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:50,299
And Judah said, the strength of the bearers of burdens

315
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:52,739
is decayed.

316
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:54,459
And there is much rubbish so that we

317
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:59,259
are not able to build the wall.

318
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:02,259
We find, as we begin to look at that word,

319
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,259
when they make the statement about the strength

320
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:07,699
of the bearers of burdens being decayed,

321
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:11,179
it means to make feeble or to make weak.

322
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:15,539
Now, again, this task requires great physical strength.

323
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:17,739
And we find that Nehemiah recognized

324
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:19,059
he received the report.

325
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,059
He heard what Judah said.

326
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:24,139
He heard about these that were working there

327
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:27,019
and how the strength of these individuals,

328
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:29,379
these bearers of burdens is decayed.

329
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:31,699
It's becoming weak.

330
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:34,459
He recognized that.

331
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:36,579
He recognized that the enemy desired

332
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:39,899
to see their hands weakened so that the work would not

333
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:43,299
be completed.

334
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,899
Number seven, he recognized that the enemy desired

335
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:49,739
to see their hands weakened so that the work would not

336
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:51,139
be completed.

337
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:52,859
Notice what it says in verse number nine.

338
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:55,219
We read it by way of introduction.

339
00:14:55,219 --> 00:14:56,859
For they all made us afraid, saying,

340
00:14:56,859 --> 00:15:00,859
their hands should be weakened from the work

341
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:04,019
that it be not done.

342
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,779
That was the desire of the enemy,

343
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:09,099
was that their hands would be weakened

344
00:15:09,099 --> 00:15:12,379
so that the work would not be completed.

345
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:15,659
But as we look at this book of Nehemiah,

346
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:18,219
I find that he recognized something else.

347
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:20,979
Number eight, he recognized this.

348
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:26,500
He recognized that God could strengthen their hands.

349
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,779
He recognized that.

350
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:30,979
It says in verse number nine, now therefore, oh God,

351
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:33,539
strengthen my hands.

352
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:37,579
We find that his recognition of God's ability

353
00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:42,099
led to the prayer that he prays in verse number nine.

354
00:15:42,099 --> 00:15:45,379
This evening, we must recognize that God's given us

355
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:46,579
a work to do.

356
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:49,739
We must recognize that God's put something in our heart.

357
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:50,939
What is that something?

358
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:52,179
You say, I have no idea.

359
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:55,179
I just feel like a ship that's just tossed to and fro

360
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:56,500
with no direction.

361
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,099
Oh, seek God and ask Him to reveal to you what it is,

362
00:16:00,099 --> 00:16:03,539
what work He has for you to do, and that He'd put it

363
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:06,699
in your heart, and that you'd recognize that this work

364
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,059
that He's given you to do, it's a great work.

365
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:09,579
Why?

366
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:12,859
Because it's God's work, and that God will strengthen you,

367
00:16:12,859 --> 00:16:14,659
that it's through God's power.

368
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:17,779
And we find that Nehemiah, he acknowledged the fact

369
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:20,299
that there was some decaying of the strength

370
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:22,299
as Judah provided the report.

371
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:24,179
He understood that the enemy wanted

372
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:27,139
to weaken their hands so that the work would not

373
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:29,979
be accomplished or completed.

374
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:34,059
But we find that he recognized that God is able.

375
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,339
That God is able.

376
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:39,339
Listen, when we find ourselves weary,

377
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:41,699
have you ever been weary?

378
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,539
Sure you have.

379
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:45,899
When you find yourself weary, oh, it's

380
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:49,779
good to recognize that God can strengthen you,

381
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:52,539
because there was still a work to be done.

382
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:55,500
We notice, number one, what Nehemiah recognized.

383
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,819
Notice number two with me this evening.

384
00:16:57,819 --> 00:16:59,859
Notice what Nehemiah requested.

385
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:01,459
It's right there in verse number nine.

386
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:02,699
It's the title of our message.

387
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:06,299
It's a simple yet appropriate prayer.

388
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,059
His request is this.

389
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:12,299
Strengthen my hands.

390
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,699
There's nothing really complicated about that.

391
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:18,099
There's nothing really deep about that.

392
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:20,259
It's a recognition of several things

393
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:21,859
that we looked at, those eight items.

394
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,899
And perhaps as you study the book of Nehemiah,

395
00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:26,099
you'll find more things that Nehemiah recognized.

396
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,699
It's not an exhaustive list.

397
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:29,539
But the reality is that as we come

398
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:31,579
to verse number nine of chapter number six,

399
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:36,379
that Nehemiah makes this simple prayer, this simple request

400
00:17:36,379 --> 00:17:39,979
that God Almighty would strengthen his hands.

401
00:17:39,979 --> 00:17:45,139
I want you to notice that Nehemiah did not request

402
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:48,619
for a change of assignment.

403
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:49,819
He didn't say, you know what?

404
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,299
This is just too much.

405
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:55,419
Maybe I can get a new assignment.

406
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:56,979
That's not what he prayed.

407
00:17:56,979 --> 00:17:59,859
He didn't pray that someone else would do the work.

408
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:07,939
He said, God, strengthen my hands.

409
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,299
Strengthen my hands.

410
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:15,819
Go over to the book of James, if you will, in the New Testament.

411
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:19,219
I want you to look at a couple of verses that are familiar to us.

412
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:22,339
But I want you to think about this prayer of Nehemiah.

413
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:23,659
Again, it's a simple prayer.

414
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:24,699
It's a simple request.

415
00:18:24,699 --> 00:18:29,059
There's nothing complicated or deep about this request.

416
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:32,419
It's absolutely appropriate to make the request.

417
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:35,059
Listen, if you feel weary, recognizing

418
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:37,339
the One who has the power to strengthen you

419
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:40,099
and asking Him for strength is appropriate.

420
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:41,179
Amen?

421
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:44,459
We find here in the book of James a couple of thoughts.

422
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:46,659
In verse number two, the Bible says,

423
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,779
you lust and have not, you kill and desire to have

424
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:50,619
and cannot obtain, you fight and war.

425
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:54,059
Notice this, you have not because you ask not.

426
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:55,700
Then notice this in verse number three,

427
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,260
ye ask and receive not because you ask amiss,

428
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,940
that you may consume it upon your lusts.

429
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,579
We've often looked at verses two and three of James chapter

430
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:05,219
number four, and we've understood

431
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:07,419
as people have quoted these verses of Scripture

432
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:08,579
that you have not.

433
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:09,140
Why?

434
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,299
Well, because you ask not.

435
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:14,940
You have not, according to verse number three, why?

436
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,019
And you receive not, why?

437
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:20,260
Because you ask amiss, that you may consume it upon your lust.

438
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,179
As I look at the request of Nehemiah

439
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:24,299
here in chapter number six and verse number nine,

440
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:27,219
when he says, oh God, strengthen my hands,

441
00:19:27,219 --> 00:19:30,099
I find that this is a request that

442
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:32,539
is appropriate for the hour and for that which

443
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:33,459
he's dealing with.

444
00:19:33,459 --> 00:19:35,459
In fact, if you go over to the book of 1 John

445
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:37,419
in chapter number five, and notice

446
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:40,779
what John tells us in this great epistle

447
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,619
that we've studied here on Sunday mornings,

448
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:47,179
and notice with me in verses 14 and 15 of the fifth chapter.

449
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:48,619
Notice what John says.

450
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:50,500
Now, John had the privilege of walking

451
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,019
with the Lord Jesus Christ.

452
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:54,940
He had the privilege of hearing the Lord speak to him

453
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,700
about the importance of prayer and the privilege of prayer

454
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,539
in coming.

455
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:01,079
Before.

456
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:03,039
or the throne of God.

457
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,739
And John, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

458
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:08,759
says this in 1 John 5 and verse number 14,

459
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:13,599
and this is the confidence that we have in Him.

460
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:16,119
Now, this is a recurring word and thought

461
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,399
in the book of 1 John.

462
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:18,879
Having confidence.

463
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:20,679
Being confident that I'm saved.

464
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:24,419
Being confident that I belong to the Lord Jesus Christ

465
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:25,799
and I am His child.

466
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,399
And we find here that He speaks of this confidence

467
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:29,279
that we have in Him.

468
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:30,479
Notice what it is.

469
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:35,479
That if we ask anything according to His will,

470
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:36,879
He heareth us.

471
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,499
Doesn't stop there.

472
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,879
In verse number 15, it says,

473
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:46,639
and if we know that He hear us,

474
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:48,879
whatsoever we ask,

475
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:52,519
we know that we have the petitions

476
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:55,479
that we desired of Him.

477
00:20:56,479 --> 00:21:00,879
Was it the will of God for Nehemiah to build the wall?

478
00:21:00,879 --> 00:21:03,779
As best we can tell, absolutely.

479
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:06,359
This was a work that God put in His heart.

480
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,959
He testifies of that.

481
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:10,439
This was a work that He recognized

482
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:12,159
God's hand was upon Him.

483
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,039
He recognized all of those things that we went through,

484
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,439
and we find that in the moment of that adversity

485
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:19,819
that continued to grow,

486
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:22,759
and in the weariness that was there amongst the people,

487
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:24,719
we find that He makes this prayer,

488
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:27,359
oh, God, strengthen my hands.

489
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,679
He asked that the Lord God omnipotent, His God,

490
00:21:34,219 --> 00:21:35,659
would give Him strength.

491
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,959
We find that as we have the whole canon of Scripture,

492
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:43,719
we look at 1 John 5, and we can say,

493
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,279
hey, if God's given me a task,

494
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:49,319
if God's given me something to accomplish,

495
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,999
then we can have the confidence

496
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:53,099
that if we ask anything according to His will,

497
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:55,339
that He hears us, and not only that,

498
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:56,879
but we know that if He hears us,

499
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:58,059
that whatsoever we ask,

500
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:02,159
we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him.

501
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:04,099
Wow.

502
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,059
You know, sometimes we may not have the strength

503
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:10,679
for the simple fact that we don't ask for it.

504
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,499
You know how many times people don't get help

505
00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:18,099
because they don't ask for help?

506
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,859
Right?

507
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:23,459
How many times have you heard somebody say,

508
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:24,779
hey, let me know if you need anything,

509
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:26,939
and you knew they were just being nice?

510
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:28,279
You know what I mean, right?

511
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,339
They really didn't want you to call them.

512
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,999
That's not how God works.

513
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:36,899
He says that He's a very present help

514
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:38,059
in the time of trouble.

515
00:22:38,979 --> 00:22:39,819
That's our God.

516
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,619
Not only is He able, but He's available.

517
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:50,019
And we find that sometimes we don't have what we need

518
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:52,659
because we just don't ask for it.

519
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:54,899
We need wisdom.

520
00:22:54,899 --> 00:22:59,139
Well, He said if any man lack, let him ask of God.

521
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:00,639
We need strength.

522
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:04,859
Nehemiah recognized we need strength,

523
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:08,259
and he recognized who it was that could give the strength.

524
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:13,259
Therefore, he says, oh God, strengthen my hands.

525
00:23:14,639 --> 00:23:17,379
Because of his recognition that it was God

526
00:23:17,379 --> 00:23:19,579
that was able to strengthen his hands,

527
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:21,619
it leads to the request.

528
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:23,299
He's never gonna make the request

529
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:25,739
if he doesn't recognize that God can give it.

530
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:27,179
He's never gonna make the request

531
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:29,479
if he doesn't recognize that they need it.

532
00:23:30,699 --> 00:23:35,579
And we find here not only what he recognized,

533
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:36,679
but what he requested.

534
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:39,419
Notice with me number three this evening.

535
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,259
Notice what Nehemiah received.

536
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,179
Notice what Nehemiah received.

537
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:47,579
The Bible tells us that God hears and answers prayer.

538
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:50,059
We just read verses in the book of 1 John

539
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:51,379
in the fifth chapter.

540
00:23:51,379 --> 00:23:53,299
And we can rejoice in knowing

541
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:56,139
that as Nehemiah made this request,

542
00:23:56,139 --> 00:24:00,059
as he says, now therefore, oh God, strengthen my hands.

543
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:02,499
I want you to understand that the attack of the enemy

544
00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:05,939
did not cease immediately following that prayer.

545
00:24:05,939 --> 00:24:09,959
In fact, the attack of the enemy became even more subtle

546
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:13,939
as they tried to get Nehemiah to go into the holy place

547
00:24:13,939 --> 00:24:15,659
in the next following verses.

548
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:18,819
It was a place in which Nehemiah was not permitted to go,

549
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:20,259
and they invited him to go there,

550
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:25,259
and the idea was to go there for protection.

551
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:29,019
That's the subtlety of the enemy.

552
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:31,699
And Nehemiah says this, I know that if I go there,

553
00:24:31,699 --> 00:24:33,859
these folks are hired servants,

554
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:36,539
and they're gonna, the hired enemies,

555
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,779
they're going to come, and they're going to try

556
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:41,679
to bring an evil report against my name.

557
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:47,239
But we come to verse number 15 and 16 of Nehemiah 6,

558
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,139
and I want you to see what the Bible says.

559
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:55,839
So the wall was finished.

560
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:58,679
Underline that word, circle that word.

561
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:02,919
Isn't it good to see the work completed?

562
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:05,439
What was the desire of the enemy?

563
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:07,799
Well, that their hands should be weakened from the work,

564
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:11,239
that it be not done.

565
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,559
And we read verse number 15, so the wall was finished

566
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:18,759
in the 20 and fifth day of the month, Elul,

567
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:21,799
in 52 days, and I want you to think about that,

568
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:23,799
52 days, that's a long period of time.

569
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:28,959
We do manual labor for 52 minutes,

570
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:30,479
ready for a break, amen?

571
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:35,999
But you understand what I'm saying, 52 days is a long time.

572
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:37,719
The Bible tells us in the fourth chapter of the book

573
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:39,439
of Nehemiah, in verse number 17,

574
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:42,839
that everyone with one of his hands wrought in the work

575
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:45,639
and with the other hand held a weapon.

576
00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:47,719
Why, because of the enemy and the attack.

577
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,759
So they're trying to work, Armando,

578
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:51,199
it's not like when you're trying to work

579
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:53,639
and you can be fully attentive to what's taking place.

580
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:55,759
If you're fully attentive, this guy's trying to,

581
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:57,439
no, no, no, they gotta do the work

582
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:58,659
and they gotta watch for the enemy.

583
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:01,119
Hold a weapon and hold a trowel, right?

584
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:02,559
And do the work.

585
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:07,099
Man, 52 days, it's a long time.

586
00:26:07,939 --> 00:26:11,779
But the Bible says that the wall was finished.

587
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:15,939
Notice in verse number 16, it says,

588
00:26:15,939 --> 00:26:19,859
and it came to pass that when all our enemies heard thereof

589
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:23,499
and all the heathen that were about us saw these things,

590
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:27,819
they were much cast down in their own eyes.

591
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,499
And then notice the statement at the end of verse number 16,

592
00:26:30,499 --> 00:26:35,499
for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.

593
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:39,619
That's glorious.

594
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:45,139
That even the opposition recognized the enemies,

595
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:47,859
those that tried to cause the work to cease,

596
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:50,939
even those individuals, when they saw what was accomplished,

597
00:26:50,939 --> 00:26:54,459
they recognized that this was a work

598
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:56,959
that was wrought of our God.

599
00:26:58,459 --> 00:26:59,939
I'm gonna come back to Nehemiah,

600
00:26:59,939 --> 00:27:02,239
but I want you to consider what the Bible says

601
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:03,079
in the book of Acts.

602
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,339
If you wanna hold your place there in the book of Nehemiah

603
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:07,299
and turn to the book of Acts, if you will.

604
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:09,499
And as we go to the book of Acts in the fifth chapter,

605
00:27:09,499 --> 00:27:11,499
and I want you to see what the disciples are doing

606
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:13,139
as they're seeking to fulfill the work

607
00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:14,899
that God has given them to do.

608
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:18,399
And we find that the disciples at this particular time

609
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:19,239
in the book of Acts,

610
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:21,459
they're faced with some great difficulties.

611
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:23,459
They've been threatened, they've been beaten,

612
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:25,819
they've suffered some adversity.

613
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:29,639
They understood, however, what God has called them to do.

614
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:32,679
We find that it's in this chapter in Acts chapter number five

615
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:34,599
when they're standing before the religious leaders

616
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:38,999
that they say, we ought to obey God rather than men.

617
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:41,919
And we find that as the work is taking place

618
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,479
and as they testify that we are His witnesses

619
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:47,319
of these things and they go through this whole process,

620
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:49,359
we find that we come to verse number 36

621
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,679
at the end of Acts five.

622
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:53,179
And the Bible says, for before these days,

623
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:55,639
let me back up to verse number 34.

624
00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:58,239
It says, then stood there up one in the council,

625
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:01,359
a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law,

626
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:03,919
had in reputation among all the people

627
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:07,079
and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space.

628
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:08,279
He's going to take the floor,

629
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,999
he's going to give his counsel.

630
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:13,199
It says in verse number 35, and he said unto them,

631
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:15,519
ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves

632
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,439
what ye intend to do as touching these men.

633
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,719
For before these days rose up Thudas.

634
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:26,239
Notice what the Bible says about Thudas in verse number 36,

635
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:29,959
boasting himself to be somebody.

636
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:35,799
I'm a nobody, so are you.

637
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,239
Saved by the power of God Almighty

638
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:45,599
and given a work to do for God Almighty.

639
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,279
But this fellow Thudas,

640
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,319
he was boasting himself to be somebody.

641
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:52,919
And it says this, to whom a number of men,

642
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:55,679
about 400 joined themselves.

643
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,039
That's a pretty good crowd.

644
00:28:57,959 --> 00:28:59,959
400 people, that's a pretty good crowd.

645
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,679
It says, who was slain and all,

646
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:05,439
as many as obeyed him, were scattered.

647
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:09,639
And notice this last phrase, and brought to naught.

648
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:14,799
37, after this man rose up Judas of Galilee

649
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,519
in the days of the taxing

650
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:18,679
and drew away much people after him.

651
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:20,399
He doesn't give us the number there.

652
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,239
And it says, he also perished and all,

653
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:25,599
even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.

654
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:29,079
And now I say unto you,

655
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:32,839
refrain from these men and let them alone.

656
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:36,999
For this counsel or this work be of men,

657
00:29:38,199 --> 00:29:41,199
it will come to naught.

658
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:44,799
Listen, if we were just here for our own name,

659
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:45,999
we're wasting our time.

660
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:50,359
Honestly, we're wasting our time.

661
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:55,119
But it says this in verse 39,

662
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:59,439
but if it be of God,

663
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:01,559
ye can.

664
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:07,039
You cannot, maybe you need to underline that word, circle it.

665
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:12,319
You cannot overthrow it.

666
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:14,559
What's it? The work.

667
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,159
If it's of God.

668
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:23,279
Lest happily ye be found even to fight against God.

669
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,799
Listen, this work that was being done by Nehemiah,

670
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,359
those that are made mention in chapter number three of the book of Nehemiah,

671
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:34,759
this was a work of God. This was a great work. Why? Because it was God's work.

672
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:37,879
Again, any work for God is a great work.

673
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:40,519
There's no small work in God's economy.

674
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:43,439
He's a great God. He's King of kings and Lord of lords.

675
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:48,079
And anything, everything that we do for Him is a great thing.

676
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,719
By the way, it ought to be done with first class.

677
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:52,519
It ought to be done to the best of our ability.

678
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,119
Sometimes we use the phraseology,

679
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:56,639
and I know we're in Northern Virginia, it's probably not popular,

680
00:30:56,639 --> 00:30:59,119
but I heard the phrase all throughout my career

681
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:00,719
when I worked in the corporate world, people would say,

682
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:02,439
well, it's good enough for government work.

683
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:03,439
You ever hear that?

684
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:06,599
And you hear that phraseology, see the guy in the Air Force,

685
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,639
he's like, oh yeah, I know all about that.

686
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:12,639
But the reality is that we've heard that phraseology.

687
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:16,879
Listen, the work that we're doing is for God Almighty.

688
00:31:16,879 --> 00:31:22,479
We never, but never should mail it in, so to speak,

689
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:25,319
because we're doing a work for God.

690
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:29,639
And we recognize that this is a great work.

691
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:32,599
I won't take you there, but in Psalm 109 and verse 27,

692
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,439
the Bible speaks about how people would see

693
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:38,839
that it was God that did the work.

694
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:41,719
We find that that's exactly what the enemy recognized

695
00:31:41,719 --> 00:31:44,399
in Nehemiah 6 and verse number 16.

696
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,719
Now, I want you to think about this.

697
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:49,679
The Bible tells us as to the day in which the work was completed.

698
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,719
In verse number 15 of Nehemiah 6,

699
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:53,799
it tells us that the wall was finished

700
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:55,839
on the 25th day of the month, Elul.

701
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:00,279
Now, that's the sixth month in the Jewish calendar.

702
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:02,039
And I want you to go forward, if you will,

703
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:03,719
to chapter number eight,

704
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:05,599
and we're gonna just kind of pick it up right here

705
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:07,799
in the beginning of chapter number eight.

706
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,319
And I want you to see what the Bible says.

707
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:11,839
And all the people gathered themselves together as one man

708
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,159
in verse number one into the street

709
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:14,559
that was before the water gate.

710
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,479
And they spake unto Ezra the scribe

711
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:18,599
to bring the book of the law of Moses,

712
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:20,719
which the Lord had commanded to Israel.

713
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:23,679
And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation,

714
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:24,999
both of men and women,

715
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:26,799
and all that could hear with understanding.

716
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,999
Notice what the Bible says at the end of verse number two,

717
00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:33,719
upon the first day of the seventh month.

718
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:36,199
Now, the wall was finished in 52 days.

719
00:32:36,199 --> 00:32:40,839
It was finished on the 25th day of the sixth month.

720
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,319
And now in chapter number eight,

721
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:45,879
we're on the first day of the seventh month.

722
00:32:45,879 --> 00:32:47,959
Now, there are some Bible scholars

723
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:50,319
that have tried to put specific dates

724
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:53,359
and using our calendar method,

725
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,479
and they've used these dates to say

726
00:32:55,479 --> 00:32:57,159
that the wall was completed,

727
00:32:57,159 --> 00:32:59,239
according to Nehemiah chapter six,

728
00:32:59,239 --> 00:33:01,919
on what they would say would be the 21st day

729
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,359
of the month of September,

730
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,359
a calendar that we'd be recognizing in the year 444 BC.

731
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,879
And now in chapter number eight,

732
00:33:11,879 --> 00:33:16,879
we're on the 27th day of September in the year 444.

733
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:22,479
So there's just six days, just six days.

734
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:25,719
And I want you to notice that they're gathered together

735
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:27,199
upon the first day of the seventh month.

736
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:28,719
And it says in verse number three,

737
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:30,799
and he read therein before the street

738
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,799
that was before the water gate from the morning

739
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:36,119
until midday before the men and the women

740
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,519
and those that could understand.

741
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,639
In the years of all the people were attentive

742
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:41,959
under the book of the law.

743
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:45,439
Now remember, they were building a wall for 52 days.

744
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,799
Hard labor work.

745
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:50,919
The men of Judah said,

746
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:55,319
hey, the strength of the bearers of burdens has decayed.

747
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,439
It's been weakened.

748
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:58,439
And Nehemiah in chapter number six says,

749
00:33:58,439 --> 00:34:00,719
oh God, strengthen my hands.

750
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:02,359
And here we are six days later,

751
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:04,479
and the Bible tells us in verse number four,

752
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:07,239
and Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood,

753
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:08,839
which they had made for the purpose.

754
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:12,119
And beside him stood Mattathiah and Shema and Ananiah

755
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,479
and Uriah and Hilkiah and Messiah.

756
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:16,319
On his right hand and on his left hand,

757
00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:19,359
Hadaiah and Mishael and Malachiah and Hashem

758
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,959
and Hashabadana, Zechariah and Meshulam.

759
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:25,959
And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people

760
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:27,279
for he was above all the people.

761
00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:29,599
And when he opened it, all the people stood up

762
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,919
and Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God.

763
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:35,959
And all the people answered, amen, amen.

764
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:40,719
Notice the next phrase, with lifting up their hands.

765
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:45,439
And they bowed their heads and worshiped the Lord

766
00:34:45,439 --> 00:34:48,999
with their faces to the ground.

767
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:52,679
The hands, the very hands that were strengthened

768
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:56,079
for the work that God had given them to accomplish

769
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,559
are now being raised in extension of worship

770
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:02,439
of our great God.

771
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:04,079
Isn't that amazing?

772
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,159
These hands that are growing weary because of the work,

773
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:11,759
because of the labor, the hard labor that was required.

774
00:35:11,759 --> 00:35:14,879
One hand holding a weapon while one hand is working

775
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,759
to build the wall and all that's taking place.

776
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:20,999
And Nehemiah says, oh God, strengthen my hands

777
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:22,799
and the work is accomplished.

778
00:35:22,799 --> 00:35:25,199
But then six days later, they're standing here

779
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,599
and they're worshiping God.

780
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:31,359
And the Bible says that they were lifting up those hands.

781
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:34,039
That's encouraging to me.

782
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:37,999
Because as their hands were strengthened

783
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:41,599
for the work that God had given them to do,

784
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,439
we find also that their hands were engaged

785
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:50,439
in worshiping the God of heaven and how precious that is.

786
00:35:50,999 --> 00:35:54,159
This evening, I understand that as we look

787
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:57,919
at the book of Nehemiah, we can see an Old Testament account

788
00:35:57,919 --> 00:36:01,439
of an actual physical work that they were called

789
00:36:01,439 --> 00:36:02,639
to accomplish.

790
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,439
But this evening, we're not building a wall.

791
00:36:07,439 --> 00:36:09,159
We're certainly engaged in a work.

792
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,239
As we're engaged in the work, it's a spiritual work.

793
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,319
But we're human beings and we can grow weary.

794
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:18,719
We can grow weary.

795
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:21,439
I want you to notice what the Bible says

796
00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:23,559
in the book of Galatians in chapter number six.

797
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:25,559
We'll look at a couple of New Testament passages

798
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,399
and close this evening.

799
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:29,639
But notice in Galatians chapter number six.

800
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:33,639
Galatians chapter number six in verse number nine.

801
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:36,479
The Bible says,

802
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:41,479
and let us not be weary in well-doing,

803
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:46,119
for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.

804
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:49,959
In 2 Thessalonians chapter number three,

805
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:52,559
in verse number 13, I want you to notice

806
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:55,399
that we are not weary in well-doing.

807
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:57,639
We are not weary in well-doing.

808
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:00,279
In verse number 13, I want you to notice

809
00:37:00,279 --> 00:37:04,519
another admonition that is given to the people of God.

810
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:10,959
Paul says in closing to the church at Thessalonica

811
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:13,799
in verse number 13 of 2 Thessalonians three,

812
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:18,799
but ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.

813
00:37:19,919 --> 00:37:21,759
You know what that word weary means?

814
00:37:21,759 --> 00:37:22,999
It means to be exhausted.

815
00:37:24,479 --> 00:37:25,879
It also carries with it this idea

816
00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:29,399
of being utterly spiritless,

817
00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:31,999
just being exhausted, being weary.

818
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:37,679
But God says, be not weary in well-doing.

819
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:43,359
Paul is the human penman as he's writing

820
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,679
to the churches in the region of Galatia,

821
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:48,119
as he's writing now to the church in Thessalonica,

822
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:51,439
and God is using him to say to the people of God,

823
00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:54,679
be not weary in well-doing.

824
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:57,999
You say, but the work that we're doing, it's exhausting.

825
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:00,799
There is an aspect of that.

826
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:05,479
But I want you to notice what Paul's testimony is.

827
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:07,319
Turn to the book of 2 Timothy, if you will.

828
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:09,839
Just keep on going in the New Testament.

829
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,839
Look at 2 Timothy chapter number four.

830
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:17,359
Of course, many of you would know that 2 Timothy,

831
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,239
Paul is writing, understanding that the time

832
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,759
of his departure was at hand.

833
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:24,919
He says in verse six, I am now ready to be offered.

834
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:26,559
The time of my departure is at hand.

835
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:27,479
I fought a good fight.

836
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:28,399
I finished my course.

837
00:38:28,399 --> 00:38:29,399
I have kept the faith.

838
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:32,039
And Paul is nearing the end of his human life.

839
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:35,959
His race is about to be completed.

840
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:39,639
And he's seeking to encourage Timothy,

841
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:41,119
his son in the faith.

842
00:38:41,999 --> 00:38:44,599
And I want you to notice the testimony of Paul

843
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:47,639
after he mentions several people by name.

844
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:49,959
He then says this in verse number 17,

845
00:38:49,959 --> 00:38:54,319
notwithstanding the Lord stood with me,

846
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:55,839
and then notice these words,

847
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,159
and strengthened me.

848
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,519
The Lord stood with me and strengthened me

849
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:07,079
that by me the preaching might be fully known

850
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:09,079
and that all the Gentiles might hear.

851
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:13,279
And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

852
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:17,559
And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work

853
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:20,639
and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom

854
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:23,319
to whom be glory forever and ever.

855
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,359
Amen.

856
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:27,439
Listen, God is no respecter of persons.

857
00:39:27,439 --> 00:39:28,279
Amen.

858
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:29,519
We believe that this evening.

859
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:33,159
The Bible declares that our God is no respecter of persons.

860
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:36,919
And we find that as Paul would give testimony here

861
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:38,119
in the book of second Timothy,

862
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:40,599
that the Lord stood with me and the Lord strengthened me.

863
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:43,119
And we could think about the life and ministry

864
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,079
of the apostle Paul,

865
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,399
and we could understand some of the hardships

866
00:39:46,439 --> 00:39:48,359
in which he endured and some of the opposition

867
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:49,359
in which he dealt with.

868
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,119
And we can understand the timing.

869
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,519
Listen, his travels were different than our travels.

870
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:57,599
The ease of communication and transportation

871
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,039
that we have today vary greatly

872
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:01,879
from what Paul had to endure.

873
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:06,439
endure an encounter.

874
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:13,279
So often I wonder how the past generation got so much done.

875
00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:19,399
Do you ever wonder that?

876
00:40:19,399 --> 00:40:27,199
We have so many modern conveniences today, but it seems like we get so little done.

877
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:29,919
I'm speaking for myself.

878
00:40:29,919 --> 00:40:32,679
How many of you have ever used a concordance?

879
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:35,959
Use a concordance, right?

880
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:38,839
I don't know how you use a concordance, but I'm lazy.

881
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:40,359
I don't use the book anymore.

882
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:41,359
Why?

883
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,519
Because it's on my computer.

884
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:48,359
I'm just being honest with you, because if I had to go over to my bookshelf and get the

885
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:52,799
strong concordance or the young concordance off my bookshelf, then I have to turn and

886
00:40:52,799 --> 00:40:58,039
find it and search through, but I can just sit down at my desk and I can just do-do-do

887
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,039
and bam, it comes up.

888
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,399
Have any of you used it on a computer?

889
00:41:01,399 --> 00:41:05,039
I got it on my phone, actually.

890
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:15,839
But you know that those guys took a Bible and word by word organized it into a concordance.

891
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:20,039
Every place you find the word fear, faith, fill in it, whatever, peace, I mean, you just

892
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:24,359
fill in every word, and they went through.

893
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:30,119
Can you imagine how much time that would take?

894
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:34,479
Without the computer technology that we have today and all of the modern conveniences,

895
00:41:34,479 --> 00:41:37,879
it would make your head explode.

896
00:41:37,879 --> 00:41:39,599
Seriously.

897
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,479
There's a fella, Kimberly, you know him, Scotty Bockhouse, right?

898
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:50,239
I don't know if I said his last name properly, but he's a pastor, and he helped work on the

899
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:52,679
Bible.

900
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:54,959
Some of you have read it, the chronological Bible.

901
00:41:54,959 --> 00:42:00,359
I think it's the Reese Chronological Bible, and Scotty Bockhouse was helping as Mr. Reese

902
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:04,239
was going home to be with the Lord and what have you, and so he's made another revision

903
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:07,799
to it and changed some things around, but I met Scotty several years ago.

904
00:42:07,799 --> 00:42:14,199
I pray for him weekly, and as I met him and we began to talk about how this chronological

905
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,799
Bible was put together.

906
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:18,719
Have any of you ever read a chronological Bible?

907
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:22,039
It takes the Bible, and it puts it in chronological order.

908
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,519
You understand that the Bible you hold in your hand tonight is not in chronological

909
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:26,519
order.

910
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:30,119
It's not, but we find that these, you know how this man did it?

911
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,919
I don't know, Kimberly, if Scotty ever told you the testimony.

912
00:42:32,919 --> 00:42:37,319
He took a Bible, and he took manila folders.

913
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:38,759
I don't like manila folders.

914
00:42:38,759 --> 00:42:39,759
Lenna knows that.

915
00:42:39,759 --> 00:42:40,759
I don't like them.

916
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:41,759
Drive me crazy.

917
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:45,919
I got a bunch of them, but they drive me crazy, and he would cut the manila folder in half

918
00:42:45,999 --> 00:42:51,519
so they'd have two pieces, and he would take the Bible, and as he read the Bible, he would

919
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:58,279
take a pen knife, and he would cut up the pages of Scripture, and he would paste them

920
00:42:58,279 --> 00:43:04,279
onto those manila folders in a chronological sequence.

921
00:43:04,279 --> 00:43:05,679
Can you imagine that?

922
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:15,079
That makes my head explode, seriously, because of the technology that we have.

923
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:17,239
Think about the first century church.

924
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:18,799
They filled Jerusalem with their doctrine.

925
00:43:18,799 --> 00:43:21,999
They turned the world upside down.

926
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:29,599
We've been given so many conveniences, and we have God's power available to us for the

927
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:37,159
work that He's called us to do, and yet at times it seems like we get so much less accomplished

928
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:43,399
than what they got accomplished, 52 days.

929
00:43:43,399 --> 00:43:48,319
When you notice the response of the enemies, this is not humanly possible.

930
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:53,599
This is a work of God, but it was the men that did it.

931
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:54,639
They saw them.

932
00:43:54,639 --> 00:44:00,519
They observed what happened, and we find this evening that when we look and we understand,

933
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:07,359
and maybe it's a matter of perspective, that the perspective that Nehemiah had, all of

934
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:12,399
those things that we looked at in the first point this evening, what he recognized, God

935
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:16,679
put a work in my heart.

936
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:19,199
The report was accurate.

937
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:22,359
God's hand is upon me.

938
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:24,959
God is the one that has all power.

939
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:32,799
You go through all of that list, and you recognize that Nehemiah said, God has a work for me

940
00:44:32,799 --> 00:44:39,499
to do, and it caused him to be laser-focused on doing what God called him to do.

941
00:44:39,499 --> 00:44:41,159
But my strength is failing.

942
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:46,679
And I go to the God that is the Lord God omnipotent, and I say, God, strengthen, strengthen

943
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:51,399
my hands, for this is a great work, and it's your work.

944
00:44:51,399 --> 00:44:55,419
And this evening, each of us have a work to do.

945
00:44:55,419 --> 00:44:56,599
We need God's strength.

946
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:03,519
Oh, there's opposition, there's adversity, but the reality is that we can grow weary.

947
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:09,159
And Paul says, the Lord stood with me, and He strengthened me, and He'll strengthen you

948
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:10,839
as well.

949
00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:18,199
This evening, Nehemiah simply prayed, oh God, strengthen my hands.

950
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:20,619
Father, we love You.

951
00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:23,339
We thank You for loving us.

952
00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:25,179
We thank You for the Word of God.

953
00:45:25,179 --> 00:45:29,599
We thank You for the testimony and the example of Nehemiah.

954
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:37,759
And God, I pray that You would help us this evening, each of us, individually, to recognize

955
00:45:37,759 --> 00:45:40,599
that You've given us a work to do.

956
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:43,999
God, that we'd recognize it's Your work.

957
00:45:43,999 --> 00:45:50,159
It's a great work, because it's Your work.

958
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:53,559
We know that the enemy wants to weaken our hands so that the work is not accomplished

959
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:55,559
or fulfilled.

960
00:45:55,559 --> 00:46:01,359
But God, You are the Lord God omnipotent.

961
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,879
You've strengthened those that have gone before us.

962
00:46:04,999 --> 00:46:15,199
God, we pray this evening that in that time of weakness, that time when we may grow weary,

963
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:20,159
that we would acknowledge our need and that we would simply request, as Nehemiah did,

964
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,559
for strength.

965
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:30,439
God, strengthen us, help us to complete, to fulfill what You've given us to do.

966
00:46:30,439 --> 00:46:35,339
I pray that in these moments of invitation, the Holy Spirit of God would use the Word

967
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:42,639
of God, the hearts of Your people, Lord, to encourage us and to challenge us.

968
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:46,519
And we'll thank You for the work that's accomplished, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

969
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:47,519
Would You say, Amen?

970
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:47,519
