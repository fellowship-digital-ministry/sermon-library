WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'll begin in the sixth chapter,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.960
but we will be looking at a number of verses

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.159
through the book of Nehemiah this evening.

00:00:07.159 --> 00:00:09.800
And several weeks ago in our first preparation

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.880
for revival sermon on a Sunday morning,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.199
I preached from Nehemiah chapter number one

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.360
and dealt with the report that was received

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.180
and the response to the report.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.200
And as we look at what's taking place here

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.200
in the book of Nehemiah, I'll mention several things

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.219
as we go through the message

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:26.920
with regard to the historical context.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.600
But let me say this simply

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.840
by way of introduction this evening,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.119
God has given each one of us a work to do.

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:36.159
He really has.

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:39.319
And I preached a message not long ago on a Sunday evening,

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:41.360
many members, one body,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.080
and speaking about the local church

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.520
and the job that we have to do,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.659
obviously corporately as a church,

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:49.080
we have responsibility biblically

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.240
to fulfill the purposes that God has given us.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.860
But as were many members in making up one body

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.619
to accomplish that goal,

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:02.099
we understand that each one of us have our own part to do.

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:04.620
And God's given each of us a work to do.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.540
And I believe that as we seek to fulfill the work

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.860
that God has given to us, that we will face adversity.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.260
Have you found it to be so?

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.660
And you look throughout the word of God

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.819
and you find that those who attempt to do something for God

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:22.980
are met with adversity or opposition

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:25.260
and such is the case for us as well.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.739
And we find that that adversity and that opposition

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:30.540
is found in the book of Nehemiah as well.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.739
And we'll note some of that this evening.

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:36.080
But I also find that as we seek to fulfill the task,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.540
the work that God has given us to do,

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.379
not only can we face the adversity and the opposition,

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:45.220
but the reality is that we as individuals,

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.339
we can grow weary, we can grow weary.

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:50.940
And we'll look at some verses in the New Testament

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.459
with regard to growing weary

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:54.739
as we near the end of the message this evening.

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:58.180
But I want you to notice in Nehemiah six and verse number nine

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.379
and it's the single verse of scripture that I've used

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:02.580
for in the bulletin there,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.779
because we'll be in so much of the book of Nehemiah

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:07.319
this evening and looking at several verses.

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.300
But I wanna draw your attention by way of introduction

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.020
onto this verse of scripture.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.419
The Bible says this,

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:15.940
for they all made us afraid,

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.220
saying, notice what they said,

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.339
this is the enemy, the opposition.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.139
They had Sanballat and Geshem had come

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:26.619
and thought to do mischief to Nehemiah

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:27.860
according to verse number two.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.979
And we notice that it says that they made us afraid,

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:31.539
they all made us afraid saying,

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:36.539
their hands shall be weakened from the work.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.259
And then notice this phrase,

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:43.259
that it be not done.

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:46.660
You know, the enemy wants to weaken our hands

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.179
so that the work is not fulfilled.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.100
The work is not accomplished.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.100
We find that it then says this,

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.339
Nehemiah, simple yet profound prayer.

00:02:57.339 --> 00:03:01.259
He says, now therefore, oh God,

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:06.139
strengthen my hands.

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.940
And I love this simple prayer of Nehemiah,

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.779
this prayer for strength.

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:13.979
And we understand as we study the New Testament

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:16.539
and Paul makes mention in second Corinthians four,

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:18.660
that though the outward man perish,

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:21.059
the inward man is renewed day by day

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:24.100
and we can speak about the inner man being strengthened

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.380
and absolutely that is essential

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.860
for the work that God has given us to do.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.699
But we find in this text of Scripture

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:34.100
and really the work that is seeking to be accomplished here

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.259
was a work that required great physical strength.

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:41.100
And we find that there was much opposition

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.300
and through the process of not only the hard labor

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.220
and the opposition, there was some weakening, if you will.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.259
There was some folks, they were growing weary

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:55.899
and so the prayer is to strengthen my hands.

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:58.940
I've used that as the title for the message this evening.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.220
And I want you to just notice a few things with me tonight.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.300
Number one, notice what Nehemiah recognized.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.899
Notice what he recognized.

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:08.820
And I'm gonna give you a number of things

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.300
that he recognized.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.259
And so go back to the second chapter, if you will.

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:15.419
We won't make much mention of the first chapter.

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.260
It's in that chapter where Nehemiah receives the report

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.540
with regard to the condition in Jerusalem

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.339
and he prays before the Lord.

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:23.820
And we come to the second chapter

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.779
and we find that Nehemiah has sorrow of heart.

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:29.820
It is seen, it is obvious to Artaxerxes

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.420
as he enters into his presence

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.500
that Nehemiah has this sorrow of heart.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.260
And we find that Nehemiah begins to express

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.260
what's taking place.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.420
And as we begin to just go through the book of Nehemiah

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.100
and take note of some things that Nehemiah recognized,

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.619
I want you to see first of all,

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:49.420
in verse number 12 of chapter two,

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.019
notice what the Bible says.

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:55.739
And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me,

00:04:55.739 --> 00:05:00.739
neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:03.179
to do at Jerusalem.

00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:04.980
Neither was there any beast with me,

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.140
save the beast that I rode upon.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.739
Number one of the things that Nehemiah recognized,

00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:13.380
I want you to see that he recognized

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.260
that God Almighty had put something in his heart to do.

00:05:19.299 --> 00:05:21.859
He recognized that it was God that put it there.

00:05:21.859 --> 00:05:24.619
He recognized that as he had heard the report

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:26.260
after his inquiry was made,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.899
that he heard what was taking place

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:31.059
and God put something in his heart.

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:32.579
And I just wonder tonight,

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:35.339
has God put something in your heart?

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:38.339
Are we confident as Nehemiah was confident,

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:40.540
where he says, listen, at this point,

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.140
we know that in just a few verses

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.339
as we begin to study through the book of Nehemiah,

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:46.380
that Nehemiah will reveal to these

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.779
that he's working amongst and ministering to

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:50.179
what God has put in his heart.

00:05:50.179 --> 00:05:52.179
At this particular moment, it says,

00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:54.820
neither told I any man, but notice what it says,

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.820
what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.820
God had a task for Nehemiah and that task,

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:09.779
it was burning within his heart.

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:11.739
And he had this desire and he recognized

00:06:11.739 --> 00:06:14.940
that it was God Almighty that put it there.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.700
Notice he recognized in verse number 13,

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.260
what is it that he recognized?

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.779
Well, he recognized that the report was accurate.

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:25.899
In verse number 13, it says,

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:28.179
and I went out by night by the gate of the valley,

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.980
even before the dragon well into the dung port

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.040
and viewed the walls of Jerusalem,

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.660
which were broken down and the gates thereof

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.579
were consumed with fire.

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:42.100
He recognized that the report that he'd received

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.579
in chapter number one was an accurate report.

00:06:44.579 --> 00:06:47.459
He found that he asked, he had inquired

00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:49.779
as to the condition there in Jerusalem.

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:52.739
And we find that he was informed

00:06:52.739 --> 00:06:53.779
that those that were there

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:55.619
were in great affliction and reproach.

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:57.500
And it says at the end of verse number three,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.899
the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:02.579
and the gates thereof are burned with fire.

00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:05.140
And now in verse number 13, at the end of the verse,

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.299
it says that he viewed the walls of Jerusalem,

00:07:08.299 --> 00:07:11.920
which were broken down and the gates thereof

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.980
were consumed with fire.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.739
What he had previously heard about,

00:07:17.739 --> 00:07:20.299
he now sees with his own eyes.

00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:24.779
And he found out that the report was an accurate report.

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:27.220
And so he recognized the condition.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.739
I want you to see as we continue reading here

00:07:29.739 --> 00:07:31.540
in verse 17, number three,

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.660
what is it that Nehemiah recognized?

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.779
He recognized that God's hand was upon him.

00:07:38.119 --> 00:07:39.500
It says in verse number 17,

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.619
then said I unto them,

00:07:40.619 --> 00:07:42.660
you see the distress that we are in,

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.420
how Jerusalem lieth waste

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.739
and the gates thereof are burned with fire.

00:07:46.739 --> 00:07:50.140
Come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.820
that we be no more a reproach.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.820
Then I told them of the hand of my God,

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.500
which was good upon me.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.260
As also the king's words that he had spoken unto me.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.500
And they said, let us rise up and build

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.459
so they strengthen their hands for this good work.

00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:13.079
I want you to notice that he recognized

00:08:13.079 --> 00:08:15.140
that God's hand was upon him.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.339
God had put something in his heart,

00:08:17.339 --> 00:08:20.700
but he also recognized that God's hand was upon him.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.980
These are all good things, by the way,

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.420
because the reality is that if we don't recognize

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.179
these things that Nehemiah is recognizing,

00:08:28.179 --> 00:08:31.459
when that opposition comes, when that adversity comes,

00:08:31.459 --> 00:08:34.000
when we grow weary,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.500
well, we may just go ahead and throw in the towel.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.500
But Nehemiah recognized some things.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.020
Notice number four, what is it that he recognized?

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.520
He recognized the power of God.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.739
Notice in verse number 20,

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.659
it said this, then answered I them.

00:08:51.659 --> 00:08:53.099
Well, let me get it in context with you.

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:54.299
In verse number 19, it says this,

00:08:54.299 --> 00:08:57.140
but when Sanballat the Hornite and Tobiah the servant,

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.940
the Ammonite and Geshem the Arabian heard it,

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.380
they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said,

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.280
what is this thing that you do?

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.299
Will you rebel against the king?

00:09:08.299 --> 00:09:10.419
Then answered I them and said unto them,

00:09:10.419 --> 00:09:13.039
the God of heaven.

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:14.580
Don't you like that?

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.619
He is talking about, and they, the opposition,

00:09:17.619 --> 00:09:19.580
the adversity, they're talking about a human king,

00:09:20.419 --> 00:09:21.900
but he's talking about the king of kings.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.380
And he says, the God of heaven,

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:29.380
he will prosper us.

00:09:29.539 --> 00:09:31.539
He recognized God's power.

00:09:31.539 --> 00:09:33.900
He said, therefore, we, his servants,

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.940
will arise and build,

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.539
but ye have no portion, nor right,

00:09:38.539 --> 00:09:41.520
nor memorial in Jerusalem.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.140
Oh, we have to recognize the power of God.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.859
Listen, the work that we're engaged in,

00:09:45.859 --> 00:09:48.299
it's a work that God would put in our hearts,

00:09:48.299 --> 00:09:49.979
and we know that it's our God,

00:09:49.979 --> 00:09:52.960
the Lord God omnipotent that puts it in our hearts,

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.900
and we find that it is God's hand that would be upon us,

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.859
and we recognize that it is his power that enables us.

00:09:59.859 --> 00:10:06.059
And he says that God, He will prosper us.

00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:07.819
Number five.

00:10:07.819 --> 00:10:10.299
Skip over to chapter number six, if you will.

00:10:10.299 --> 00:10:15.899
In chapter number three, you read the work that's assigned,

00:10:15.899 --> 00:10:17.059
the building of the walls.

00:10:17.059 --> 00:10:19.379
In chapter number four, you read of all the attack.

00:10:19.379 --> 00:10:21.179
It continues into chapter number five

00:10:21.179 --> 00:10:23.179
and into the beginning of chapter number six

00:10:23.179 --> 00:10:25.679
by way of compromise and what have you.

00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:27.659
But I want you to notice what it is

00:10:27.659 --> 00:10:29.339
that Nehemiah recognized.

00:10:29.339 --> 00:10:33.459
Number five, he recognized that this work was, quote,

00:10:33.459 --> 00:10:35.279
a great work.

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:39.779
Notice what he says in Nehemiah 6 in verse number three.

00:10:39.779 --> 00:10:42.499
And I sent messengers unto them, saying,

00:10:42.499 --> 00:10:50.139
I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down.

00:10:50.139 --> 00:10:56.619
Why should the work cease whilst I leave it and come down to you?

00:10:56.619 --> 00:10:58.659
He recognized that it was a great work.

00:10:58.659 --> 00:10:59.979
Let me say this.

00:10:59.979 --> 00:11:03.779
Every work for God is a great work.

00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:04.419
Why?

00:11:04.419 --> 00:11:06.499
Because He's a great God.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.939
And He is the Lord God Almighty.

00:11:08.939 --> 00:11:13.659
And listen, every work for God is a great work.

00:11:13.659 --> 00:11:16.019
And we understand that as God had put it

00:11:16.019 --> 00:11:19.219
in the heart of Nehemiah to build the walls,

00:11:19.219 --> 00:11:22.379
as God had put this work in his heart

00:11:22.379 --> 00:11:25.499
and He had given him the power and the strength to do it,

00:11:25.499 --> 00:11:28.579
we find that every work that we would do for God

00:11:28.579 --> 00:11:31.219
is a great work.

00:11:31.219 --> 00:11:33.619
You say, well, the work that God's given me to do

00:11:33.619 --> 00:11:36.499
isn't the same work that God's given you to do.

00:11:36.499 --> 00:11:38.299
Correct.

00:11:38.299 --> 00:11:40.579
But it's still a great work.

00:11:40.579 --> 00:11:41.619
It's still a great work.

00:11:41.619 --> 00:11:42.339
Why?

00:11:42.339 --> 00:11:44.059
Because it's for God.

00:11:44.059 --> 00:11:45.979
Because it's for God.

00:11:45.979 --> 00:11:49.539
And when we recognize that this work that we're doing

00:11:49.539 --> 00:11:52.259
is a great work and that it's a work for God,

00:11:52.259 --> 00:11:54.779
it will give us a perspective with regard

00:11:55.179 --> 00:11:56.539
to I can't slow down.

00:11:56.539 --> 00:11:58.059
I can't throw in the towel.

00:11:58.059 --> 00:11:59.059
I can't give up.

00:11:59.059 --> 00:11:59.579
Why?

00:11:59.579 --> 00:12:03.419
Because this work, this is a great work.

00:12:03.419 --> 00:12:07.219
God's given me this task to do.

00:12:07.219 --> 00:12:10.579
Notice that He recognized whatever number we're on.

00:12:10.579 --> 00:12:12.459
Number six, I guess it is.

00:12:12.459 --> 00:12:15.179
I have them by letters in my notes.

00:12:15.179 --> 00:12:17.379
And I'm giving them to you by numbers.

00:12:17.379 --> 00:12:20.899
And so number six, if that's the right number,

00:12:20.899 --> 00:12:22.739
I heard one preacher say number next.

00:12:22.739 --> 00:12:25.019
And that way, you just know what next is, amen?

00:12:25.019 --> 00:12:27.739
And what is number next?

00:12:27.739 --> 00:12:30.219
It's whatever's next in your sequence, amen?

00:12:30.219 --> 00:12:32.339
But number six, notice this.

00:12:32.339 --> 00:12:37.939
He recognized that their strength is decayed.

00:12:37.939 --> 00:12:40.139
Notice him back in chapter number four.

00:12:40.139 --> 00:12:40.939
They're working.

00:12:40.939 --> 00:12:41.899
They're doing the work.

00:12:41.899 --> 00:12:44.419
And chapter number three gave us all of the details.

00:12:44.419 --> 00:12:46.859
And you can go back and read it in chapter number three

00:12:46.859 --> 00:12:49.659
and the work that's assigned and all the parts of the wall

00:12:49.659 --> 00:12:50.659
and what have you.

00:12:50.659 --> 00:12:52.299
But we find that the work is being

00:12:52.299 --> 00:12:54.299
attacked in the fourth chapter.

00:12:54.299 --> 00:12:56.019
They persevere through this.

00:12:56.019 --> 00:12:58.499
They're praying and seeking the face of God.

00:12:58.499 --> 00:13:01.739
But we find that as we look in Nehemiah 4,

00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:03.939
notice in verse number seven, it says,

00:13:03.939 --> 00:13:06.259
but it came to pass that when Sanballat and Tobiah

00:13:06.259 --> 00:13:09.019
and the Arabians and the Ammonites and the Ashtodites

00:13:09.019 --> 00:13:12.059
heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up

00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:15.219
and that the breaches began to be stopped,

00:13:15.219 --> 00:13:19.939
then they were very rough and conspired all of them

00:13:19.939 --> 00:13:23.219
together to come and to fight against Jerusalem

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:24.619
and to hinder it.

00:13:24.619 --> 00:13:26.819
Now, this enemy that's going to fight,

00:13:26.819 --> 00:13:28.219
you think about all of those that

00:13:28.219 --> 00:13:29.779
were named in verse number seven.

00:13:29.779 --> 00:13:31.379
This is a large host that's going

00:13:31.379 --> 00:13:33.779
to come against the work of God.

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:35.259
The Bible says in verse number nine,

00:13:35.259 --> 00:13:37.419
nevertheless, we made our prayer unto our God

00:13:37.419 --> 00:13:40.779
and set a watch against them day and night because of them.

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:43.459
And then I want you to notice what Judah says in verse number

00:13:43.459 --> 00:13:44.179
10.

00:13:44.179 --> 00:13:50.299
And Judah said, the strength of the bearers of burdens

00:13:50.299 --> 00:13:52.739
is decayed.

00:13:52.739 --> 00:13:54.459
And there is much rubbish so that we

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:59.259
are not able to build the wall.

00:13:59.259 --> 00:14:02.259
We find, as we begin to look at that word,

00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:05.259
when they make the statement about the strength

00:14:05.259 --> 00:14:07.699
of the bearers of burdens being decayed,

00:14:07.699 --> 00:14:11.179
it means to make feeble or to make weak.

00:14:11.179 --> 00:14:15.539
Now, again, this task requires great physical strength.

00:14:15.539 --> 00:14:17.739
And we find that Nehemiah recognized

00:14:17.739 --> 00:14:19.059
he received the report.

00:14:19.059 --> 00:14:21.059
He heard what Judah said.

00:14:21.059 --> 00:14:24.139
He heard about these that were working there

00:14:24.139 --> 00:14:27.019
and how the strength of these individuals,

00:14:27.019 --> 00:14:29.379
these bearers of burdens is decayed.

00:14:29.379 --> 00:14:31.699
It's becoming weak.

00:14:31.699 --> 00:14:34.459
He recognized that.

00:14:34.459 --> 00:14:36.579
He recognized that the enemy desired

00:14:36.579 --> 00:14:39.899
to see their hands weakened so that the work would not

00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:43.299
be completed.

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.899
Number seven, he recognized that the enemy desired

00:14:45.899 --> 00:14:49.739
to see their hands weakened so that the work would not

00:14:49.739 --> 00:14:51.139
be completed.

00:14:51.139 --> 00:14:52.859
Notice what it says in verse number nine.

00:14:52.859 --> 00:14:55.219
We read it by way of introduction.

00:14:55.219 --> 00:14:56.859
For they all made us afraid, saying,

00:14:56.859 --> 00:15:00.859
their hands should be weakened from the work

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:04.019
that it be not done.

00:15:04.019 --> 00:15:06.779
That was the desire of the enemy,

00:15:06.779 --> 00:15:09.099
was that their hands would be weakened

00:15:09.099 --> 00:15:12.379
so that the work would not be completed.

00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:15.659
But as we look at this book of Nehemiah,

00:15:15.659 --> 00:15:18.219
I find that he recognized something else.

00:15:18.219 --> 00:15:20.979
Number eight, he recognized this.

00:15:20.979 --> 00:15:26.500
He recognized that God could strengthen their hands.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.779
He recognized that.

00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:30.979
It says in verse number nine, now therefore, oh God,

00:15:30.979 --> 00:15:33.539
strengthen my hands.

00:15:33.539 --> 00:15:37.579
We find that his recognition of God's ability

00:15:37.579 --> 00:15:42.099
led to the prayer that he prays in verse number nine.

00:15:42.099 --> 00:15:45.379
This evening, we must recognize that God's given us

00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:46.579
a work to do.

00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:49.739
We must recognize that God's put something in our heart.

00:15:49.739 --> 00:15:50.939
What is that something?

00:15:50.939 --> 00:15:52.179
You say, I have no idea.

00:15:52.179 --> 00:15:55.179
I just feel like a ship that's just tossed to and fro

00:15:55.179 --> 00:15:56.500
with no direction.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.099
Oh, seek God and ask Him to reveal to you what it is,

00:16:00.099 --> 00:16:03.539
what work He has for you to do, and that He'd put it

00:16:03.539 --> 00:16:06.699
in your heart, and that you'd recognize that this work

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:09.059
that He's given you to do, it's a great work.

00:16:09.059 --> 00:16:09.579
Why?

00:16:09.579 --> 00:16:12.859
Because it's God's work, and that God will strengthen you,

00:16:12.859 --> 00:16:14.659
that it's through God's power.

00:16:14.659 --> 00:16:17.779
And we find that Nehemiah, he acknowledged the fact

00:16:17.779 --> 00:16:20.299
that there was some decaying of the strength

00:16:20.299 --> 00:16:22.299
as Judah provided the report.

00:16:22.299 --> 00:16:24.179
He understood that the enemy wanted

00:16:24.179 --> 00:16:27.139
to weaken their hands so that the work would not

00:16:27.139 --> 00:16:29.979
be accomplished or completed.

00:16:29.979 --> 00:16:34.059
But we find that he recognized that God is able.

00:16:34.059 --> 00:16:35.339
That God is able.

00:16:35.339 --> 00:16:39.339
Listen, when we find ourselves weary,

00:16:39.339 --> 00:16:41.699
have you ever been weary?

00:16:41.699 --> 00:16:43.539
Sure you have.

00:16:43.539 --> 00:16:45.899
When you find yourself weary, oh, it's

00:16:45.899 --> 00:16:49.779
good to recognize that God can strengthen you,

00:16:49.779 --> 00:16:52.539
because there was still a work to be done.

00:16:52.539 --> 00:16:55.500
We notice, number one, what Nehemiah recognized.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.819
Notice number two with me this evening.

00:16:57.819 --> 00:16:59.859
Notice what Nehemiah requested.

00:16:59.859 --> 00:17:01.459
It's right there in verse number nine.

00:17:01.459 --> 00:17:02.699
It's the title of our message.

00:17:02.699 --> 00:17:06.299
It's a simple yet appropriate prayer.

00:17:06.299 --> 00:17:08.059
His request is this.

00:17:08.059 --> 00:17:12.299
Strengthen my hands.

00:17:12.299 --> 00:17:14.699
There's nothing really complicated about that.

00:17:14.699 --> 00:17:18.099
There's nothing really deep about that.

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:20.259
It's a recognition of several things

00:17:20.259 --> 00:17:21.859
that we looked at, those eight items.

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:23.899
And perhaps as you study the book of Nehemiah,

00:17:23.899 --> 00:17:26.099
you'll find more things that Nehemiah recognized.

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:27.699
It's not an exhaustive list.

00:17:27.699 --> 00:17:29.539
But the reality is that as we come

00:17:29.539 --> 00:17:31.579
to verse number nine of chapter number six,

00:17:31.579 --> 00:17:36.379
that Nehemiah makes this simple prayer, this simple request

00:17:36.379 --> 00:17:39.979
that God Almighty would strengthen his hands.

00:17:39.979 --> 00:17:45.139
I want you to notice that Nehemiah did not request

00:17:45.139 --> 00:17:48.619
for a change of assignment.

00:17:48.619 --> 00:17:49.819
He didn't say, you know what?

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:52.299
This is just too much.

00:17:52.299 --> 00:17:55.419
Maybe I can get a new assignment.

00:17:55.419 --> 00:17:56.979
That's not what he prayed.

00:17:56.979 --> 00:17:59.859
He didn't pray that someone else would do the work.

00:18:02.859 --> 00:18:07.939
He said, God, strengthen my hands.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.299
Strengthen my hands.

00:18:13.299 --> 00:18:15.819
Go over to the book of James, if you will, in the New Testament.

00:18:15.819 --> 00:18:19.219
I want you to look at a couple of verses that are familiar to us.

00:18:19.219 --> 00:18:22.339
But I want you to think about this prayer of Nehemiah.

00:18:22.339 --> 00:18:23.659
Again, it's a simple prayer.

00:18:23.659 --> 00:18:24.699
It's a simple request.

00:18:24.699 --> 00:18:29.059
There's nothing complicated or deep about this request.

00:18:29.059 --> 00:18:32.419
It's absolutely appropriate to make the request.

00:18:32.419 --> 00:18:35.059
Listen, if you feel weary, recognizing

00:18:35.059 --> 00:18:37.339
the One who has the power to strengthen you

00:18:37.339 --> 00:18:40.099
and asking Him for strength is appropriate.

00:18:40.099 --> 00:18:41.179
Amen?

00:18:41.179 --> 00:18:44.459
We find here in the book of James a couple of thoughts.

00:18:44.459 --> 00:18:46.659
In verse number two, the Bible says,

00:18:46.659 --> 00:18:48.779
you lust and have not, you kill and desire to have

00:18:48.779 --> 00:18:50.619
and cannot obtain, you fight and war.

00:18:50.619 --> 00:18:54.059
Notice this, you have not because you ask not.

00:18:54.059 --> 00:18:55.700
Then notice this in verse number three,

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.260
ye ask and receive not because you ask amiss,

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.940
that you may consume it upon your lusts.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.579
We've often looked at verses two and three of James chapter

00:19:03.579 --> 00:19:05.219
number four, and we've understood

00:19:05.219 --> 00:19:07.419
as people have quoted these verses of Scripture

00:19:07.419 --> 00:19:08.579
that you have not.

00:19:08.579 --> 00:19:09.140
Why?

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.299
Well, because you ask not.

00:19:11.299 --> 00:19:14.940
You have not, according to verse number three, why?

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.019
And you receive not, why?

00:19:16.019 --> 00:19:20.260
Because you ask amiss, that you may consume it upon your lust.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.179
As I look at the request of Nehemiah

00:19:22.219 --> 00:19:24.299
here in chapter number six and verse number nine,

00:19:24.299 --> 00:19:27.219
when he says, oh God, strengthen my hands,

00:19:27.219 --> 00:19:30.099
I find that this is a request that

00:19:30.099 --> 00:19:32.539
is appropriate for the hour and for that which

00:19:32.539 --> 00:19:33.459
he's dealing with.

00:19:33.459 --> 00:19:35.459
In fact, if you go over to the book of 1 John

00:19:35.459 --> 00:19:37.419
in chapter number five, and notice

00:19:37.419 --> 00:19:40.779
what John tells us in this great epistle

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:42.619
that we've studied here on Sunday mornings,

00:19:42.619 --> 00:19:47.179
and notice with me in verses 14 and 15 of the fifth chapter.

00:19:47.179 --> 00:19:48.619
Notice what John says.

00:19:48.619 --> 00:19:50.500
Now, John had the privilege of walking

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.019
with the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:19:52.019 --> 00:19:54.940
He had the privilege of hearing the Lord speak to him

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.700
about the importance of prayer and the privilege of prayer

00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.539
in coming.

00:19:59.539 --> 00:20:01.079
Before.

00:20:01.079 --> 00:20:03.039
or the throne of God.

00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:05.739
And John, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:20:05.739 --> 00:20:08.759
says this in 1 John 5 and verse number 14,

00:20:08.759 --> 00:20:13.599
and this is the confidence that we have in Him.

00:20:13.599 --> 00:20:16.119
Now, this is a recurring word and thought

00:20:16.119 --> 00:20:17.399
in the book of 1 John.

00:20:17.399 --> 00:20:18.879
Having confidence.

00:20:18.879 --> 00:20:20.679
Being confident that I'm saved.

00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:24.419
Being confident that I belong to the Lord Jesus Christ

00:20:24.419 --> 00:20:25.799
and I am His child.

00:20:25.799 --> 00:20:28.399
And we find here that He speaks of this confidence

00:20:28.399 --> 00:20:29.279
that we have in Him.

00:20:29.279 --> 00:20:30.479
Notice what it is.

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:35.479
That if we ask anything according to His will,

00:20:35.639 --> 00:20:36.879
He heareth us.

00:20:38.319 --> 00:20:39.499
Doesn't stop there.

00:20:40.359 --> 00:20:41.879
In verse number 15, it says,

00:20:41.879 --> 00:20:46.639
and if we know that He hear us,

00:20:46.639 --> 00:20:48.879
whatsoever we ask,

00:20:48.879 --> 00:20:52.519
we know that we have the petitions

00:20:52.519 --> 00:20:55.479
that we desired of Him.

00:20:56.479 --> 00:21:00.879
Was it the will of God for Nehemiah to build the wall?

00:21:00.879 --> 00:21:03.779
As best we can tell, absolutely.

00:21:03.779 --> 00:21:06.359
This was a work that God put in His heart.

00:21:06.359 --> 00:21:07.959
He testifies of that.

00:21:07.959 --> 00:21:10.439
This was a work that He recognized

00:21:10.439 --> 00:21:12.159
God's hand was upon Him.

00:21:12.159 --> 00:21:15.039
He recognized all of those things that we went through,

00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:18.439
and we find that in the moment of that adversity

00:21:18.439 --> 00:21:19.819
that continued to grow,

00:21:19.819 --> 00:21:22.759
and in the weariness that was there amongst the people,

00:21:22.759 --> 00:21:24.719
we find that He makes this prayer,

00:21:24.719 --> 00:21:27.359
oh, God, strengthen my hands.

00:21:28.679 --> 00:21:33.679
He asked that the Lord God omnipotent, His God,

00:21:34.219 --> 00:21:35.659
would give Him strength.

00:21:36.559 --> 00:21:40.959
We find that as we have the whole canon of Scripture,

00:21:40.959 --> 00:21:43.719
we look at 1 John 5, and we can say,

00:21:43.719 --> 00:21:46.279
hey, if God's given me a task,

00:21:46.279 --> 00:21:49.319
if God's given me something to accomplish,

00:21:49.319 --> 00:21:50.999
then we can have the confidence

00:21:50.999 --> 00:21:53.099
that if we ask anything according to His will,

00:21:53.099 --> 00:21:55.339
that He hears us, and not only that,

00:21:55.339 --> 00:21:56.879
but we know that if He hears us,

00:21:56.879 --> 00:21:58.059
that whatsoever we ask,

00:21:58.059 --> 00:22:02.159
we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him.

00:22:03.259 --> 00:22:04.099
Wow.

00:22:05.119 --> 00:22:08.059
You know, sometimes we may not have the strength

00:22:08.059 --> 00:22:10.679
for the simple fact that we don't ask for it.

00:22:13.899 --> 00:22:16.499
You know how many times people don't get help

00:22:16.499 --> 00:22:18.099
because they don't ask for help?

00:22:20.539 --> 00:22:21.859
Right?

00:22:21.859 --> 00:22:23.459
How many times have you heard somebody say,

00:22:23.459 --> 00:22:24.779
hey, let me know if you need anything,

00:22:24.779 --> 00:22:26.939
and you knew they were just being nice?

00:22:26.939 --> 00:22:28.279
You know what I mean, right?

00:22:28.279 --> 00:22:30.339
They really didn't want you to call them.

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:33.999
That's not how God works.

00:22:35.339 --> 00:22:36.899
He says that He's a very present help

00:22:36.899 --> 00:22:38.059
in the time of trouble.

00:22:38.979 --> 00:22:39.819
That's our God.

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:43.619
Not only is He able, but He's available.

00:22:45.019 --> 00:22:50.019
And we find that sometimes we don't have what we need

00:22:51.019 --> 00:22:52.659
because we just don't ask for it.

00:22:53.859 --> 00:22:54.899
We need wisdom.

00:22:54.899 --> 00:22:59.139
Well, He said if any man lack, let him ask of God.

00:22:59.139 --> 00:23:00.639
We need strength.

00:23:02.139 --> 00:23:04.859
Nehemiah recognized we need strength,

00:23:04.859 --> 00:23:08.259
and he recognized who it was that could give the strength.

00:23:08.259 --> 00:23:13.259
Therefore, he says, oh God, strengthen my hands.

00:23:14.639 --> 00:23:17.379
Because of his recognition that it was God

00:23:17.379 --> 00:23:19.579
that was able to strengthen his hands,

00:23:19.659 --> 00:23:21.619
it leads to the request.

00:23:21.619 --> 00:23:23.299
He's never gonna make the request

00:23:23.299 --> 00:23:25.739
if he doesn't recognize that God can give it.

00:23:25.739 --> 00:23:27.179
He's never gonna make the request

00:23:27.179 --> 00:23:29.479
if he doesn't recognize that they need it.

00:23:30.699 --> 00:23:35.579
And we find here not only what he recognized,

00:23:35.579 --> 00:23:36.679
but what he requested.

00:23:36.679 --> 00:23:39.419
Notice with me number three this evening.

00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:41.259
Notice what Nehemiah received.

00:23:42.379 --> 00:23:44.179
Notice what Nehemiah received.

00:23:44.179 --> 00:23:47.579
The Bible tells us that God hears and answers prayer.

00:23:47.579 --> 00:23:50.059
We just read verses in the book of 1 John

00:23:50.059 --> 00:23:51.379
in the fifth chapter.

00:23:51.379 --> 00:23:53.299
And we can rejoice in knowing

00:23:53.299 --> 00:23:56.139
that as Nehemiah made this request,

00:23:56.139 --> 00:24:00.059
as he says, now therefore, oh God, strengthen my hands.

00:24:00.059 --> 00:24:02.499
I want you to understand that the attack of the enemy

00:24:02.499 --> 00:24:05.939
did not cease immediately following that prayer.

00:24:05.939 --> 00:24:09.959
In fact, the attack of the enemy became even more subtle

00:24:09.959 --> 00:24:13.939
as they tried to get Nehemiah to go into the holy place

00:24:13.939 --> 00:24:15.659
in the next following verses.

00:24:15.659 --> 00:24:18.819
It was a place in which Nehemiah was not permitted to go,

00:24:18.819 --> 00:24:20.259
and they invited him to go there,

00:24:20.259 --> 00:24:25.259
and the idea was to go there for protection.

00:24:26.579 --> 00:24:29.019
That's the subtlety of the enemy.

00:24:29.019 --> 00:24:31.699
And Nehemiah says this, I know that if I go there,

00:24:31.699 --> 00:24:33.859
these folks are hired servants,

00:24:33.859 --> 00:24:36.539
and they're gonna, the hired enemies,

00:24:36.539 --> 00:24:38.779
they're going to come, and they're going to try

00:24:38.779 --> 00:24:41.679
to bring an evil report against my name.

00:24:42.239 --> 00:24:47.239
But we come to verse number 15 and 16 of Nehemiah 6,

00:24:49.039 --> 00:24:51.139
and I want you to see what the Bible says.

00:24:52.399 --> 00:24:55.839
So the wall was finished.

00:24:56.839 --> 00:24:58.679
Underline that word, circle that word.

00:24:58.679 --> 00:25:02.919
Isn't it good to see the work completed?

00:25:02.919 --> 00:25:05.439
What was the desire of the enemy?

00:25:05.439 --> 00:25:07.799
Well, that their hands should be weakened from the work,

00:25:07.799 --> 00:25:11.239
that it be not done.

00:25:11.839 --> 00:25:15.559
And we read verse number 15, so the wall was finished

00:25:15.559 --> 00:25:18.759
in the 20 and fifth day of the month, Elul,

00:25:18.759 --> 00:25:21.799
in 52 days, and I want you to think about that,

00:25:21.799 --> 00:25:23.799
52 days, that's a long period of time.

00:25:26.199 --> 00:25:28.959
We do manual labor for 52 minutes,

00:25:28.959 --> 00:25:30.479
ready for a break, amen?

00:25:32.879 --> 00:25:35.999
But you understand what I'm saying, 52 days is a long time.

00:25:35.999 --> 00:25:37.719
The Bible tells us in the fourth chapter of the book

00:25:37.719 --> 00:25:39.439
of Nehemiah, in verse number 17,

00:25:39.439 --> 00:25:42.839
that everyone with one of his hands wrought in the work

00:25:42.839 --> 00:25:45.639
and with the other hand held a weapon.

00:25:45.639 --> 00:25:47.719
Why, because of the enemy and the attack.

00:25:47.719 --> 00:25:49.759
So they're trying to work, Armando,

00:25:49.759 --> 00:25:51.199
it's not like when you're trying to work

00:25:51.199 --> 00:25:53.639
and you can be fully attentive to what's taking place.

00:25:53.639 --> 00:25:55.759
If you're fully attentive, this guy's trying to,

00:25:55.759 --> 00:25:57.439
no, no, no, they gotta do the work

00:25:57.439 --> 00:25:58.659
and they gotta watch for the enemy.

00:25:58.659 --> 00:26:01.119
Hold a weapon and hold a trowel, right?

00:26:01.119 --> 00:26:02.559
And do the work.

00:26:04.679 --> 00:26:07.099
Man, 52 days, it's a long time.

00:26:07.939 --> 00:26:11.779
But the Bible says that the wall was finished.

00:26:13.299 --> 00:26:15.939
Notice in verse number 16, it says,

00:26:15.939 --> 00:26:19.859
and it came to pass that when all our enemies heard thereof

00:26:19.859 --> 00:26:23.499
and all the heathen that were about us saw these things,

00:26:23.499 --> 00:26:27.819
they were much cast down in their own eyes.

00:26:27.819 --> 00:26:30.499
And then notice the statement at the end of verse number 16,

00:26:30.499 --> 00:26:35.499
for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.

00:26:38.019 --> 00:26:39.619
That's glorious.

00:26:40.579 --> 00:26:45.139
That even the opposition recognized the enemies,

00:26:45.139 --> 00:26:47.859
those that tried to cause the work to cease,

00:26:47.859 --> 00:26:50.939
even those individuals, when they saw what was accomplished,

00:26:50.939 --> 00:26:54.459
they recognized that this was a work

00:26:54.459 --> 00:26:56.959
that was wrought of our God.

00:26:58.459 --> 00:26:59.939
I'm gonna come back to Nehemiah,

00:26:59.939 --> 00:27:02.239
but I want you to consider what the Bible says

00:27:02.239 --> 00:27:03.079
in the book of Acts.

00:27:03.079 --> 00:27:05.339
If you wanna hold your place there in the book of Nehemiah

00:27:05.339 --> 00:27:07.299
and turn to the book of Acts, if you will.

00:27:07.299 --> 00:27:09.499
And as we go to the book of Acts in the fifth chapter,

00:27:09.499 --> 00:27:11.499
and I want you to see what the disciples are doing

00:27:11.499 --> 00:27:13.139
as they're seeking to fulfill the work

00:27:13.139 --> 00:27:14.899
that God has given them to do.

00:27:14.899 --> 00:27:18.399
And we find that the disciples at this particular time

00:27:18.399 --> 00:27:19.239
in the book of Acts,

00:27:19.239 --> 00:27:21.459
they're faced with some great difficulties.

00:27:21.459 --> 00:27:23.459
They've been threatened, they've been beaten,

00:27:23.459 --> 00:27:25.819
they've suffered some adversity.

00:27:25.819 --> 00:27:29.639
They understood, however, what God has called them to do.

00:27:29.639 --> 00:27:32.679
We find that it's in this chapter in Acts chapter number five

00:27:32.679 --> 00:27:34.599
when they're standing before the religious leaders

00:27:34.639 --> 00:27:38.999
that they say, we ought to obey God rather than men.

00:27:38.999 --> 00:27:41.919
And we find that as the work is taking place

00:27:41.919 --> 00:27:44.479
and as they testify that we are His witnesses

00:27:44.479 --> 00:27:47.319
of these things and they go through this whole process,

00:27:47.319 --> 00:27:49.359
we find that we come to verse number 36

00:27:49.359 --> 00:27:50.679
at the end of Acts five.

00:27:50.679 --> 00:27:53.179
And the Bible says, for before these days,

00:27:53.179 --> 00:27:55.639
let me back up to verse number 34.

00:27:55.639 --> 00:27:58.239
It says, then stood there up one in the council,

00:27:58.239 --> 00:28:01.359
a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law,

00:28:01.359 --> 00:28:03.919
had in reputation among all the people

00:28:03.959 --> 00:28:07.079
and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space.

00:28:07.079 --> 00:28:08.279
He's going to take the floor,

00:28:08.279 --> 00:28:10.999
he's going to give his counsel.

00:28:10.999 --> 00:28:13.199
It says in verse number 35, and he said unto them,

00:28:13.199 --> 00:28:15.519
ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves

00:28:15.519 --> 00:28:18.439
what ye intend to do as touching these men.

00:28:19.799 --> 00:28:22.719
For before these days rose up Thudas.

00:28:22.719 --> 00:28:26.239
Notice what the Bible says about Thudas in verse number 36,

00:28:26.239 --> 00:28:29.959
boasting himself to be somebody.

00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:35.799
I'm a nobody, so are you.

00:28:37.679 --> 00:28:41.239
Saved by the power of God Almighty

00:28:41.239 --> 00:28:45.599
and given a work to do for God Almighty.

00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:47.279
But this fellow Thudas,

00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:50.319
he was boasting himself to be somebody.

00:28:50.319 --> 00:28:52.919
And it says this, to whom a number of men,

00:28:52.919 --> 00:28:55.679
about 400 joined themselves.

00:28:55.679 --> 00:28:57.039
That's a pretty good crowd.

00:28:57.959 --> 00:28:59.959
400 people, that's a pretty good crowd.

00:29:01.079 --> 00:29:02.679
It says, who was slain and all,

00:29:02.679 --> 00:29:05.439
as many as obeyed him, were scattered.

00:29:05.439 --> 00:29:09.639
And notice this last phrase, and brought to naught.

00:29:10.599 --> 00:29:14.799
37, after this man rose up Judas of Galilee

00:29:14.799 --> 00:29:16.519
in the days of the taxing

00:29:16.519 --> 00:29:18.679
and drew away much people after him.

00:29:18.679 --> 00:29:20.399
He doesn't give us the number there.

00:29:20.399 --> 00:29:22.239
And it says, he also perished and all,

00:29:22.239 --> 00:29:25.599
even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.

00:29:27.519 --> 00:29:29.079
And now I say unto you,

00:29:29.959 --> 00:29:32.839
refrain from these men and let them alone.

00:29:33.719 --> 00:29:36.999
For this counsel or this work be of men,

00:29:38.199 --> 00:29:41.199
it will come to naught.

00:29:42.279 --> 00:29:44.799
Listen, if we were just here for our own name,

00:29:44.799 --> 00:29:45.999
we're wasting our time.

00:29:47.559 --> 00:29:50.359
Honestly, we're wasting our time.

00:29:52.319 --> 00:29:55.119
But it says this in verse 39,

00:29:55.199 --> 00:29:59.439
but if it be of God,

00:30:00.719 --> 00:30:01.559
ye can.

00:30:01.559 --> 00:30:07.039
You cannot, maybe you need to underline that word, circle it.

00:30:07.039 --> 00:30:12.319
You cannot overthrow it.

00:30:12.319 --> 00:30:14.559
What's it? The work.

00:30:14.559 --> 00:30:16.159
If it's of God.

00:30:16.159 --> 00:30:23.279
Lest happily ye be found even to fight against God.

00:30:23.279 --> 00:30:26.799
Listen, this work that was being done by Nehemiah,

00:30:26.799 --> 00:30:30.359
those that are made mention in chapter number three of the book of Nehemiah,

00:30:30.359 --> 00:30:34.759
this was a work of God. This was a great work. Why? Because it was God's work.

00:30:34.759 --> 00:30:37.879
Again, any work for God is a great work.

00:30:37.879 --> 00:30:40.519
There's no small work in God's economy.

00:30:40.519 --> 00:30:43.439
He's a great God. He's King of kings and Lord of lords.

00:30:43.439 --> 00:30:48.079
And anything, everything that we do for Him is a great thing.

00:30:48.079 --> 00:30:49.719
By the way, it ought to be done with first class.

00:30:49.719 --> 00:30:52.519
It ought to be done to the best of our ability.

00:30:52.519 --> 00:30:54.119
Sometimes we use the phraseology,

00:30:54.119 --> 00:30:56.639
and I know we're in Northern Virginia, it's probably not popular,

00:30:56.639 --> 00:30:59.119
but I heard the phrase all throughout my career

00:30:59.119 --> 00:31:00.719
when I worked in the corporate world, people would say,

00:31:00.719 --> 00:31:02.439
well, it's good enough for government work.

00:31:02.439 --> 00:31:03.439
You ever hear that?

00:31:03.439 --> 00:31:06.599
And you hear that phraseology, see the guy in the Air Force,

00:31:06.599 --> 00:31:08.639
he's like, oh yeah, I know all about that.

00:31:08.639 --> 00:31:12.639
But the reality is that we've heard that phraseology.

00:31:12.639 --> 00:31:16.879
Listen, the work that we're doing is for God Almighty.

00:31:16.879 --> 00:31:22.479
We never, but never should mail it in, so to speak,

00:31:22.479 --> 00:31:25.319
because we're doing a work for God.

00:31:25.359 --> 00:31:29.639
And we recognize that this is a great work.

00:31:29.639 --> 00:31:32.599
I won't take you there, but in Psalm 109 and verse 27,

00:31:32.599 --> 00:31:35.439
the Bible speaks about how people would see

00:31:35.439 --> 00:31:38.839
that it was God that did the work.

00:31:38.839 --> 00:31:41.719
We find that that's exactly what the enemy recognized

00:31:41.719 --> 00:31:44.399
in Nehemiah 6 and verse number 16.

00:31:44.399 --> 00:31:45.719
Now, I want you to think about this.

00:31:45.719 --> 00:31:49.679
The Bible tells us as to the day in which the work was completed.

00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:51.719
In verse number 15 of Nehemiah 6,

00:31:51.719 --> 00:31:53.799
it tells us that the wall was finished

00:31:53.839 --> 00:31:55.839
on the 25th day of the month, Elul.

00:31:55.839 --> 00:32:00.279
Now, that's the sixth month in the Jewish calendar.

00:32:00.279 --> 00:32:02.039
And I want you to go forward, if you will,

00:32:02.039 --> 00:32:03.719
to chapter number eight,

00:32:03.719 --> 00:32:05.599
and we're gonna just kind of pick it up right here

00:32:05.599 --> 00:32:07.799
in the beginning of chapter number eight.

00:32:07.799 --> 00:32:09.319
And I want you to see what the Bible says.

00:32:09.319 --> 00:32:11.839
And all the people gathered themselves together as one man

00:32:11.839 --> 00:32:13.159
in verse number one into the street

00:32:13.159 --> 00:32:14.559
that was before the water gate.

00:32:14.559 --> 00:32:16.479
And they spake unto Ezra the scribe

00:32:16.479 --> 00:32:18.599
to bring the book of the law of Moses,

00:32:18.599 --> 00:32:20.719
which the Lord had commanded to Israel.

00:32:20.719 --> 00:32:23.679
And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation,

00:32:23.679 --> 00:32:24.999
both of men and women,

00:32:24.999 --> 00:32:26.799
and all that could hear with understanding.

00:32:26.799 --> 00:32:28.999
Notice what the Bible says at the end of verse number two,

00:32:28.999 --> 00:32:33.719
upon the first day of the seventh month.

00:32:33.719 --> 00:32:36.199
Now, the wall was finished in 52 days.

00:32:36.199 --> 00:32:40.839
It was finished on the 25th day of the sixth month.

00:32:40.839 --> 00:32:42.319
And now in chapter number eight,

00:32:42.319 --> 00:32:45.879
we're on the first day of the seventh month.

00:32:45.879 --> 00:32:47.959
Now, there are some Bible scholars

00:32:47.959 --> 00:32:50.319
that have tried to put specific dates

00:32:50.319 --> 00:32:53.359
and using our calendar method,

00:32:54.039 --> 00:32:55.479
and they've used these dates to say

00:32:55.479 --> 00:32:57.159
that the wall was completed,

00:32:57.159 --> 00:32:59.239
according to Nehemiah chapter six,

00:32:59.239 --> 00:33:01.919
on what they would say would be the 21st day

00:33:01.919 --> 00:33:03.359
of the month of September,

00:33:03.359 --> 00:33:08.359
a calendar that we'd be recognizing in the year 444 BC.

00:33:09.919 --> 00:33:11.879
And now in chapter number eight,

00:33:11.879 --> 00:33:16.879
we're on the 27th day of September in the year 444.

00:33:17.639 --> 00:33:22.479
So there's just six days, just six days.

00:33:22.479 --> 00:33:25.719
And I want you to notice that they're gathered together

00:33:25.719 --> 00:33:27.199
upon the first day of the seventh month.

00:33:27.199 --> 00:33:28.719
And it says in verse number three,

00:33:28.719 --> 00:33:30.799
and he read therein before the street

00:33:30.799 --> 00:33:33.799
that was before the water gate from the morning

00:33:33.799 --> 00:33:36.119
until midday before the men and the women

00:33:36.119 --> 00:33:37.519
and those that could understand.

00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:39.639
In the years of all the people were attentive

00:33:39.639 --> 00:33:41.959
under the book of the law.

00:33:41.959 --> 00:33:45.439
Now remember, they were building a wall for 52 days.

00:33:46.839 --> 00:33:48.799
Hard labor work.

00:33:49.799 --> 00:33:50.919
The men of Judah said,

00:33:50.919 --> 00:33:55.319
hey, the strength of the bearers of burdens has decayed.

00:33:55.319 --> 00:33:56.439
It's been weakened.

00:33:56.439 --> 00:33:58.439
And Nehemiah in chapter number six says,

00:33:58.439 --> 00:34:00.719
oh God, strengthen my hands.

00:34:00.719 --> 00:34:02.359
And here we are six days later,

00:34:02.359 --> 00:34:04.479
and the Bible tells us in verse number four,

00:34:04.479 --> 00:34:07.239
and Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood,

00:34:07.239 --> 00:34:08.839
which they had made for the purpose.

00:34:08.839 --> 00:34:12.119
And beside him stood Mattathiah and Shema and Ananiah

00:34:12.119 --> 00:34:14.479
and Uriah and Hilkiah and Messiah.

00:34:14.479 --> 00:34:16.319
On his right hand and on his left hand,

00:34:16.319 --> 00:34:19.359
Hadaiah and Mishael and Malachiah and Hashem

00:34:19.359 --> 00:34:22.959
and Hashabadana, Zechariah and Meshulam.

00:34:22.959 --> 00:34:25.959
And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people

00:34:25.959 --> 00:34:27.279
for he was above all the people.

00:34:27.279 --> 00:34:29.599
And when he opened it, all the people stood up

00:34:29.599 --> 00:34:32.919
and Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God.

00:34:32.919 --> 00:34:35.959
And all the people answered, amen, amen.

00:34:35.959 --> 00:34:40.719
Notice the next phrase, with lifting up their hands.

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:45.439
And they bowed their heads and worshiped the Lord

00:34:45.439 --> 00:34:48.999
with their faces to the ground.

00:34:48.999 --> 00:34:52.679
The hands, the very hands that were strengthened

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:56.079
for the work that God had given them to accomplish

00:34:56.079 --> 00:35:00.559
are now being raised in extension of worship

00:35:00.559 --> 00:35:02.439
of our great God.

00:35:02.439 --> 00:35:04.079
Isn't that amazing?

00:35:04.079 --> 00:35:08.159
These hands that are growing weary because of the work,

00:35:08.159 --> 00:35:11.759
because of the labor, the hard labor that was required.

00:35:11.759 --> 00:35:14.879
One hand holding a weapon while one hand is working

00:35:15.279 --> 00:35:17.759
to build the wall and all that's taking place.

00:35:17.759 --> 00:35:20.999
And Nehemiah says, oh God, strengthen my hands

00:35:20.999 --> 00:35:22.799
and the work is accomplished.

00:35:22.799 --> 00:35:25.199
But then six days later, they're standing here

00:35:25.199 --> 00:35:26.599
and they're worshiping God.

00:35:26.599 --> 00:35:31.359
And the Bible says that they were lifting up those hands.

00:35:32.559 --> 00:35:34.039
That's encouraging to me.

00:35:35.159 --> 00:35:37.999
Because as their hands were strengthened

00:35:37.999 --> 00:35:41.599
for the work that God had given them to do,

00:35:41.599 --> 00:35:45.439
we find also that their hands were engaged

00:35:45.439 --> 00:35:50.439
in worshiping the God of heaven and how precious that is.

00:35:50.999 --> 00:35:54.159
This evening, I understand that as we look

00:35:54.159 --> 00:35:57.919
at the book of Nehemiah, we can see an Old Testament account

00:35:57.919 --> 00:36:01.439
of an actual physical work that they were called

00:36:01.439 --> 00:36:02.639
to accomplish.

00:36:03.599 --> 00:36:07.439
But this evening, we're not building a wall.

00:36:07.439 --> 00:36:09.159
We're certainly engaged in a work.

00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:13.239
As we're engaged in the work, it's a spiritual work.

00:36:14.079 --> 00:36:16.319
But we're human beings and we can grow weary.

00:36:17.679 --> 00:36:18.719
We can grow weary.

00:36:19.879 --> 00:36:21.439
I want you to notice what the Bible says

00:36:21.439 --> 00:36:23.559
in the book of Galatians in chapter number six.

00:36:23.559 --> 00:36:25.559
We'll look at a couple of New Testament passages

00:36:25.559 --> 00:36:27.399
and close this evening.

00:36:27.399 --> 00:36:29.639
But notice in Galatians chapter number six.

00:36:30.639 --> 00:36:33.639
Galatians chapter number six in verse number nine.

00:36:35.639 --> 00:36:36.479
The Bible says,

00:36:36.479 --> 00:36:41.479
and let us not be weary in well-doing,

00:36:42.159 --> 00:36:46.119
for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.

00:36:47.199 --> 00:36:49.959
In 2 Thessalonians chapter number three,

00:36:49.959 --> 00:36:52.559
in verse number 13, I want you to notice

00:36:52.559 --> 00:36:55.399
that we are not weary in well-doing.

00:36:55.399 --> 00:36:57.639
We are not weary in well-doing.

00:36:57.639 --> 00:37:00.279
In verse number 13, I want you to notice

00:37:00.279 --> 00:37:04.519
another admonition that is given to the people of God.

00:37:06.399 --> 00:37:10.959
Paul says in closing to the church at Thessalonica

00:37:10.959 --> 00:37:13.799
in verse number 13 of 2 Thessalonians three,

00:37:13.799 --> 00:37:18.799
but ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.

00:37:19.919 --> 00:37:21.759
You know what that word weary means?

00:37:21.759 --> 00:37:22.999
It means to be exhausted.

00:37:24.479 --> 00:37:25.879
It also carries with it this idea

00:37:25.919 --> 00:37:29.399
of being utterly spiritless,

00:37:29.399 --> 00:37:31.999
just being exhausted, being weary.

00:37:33.319 --> 00:37:37.679
But God says, be not weary in well-doing.

00:37:38.759 --> 00:37:43.359
Paul is the human penman as he's writing

00:37:43.359 --> 00:37:45.679
to the churches in the region of Galatia,

00:37:45.679 --> 00:37:48.119
as he's writing now to the church in Thessalonica,

00:37:48.119 --> 00:37:51.439
and God is using him to say to the people of God,

00:37:51.439 --> 00:37:54.679
be not weary in well-doing.

00:37:54.679 --> 00:37:57.999
You say, but the work that we're doing, it's exhausting.

00:37:59.359 --> 00:38:00.799
There is an aspect of that.

00:38:02.679 --> 00:38:05.479
But I want you to notice what Paul's testimony is.

00:38:05.479 --> 00:38:07.319
Turn to the book of 2 Timothy, if you will.

00:38:07.319 --> 00:38:09.839
Just keep on going in the New Testament.

00:38:09.839 --> 00:38:11.839
Look at 2 Timothy chapter number four.

00:38:14.039 --> 00:38:17.359
Of course, many of you would know that 2 Timothy,

00:38:17.359 --> 00:38:20.239
Paul is writing, understanding that the time

00:38:20.239 --> 00:38:21.759
of his departure was at hand.

00:38:21.759 --> 00:38:24.919
He says in verse six, I am now ready to be offered.

00:38:24.919 --> 00:38:26.559
The time of my departure is at hand.

00:38:26.559 --> 00:38:27.479
I fought a good fight.

00:38:27.479 --> 00:38:28.399
I finished my course.

00:38:28.399 --> 00:38:29.399
I have kept the faith.

00:38:29.399 --> 00:38:32.039
And Paul is nearing the end of his human life.

00:38:32.039 --> 00:38:35.959
His race is about to be completed.

00:38:37.239 --> 00:38:39.639
And he's seeking to encourage Timothy,

00:38:39.639 --> 00:38:41.119
his son in the faith.

00:38:41.999 --> 00:38:44.599
And I want you to notice the testimony of Paul

00:38:44.599 --> 00:38:47.639
after he mentions several people by name.

00:38:47.639 --> 00:38:49.959
He then says this in verse number 17,

00:38:49.959 --> 00:38:54.319
notwithstanding the Lord stood with me,

00:38:54.319 --> 00:38:55.839
and then notice these words,

00:38:55.839 --> 00:38:59.159
and strengthened me.

00:39:01.119 --> 00:39:04.519
The Lord stood with me and strengthened me

00:39:04.519 --> 00:39:07.079
that by me the preaching might be fully known

00:39:07.079 --> 00:39:09.079
and that all the Gentiles might hear.

00:39:09.079 --> 00:39:13.279
And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

00:39:14.439 --> 00:39:17.559
And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work

00:39:17.559 --> 00:39:20.639
and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom

00:39:20.639 --> 00:39:23.319
to whom be glory forever and ever.

00:39:23.319 --> 00:39:24.359
Amen.

00:39:24.359 --> 00:39:27.439
Listen, God is no respecter of persons.

00:39:27.439 --> 00:39:28.279
Amen.

00:39:28.279 --> 00:39:29.519
We believe that this evening.

00:39:29.519 --> 00:39:33.159
The Bible declares that our God is no respecter of persons.

00:39:33.159 --> 00:39:36.919
And we find that as Paul would give testimony here

00:39:36.919 --> 00:39:38.119
in the book of second Timothy,

00:39:38.119 --> 00:39:40.599
that the Lord stood with me and the Lord strengthened me.

00:39:40.599 --> 00:39:43.119
And we could think about the life and ministry

00:39:43.119 --> 00:39:44.079
of the apostle Paul,

00:39:44.079 --> 00:39:46.399
and we could understand some of the hardships

00:39:46.439 --> 00:39:48.359
in which he endured and some of the opposition

00:39:48.359 --> 00:39:49.359
in which he dealt with.

00:39:49.359 --> 00:39:51.119
And we can understand the timing.

00:39:51.119 --> 00:39:54.519
Listen, his travels were different than our travels.

00:39:54.519 --> 00:39:57.599
The ease of communication and transportation

00:39:57.599 --> 00:40:00.039
that we have today vary greatly

00:40:00.039 --> 00:40:01.879
from what Paul had to endure.

00:40:01.879 --> 00:40:06.439
endure an encounter.

00:40:06.439 --> 00:40:13.279
So often I wonder how the past generation got so much done.

00:40:13.279 --> 00:40:19.399
Do you ever wonder that?

00:40:19.399 --> 00:40:27.199
We have so many modern conveniences today, but it seems like we get so little done.

00:40:27.199 --> 00:40:29.919
I'm speaking for myself.

00:40:29.919 --> 00:40:32.679
How many of you have ever used a concordance?

00:40:32.679 --> 00:40:35.959
Use a concordance, right?

00:40:35.959 --> 00:40:38.839
I don't know how you use a concordance, but I'm lazy.

00:40:38.839 --> 00:40:40.359
I don't use the book anymore.

00:40:40.359 --> 00:40:41.359
Why?

00:40:41.359 --> 00:40:44.519
Because it's on my computer.

00:40:44.519 --> 00:40:48.359
I'm just being honest with you, because if I had to go over to my bookshelf and get the

00:40:48.359 --> 00:40:52.799
strong concordance or the young concordance off my bookshelf, then I have to turn and

00:40:52.799 --> 00:40:58.039
find it and search through, but I can just sit down at my desk and I can just do-do-do

00:40:58.039 --> 00:40:59.039
and bam, it comes up.

00:40:59.039 --> 00:41:01.399
Have any of you used it on a computer?

00:41:01.399 --> 00:41:05.039
I got it on my phone, actually.

00:41:05.039 --> 00:41:15.839
But you know that those guys took a Bible and word by word organized it into a concordance.

00:41:15.839 --> 00:41:20.039
Every place you find the word fear, faith, fill in it, whatever, peace, I mean, you just

00:41:20.039 --> 00:41:24.359
fill in every word, and they went through.

00:41:24.359 --> 00:41:30.119
Can you imagine how much time that would take?

00:41:30.119 --> 00:41:34.479
Without the computer technology that we have today and all of the modern conveniences,

00:41:34.479 --> 00:41:37.879
it would make your head explode.

00:41:37.879 --> 00:41:39.599
Seriously.

00:41:39.599 --> 00:41:43.479
There's a fella, Kimberly, you know him, Scotty Bockhouse, right?

00:41:43.479 --> 00:41:50.239
I don't know if I said his last name properly, but he's a pastor, and he helped work on the

00:41:50.239 --> 00:41:52.679
Bible.

00:41:52.679 --> 00:41:54.959
Some of you have read it, the chronological Bible.

00:41:54.959 --> 00:42:00.359
I think it's the Reese Chronological Bible, and Scotty Bockhouse was helping as Mr. Reese

00:42:00.359 --> 00:42:04.239
was going home to be with the Lord and what have you, and so he's made another revision

00:42:04.239 --> 00:42:07.799
to it and changed some things around, but I met Scotty several years ago.

00:42:07.799 --> 00:42:14.199
I pray for him weekly, and as I met him and we began to talk about how this chronological

00:42:14.199 --> 00:42:15.799
Bible was put together.

00:42:15.799 --> 00:42:18.719
Have any of you ever read a chronological Bible?

00:42:18.719 --> 00:42:22.039
It takes the Bible, and it puts it in chronological order.

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:25.519
You understand that the Bible you hold in your hand tonight is not in chronological

00:42:25.519 --> 00:42:26.519
order.

00:42:26.519 --> 00:42:30.119
It's not, but we find that these, you know how this man did it?

00:42:30.119 --> 00:42:32.919
I don't know, Kimberly, if Scotty ever told you the testimony.

00:42:32.919 --> 00:42:37.319
He took a Bible, and he took manila folders.

00:42:37.319 --> 00:42:38.759
I don't like manila folders.

00:42:38.759 --> 00:42:39.759
Lenna knows that.

00:42:39.759 --> 00:42:40.759
I don't like them.

00:42:40.759 --> 00:42:41.759
Drive me crazy.

00:42:41.759 --> 00:42:45.919
I got a bunch of them, but they drive me crazy, and he would cut the manila folder in half

00:42:45.999 --> 00:42:51.519
so they'd have two pieces, and he would take the Bible, and as he read the Bible, he would

00:42:51.519 --> 00:42:58.279
take a pen knife, and he would cut up the pages of Scripture, and he would paste them

00:42:58.279 --> 00:43:04.279
onto those manila folders in a chronological sequence.

00:43:04.279 --> 00:43:05.679
Can you imagine that?

00:43:05.679 --> 00:43:15.079
That makes my head explode, seriously, because of the technology that we have.

00:43:15.079 --> 00:43:17.239
Think about the first century church.

00:43:17.239 --> 00:43:18.799
They filled Jerusalem with their doctrine.

00:43:18.799 --> 00:43:21.999
They turned the world upside down.

00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:29.599
We've been given so many conveniences, and we have God's power available to us for the

00:43:29.599 --> 00:43:37.159
work that He's called us to do, and yet at times it seems like we get so much less accomplished

00:43:37.159 --> 00:43:43.399
than what they got accomplished, 52 days.

00:43:43.399 --> 00:43:48.319
When you notice the response of the enemies, this is not humanly possible.

00:43:48.319 --> 00:43:53.599
This is a work of God, but it was the men that did it.

00:43:53.599 --> 00:43:54.639
They saw them.

00:43:54.639 --> 00:44:00.519
They observed what happened, and we find this evening that when we look and we understand,

00:44:00.519 --> 00:44:07.359
and maybe it's a matter of perspective, that the perspective that Nehemiah had, all of

00:44:07.359 --> 00:44:12.399
those things that we looked at in the first point this evening, what he recognized, God

00:44:12.399 --> 00:44:16.679
put a work in my heart.

00:44:16.679 --> 00:44:19.199
The report was accurate.

00:44:19.199 --> 00:44:22.359
God's hand is upon me.

00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:24.959
God is the one that has all power.

00:44:24.959 --> 00:44:32.799
You go through all of that list, and you recognize that Nehemiah said, God has a work for me

00:44:32.799 --> 00:44:39.499
to do, and it caused him to be laser-focused on doing what God called him to do.

00:44:39.499 --> 00:44:41.159
But my strength is failing.

00:44:41.159 --> 00:44:46.679
And I go to the God that is the Lord God omnipotent, and I say, God, strengthen, strengthen

00:44:46.679 --> 00:44:51.399
my hands, for this is a great work, and it's your work.

00:44:51.399 --> 00:44:55.419
And this evening, each of us have a work to do.

00:44:55.419 --> 00:44:56.599
We need God's strength.

00:44:56.599 --> 00:45:03.519
Oh, there's opposition, there's adversity, but the reality is that we can grow weary.

00:45:03.519 --> 00:45:09.159
And Paul says, the Lord stood with me, and He strengthened me, and He'll strengthen you

00:45:09.159 --> 00:45:10.839
as well.

00:45:10.839 --> 00:45:18.199
This evening, Nehemiah simply prayed, oh God, strengthen my hands.

00:45:18.199 --> 00:45:20.619
Father, we love You.

00:45:20.619 --> 00:45:23.339
We thank You for loving us.

00:45:23.339 --> 00:45:25.179
We thank You for the Word of God.

00:45:25.179 --> 00:45:29.599
We thank You for the testimony and the example of Nehemiah.

00:45:29.599 --> 00:45:37.759
And God, I pray that You would help us this evening, each of us, individually, to recognize

00:45:37.759 --> 00:45:40.599
that You've given us a work to do.

00:45:40.599 --> 00:45:43.999
God, that we'd recognize it's Your work.

00:45:43.999 --> 00:45:50.159
It's a great work, because it's Your work.

00:45:50.159 --> 00:45:53.559
We know that the enemy wants to weaken our hands so that the work is not accomplished

00:45:53.559 --> 00:45:55.559
or fulfilled.

00:45:55.559 --> 00:46:01.359
But God, You are the Lord God omnipotent.

00:46:01.359 --> 00:46:04.879
You've strengthened those that have gone before us.

00:46:04.999 --> 00:46:15.199
God, we pray this evening that in that time of weakness, that time when we may grow weary,

00:46:15.199 --> 00:46:20.159
that we would acknowledge our need and that we would simply request, as Nehemiah did,

00:46:20.159 --> 00:46:21.559
for strength.

00:46:21.559 --> 00:46:30.439
God, strengthen us, help us to complete, to fulfill what You've given us to do.

00:46:30.439 --> 00:46:35.339
I pray that in these moments of invitation, the Holy Spirit of God would use the Word

00:46:35.339 --> 00:46:42.639
of God, the hearts of Your people, Lord, to encourage us and to challenge us.

00:46:42.639 --> 00:46:46.519
And we'll thank You for the work that's accomplished, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:46:46.519 --> 00:46:47.519
Would You say, Amen?

00:46:47.519 --> 00:46:47.519
