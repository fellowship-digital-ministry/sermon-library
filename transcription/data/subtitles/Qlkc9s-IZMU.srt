1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
Hallelujah, Jesus ransomed me.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,420
Why?

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,179
All are welcome.

4
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:08,619
You know, there's some people that we know,

5
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:11,460
there's some people that I know that you know personally

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,779
that could not sing this morning,

7
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:16,299
when the roll is caught up yonder, I'll be there.

8
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:17,139
They don't know.

9
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:20,620
There's some people that you know that I know

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,059
that can't say, Jesus ransomed me.

11
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:26,180
I don't even know what it means.

12
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,819
But all are welcome.

13
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:31,819
We have a great responsibility to tell them

14
00:00:31,819 --> 00:00:36,819
of this wonderful, wonderful truth that Jesus saves.

15
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,119
And so thankful for those songs this morning.

16
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:42,220
First John chapter number five,

17
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,459
we'll be looking at verses six through 13.

18
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:48,419
The title for the message, the witness of God is greater.

19
00:00:48,419 --> 00:00:51,000
And we'll see that statement in our text of scripture

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,459
as we come to the word of God

21
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:54,500
and we come to this passage of scripture.

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,939
Of course, all year I've been preaching on Sunday mornings.

23
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:58,139
We've taken some weeks off,

24
00:00:58,139 --> 00:01:00,860
but we've been preaching through the book of First John

25
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,979
and we're nearing the end

26
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,699
as we are nearing the end of a calendar year.

27
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:08,379
And we have made it through thus far.

28
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:10,379
But I want you to be mindful this morning

29
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:12,779
of the fact of just thanking God

30
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:16,660
and having appreciation for what God has given us

31
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,940
and allowing us to have the word of God.

32
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,419
I believe that if we're not careful,

33
00:01:20,419 --> 00:01:21,980
there are times in our lives

34
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,220
that we can take things for granted.

35
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,220
And if we're not careful,

36
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,959
when we take those things for granted,

37
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,839
we lack appreciation for those things.

38
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:32,720
And we're gonna take things for granted.

39
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,360
We take for granted, if we're not careful,

40
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,779
the fact that God has given us a Bible,

41
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:41,260
that God has given us a church

42
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,720
where the Bible is faithfully preached.

43
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,160
And we can take those things for granted week after week,

44
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,739
day after day in our lives.

45
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:50,519
And we can, if we're not careful,

46
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,480
have a diminished appreciation for what God has given us.

47
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,040
But I believe this morning

48
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,919
that as we understand the truth of the gospel,

49
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:03,279
as we understand the truth about who Jesus is

50
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:06,099
and about the plan of salvation,

51
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:09,839
we get to hear it so often and so regularly.

52
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:13,279
But I hope that it never loses

53
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:16,679
that impact in your life and in my life

54
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:20,520
when we hear the wonderful truth that Jesus saved,

55
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,240
that it continues to impact our lives,

56
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,039
that we, maybe I'll say it this way,

57
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:26,800
that we never get over it

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,639
and that we constantly live in a state of appreciation

59
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,500
for what God has done for us.

60
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,320
As we go to the book of 1 John,

61
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,759
as we've studied through this book,

62
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:39,639
there are several verses in the book of 1 John

63
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,919
that are very well known.

64
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,800
Could be argued as to which verses

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,559
are more well known than others.

66
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:48,399
But I would say this morning

67
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:52,440
that 1 John 5.13 definitely stands at the,

68
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,000
finds its place in the list of the most commonly known,

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,759
referenced verses in the book of 1 John.

70
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,759
It may not be at the top of the list,

71
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,360
but it certainly would find itself on the list

72
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,119
of the most known verses in the book of 1 John.

73
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:10,240
And the Bible says this in verse 13,

74
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,800
these things have I written unto you

75
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,279
that believe on the name of the Son of God,

76
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,199
that you may know that you have eternal life

77
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:21,039
and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.

78
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,759
As we think about this verse of scripture

79
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,779
and we think about the security of the believer,

80
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:28,080
how thankful I am for this truth of this verse.

81
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,559
And no doubt when it says these things

82
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:32,119
have I written unto you,

83
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:35,119
that it would really capture the entirety

84
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:36,839
of the book of 1 John.

85
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:38,520
But this morning, we're going to look

86
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,520
at the immediate context of what John is writing

87
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,800
when he speaks about these things

88
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,419
within the immediate context.

89
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:49,460
Of course, broadly speaking,

90
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,240
it's the entirety of the book of 1 John.

91
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,979
But as we look at this text of scripture this morning,

92
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:56,860
we find that the Bible tells us,

93
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,580
notice in verse number nine,

94
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,660
if we receive the witness of men,

95
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,899
then notice the statement,

96
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:04,960
the witness of God is greater,

97
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,660
for this is the witness of God,

98
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,660
which he hath testified of his son.

99
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,800
And we'll look at the entirety of the passage,

100
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,460
but I want you to be aware of the fact this morning

101
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,779
that the witness of God is greater.

102
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:19,980
And I'm so thankful that God has given us

103
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,899
this record or this witness.

104
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,220
We'll see that both of those terms are used

105
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,019
throughout these verses of scripture

106
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:27,619
about the record that's been given,

107
00:04:27,619 --> 00:04:29,540
the witness that has been provided.

108
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,679
And I'm so thankful to have the truth

109
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:34,220
of the Word of God.

110
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,739
If you're taking notes this morning,

111
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:37,019
notice first of all with me,

112
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:39,299
the record delivered.

113
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:40,459
The record delivered.

114
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:42,179
Begin reading with me in verse number six.

115
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:43,959
Notice what the Bible says.

116
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:47,880
This is He that came by water and blood,

117
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,880
even Jesus Christ.

118
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,679
Not by water only,

119
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,559
but by water and blood.

120
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,839
And it is the Spirit that beareth witness,

121
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,040
because the Spirit is truth.

122
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,839
For there are three that bear record in heaven,

123
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,440
the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost.

124
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,320
And these three are one.

125
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,640
Verse eight, there are three that bear witness in earth,

126
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,920
the Spirit, and the water, and the blood,

127
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,239
and these three agree in one.

128
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:19,119
As we begin to look at these verses of scripture

129
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:21,799
and understand the record has been delivered,

130
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:23,359
we ought to just pause right there

131
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:25,760
and say hallelujah that He's given us a record

132
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,019
that He's provided us with this witness

133
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:29,320
and it's been delivered.

134
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,880
As we begin to think about the record

135
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,059
that's been delivered,

136
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:34,100
there are a couple of things that I understand

137
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,480
in this passage of scripture

138
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,660
that are important for us to recognize this morning.

139
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,040
And number one is this,

140
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,440
the record that's been delivered is reliable.

141
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,679
It's reliable.

142
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,160
Aren't you thankful for that?

143
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,220
I don't want a record that is not trustworthy.

144
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,600
I don't want a record that is not reliable,

145
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,660
something that I can't trust, that I cannot depend on.

146
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,920
But when we look at the record that's been delivered,

147
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,959
as John is writing here to these believers,

148
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:03,480
he says to them, and we find by way of preservation

149
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,959
that God is saying to us

150
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,959
that the record that's been delivered is reliable.

151
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,160
It is trustworthy.

152
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,079
It is something that we stake our eternity on

153
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,839
and we ought to rejoice this morning

154
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:17,839
that we have a reliable record.

155
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:20,399
Notice what the Bible says about this record.

156
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,000
The Bible says in verse number six,

157
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,839
this is He that came by water and blood,

158
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,279
even Jesus Christ.

159
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:30,399
Notice, not by water only, but by water and blood.

160
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,399
And then it says this, and it is the Spirit.

161
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,880
That's a capital S.

162
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,980
Who's it referring to?

163
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,040
It's referring to the Holy Spirit or the Holy Ghost.

164
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,480
And it says the Spirit that beareth witness.

165
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,399
I'm thankful that the Spirit of God,

166
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:47,440
the Holy Ghost, bears witness.

167
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,239
And I'm thankful that because the Holy Spirit is,

168
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:52,559
when we think about the Trinity,

169
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:56,040
the third person of the Godhead, the Holy Ghost,

170
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,700
and the witness that He gives is reliable,

171
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,700
notice what it says, because the Spirit is truth.

172
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,540
There are so many people today

173
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,059
that are so confused about truth.

174
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:13,260
Can you know truth?

175
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,859
Is there truth?

176
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:16,820
They believe that truth is something

177
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,380
that would be described as being relative,

178
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,579
that it's your truth or their truth or my truth

179
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:24,059
or someone else's truth,

180
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:26,100
but I'm thankful that the Word of God

181
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,859
declares for us that the Spirit is truth.

182
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:31,420
And remember that Jesus Christ said this

183
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,619
in John 14 in verse number six,

184
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:38,500
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

185
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,899
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

186
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:43,380
What a great declaration.

187
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,739
We find that the Bible says in John 17,

188
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:47,380
sanctify them by thy Word.

189
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,899
Thy Word is truth.

190
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:54,559
We begin to think about the Spirit bearing witness

191
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:56,820
and the Spirit being defined here

192
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,739
as being the, because the Spirit is truth,

193
00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:04,100
because it is the Spirit that beareth witness

194
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,519
and because it is the Spirit that is truth,

195
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:10,019
then we know that this record that we have is reliable.

196
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:12,700
It is trustworthy, it's dependable.

197
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,179
Listen, I'm not interested in something

198
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:17,820
that's just potentially reliable.

199
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,339
I'm not interested in something

200
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:21,540
that has holes and has problems.

201
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,019
I'm thankful that God said that every Word of God is pure

202
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:27,540
and that He's given us a perfect book

203
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:30,980
and He's given it to us and He's preserved it for us.

204
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,739
And we understand as we look at the passage of Scripture

205
00:08:33,739 --> 00:08:36,320
that there is unity and there is agreement

206
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,539
within the Godhead.

207
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,020
It tells us in verse number seven,

208
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,960
for there are three that bear record in heaven.

209
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,500
By the way, I'm thankful that at this time,

210
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,299
at the writing of the book of 1 John

211
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:48,219
and even now still at this moment,

212
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:50,219
that Jesus is in heaven.

213
00:08:50,219 --> 00:08:52,380
He's ascended up into heaven.

214
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,219
We see that the Bible speaks about these three

215
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:55,059
that bear record.

216
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:57,619
The Word, the Bible says this,

217
00:08:57,619 --> 00:08:59,419
the Father, the Word.

218
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:01,299
Who's the Word?

219
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:04,179
Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost.

220
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:07,119
And these three are one.

221
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:10,219
There is agreement, there is unity amongst the Trinity.

222
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:12,539
And we find that Jesus Himself,

223
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:15,619
after His ministry here upon this earth,

224
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:17,659
after His death and His burial

225
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:19,299
and His glorious resurrection

226
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:20,840
and He ministered for 40 days

227
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,659
and then He ascended up into heaven.

228
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:25,000
And the Bible tells us that He's at the right hand

229
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,320
of the throne of God

230
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,039
and that He ever liveth to make intercession for us.

231
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,159
He was dead, but now He's alive

232
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,760
and He's alive forevermore.

233
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,640
And the Bible tells us that He's coming again.

234
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,479
Oh, what a glorious truth.

235
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:39,919
He has a perfect plan.

236
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,159
We find that He's given us this record

237
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,359
and obviously we could understand

238
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:47,679
that as John is writing to these believers

239
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,919
and under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

240
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,599
He's writing this book of 1 John

241
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:54,599
and He says that the record's been delivered,

242
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,479
that the record is reliable,

243
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,280
but I would broaden it this morning

244
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,359
to say of the entirety of it.

245
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:02,659
of this book has been delivered.

246
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:05,379
The entirety of this book is reliable.

247
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:09,079
Listen, we don't look to try to prove the Bible

248
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:12,719
through science or archeology or any other thing.

249
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:15,379
We say, no, as those things are discovered,

250
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:17,479
as those things are understood,

251
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:21,959
the Bible gives credit to what they've determined.

252
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:22,799
Amen?

253
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,879
And we say the Bible is true.

254
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,439
It's reliable.

255
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:29,679
Notice, as John would write,

256
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,079
it's very interesting, remember,

257
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:34,279
that John is dealing with some false teachers

258
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,119
that would be prevalent.

259
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:37,039
In fact, as you study the New Testament,

260
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,079
you find that the Bible regularly speaks

261
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,839
about these false teachers.

262
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,499
Just as there were false prophets in the Old Testament,

263
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:45,719
there would be false teachers.

264
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:48,399
And we find that they're active and they're working.

265
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,059
And as we studied the book of Colossians last year,

266
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:53,479
we mentioned how that Paul was writing

267
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:55,799
and he was giving great truth

268
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:58,359
and trying to help these people understand

269
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:00,159
the error of the Gnostics

270
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,679
and understanding the truth of the word of God.

271
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,999
And we find that John is dealing with the same thing.

272
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:07,839
The Gnostics are still active and things are taking place.

273
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,399
And we find that he had mentioned in 1 John 4,

274
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,079
in verse number one,

275
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,279
beloved, believe not every spirit,

276
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,599
but try the spirits, whether they're of God,

277
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:20,959
because many false prophets are gone out into the world.

278
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,319
We find that these false teachers were active.

279
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:27,399
And one of the false teachers, an early Gnostic,

280
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:30,319
that was very active and it seems very evident

281
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:32,759
that John, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

282
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:36,239
is really dealing with one of the great errors of their way

283
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:40,279
in verse number six, was a guy by the name of Serenthes.

284
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,719
And Serenthes, the folks that would follow him

285
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,279
were Serenthenes, not to be confused with the Corinthians,

286
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:47,599
but the Serenthenes.

287
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:51,339
And he was an early Gnostic and he was teaching.

288
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:55,639
And really, as we've mentioned throughout the years,

289
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,079
and as we've looked specifically at 1 John

290
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,119
and chapter number four, we said this,

291
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,759
often as you look at the false teachers, what do they do?

292
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,639
They get it wrong on Jesus.

293
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,119
They get it wrong on Jesus.

294
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:09,279
Can I tell you today that people still

295
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,039
are getting it wrong on Jesus?

296
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:14,239
And if you got it wrong on who Jesus is,

297
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:17,599
there's no hope of eternity as far as salvation

298
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:20,119
and having a home in heaven.

299
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:23,039
We find that, listen, we just spent almost two weeks

300
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,479
in a land where Jesus walked, where Jesus ministered,

301
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,559
where Jesus proved his deity.

302
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,079
We're in various places and yet there are countless,

303
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,879
countless scores of people that are blinded

304
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,719
and they have it wrong about Jesus.

305
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:42,719
Broke my heart to see so many people that are so close,

306
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:48,679
but they're lost, but they're lost.

307
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,719
Agrippa said to Paul,

308
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:54,719
almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.

309
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:57,999
Almost isn't good enough, amen?

310
00:12:57,999 --> 00:12:59,879
And it's the person of Jesus.

311
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,679
And this man, Serenthes, how he got it wrong

312
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,759
and what he would teach is that he would teach

313
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:07,759
that the Christ, meaning Messiah,

314
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:10,599
see, he said that Jesus was just a man.

315
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:13,039
He did not understand the incarnation.

316
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,079
He did not understand the deity of Jesus Christ.

317
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,519
And he said this, that at the baptism of Jesus,

318
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,919
that that's when the Christ descended upon him.

319
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:25,279
And then prior to the crucifixion,

320
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,479
the Christ left him, departed him.

321
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:30,839
And so we find that John is saying this,

322
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,559
and you think about the earthly ministry

323
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,999
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

324
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:35,519
it was inaugurated when?

325
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,679
At the baptism.

326
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:39,759
By the way, John knew who he was.

327
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,399
John the Baptist understood who Jesus was.

328
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,399
John the Baptist felt unworthy to baptize Jesus.

329
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,319
He said, there's one that comes after me

330
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:51,519
that is preferred above me and before me.

331
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,399
He said this, I'm not worthy to unloose his sandals,

332
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,799
the latches of his shoes.

333
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,359
And we find that he, John the Baptist,

334
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:00,239
he was the forerunner.

335
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,599
He understood who Jesus was.

336
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:05,519
But Jesus at his baptism at Jordan,

337
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,319
God the Father said, this is my beloved son

338
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:10,879
in whom I am well pleased.

339
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:12,879
The inauguration of the earthly ministry

340
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,319
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

341
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:16,879
And you understand that he's always been God.

342
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:18,839
He left the throne room of heaven

343
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,279
and he came to this sin-cursed world.

344
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,399
And he's always been the God-man,

345
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:26,359
100% God and 100% man.

346
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:29,839
And we find that John is focusing here really

347
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,719
on dealing with the false teaching that's taking place.

348
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:36,599
And he's talking about the record of God being reliable.

349
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:37,839
He says, notice what he says,

350
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,279
this is he that came by water and blood even.

351
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,279
Notice what he says, Jesus Christ.

352
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,639
Why does every word of God is pure?

353
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:48,559
Why does he use the terminology that he does?

354
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,879
He doesn't just say that Jesus, he says Jesus Christ.

355
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:55,479
Remember when Paul was preaching in Thessalonica

356
00:14:55,479 --> 00:15:00,159
and he says, this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ.

357
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:02,359
They understood who the man Jesus was,

358
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,079
but he was making sure they understood

359
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,439
that he is the Messiah,

360
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:10,359
that his name, the Lord Jesus Christ.

361
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:12,919
We find that Jesus, of course,

362
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,639
hung upon that cruel cross.

363
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,759
By the way, he had to,

364
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:22,199
in order to fulfill the plan of redemption.

365
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,239
The plan of redemption that was determined

366
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:26,439
before the foundation of the world.

367
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:29,319
When you read the book of Ephesians in the first chapter,

368
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:33,719
you find that God has clearly communicated to his people

369
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:36,759
that the plan of redemption was determined

370
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,119
before the foundation of the world.

371
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:41,639
How would people be saved that Jesus

372
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,439
would come to this incursed world

373
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:45,279
and that he would die in our place?

374
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,159
He would take on himself the form of a man.

375
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:51,719
He would suffer, he'd bleed and die.

376
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:55,279
We find that here, John, no doubt,

377
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,559
is exposing the false teaching of Serenthes.

378
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,119
And we find that as he would expose that false teaching,

379
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:05,239
he's saying, listen, God has given us a record

380
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:08,159
and the record that God has given us is true.

381
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,639
It is reliable.

382
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:12,000
We find that it's the spirit of God,

383
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,679
the Holy Ghost that bears witness

384
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,959
and the spirit is truth.

385
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:19,359
Notice not only that the record has been delivered

386
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:20,799
and that the record is reliable,

387
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:23,399
but I'd say this, the record is available.

388
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:27,519
Aren't you thankful that the record is available?

389
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,719
You know, it's one thing to say the record's reliable,

390
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,559
but you know, it's just, we don't know where it is.

391
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,319
Well, that'd be tragic, wouldn't it?

392
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:38,719
But the record is not available.

393
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:41,959
But the record is not only reliable,

394
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,000
but the record is available.

395
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,719
I mean, you're holding it in your hands this morning.

396
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:48,959
You're holding in your hands

397
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,559
the record that has been delivered.

398
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:53,319
You're holding in your hands the record

399
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,439
that God is speaking of that God graciously gave,

400
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:59,479
but then providentially preserved the record

401
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:02,719
so that you and I and countless millions of people

402
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,519
around this world today can have this reliable record

403
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:08,279
that's available to us.

404
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,919
Why do we put scriptures together?

405
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,479
Why do we support a printing ministry

406
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:13,679
such as Beacon of Truth?

407
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,439
Because there are millions upon millions upon millions

408
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,559
of people around the world that do not have yet

409
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:23,879
this record that's been given in their own native tongue,

410
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:25,279
in their own language.

411
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,879
And so we desire to help and to provide the resources

412
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:33,959
and the manpower so that Bibles and portions of scripture

413
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:36,799
can be given in their own language.

414
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,839
I said to many people this past week,

415
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:43,039
your English is good, and they would laugh

416
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,079
and they'd chuckle, and I'd say this,

417
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,879
it's much better than my Hebrew.

418
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,439
It's much better than my Greek.

419
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,079
I'm thankful that the Bible that I have is in English

420
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,959
because that's my native tongue.

421
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:01,000
Amen?

422
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:06,199
We find this morning, even within our congregation,

423
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:08,919
the folks that have a native tongue

424
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:10,199
that's different than English,

425
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:13,799
that now they've learned English and they read it

426
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,559
and they understand it and so on and so forth,

427
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:19,039
but the Bible's available in their language.

428
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,559
What a joy, what a blessing.

429
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:25,239
This morning, when we think about the truth,

430
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:28,559
the record has been delivered, that it's reliable, yes,

431
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,839
but it's also available to us.

432
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:33,559
Think about this, turn to the book of 1 Corinthians,

433
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,679
if you will, chapter 15.

434
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,279
Notice what Paul says.

435
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:39,159
Look at just a couple of verses this morning

436
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,320
in dealing with this truth

437
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,039
that the record is available to us.

438
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,000
In 1 Corinthians, chapter 15, we would often,

439
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,279
as we think about that chapter being mentioned,

440
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:49,279
we'd be aware of the fact

441
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:51,599
that it's the great resurrection chapter, and it is,

442
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:54,559
and I'm so thankful for the truth of 1 Corinthians 15,

443
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,799
but notice what Paul says, beginning in verse number one.

444
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:02,880
Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel,

445
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,000
which I preached unto you,

446
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,760
which also you have received, and wherein ye stand,

447
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,159
by which also you're saved,

448
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:11,640
if you keep in memory what I preached unto you,

449
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,200
unless you have believed in vain.

450
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,359
Notice what he says,

451
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,519
for I delivered unto you, first of all,

452
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,799
that which I also received,

453
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,399
how that Christ died for our sins,

454
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:22,239
according to the scriptures, and that he was buried,

455
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,320
and that he rose again the third day,

456
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,679
according to the scriptures.

457
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:29,159
Paul is saying, listen, I've declared something to you,

458
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:30,479
but what I've declared,

459
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:32,559
he uses the word declare in verse number one,

460
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,000
he uses the word deliver in verse number three,

461
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,200
but what he declared and what he delivered

462
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,399
was first what he had received,

463
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,200
and what he had received,

464
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,679
he then declared and delivered specifically,

465
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,719
contextually to the believers in Corinth,

466
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:50,320
and these believers in Corinth,

467
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,440
as Paul would take that missionary journey,

468
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,760
and he'd go to Corinth, and he faced opposition,

469
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,839
and he faced difficulty,

470
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:57,440
but the Lord appeared to him and said,

471
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,479
I have much people in this city,

472
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:00,320
sorry.

473
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,880
How encouraging that must have been for Paul to receive that message.

474
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,200
And he ministered there, and a church was established, and we know it's not a model

475
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
church.

476
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,400
They had many problems in the church in Corinth, but there were people in Corinth that were

477
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,360
saved because a message was delivered.

478
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,320
Because Paul had received it, and then Paul declared and delivered that message.

479
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:28,720
And the message that Paul delivered, the record that Paul gave to the believers in Corinth

480
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,760
as he went to that place, we find that it was available to them.

481
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,200
He then writes this under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, and he sends this

482
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,000
letter to them so that they could receive further instruction.

483
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
What a joy.

484
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,560
In the book of Jude, it's just one chapter.

485
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:54,600
We find that Jude is giving us great truth, and it's a one-chapter book, 25 verses.

486
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:01,840
But man, the content of this book is so rich and so deep.

487
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,840
We find that Jude says this in verse number 3,

488
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:13,760
Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful

489
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,680
for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith,

490
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:23,600
notice the statement, which was once delivered unto the saints.

491
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,680
Aren't you thankful that the record has been delivered?

492
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm so thankful this morning.

493
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,320
I think we should pause in our minds just for a moment and thank God that He's delivered

494
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,120
a record to us, and that the record that He's delivered, these things that are mentioned

495
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,800
in this passage, the witness as He used that word interchangeably for this record that

496
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,880
we can rejoice this morning, that it's reliable.

497
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,160
Every word of God is true.

498
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,160
Amen?

499
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,360
And it's available.

500
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:02,840
I've read today and last week and this last year, I've read as much of God's Word as I

501
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,240
wanted to, and so have you.

502
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,240
Amen?

503
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,520
Because it's available.

504
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:18,600
Sometimes it just sits on a shelf somewhere, and it's ignored, and how tragic that is,

505
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,520
because the record is, man, it's reliable, it's helpful.

506
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,200
The Bible says of itself that the Word of God is profitable.

507
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,720
Not profitable just sitting on a shelf somewhere, but profitable to me as a believer as I read

508
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
it, as I study it.

509
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,160
Yes, it taught me the truth of salvation.

510
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:43,280
We understand that He says in that same passage of Scripture, as Paul is speaking to Timothy,

511
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,520
that from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise

512
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,680
unto salvation.

513
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,080
Hallelujah.

514
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,440
But it's not just a book that teaches us about salvation, but it's a book that teaches us

515
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,120
about sanctification.

516
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,640
There's much that we speak of with regard to salvation, and if we're not careful, we

517
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,120
don't really discuss enough sanctification.

518
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,480
But those that have been born again, those that have been saved, we are to be sanctified,

519
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,480
set apart.

520
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,400
We're to be conformed to the image of His dear Son.

521
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,800
We're to be holy as He is holy.

522
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
Amen?

523
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,320
He left us an example that we should follow His steps, and we think about this process

524
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,320
of sanctification.

525
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,200
I'm thankful this morning that salvation is the miracle of a moment, amen?

526
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,200
That when you understand that you're lost and you're hellbound because of your sin and

527
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,280
that you are guilty, that Jesus Christ is the only Savior, and you place your faith

528
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:49,740
and trust in Jesus Christ, you can say, hallelujah, Jesus ransomed me.

529
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,680
Sanctification is a process.

530
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:58,400
Some have said this, it's a process of a lifetime, becoming like our Savior.

531
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:06,680
Every single day, drawing closer to Him, drawing nigh to God, becoming like Him.

532
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:14,560
You see, I'm thankful to be saved, but He saved us, and He's got a plan for us, amen?

533
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:20,440
And His plan is that we would be like His dear Son.

534
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,839
Read Romans 8, oftentimes we read verse 28, we know that all things work together for

535
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,000
good to them that love God, to them who are called according to His purpose, and we can

536
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,679
rejoice in understanding that Bible truth.

537
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,839
Sometimes we're going through the difficulties of life, we don't fully understand how it

538
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:40,920
all works, but we can rest in knowing that God has a plan and God has a purpose.

539
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,800
But we look at verse number 29, and it says that we've been predestined to be conformed

540
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,320
to the image of His dear Son.

541
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:54,200
That's God's plan for each and every one of us, is that we would be like Christ.

542
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,559
I'm so thankful that the record has been delivered.

543
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,800
It's reliable, it's available.

544
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,360
Let me say this, number two, by the way, I only have two points this morning, don't get

545
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,399
nervous.

546
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:14,240
A record delivered, number two, a response demanded, a response demanded.

547
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,260
You know, every man is going to believe someone or something.

548
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:23,520
You can read in Acts 27, we won't take the time to develop the thought, but in Acts chapter

549
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,679
number 27, they're going to sail, and Paul makes mention that it's not wise for them

550
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:29,960
to set sail.

551
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,679
He says that sailing was dangerous, and he says to them in verse number 10, "'Sirs,

552
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,420
I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only to the lading

553
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,119
in the ship, but also to our lives.'"

554
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:44,399
And it then says this in verse number 11 of Acts 27, "'Nevertheless, the centurion believed

555
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:49,119
the master and the owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by Paul.'"

556
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,119
And what did they do?

557
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:55,460
They departed, and they hit a terrible storm.

558
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,480
Everyone believes someone.

559
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,480
Everyone believes someone.

560
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,200
We've got to make sure we're believing the right someone.

561
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
Amen?

562
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:10,399
And the report has been delivered, but there is a response that is demanded.

563
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:16,240
We find that as this report has been delivered, he continues in verse number 9.

564
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:22,279
Notice where he says, "'If,' there's this word, this conditional word, "'if we receive

565
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:27,960
the witness of men,' then he says this, "'the witness of God is greater.

566
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,320
For this is the witness of God, which he hath testified of his Son.

567
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,360
He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself.

568
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,839
He that believeth not God hath made him a liar, because he believeth not the record

569
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,520
that God gave of his Son.

570
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:46,040
And this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his

571
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,040
Son.

572
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:52,360
He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.

573
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,080
These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that

574
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,160
ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son

575
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,160
of God.'"

576
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:06,140
And so as you read verses 9 through 13, you find in these verses of Scripture that there's

577
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:12,440
this contrast between those who have believed or received the record and those who have

578
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,360
rejected the record.

579
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,360
And as we look at this passage of Scripture, we find that this here, as John is writing

580
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,360
to these believers, he says to them, this record has been delivered, but it demands

581
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,119
a response.

582
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:33,119
Again, I would make it broad to the entirety of the Word of God.

583
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:42,480
God's Word has been given, and God's record has been provided, and it demands a response.

584
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,880
Really there's only two responses.

585
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,800
We either receive it or we reject it.

586
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,520
Those are the two responses.

587
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:56,760
And let me say this, it's an all or none kind of a situation, amen?

588
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,080
It's not a situation where you say, well, I like this part of the record over here,

589
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,960
so I'm going to receive that part, and this part over here, you know, I don't really like

590
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,960
that part a whole lot.

591
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,559
It kind of, eh, I'm going to ignore that, I'm going to reject that.

592
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,440
No, that's not how it works.

593
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,740
It's all or none, all or none.

594
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:23,179
Most people would gladly receive the part of the record that says God so loved the world,

595
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:26,899
but they reject so many other parts of it.

596
00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:31,619
And we find this morning that God has given us this record.

597
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:37,299
Yes, John is speaking about what he's writing specifically, but we can very easily make

598
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:42,859
the application to the whole of Scripture, and as we understand that we've been the gracious

599
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:47,340
recipients of this record that God has given, there's a response that is demanded.

600
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:52,299
And I want you to see, for those that receive it, notice what he says specifically here

601
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:57,059
in the text of Scripture, for those that receive this record, this witness.

602
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:05,020
In verse number 10, he says this, he that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness

603
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,299
in himself.

604
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:11,780
And that's a great result of receiving the record that's been delivered.

605
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:17,260
As I respond, this response is demanded, as I receive the record, as I believe what

606
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:22,539
God has given me as being truth, and I receive the Lord Jesus Christ as my Savior, the Bible

607
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:28,780
says he that believeth on the Son of God hath this witness, the witness, in himself.

608
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,039
Who was the witness?

609
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:35,340
Back in verse number 6, it says this, this is he that came by water and the blood, even

610
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:42,100
Jesus Christ, not by water only, but by water and blood, and it is the Spirit that beareth

611
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,059
witness because the Spirit is truth.

612
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:48,780
So I have, the Bible says this, I have the witness in himself.

613
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,660
Guess what happened when you got saved?

614
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,100
The Holy Spirit of God took up residence.

615
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,460
Isn't that awesome?

616
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:00,100
We can talk about the difference between the indwelling of the Spirit of God and the…

617
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,700
filling of the Spirit of God.

618
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,860
And we understand the moment of salvation,

619
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,100
the Holy Spirit of God indwells us.

620
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,220
I didn't understand all of it when I got saved,

621
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,780
and you probably didn't understand all of it

622
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,100
when you got saved either.

623
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,020
But the Spirit of God, the Bible tells us

624
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,900
that our bodies are the temple of the Spirit of God,

625
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,860
which is in you, which you have of God.

626
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,860
We've been redeemed.

627
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,620
The Bible tells us that the Spirit is the earnest

628
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:26,220
of our inheritance in Ephesians chapter number one.

629
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,860
This morning, as I begin to understand

630
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,180
one of the results that are mentioned

631
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,420
in this passage of Scripture,

632
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,900
of having received the witnesses,

633
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,980
that now we have the witness within ourselves.

634
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,380
You know, the Bible talks about His Spirit

635
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,500
bears witness with our spirit.

636
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,740
You know, as you read the Word of God,

637
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,020
as you listen to the preaching of the Word of God,

638
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,900
as you hear people say different things,

639
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,020
as you're walking with the Lord,

640
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,300
as you're receiving the witness that God's given,

641
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,940
the record that God's given,

642
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,180
there are times in which your spirit bears witness

643
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,580
with what you're hearing, right?

644
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,780
His Spirit bears witness with your spirit

645
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,260
that this is truth.

646
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,300
There are other times that you might hear something

647
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,780
and you may not fully understand what's being said.

648
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,980
There's some things, nuances, whatever,

649
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,420
and the Holy Spirit of God is just not bearing witness

650
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,500
with your spirit that there's truth there.

651
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,340
There's a problem.

652
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,060
There's something here.

653
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,900
And His Spirit now lives within us,

654
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,900
and His Spirit bears witness with our spirit.

655
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,220
I'm so thankful for the ministry of the Holy Spirit of God,

656
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,500
the Holy Ghost that indwells us.

657
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,300
He empowers us, but He, the Bible says this,

658
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:44,300
He will guide us or lead us into all truth.

659
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,580
What a joy.

660
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,620
Notice what it says for those that receive this record.

661
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,060
Again, the response is demanded.

662
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,020
It says in verse number 11,

663
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,300
and this is the record that God has given to us,

664
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,060
eternal life, and this life is in His Son.

665
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,540
Listen, eternal life is in no one else

666
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,620
but the Lord Jesus Christ.

667
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,740
That's why Peter stood up and said,

668
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,860
there's no other name under heaven given among men

669
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,300
whereby we must be saved.

670
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,060
It says in verse number 12,

671
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:18,380
he that hath the Son hath life.

672
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,900
He that hath the Son hath life.

673
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,300
If we receive, if we respond to this record

674
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,620
that's been given with receiving it,

675
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:33,420
the Bible says that we have the Son, we have life.

676
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:38,420
I'm so thankful to have not only this temporal life,

677
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,420
but to have the truth of eternal life.

678
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,020
I'm so thankful that in this temporal life

679
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,580
that God will give us abundant life,

680
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,460
as He says in John chapter number 10.

681
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,860
What a joy it is to have this life.

682
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,620
You know, there are so many people that are living today

683
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,620
that are walking around

684
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,260
and they really have no purpose for their life.

685
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,540
They don't know what their purpose is.

686
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,900
One of the questions that so many people desire

687
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,100
to have an answer to is what is the purpose?

688
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,140
What is the purpose of life?

689
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,180
Why are we here?

690
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,700
People begin to answer that question

691
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,620
with all sorts of theories and ideas

692
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:17,820
and the ideologies that permeate our society

693
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,260
would provide them with answers that are so far

694
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,420
from what God has said in His word.

695
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,780
You know what the purpose is for your life

696
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,980
and for my life as believers?

697
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,380
Is to glorify my Father, which is in heaven.

698
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,260
That is the singular purpose of my life.

699
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,980
Now, when we understand the singular purpose of my life,

700
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,900
there's a lot of digging into the Word of God

701
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,940
to find out how I bring glory to my Savior.

702
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,940
How do I live my life in such a way that God is glorified?

703
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,500
You know what the Bible says of Jesus?

704
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,740
He always did that which pleased His Father.

705
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,380
Wow, what a testimony.

706
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,180
What a testimony.

707
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,820
This morning, listen, I'm thankful

708
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,500
that I understand a purpose for my life,

709
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,020
but there was a time in my life

710
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,900
where I did not understand a purpose for my life.

711
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,900
There was a time in my life before I got saved

712
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,380
that I thought, and many of you can relate,

713
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,660
you understood this as well,

714
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,500
that the purpose of living, the purpose of life

715
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,540
was that I could go and I could make

716
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,220
as much as I could possibly make

717
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,540
and have as good as I could possibly have

718
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,140
from a human perspective.

719
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,460
That's what I thought life was all about.

720
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,100
But then God saved my soul

721
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,780
and helped me understand that there's something far greater.

722
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,260
What shall it profit a man

723
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,660
if he gained the whole world but loses his own soul?

724
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,660
Money doesn't satisfy.

725
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,740
Jesus always satisfies.

726
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:49,980
What's the blessing, the result of receiving?

727
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,500
Well, we have the Holy Spirit within us,

728
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,940
we have the witness in Himself, we have life.

729
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,540
But then notice verse number 13.

730
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,020
These things have I written unto you

731
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,180
that believe on the name of the Son of God.

732
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,340
And then notice this phrase,

733
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,380
that ye may know that ye have eternal life.

734
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,660
Throughout the study of the book of 1 John,

735
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,300
we've made reference of how many times

736
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,540
He uses the word know, to have knowledge of,

737
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,780
to have that assurance.

738
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,940
And this morning as we look at what He says here,

739
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,180
that ye may know that ye have eternal life

740
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,580
and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God,

741
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,420
I'm so thankful to have the knowledge,

742
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,860
the confidence of eternal life.

743
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,100
I'm so thankful this morning

744
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,660
that He's given us this record,

745
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,020
the record's been delivered.

746
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,860
And as we respond to this record by receiving it,

747
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,180
then His Spirit bears witness with my spirit

748
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,780
that I am a child of God and I have that assurance.

749
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,900
He says, I'm writing these things unto you

750
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,460
that have believed that ye may know

751
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,580
that ye have eternal life.

752
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,060
What a tragedy for people to go through life

753
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,340
and not have any confidence of heaven.

754
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,580
How many times we've spoken to individuals in our lives

755
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,380
as we sought to share the gospel

756
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,780
and they say something like this,

757
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,780
well, I hope I'd go to heaven when I die.

758
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,060
I'm just not sure.

759
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,220
And they struggle.

760
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,020
In fact, you find that there are people

761
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,980
that even would go to church

762
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,820
and they struggle with their salvation.

763
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,660
They struggle with whether or not they're truly saved.

764
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,340
Listen, God wants you to know that you know,

765
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,860
that you know, that you know that you're saved.

766
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,700
The devil is the one that wants you to doubt.

767
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:30,380
I would say this, that it's a battleground

768
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,100
and in that battleground,

769
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,460
He has the ability to cause us,

770
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,500
render us ineffective

771
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,780
when we don't even know if we're saved ourselves.

772
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,220
Because if you don't know,

773
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,660
you're going to have a hard time talking to somebody else

774
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,900
about how they can know.

775
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,860
Make sense?

776
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,740
Notice what Peter said in 1 Peter 1,

777
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,740
and I'll reference what Jesus said.

778
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,460
In 1 Peter 1,

779
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,220
the Bible says this in verse 3,

780
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,940
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

781
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,340
which according to His abundant mercy

782
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,460
hath begotten us again into a lively hope

783
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,980
by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.

784
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,740
Aren't you thankful to be saved?

785
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:20,820
Verse 4, to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled

786
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:25,820
and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you.

787
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,380
Now that sounds pretty sure, doesn't it?

788
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,020
And then it says this in verse number 5,

789
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,940
who are kept by the power of God

790
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,460
through faith unto salvation,

791
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,180
ready to be revealed in the last time.

792
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,100
I've said it many times over the years,

793
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,900
if it were up to me to keep my salvation,

794
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,100
I would have lost it shortly after I got it.

795
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,220
But I'm kept by the power of God.

796
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,300
Jesus said this in John chapter number 10,

797
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,340
my sheep hear my voice and I know them.

798
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,860
And He says this, they follow me

799
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,300
and I give unto them eternal life

800
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,780
and they shall never perish.

801
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,300
Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand, He says.

802
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,540
And you think about being secure in the very hand of God

803
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,300
and what a blessing to know the assurance,

804
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,780
to have the confidence.

805
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,220
Listen, it's not a prideful thing for us to say,

806
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,580
I know I'm going to heaven when I die.

807
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,060
You know why it's not prideful?

808
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,900
Because if you take the record that God has given,

809
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,340
if you ask me this morning,

810
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,860
are you sure that when you die you're gonna go to heaven?

811
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,940
Absolutely, 100% confident that I'm going to heaven.

812
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,420
And it's not prideful because it has nothing to do with me.

813
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,500
Has everything to do with what Jesus Christ did for me

814
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,180
on the cross of Calvary,

815
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,820
His death, His burial and His glorious resurrection.

816
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,740
And I glory in my Savior.

817
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,820
Notice for those that reject it,

818
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,420
because their response is demanded.

819
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,980
Those that reject the record that has been delivered,

820
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,780
notice in verse number 10, what strong language.

821
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,860
The Bible says, he that believeth on the Son of God

822
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,220
hath the witness in himself.

823
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:59,220
He that believeth not God hath made him a liar,

824
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,860
because he believeth not the record

825
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,340
that God gave of His Son.

826
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:09,460
What an indictment, making God a liar.

827
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,540
Our God is not a liar.

828
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:15,180
He's not a man that He should lie, amen?

829
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,660
In fact, what a joy to think about the way

830
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,860
in which Paul says this in the book of Titus.

831
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,580
He says, in hope of eternal life,

832
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:29,580
which God that cannot lie promised before the world began.

833
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:33,500
Let God be true and every man a liar.

834
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,500
And this morning, we find that those that would reject

835
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,060
the message that's been delivered,

836
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,140
this report that's been delivered

837
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:43,740
and how grateful we are that God has given us a report,

838
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,180
that God has given us the word of God

839
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,260
and that response is demanded.

840
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:53,180
And for those that reject it, they are without hope.

841
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,260
They've made Him a liar,

842
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,620
but the Bible says also this in verse 12,

843
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,580
they have no life.

844
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,180
Notice what it says, he that hath the Son hath life.

845
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:06,980
And he that hath not the Son of God hath not life."

846
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,980
Hath not life.

847
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,500
Oh, they're living a temporal life.

848
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:19,940
To use the term that was used when...was instrumental in seeing my dad saved, there are a lot of

849
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:24,500
dead people that are waiting to die.

850
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,620
What in the world does that mean?

851
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:31,540
They're dead spiritually waiting to die a physical death.

852
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,460
And he says, they have not life.

853
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,900
Listen, understand this morning that when you trust that Christ is your Savior, He gave

854
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,060
you everlasting life at that moment.

855
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:43,820
It's the gift of God, eternal life, everlasting life.

856
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:50,220
And this morning, when we look at the record that God has given to us and we see that God

857
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:54,860
says here in this passage of Scripture, this record has been delivered, and we see that

858
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,740
it's reliable, that it's available.

859
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:03,740
I hope this morning that we would thank God that He's given us the record, that He's given

860
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:11,140
us the Word of God, that it is reliable, that it is available, that I have it and I hold

861
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,620
it in my hand.

862
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:17,260
And then as we begin to think about a response that is demanded, and again, understanding

863
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:23,260
that it's an all or none kind of a situation, that we would respond to the record that He's

864
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:31,540
given us and this response is demanded, that we'd respond by taking heed to all of it,

865
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:35,780
to all of it, that we would search the Scriptures as we've been commanded to do so, that we'd

866
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:40,260
be students of the Word of God, that we would prove what is acceptable unto the Lord, that

867
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:45,020
we would take the Word of God and we would dig in and we'd say, listen, I want my life

868
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,020
to please my Savior.

869
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:51,220
God's Word speaks so much more than just about salvation.

870
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:56,020
Now I'm so thankful that the message of redemption is the message of the Bible.

871
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:00,640
I'm so thankful that throughout the Word of God, it is the main focus of the Scriptures

872
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,300
of redemption and the plan of redemption as it's been referred to by William Scroggie,

873
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,260
great theologian of yesteryear.

874
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:12,140
He referred to the Bible as being the unfolding drama of redemption.

875
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,620
And I love that phraseology.

876
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:17,780
I love the way that he referred to the Bible that way because it is the unfolding drama

877
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,780
of redemption.

878
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:23,100
You read the Old Testament and how it prophesies of Messiah who would come and then you read

879
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:28,820
how Messiah comes and how He fulfills and all that He does and then how the church moves

880
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:34,020
forward on proclaiming the message of redemption.

881
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:38,640
And I'm thankful for salvation through Christ, but you understand that the Bible speaks a

882
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,820
whole lot about sanctification as well.

883
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:50,260
The put off and put on principles of the Word of God, the taking heed to the Word of

884
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,260
God.

885
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:54,340
And this morning, God's Word requires a response.

886
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:57,020
You say, well, I've trusted Him as my Savior.

887
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,800
I am so thankful.

888
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,220
If you're here this morning, if you're tuned in via live stream, you've never trusted the

889
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,140
Lord Jesus Christ, your personal Savior.

890
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:08,460
Today is the day of salvation.

891
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:13,060
The record's been given, a response is demanded.

892
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:16,860
But maybe this morning you say, well, I've trusted Him as my Savior.

893
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,620
And that's about as far as you've gone.

894
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:24,340
Can I tell you this morning that He has given you a whole Bible and desires that you would

895
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:36,700
take heed to all of it, to respond in obedience to it, to walk in holiness, to walk in obedience,

896
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:42,820
to be doers of the Word, not just picking and choosing various portions, not taking

897
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,880
and throwing away a whole segment of God's Word and saying, well, that's not really for

898
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,880
us today.

899
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:54,780
No, no, God's given us the entirety of the Bible, and He intends for us to know and to

900
00:43:54,780 --> 00:44:01,300
prove what is acceptable unto the Lord so that we could bring honor and glory to our

901
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,300
Savior.

902
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,380
I'm so thankful that the witness of God is greater.

903
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:08,060
I'm so thankful He's given it.

904
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,060
It's available.

905
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,380
It's reliable.

906
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:15,900
This morning we need to not only take heed to it ourselves, but then we need to propagate

907
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:16,900
that truth.

908
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,620
There's a lost and dying world.

909
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:24,940
The Sunday school lesson this morning, the song service today, oh, how my heart was burdened

910
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:29,180
about that truth of, listen, I'm thankful that we have the Word of God.

911
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:33,140
We get to hear it so often, but what do we do with it?

912
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,900
What do we do with it?

913
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:41,660
I stood on the banks of the Sea of Galilee, and I also stood on the banks of the Dead

914
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:42,660
Sea.

915
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:48,100
What a great contrast between those two bodies of water.

916
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:53,860
The Dead Sea is much larger than the Sea of Galilee, much larger, but nothing can live

917
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,660
there, it's dead.

918
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:03,860
Ten times the salt and other mineral levels are in the Dead Sea than are found in any

919
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,580
other sea.

920
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:06,580
Ten times the amount.

921
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,380
So yeah, you can float in it.

922
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,700
I hope you'd learn a greater lesson than just floating in it.

923
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:18,620
I didn't float in it, I had no interest in that.

924
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:24,280
It's dead because there's no outlet.

925
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:29,240
The Jordan River feeds the Sea of Galilee.

926
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:35,920
There are three other tributaries that form into the Jordan that feed the Sea of Galilee.

927
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,280
And then out of the Sea of Galilee is the Jordan.

928
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,920
You know where the Jordan goes?

929
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,920
To the Dead Sea.

930
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:47,880
You know how much life is in the Sea of Galilee?

931
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,320
Holly and I stood there to take a picture.

932
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,640
We sent some pictures to you guys, and we stood there to take a picture, and you could

933
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,240
hear the fish jumping out of the water.

934
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,020
I'm serious.

935
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:03,680
No wonder they use those nets to catch fish, man, there's all kinds of fish.

936
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,520
There's life in abundance.

937
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:16,360
That same river goes to the Dead Sea, and it's dead because there's no outlet.

938
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,120
I don't want to be a Dead Sea Christian.

939
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,880
Amen?

940
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,840
God's given us so much.

941
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:28,240
We respond to it, we believe it, but then there's got to be an outlet.

942
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,080
There's got to be somebody that I'm sharing the truth with, that I'm trying to reach and

943
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,080
trying to...

944
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,200
Why?

945
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,400
Because the message that we have is a life-giving message.

946
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,560
Oh, what great opportunity God has given us.

947
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,560
Let's pray.

948
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,920
Father, we love You.

949
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,260
Thank You for loving us.

950
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:52,780
Thank You for the record that's been delivered.

951
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:57,500
As we think about a response that's demanded, I pray that we'd respond in belief and trust

952
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:06,980
and faith, not only for salvation but even for sanctification as we understand the importance

953
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:14,860
of living in obedience to Your Word, that we would follow Your steps, that we would

954
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:18,740
live and walk in holiness.

955
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:23,220
God, if there's someone that's not sure of heaven, whether they're here or tuned in via

956
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:26,940
live stream, I pray that today would be the day of their salvation.

957
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:31,820
I pray for every child of God, Lord, I pray that You'd help us to thank You for the record

958
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:37,220
that's been provided to us, the record delivered, that it is reliable and available.

959
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:40,260
Help us to rejoice greatly in that truth.

960
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:44,980
God, help us to receive it, all of it, and then help us to give it.

961
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:49,980
Help us to be faithful, to proclaim the truth of Your Word.

962
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:53,620
I pray, God, that You would move and work in these few moments as we've been ready to

963
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:58,580
receive and now, as we have opportunity to respond, I pray, God, that Your name would

964
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:03,220
be exalted in every decision that is made, that You'd be glorified and we'll thank You

965
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,220
for it.

966
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:05,220
In Christ's name we pray.

967
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,220
Would You stand with me?

968
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:10,740
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed, and no one's looking around this morning.

969
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:15,540
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano, and as she does, the altar's open.

970
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:18,140
Not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how you can know for sure that

971
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,860
heaven's your home.

972
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:24,660
Maybe you want to come and thank God for the record, the Word of God that's been given.

973
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:30,620
Maybe this morning there's areas that you have not been obedient to.

974
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:34,380
You received portions of it, but not others, and you want to come and get that right with

975
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,780
the Lord.

976
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:41,060
Maybe this morning you want to make a commitment to God to share the truth with others.

977
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,980
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
