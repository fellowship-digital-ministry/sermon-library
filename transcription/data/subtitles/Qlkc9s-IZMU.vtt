WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
Hallelujah, Jesus ransomed me.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.420
Why?

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.179
All are welcome.

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:08.619
You know, there's some people that we know,

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:11.460
there's some people that I know that you know personally

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.779
that could not sing this morning,

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:16.299
when the roll is caught up yonder, I'll be there.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.139
They don't know.

00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:20.620
There's some people that you know that I know

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.059
that can't say, Jesus ransomed me.

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:26.180
I don't even know what it means.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.819
But all are welcome.

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:31.819
We have a great responsibility to tell them

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:36.819
of this wonderful, wonderful truth that Jesus saves.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.119
And so thankful for those songs this morning.

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:42.220
First John chapter number five,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.459
we'll be looking at verses six through 13.

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:48.419
The title for the message, the witness of God is greater.

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:51.000
And we'll see that statement in our text of scripture

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.459
as we come to the word of God

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:54.500
and we come to this passage of scripture.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.939
Of course, all year I've been preaching on Sunday mornings.

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:58.139
We've taken some weeks off,

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:00.860
but we've been preaching through the book of First John

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.979
and we're nearing the end

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.699
as we are nearing the end of a calendar year.

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.379
And we have made it through thus far.

00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:10.379
But I want you to be mindful this morning

00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:12.779
of the fact of just thanking God

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:16.660
and having appreciation for what God has given us

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.940
and allowing us to have the word of God.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.419
I believe that if we're not careful,

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:21.980
there are times in our lives

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.220
that we can take things for granted.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.220
And if we're not careful,

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.959
when we take those things for granted,

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:30.839
we lack appreciation for those things.

00:01:30.839 --> 00:01:32.720
And we're gonna take things for granted.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.360
We take for granted, if we're not careful,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.779
the fact that God has given us a Bible,

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:41.260
that God has given us a church

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.720
where the Bible is faithfully preached.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.160
And we can take those things for granted week after week,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.739
day after day in our lives.

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:50.519
And we can, if we're not careful,

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:55.480
have a diminished appreciation for what God has given us.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.040
But I believe this morning

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.919
that as we understand the truth of the gospel,

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:03.279
as we understand the truth about who Jesus is

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:06.099
and about the plan of salvation,

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:09.839
we get to hear it so often and so regularly.

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:13.279
But I hope that it never loses

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:16.679
that impact in your life and in my life

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:20.520
when we hear the wonderful truth that Jesus saved,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.240
that it continues to impact our lives,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.039
that we, maybe I'll say it this way,

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:26.800
that we never get over it

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.639
and that we constantly live in a state of appreciation

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.500
for what God has done for us.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.320
As we go to the book of 1 John,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.759
as we've studied through this book,

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:39.639
there are several verses in the book of 1 John

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.919
that are very well known.

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:44.800
Could be argued as to which verses

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.559
are more well known than others.

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:48.399
But I would say this morning

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:52.440
that 1 John 5.13 definitely stands at the,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.000
finds its place in the list of the most commonly known,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.759
referenced verses in the book of 1 John.

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:01.759
It may not be at the top of the list,

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:04.360
but it certainly would find itself on the list

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.119
of the most known verses in the book of 1 John.

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:10.240
And the Bible says this in verse 13,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.800
these things have I written unto you

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.279
that believe on the name of the Son of God,

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.199
that you may know that you have eternal life

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:21.039
and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:22.759
As we think about this verse of scripture

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:24.779
and we think about the security of the believer,

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:28.080
how thankful I am for this truth of this verse.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.559
And no doubt when it says these things

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:32.119
have I written unto you,

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:35.119
that it would really capture the entirety

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:36.839
of the book of 1 John.

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:38.520
But this morning, we're going to look

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.520
at the immediate context of what John is writing

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.800
when he speaks about these things

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.419
within the immediate context.

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.460
Of course, broadly speaking,

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.240
it's the entirety of the book of 1 John.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.979
But as we look at this text of scripture this morning,

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:56.860
we find that the Bible tells us,

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.580
notice in verse number nine,

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.660
if we receive the witness of men,

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.899
then notice the statement,

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:04.960
the witness of God is greater,

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.660
for this is the witness of God,

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.660
which he hath testified of his son.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.800
And we'll look at the entirety of the passage,

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.460
but I want you to be aware of the fact this morning

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.779
that the witness of God is greater.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:19.980
And I'm so thankful that God has given us

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.899
this record or this witness.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.220
We'll see that both of those terms are used

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.019
throughout these verses of scripture

00:04:26.019 --> 00:04:27.619
about the record that's been given,

00:04:27.619 --> 00:04:29.540
the witness that has been provided.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.679
And I'm so thankful to have the truth

00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:34.220
of the Word of God.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.739
If you're taking notes this morning,

00:04:35.739 --> 00:04:37.019
notice first of all with me,

00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:39.299
the record delivered.

00:04:39.299 --> 00:04:40.459
The record delivered.

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:42.179
Begin reading with me in verse number six.

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:43.959
Notice what the Bible says.

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:47.880
This is He that came by water and blood,

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.880
even Jesus Christ.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.679
Not by water only,

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:53.559
but by water and blood.

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.839
And it is the Spirit that beareth witness,

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:59.040
because the Spirit is truth.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.839
For there are three that bear record in heaven,

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:05.440
the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.320
And these three are one.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.640
Verse eight, there are three that bear witness in earth,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.920
the Spirit, and the water, and the blood,

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.239
and these three agree in one.

00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:19.119
As we begin to look at these verses of scripture

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:21.799
and understand the record has been delivered,

00:05:21.799 --> 00:05:23.359
we ought to just pause right there

00:05:23.359 --> 00:05:25.760
and say hallelujah that He's given us a record

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.019
that He's provided us with this witness

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:29.320
and it's been delivered.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.880
As we begin to think about the record

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.059
that's been delivered,

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:34.100
there are a couple of things that I understand

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.480
in this passage of scripture

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.660
that are important for us to recognize this morning.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.040
And number one is this,

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.440
the record that's been delivered is reliable.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.679
It's reliable.

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:46.160
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.220
I don't want a record that is not trustworthy.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.600
I don't want a record that is not reliable,

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.660
something that I can't trust, that I cannot depend on.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.920
But when we look at the record that's been delivered,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.959
as John is writing here to these believers,

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:03.480
he says to them, and we find by way of preservation

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.959
that God is saying to us

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:08.959
that the record that's been delivered is reliable.

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:10.160
It is trustworthy.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.079
It is something that we stake our eternity on

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:14.839
and we ought to rejoice this morning

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:17.839
that we have a reliable record.

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:20.399
Notice what the Bible says about this record.

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:22.000
The Bible says in verse number six,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.839
this is He that came by water and blood,

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:26.279
even Jesus Christ.

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:30.399
Notice, not by water only, but by water and blood.

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:33.399
And then it says this, and it is the Spirit.

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:34.880
That's a capital S.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.980
Who's it referring to?

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.040
It's referring to the Holy Spirit or the Holy Ghost.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.480
And it says the Spirit that beareth witness.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.399
I'm thankful that the Spirit of God,

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:47.440
the Holy Ghost, bears witness.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.239
And I'm thankful that because the Holy Spirit is,

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:52.559
when we think about the Trinity,

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:56.040
the third person of the Godhead, the Holy Ghost,

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.700
and the witness that He gives is reliable,

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.700
notice what it says, because the Spirit is truth.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.540
There are so many people today

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.059
that are so confused about truth.

00:07:12.059 --> 00:07:13.260
Can you know truth?

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.859
Is there truth?

00:07:14.859 --> 00:07:16.820
They believe that truth is something

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.380
that would be described as being relative,

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.579
that it's your truth or their truth or my truth

00:07:22.579 --> 00:07:24.059
or someone else's truth,

00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:26.100
but I'm thankful that the Word of God

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.859
declares for us that the Spirit is truth.

00:07:28.859 --> 00:07:31.420
And remember that Jesus Christ said this

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.619
in John 14 in verse number six,

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:38.500
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.899
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:07:41.899 --> 00:07:43.380
What a great declaration.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.739
We find that the Bible says in John 17,

00:07:45.739 --> 00:07:47.380
sanctify them by thy Word.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.899
Thy Word is truth.

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:54.559
We begin to think about the Spirit bearing witness

00:07:54.559 --> 00:07:56.820
and the Spirit being defined here

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.739
as being the, because the Spirit is truth,

00:08:00.739 --> 00:08:04.100
because it is the Spirit that beareth witness

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.519
and because it is the Spirit that is truth,

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:10.019
then we know that this record that we have is reliable.

00:08:10.019 --> 00:08:12.700
It is trustworthy, it's dependable.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.179
Listen, I'm not interested in something

00:08:15.179 --> 00:08:17.820
that's just potentially reliable.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.339
I'm not interested in something

00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:21.540
that has holes and has problems.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.019
I'm thankful that God said that every Word of God is pure

00:08:25.019 --> 00:08:27.540
and that He's given us a perfect book

00:08:27.579 --> 00:08:30.980
and He's given it to us and He's preserved it for us.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.739
And we understand as we look at the passage of Scripture

00:08:33.739 --> 00:08:36.320
that there is unity and there is agreement

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.539
within the Godhead.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.020
It tells us in verse number seven,

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.960
for there are three that bear record in heaven.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.500
By the way, I'm thankful that at this time,

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.299
at the writing of the book of 1 John

00:08:46.299 --> 00:08:48.219
and even now still at this moment,

00:08:48.219 --> 00:08:50.219
that Jesus is in heaven.

00:08:50.219 --> 00:08:52.380
He's ascended up into heaven.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.219
We see that the Bible speaks about these three

00:08:54.219 --> 00:08:55.059
that bear record.

00:08:55.059 --> 00:08:57.619
The Word, the Bible says this,

00:08:57.619 --> 00:08:59.419
the Father, the Word.

00:08:59.419 --> 00:09:01.299
Who's the Word?

00:09:01.299 --> 00:09:04.179
Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost.

00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:07.119
And these three are one.

00:09:07.119 --> 00:09:10.219
There is agreement, there is unity amongst the Trinity.

00:09:10.219 --> 00:09:12.539
And we find that Jesus Himself,

00:09:12.539 --> 00:09:15.619
after His ministry here upon this earth,

00:09:15.619 --> 00:09:17.659
after His death and His burial

00:09:17.659 --> 00:09:19.299
and His glorious resurrection

00:09:19.299 --> 00:09:20.840
and He ministered for 40 days

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.659
and then He ascended up into heaven.

00:09:22.659 --> 00:09:25.000
And the Bible tells us that He's at the right hand

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.320
of the throne of God

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.039
and that He ever liveth to make intercession for us.

00:09:29.039 --> 00:09:31.159
He was dead, but now He's alive

00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:32.760
and He's alive forevermore.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.640
And the Bible tells us that He's coming again.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.479
Oh, what a glorious truth.

00:09:38.479 --> 00:09:39.919
He has a perfect plan.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.159
We find that He's given us this record

00:09:43.159 --> 00:09:45.359
and obviously we could understand

00:09:45.359 --> 00:09:47.679
that as John is writing to these believers

00:09:47.679 --> 00:09:49.919
and under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:09:49.919 --> 00:09:52.599
He's writing this book of 1 John

00:09:52.599 --> 00:09:54.599
and He says that the record's been delivered,

00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:56.479
that the record is reliable,

00:09:56.479 --> 00:09:58.280
but I would broaden it this morning

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.359
to say of the entirety of it.

00:10:00.359 --> 00:10:02.659
of this book has been delivered.

00:10:02.659 --> 00:10:05.379
The entirety of this book is reliable.

00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:09.079
Listen, we don't look to try to prove the Bible

00:10:09.079 --> 00:10:12.719
through science or archeology or any other thing.

00:10:12.719 --> 00:10:15.379
We say, no, as those things are discovered,

00:10:15.379 --> 00:10:17.479
as those things are understood,

00:10:17.479 --> 00:10:21.959
the Bible gives credit to what they've determined.

00:10:21.959 --> 00:10:22.799
Amen?

00:10:22.799 --> 00:10:24.879
And we say the Bible is true.

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:27.439
It's reliable.

00:10:27.439 --> 00:10:29.679
Notice, as John would write,

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:31.079
it's very interesting, remember,

00:10:31.079 --> 00:10:34.279
that John is dealing with some false teachers

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:35.119
that would be prevalent.

00:10:35.119 --> 00:10:37.039
In fact, as you study the New Testament,

00:10:37.039 --> 00:10:40.079
you find that the Bible regularly speaks

00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:41.839
about these false teachers.

00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:44.499
Just as there were false prophets in the Old Testament,

00:10:44.499 --> 00:10:45.719
there would be false teachers.

00:10:45.719 --> 00:10:48.399
And we find that they're active and they're working.

00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:51.059
And as we studied the book of Colossians last year,

00:10:51.059 --> 00:10:53.479
we mentioned how that Paul was writing

00:10:53.479 --> 00:10:55.799
and he was giving great truth

00:10:55.799 --> 00:10:58.359
and trying to help these people understand

00:10:58.359 --> 00:11:00.159
the error of the Gnostics

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:02.679
and understanding the truth of the word of God.

00:11:02.679 --> 00:11:04.999
And we find that John is dealing with the same thing.

00:11:04.999 --> 00:11:07.839
The Gnostics are still active and things are taking place.

00:11:07.839 --> 00:11:10.399
And we find that he had mentioned in 1 John 4,

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:12.079
in verse number one,

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:15.279
beloved, believe not every spirit,

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:17.599
but try the spirits, whether they're of God,

00:11:17.599 --> 00:11:20.959
because many false prophets are gone out into the world.

00:11:20.959 --> 00:11:24.319
We find that these false teachers were active.

00:11:24.319 --> 00:11:27.399
And one of the false teachers, an early Gnostic,

00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:30.319
that was very active and it seems very evident

00:11:30.319 --> 00:11:32.759
that John, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:11:32.759 --> 00:11:36.239
is really dealing with one of the great errors of their way

00:11:36.239 --> 00:11:40.279
in verse number six, was a guy by the name of Serenthes.

00:11:40.279 --> 00:11:42.719
And Serenthes, the folks that would follow him

00:11:42.719 --> 00:11:46.279
were Serenthenes, not to be confused with the Corinthians,

00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:47.599
but the Serenthenes.

00:11:47.599 --> 00:11:51.339
And he was an early Gnostic and he was teaching.

00:11:51.339 --> 00:11:55.639
And really, as we've mentioned throughout the years,

00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:58.079
and as we've looked specifically at 1 John

00:11:58.079 --> 00:12:00.119
and chapter number four, we said this,

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:02.759
often as you look at the false teachers, what do they do?

00:12:02.759 --> 00:12:04.639
They get it wrong on Jesus.

00:12:05.679 --> 00:12:07.119
They get it wrong on Jesus.

00:12:07.119 --> 00:12:09.279
Can I tell you today that people still

00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:12.039
are getting it wrong on Jesus?

00:12:12.039 --> 00:12:14.239
And if you got it wrong on who Jesus is,

00:12:14.239 --> 00:12:17.599
there's no hope of eternity as far as salvation

00:12:17.599 --> 00:12:20.119
and having a home in heaven.

00:12:20.119 --> 00:12:23.039
We find that, listen, we just spent almost two weeks

00:12:23.039 --> 00:12:26.479
in a land where Jesus walked, where Jesus ministered,

00:12:26.479 --> 00:12:28.559
where Jesus proved his deity.

00:12:28.559 --> 00:12:32.079
We're in various places and yet there are countless,

00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:34.879
countless scores of people that are blinded

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:37.719
and they have it wrong about Jesus.

00:12:37.719 --> 00:12:42.719
Broke my heart to see so many people that are so close,

00:12:45.359 --> 00:12:48.679
but they're lost, but they're lost.

00:12:48.679 --> 00:12:50.719
Agrippa said to Paul,

00:12:50.759 --> 00:12:54.719
almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.

00:12:54.719 --> 00:12:57.999
Almost isn't good enough, amen?

00:12:57.999 --> 00:12:59.879
And it's the person of Jesus.

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:02.679
And this man, Serenthes, how he got it wrong

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:04.759
and what he would teach is that he would teach

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:07.759
that the Christ, meaning Messiah,

00:13:07.759 --> 00:13:10.599
see, he said that Jesus was just a man.

00:13:10.599 --> 00:13:13.039
He did not understand the incarnation.

00:13:13.039 --> 00:13:16.079
He did not understand the deity of Jesus Christ.

00:13:16.079 --> 00:13:19.519
And he said this, that at the baptism of Jesus,

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:22.919
that that's when the Christ descended upon him.

00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:25.279
And then prior to the crucifixion,

00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:28.479
the Christ left him, departed him.

00:13:28.479 --> 00:13:30.839
And so we find that John is saying this,

00:13:30.839 --> 00:13:32.559
and you think about the earthly ministry

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:33.999
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:13:33.999 --> 00:13:35.519
it was inaugurated when?

00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:36.679
At the baptism.

00:13:37.599 --> 00:13:39.759
By the way, John knew who he was.

00:13:39.759 --> 00:13:42.399
John the Baptist understood who Jesus was.

00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:46.399
John the Baptist felt unworthy to baptize Jesus.

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:48.319
He said, there's one that comes after me

00:13:48.319 --> 00:13:51.519
that is preferred above me and before me.

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:55.399
He said this, I'm not worthy to unloose his sandals,

00:13:55.399 --> 00:13:56.799
the latches of his shoes.

00:13:56.799 --> 00:13:59.359
And we find that he, John the Baptist,

00:13:59.359 --> 00:14:00.239
he was the forerunner.

00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:02.599
He understood who Jesus was.

00:14:02.599 --> 00:14:05.519
But Jesus at his baptism at Jordan,

00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:08.319
God the Father said, this is my beloved son

00:14:08.319 --> 00:14:10.879
in whom I am well pleased.

00:14:10.879 --> 00:14:12.879
The inauguration of the earthly ministry

00:14:12.879 --> 00:14:14.319
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:14:14.319 --> 00:14:16.879
And you understand that he's always been God.

00:14:16.879 --> 00:14:18.839
He left the throne room of heaven

00:14:18.839 --> 00:14:21.279
and he came to this sin-cursed world.

00:14:21.279 --> 00:14:23.399
And he's always been the God-man,

00:14:23.399 --> 00:14:26.359
100% God and 100% man.

00:14:26.359 --> 00:14:29.839
And we find that John is focusing here really

00:14:29.839 --> 00:14:32.719
on dealing with the false teaching that's taking place.

00:14:32.719 --> 00:14:36.599
And he's talking about the record of God being reliable.

00:14:36.599 --> 00:14:37.839
He says, notice what he says,

00:14:37.839 --> 00:14:40.279
this is he that came by water and blood even.

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:43.279
Notice what he says, Jesus Christ.

00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:46.639
Why does every word of God is pure?

00:14:47.399 --> 00:14:48.559
Why does he use the terminology that he does?

00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:52.879
He doesn't just say that Jesus, he says Jesus Christ.

00:14:52.879 --> 00:14:55.479
Remember when Paul was preaching in Thessalonica

00:14:55.479 --> 00:15:00.159
and he says, this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ.

00:15:00.159 --> 00:15:02.359
They understood who the man Jesus was,

00:15:02.359 --> 00:15:04.079
but he was making sure they understood

00:15:04.079 --> 00:15:06.439
that he is the Messiah,

00:15:06.439 --> 00:15:10.359
that his name, the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:15:10.359 --> 00:15:12.919
We find that Jesus, of course,

00:15:13.479 --> 00:15:15.639
hung upon that cruel cross.

00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:19.759
By the way, he had to,

00:15:19.759 --> 00:15:22.199
in order to fulfill the plan of redemption.

00:15:22.199 --> 00:15:24.239
The plan of redemption that was determined

00:15:24.239 --> 00:15:26.439
before the foundation of the world.

00:15:26.439 --> 00:15:29.319
When you read the book of Ephesians in the first chapter,

00:15:29.319 --> 00:15:33.719
you find that God has clearly communicated to his people

00:15:33.719 --> 00:15:36.759
that the plan of redemption was determined

00:15:36.759 --> 00:15:38.119
before the foundation of the world.

00:15:38.119 --> 00:15:41.639
How would people be saved that Jesus

00:15:41.839 --> 00:15:43.439
would come to this incursed world

00:15:43.439 --> 00:15:45.279
and that he would die in our place?

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:49.159
He would take on himself the form of a man.

00:15:49.159 --> 00:15:51.719
He would suffer, he'd bleed and die.

00:15:51.719 --> 00:15:55.279
We find that here, John, no doubt,

00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:59.559
is exposing the false teaching of Serenthes.

00:15:59.559 --> 00:16:02.119
And we find that as he would expose that false teaching,

00:16:02.119 --> 00:16:05.239
he's saying, listen, God has given us a record

00:16:05.239 --> 00:16:08.159
and the record that God has given us is true.

00:16:08.159 --> 00:16:09.639
It is reliable.

00:16:09.919 --> 00:16:12.000
We find that it's the spirit of God,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.679
the Holy Ghost that bears witness

00:16:13.679 --> 00:16:15.959
and the spirit is truth.

00:16:15.959 --> 00:16:19.359
Notice not only that the record has been delivered

00:16:19.359 --> 00:16:20.799
and that the record is reliable,

00:16:20.799 --> 00:16:23.399
but I'd say this, the record is available.

00:16:24.719 --> 00:16:27.519
Aren't you thankful that the record is available?

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:30.719
You know, it's one thing to say the record's reliable,

00:16:30.719 --> 00:16:33.559
but you know, it's just, we don't know where it is.

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:35.319
Well, that'd be tragic, wouldn't it?

00:16:36.719 --> 00:16:38.719
But the record is not available.

00:16:38.839 --> 00:16:41.959
But the record is not only reliable,

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:44.000
but the record is available.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.719
I mean, you're holding it in your hands this morning.

00:16:46.719 --> 00:16:48.959
You're holding in your hands

00:16:48.959 --> 00:16:50.559
the record that has been delivered.

00:16:50.559 --> 00:16:53.319
You're holding in your hands the record

00:16:53.319 --> 00:16:56.439
that God is speaking of that God graciously gave,

00:16:56.439 --> 00:16:59.479
but then providentially preserved the record

00:16:59.479 --> 00:17:02.719
so that you and I and countless millions of people

00:17:02.719 --> 00:17:06.519
around this world today can have this reliable record

00:17:06.519 --> 00:17:08.279
that's available to us.

00:17:08.279 --> 00:17:09.919
Why do we put scriptures together?

00:17:09.919 --> 00:17:12.479
Why do we support a printing ministry

00:17:12.479 --> 00:17:13.679
such as Beacon of Truth?

00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:16.439
Because there are millions upon millions upon millions

00:17:16.439 --> 00:17:19.559
of people around the world that do not have yet

00:17:19.559 --> 00:17:23.879
this record that's been given in their own native tongue,

00:17:23.879 --> 00:17:25.279
in their own language.

00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:29.879
And so we desire to help and to provide the resources

00:17:29.879 --> 00:17:33.959
and the manpower so that Bibles and portions of scripture

00:17:33.959 --> 00:17:36.799
can be given in their own language.

00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:40.839
I said to many people this past week,

00:17:40.839 --> 00:17:43.039
your English is good, and they would laugh

00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:45.079
and they'd chuckle, and I'd say this,

00:17:45.079 --> 00:17:46.879
it's much better than my Hebrew.

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:52.439
It's much better than my Greek.

00:17:53.519 --> 00:17:56.079
I'm thankful that the Bible that I have is in English

00:17:56.079 --> 00:17:57.959
because that's my native tongue.

00:18:00.159 --> 00:18:01.000
Amen?

00:18:02.679 --> 00:18:06.199
We find this morning, even within our congregation,

00:18:06.199 --> 00:18:08.919
the folks that have a native tongue

00:18:08.919 --> 00:18:10.199
that's different than English,

00:18:10.199 --> 00:18:13.799
that now they've learned English and they read it

00:18:13.799 --> 00:18:15.559
and they understand it and so on and so forth,

00:18:15.559 --> 00:18:19.039
but the Bible's available in their language.

00:18:19.039 --> 00:18:21.559
What a joy, what a blessing.

00:18:22.439 --> 00:18:25.239
This morning, when we think about the truth,

00:18:25.239 --> 00:18:28.559
the record has been delivered, that it's reliable, yes,

00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:30.839
but it's also available to us.

00:18:30.839 --> 00:18:33.559
Think about this, turn to the book of 1 Corinthians,

00:18:33.559 --> 00:18:35.679
if you will, chapter 15.

00:18:36.159 --> 00:18:37.279
Notice what Paul says.

00:18:37.279 --> 00:18:39.159
Look at just a couple of verses this morning

00:18:39.159 --> 00:18:40.320
in dealing with this truth

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.039
that the record is available to us.

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:46.000
In 1 Corinthians, chapter 15, we would often,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.279
as we think about that chapter being mentioned,

00:18:48.279 --> 00:18:49.279
we'd be aware of the fact

00:18:49.279 --> 00:18:51.599
that it's the great resurrection chapter, and it is,

00:18:51.599 --> 00:18:54.559
and I'm so thankful for the truth of 1 Corinthians 15,

00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:57.799
but notice what Paul says, beginning in verse number one.

00:18:58.959 --> 00:19:02.880
Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel,

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.000
which I preached unto you,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.760
which also you have received, and wherein ye stand,

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.159
by which also you're saved,

00:19:09.159 --> 00:19:11.640
if you keep in memory what I preached unto you,

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.200
unless you have believed in vain.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.359
Notice what he says,

00:19:14.359 --> 00:19:16.519
for I delivered unto you, first of all,

00:19:16.519 --> 00:19:18.799
that which I also received,

00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:20.399
how that Christ died for our sins,

00:19:20.399 --> 00:19:22.239
according to the scriptures, and that he was buried,

00:19:22.239 --> 00:19:24.320
and that he rose again the third day,

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.679
according to the scriptures.

00:19:26.679 --> 00:19:29.159
Paul is saying, listen, I've declared something to you,

00:19:29.159 --> 00:19:30.479
but what I've declared,

00:19:30.479 --> 00:19:32.559
he uses the word declare in verse number one,

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:35.000
he uses the word deliver in verse number three,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.200
but what he declared and what he delivered

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.399
was first what he had received,

00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:42.200
and what he had received,

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.679
he then declared and delivered specifically,

00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:48.719
contextually to the believers in Corinth,

00:19:48.719 --> 00:19:50.320
and these believers in Corinth,

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.440
as Paul would take that missionary journey,

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.760
and he'd go to Corinth, and he faced opposition,

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.839
and he faced difficulty,

00:19:55.839 --> 00:19:57.440
but the Lord appeared to him and said,

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.479
I have much people in this city,

00:19:59.479 --> 00:20:00.320
sorry.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.880
How encouraging that must have been for Paul to receive that message.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:08.200
And he ministered there, and a church was established, and we know it's not a model

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.200
church.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.400
They had many problems in the church in Corinth, but there were people in Corinth that were

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:18.360
saved because a message was delivered.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:23.320
Because Paul had received it, and then Paul declared and delivered that message.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:28.720
And the message that Paul delivered, the record that Paul gave to the believers in Corinth

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.760
as he went to that place, we find that it was available to them.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.200
He then writes this under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, and he sends this

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:41.000
letter to them so that they could receive further instruction.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
What a joy.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.560
In the book of Jude, it's just one chapter.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:54.600
We find that Jude is giving us great truth, and it's a one-chapter book, 25 verses.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:21:01.840
But man, the content of this book is so rich and so deep.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.840
We find that Jude says this in verse number 3,

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:13.760
Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.680
for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith,

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:23.600
notice the statement, which was once delivered unto the saints.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.680
Aren't you thankful that the record has been delivered?

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.000
I'm so thankful this morning.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.320
I think we should pause in our minds just for a moment and thank God that He's delivered

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:40.120
a record to us, and that the record that He's delivered, these things that are mentioned

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:44.800
in this passage, the witness as He used that word interchangeably for this record that

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.880
we can rejoice this morning, that it's reliable.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.160
Every word of God is true.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.160
Amen?

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.360
And it's available.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:02.840
I've read today and last week and this last year, I've read as much of God's Word as I

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.240
wanted to, and so have you.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.240
Amen?

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.520
Because it's available.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:18.600
Sometimes it just sits on a shelf somewhere, and it's ignored, and how tragic that is,

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:23.520
because the record is, man, it's reliable, it's helpful.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:29.200
The Bible says of itself that the Word of God is profitable.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.720
Not profitable just sitting on a shelf somewhere, but profitable to me as a believer as I read

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.720
it, as I study it.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.160
Yes, it taught me the truth of salvation.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:43.280
We understand that He says in that same passage of Scripture, as Paul is speaking to Timothy,

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.520
that from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.680
unto salvation.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.080
Hallelujah.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:54.440
But it's not just a book that teaches us about salvation, but it's a book that teaches us

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:59.120
about sanctification.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:04.640
There's much that we speak of with regard to salvation, and if we're not careful, we

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.120
don't really discuss enough sanctification.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:13.480
But those that have been born again, those that have been saved, we are to be sanctified,

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.480
set apart.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.400
We're to be conformed to the image of His dear Son.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.800
We're to be holy as He is holy.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:20.800
Amen?

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.320
He left us an example that we should follow His steps, and we think about this process

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.320
of sanctification.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:31.200
I'm thankful this morning that salvation is the miracle of a moment, amen?

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:36.200
That when you understand that you're lost and you're hellbound because of your sin and

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:41.280
that you are guilty, that Jesus Christ is the only Savior, and you place your faith

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:49.740
and trust in Jesus Christ, you can say, hallelujah, Jesus ransomed me.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.680
Sanctification is a process.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:58.400
Some have said this, it's a process of a lifetime, becoming like our Savior.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:06.680
Every single day, drawing closer to Him, drawing nigh to God, becoming like Him.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:14.560
You see, I'm thankful to be saved, but He saved us, and He's got a plan for us, amen?

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:20.440
And His plan is that we would be like His dear Son.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:25.839
Read Romans 8, oftentimes we read verse 28, we know that all things work together for

00:24:25.839 --> 00:24:29.000
good to them that love God, to them who are called according to His purpose, and we can

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.679
rejoice in understanding that Bible truth.

00:24:32.679 --> 00:24:35.839
Sometimes we're going through the difficulties of life, we don't fully understand how it

00:24:35.839 --> 00:24:40.920
all works, but we can rest in knowing that God has a plan and God has a purpose.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.800
But we look at verse number 29, and it says that we've been predestined to be conformed

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.320
to the image of His dear Son.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:54.200
That's God's plan for each and every one of us, is that we would be like Christ.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.559
I'm so thankful that the record has been delivered.

00:24:58.559 --> 00:25:00.800
It's reliable, it's available.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.360
Let me say this, number two, by the way, I only have two points this morning, don't get

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.399
nervous.

00:25:06.399 --> 00:25:14.240
A record delivered, number two, a response demanded, a response demanded.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:19.260
You know, every man is going to believe someone or something.

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:23.520
You can read in Acts 27, we won't take the time to develop the thought, but in Acts chapter

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:28.679
number 27, they're going to sail, and Paul makes mention that it's not wise for them

00:25:28.679 --> 00:25:29.960
to set sail.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:33.679
He says that sailing was dangerous, and he says to them in verse number 10, "'Sirs,

00:25:33.679 --> 00:25:37.420
I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only to the lading

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.119
in the ship, but also to our lives.'"

00:25:39.119 --> 00:25:44.399
And it then says this in verse number 11 of Acts 27, "'Nevertheless, the centurion believed

00:25:44.399 --> 00:25:49.119
the master and the owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by Paul.'"

00:25:49.119 --> 00:25:50.119
And what did they do?

00:25:50.119 --> 00:25:55.460
They departed, and they hit a terrible storm.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.480
Everyone believes someone.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.480
Everyone believes someone.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.200
We've got to make sure we're believing the right someone.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.200
Amen?

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:10.399
And the report has been delivered, but there is a response that is demanded.

00:26:10.399 --> 00:26:16.240
We find that as this report has been delivered, he continues in verse number 9.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:22.279
Notice where he says, "'If,' there's this word, this conditional word, "'if we receive

00:26:22.279 --> 00:26:27.960
the witness of men,' then he says this, "'the witness of God is greater.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.320
For this is the witness of God, which he hath testified of his Son.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.360
He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.839
He that believeth not God hath made him a liar, because he believeth not the record

00:26:38.839 --> 00:26:40.520
that God gave of his Son.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:46.040
And this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.040
Son.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:52.360
He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:56.080
These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that

00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:00.160
ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.160
of God.'"

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:06.140
And so as you read verses 9 through 13, you find in these verses of Scripture that there's

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:12.440
this contrast between those who have believed or received the record and those who have

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.360
rejected the record.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:21.360
And as we look at this passage of Scripture, we find that this here, as John is writing

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:26.360
to these believers, he says to them, this record has been delivered, but it demands

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.119
a response.

00:27:28.119 --> 00:27:33.119
Again, I would make it broad to the entirety of the Word of God.

00:27:33.119 --> 00:27:42.480
God's Word has been given, and God's record has been provided, and it demands a response.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.880
Really there's only two responses.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.800
We either receive it or we reject it.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.520
Those are the two responses.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:56.760
And let me say this, it's an all or none kind of a situation, amen?

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.080
It's not a situation where you say, well, I like this part of the record over here,

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.960
so I'm going to receive that part, and this part over here, you know, I don't really like

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.960
that part a whole lot.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.559
It kind of, eh, I'm going to ignore that, I'm going to reject that.

00:28:08.559 --> 00:28:10.440
No, that's not how it works.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.740
It's all or none, all or none.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:23.179
Most people would gladly receive the part of the record that says God so loved the world,

00:28:23.179 --> 00:28:26.899
but they reject so many other parts of it.

00:28:26.899 --> 00:28:31.619
And we find this morning that God has given us this record.

00:28:31.619 --> 00:28:37.299
Yes, John is speaking about what he's writing specifically, but we can very easily make

00:28:37.299 --> 00:28:42.859
the application to the whole of Scripture, and as we understand that we've been the gracious

00:28:42.859 --> 00:28:47.340
recipients of this record that God has given, there's a response that is demanded.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:52.299
And I want you to see, for those that receive it, notice what he says specifically here

00:28:52.299 --> 00:28:57.059
in the text of Scripture, for those that receive this record, this witness.

00:28:57.059 --> 00:29:05.020
In verse number 10, he says this, he that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.299
in himself.

00:29:07.299 --> 00:29:11.780
And that's a great result of receiving the record that's been delivered.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:17.260
As I respond, this response is demanded, as I receive the record, as I believe what

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:22.539
God has given me as being truth, and I receive the Lord Jesus Christ as my Savior, the Bible

00:29:22.539 --> 00:29:28.780
says he that believeth on the Son of God hath this witness, the witness, in himself.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.039
Who was the witness?

00:29:30.039 --> 00:29:35.340
Back in verse number 6, it says this, this is he that came by water and the blood, even

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:42.100
Jesus Christ, not by water only, but by water and blood, and it is the Spirit that beareth

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.059
witness because the Spirit is truth.

00:29:45.059 --> 00:29:48.780
So I have, the Bible says this, I have the witness in himself.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.660
Guess what happened when you got saved?

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.100
The Holy Spirit of God took up residence.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.460
Isn't that awesome?

00:29:55.460 --> 00:30:00.100
We can talk about the difference between the indwelling of the Spirit of God and the…

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.700
filling of the Spirit of God.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.860
And we understand the moment of salvation,

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.100
the Holy Spirit of God indwells us.

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.220
I didn't understand all of it when I got saved,

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.780
and you probably didn't understand all of it

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:11.100
when you got saved either.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.020
But the Spirit of God, the Bible tells us

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.900
that our bodies are the temple of the Spirit of God,

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.860
which is in you, which you have of God.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:18.860
We've been redeemed.

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:21.620
The Bible tells us that the Spirit is the earnest

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:26.220
of our inheritance in Ephesians chapter number one.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.860
This morning, as I begin to understand

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:32.180
one of the results that are mentioned

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.420
in this passage of Scripture,

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.900
of having received the witnesses,

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:39.980
that now we have the witness within ourselves.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.380
You know, the Bible talks about His Spirit

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.500
bears witness with our spirit.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.740
You know, as you read the Word of God,

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.020
as you listen to the preaching of the Word of God,

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.900
as you hear people say different things,

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.020
as you're walking with the Lord,

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:59.300
as you're receiving the witness that God's given,

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:00.940
the record that God's given,

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:04.180
there are times in which your spirit bears witness

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:05.580
with what you're hearing, right?

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.780
His Spirit bears witness with your spirit

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.260
that this is truth.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.300
There are other times that you might hear something

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.780
and you may not fully understand what's being said.

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:16.980
There's some things, nuances, whatever,

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.420
and the Holy Spirit of God is just not bearing witness

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.500
with your spirit that there's truth there.

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:22.340
There's a problem.

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:24.060
There's something here.

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.900
And His Spirit now lives within us,

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.900
and His Spirit bears witness with our spirit.

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:34.220
I'm so thankful for the ministry of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.500
the Holy Ghost that indwells us.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.300
He empowers us, but He, the Bible says this,

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:44.300
He will guide us or lead us into all truth.

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:45.580
What a joy.

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:50.620
Notice what it says for those that receive this record.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:53.060
Again, the response is demanded.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:55.020
It says in verse number 11,

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.300
and this is the record that God has given to us,

00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:00.060
eternal life, and this life is in His Son.

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.540
Listen, eternal life is in no one else

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.620
but the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.740
That's why Peter stood up and said,

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:08.860
there's no other name under heaven given among men

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.300
whereby we must be saved.

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.060
It says in verse number 12,

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:18.380
he that hath the Son hath life.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.900
He that hath the Son hath life.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:26.300
If we receive, if we respond to this record

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.620
that's been given with receiving it,

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:33.420
the Bible says that we have the Son, we have life.

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:38.420
I'm so thankful to have not only this temporal life,

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.420
but to have the truth of eternal life.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.020
I'm so thankful that in this temporal life

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.580
that God will give us abundant life,

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.460
as He says in John chapter number 10.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:51.860
What a joy it is to have this life.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.620
You know, there are so many people that are living today

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:55.620
that are walking around

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:58.260
and they really have no purpose for their life.

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.540
They don't know what their purpose is.

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:02.900
One of the questions that so many people desire

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:06.100
to have an answer to is what is the purpose?

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.140
What is the purpose of life?

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.180
Why are we here?

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.700
People begin to answer that question

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:14.620
with all sorts of theories and ideas

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:17.820
and the ideologies that permeate our society

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.260
would provide them with answers that are so far

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.420
from what God has said in His word.

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:23.780
You know what the purpose is for your life

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:25.980
and for my life as believers?

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:28.380
Is to glorify my Father, which is in heaven.

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.260
That is the singular purpose of my life.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.980
Now, when we understand the singular purpose of my life,

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:36.900
there's a lot of digging into the Word of God

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.940
to find out how I bring glory to my Savior.

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:44.940
How do I live my life in such a way that God is glorified?

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.500
You know what the Bible says of Jesus?

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.740
He always did that which pleased His Father.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.380
Wow, what a testimony.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.180
What a testimony.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:55.820
This morning, listen, I'm thankful

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.500
that I understand a purpose for my life,

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.020
but there was a time in my life

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:02.900
where I did not understand a purpose for my life.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.900
There was a time in my life before I got saved

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.380
that I thought, and many of you can relate,

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.660
you understood this as well,

00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:11.500
that the purpose of living, the purpose of life

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.540
was that I could go and I could make

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:15.220
as much as I could possibly make

00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:17.540
and have as good as I could possibly have

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.140
from a human perspective.

00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:22.460
That's what I thought life was all about.

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:26.100
But then God saved my soul

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:30.780
and helped me understand that there's something far greater.

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.260
What shall it profit a man

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.660
if he gained the whole world but loses his own soul?

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:40.660
Money doesn't satisfy.

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.740
Jesus always satisfies.

00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:49.980
What's the blessing, the result of receiving?

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.500
Well, we have the Holy Spirit within us,

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.940
we have the witness in Himself, we have life.

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.540
But then notice verse number 13.

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:00.020
These things have I written unto you

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.180
that believe on the name of the Son of God.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:04.340
And then notice this phrase,

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:07.380
that ye may know that ye have eternal life.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.660
Throughout the study of the book of 1 John,

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:12.300
we've made reference of how many times

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:15.540
He uses the word know, to have knowledge of,

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:17.780
to have that assurance.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.940
And this morning as we look at what He says here,

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.180
that ye may know that ye have eternal life

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.580
and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God,

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.420
I'm so thankful to have the knowledge,

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.860
the confidence of eternal life.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.100
I'm so thankful this morning

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.660
that He's given us this record,

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:33.020
the record's been delivered.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:35.860
And as we respond to this record by receiving it,

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.180
then His Spirit bears witness with my spirit

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:41.780
that I am a child of God and I have that assurance.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:43.900
He says, I'm writing these things unto you

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.460
that have believed that ye may know

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.580
that ye have eternal life.

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:51.060
What a tragedy for people to go through life

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.340
and not have any confidence of heaven.

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.580
How many times we've spoken to individuals in our lives

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.380
as we sought to share the gospel

00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:59.780
and they say something like this,

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.780
well, I hope I'd go to heaven when I die.

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:03.060
I'm just not sure.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.220
And they struggle.

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:06.020
In fact, you find that there are people

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:07.980
that even would go to church

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:09.820
and they struggle with their salvation.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.660
They struggle with whether or not they're truly saved.

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:15.340
Listen, God wants you to know that you know,

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.860
that you know, that you know that you're saved.

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.700
The devil is the one that wants you to doubt.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:30.380
I would say this, that it's a battleground

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.100
and in that battleground,

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.460
He has the ability to cause us,

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:41.500
render us ineffective

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:45.780
when we don't even know if we're saved ourselves.

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.220
Because if you don't know,

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.660
you're going to have a hard time talking to somebody else

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:51.900
about how they can know.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.860
Make sense?

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.740
Notice what Peter said in 1 Peter 1,

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.740
and I'll reference what Jesus said.

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:03.460
In 1 Peter 1,

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:06.220
the Bible says this in verse 3,

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.940
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:10.340
which according to His abundant mercy

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:12.460
hath begotten us again into a lively hope

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:14.980
by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.740
Aren't you thankful to be saved?

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:20.820
Verse 4, to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:25.820
and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you.

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:28.380
Now that sounds pretty sure, doesn't it?

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.020
And then it says this in verse number 5,

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.940
who are kept by the power of God

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.460
through faith unto salvation,

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.180
ready to be revealed in the last time.

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:40.100
I've said it many times over the years,

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.900
if it were up to me to keep my salvation,

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.100
I would have lost it shortly after I got it.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:47.220
But I'm kept by the power of God.

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:49.300
Jesus said this in John chapter number 10,

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.340
my sheep hear my voice and I know them.

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:52.860
And He says this, they follow me

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.300
and I give unto them eternal life

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:57.780
and they shall never perish.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:00.300
Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand, He says.

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.540
And you think about being secure in the very hand of God

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:06.300
and what a blessing to know the assurance,

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.780
to have the confidence.

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:10.220
Listen, it's not a prideful thing for us to say,

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.580
I know I'm going to heaven when I die.

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.060
You know why it's not prideful?

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:16.900
Because if you take the record that God has given,

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:18.340
if you ask me this morning,

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.860
are you sure that when you die you're gonna go to heaven?

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:23.940
Absolutely, 100% confident that I'm going to heaven.

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:27.420
And it's not prideful because it has nothing to do with me.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.500
Has everything to do with what Jesus Christ did for me

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.180
on the cross of Calvary,

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:35.820
His death, His burial and His glorious resurrection.

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:38.740
And I glory in my Savior.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.820
Notice for those that reject it,

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.420
because their response is demanded.

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:47.980
Those that reject the record that has been delivered,

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.780
notice in verse number 10, what strong language.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:52.860
The Bible says, he that believeth on the Son of God

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:54.220
hath the witness in himself.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:59.220
He that believeth not God hath made him a liar,

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.860
because he believeth not the record

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:03.340
that God gave of His Son.

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:09.460
What an indictment, making God a liar.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:11.540
Our God is not a liar.

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:15.180
He's not a man that He should lie, amen?

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:18.660
In fact, what a joy to think about the way

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:22.860
in which Paul says this in the book of Titus.

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.580
He says, in hope of eternal life,

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:29.580
which God that cannot lie promised before the world began.

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:33.500
Let God be true and every man a liar.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.500
And this morning, we find that those that would reject

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.060
the message that's been delivered,

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:40.140
this report that's been delivered

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:43.740
and how grateful we are that God has given us a report,

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:46.180
that God has given us the word of God

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:48.260
and that response is demanded.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:53.180
And for those that reject it, they are without hope.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.260
They've made Him a liar,

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.620
but the Bible says also this in verse 12,

00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:57.580
they have no life.

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.180
Notice what it says, he that hath the Son hath life.

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:06.980
And he that hath not the Son of God hath not life."

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:07.980
Hath not life.

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:11.500
Oh, they're living a temporal life.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:19.940
To use the term that was used when...was instrumental in seeing my dad saved, there are a lot of

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:24.500
dead people that are waiting to die.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:27.620
What in the world does that mean?

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:31.540
They're dead spiritually waiting to die a physical death.

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.460
And he says, they have not life.

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:37.900
Listen, understand this morning that when you trust that Christ is your Savior, He gave

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.060
you everlasting life at that moment.

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:43.820
It's the gift of God, eternal life, everlasting life.

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:50.220
And this morning, when we look at the record that God has given to us and we see that God

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:54.860
says here in this passage of Scripture, this record has been delivered, and we see that

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:56.740
it's reliable, that it's available.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:03.740
I hope this morning that we would thank God that He's given us the record, that He's given

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:11.140
us the Word of God, that it is reliable, that it is available, that I have it and I hold

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:12.620
it in my hand.

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:17.260
And then as we begin to think about a response that is demanded, and again, understanding

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:23.260
that it's an all or none kind of a situation, that we would respond to the record that He's

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:31.540
given us and this response is demanded, that we'd respond by taking heed to all of it,

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:35.780
to all of it, that we would search the Scriptures as we've been commanded to do so, that we'd

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:40.260
be students of the Word of God, that we would prove what is acceptable unto the Lord, that

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:45.020
we would take the Word of God and we would dig in and we'd say, listen, I want my life

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:47.020
to please my Savior.

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:51.220
God's Word speaks so much more than just about salvation.

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:56.020
Now I'm so thankful that the message of redemption is the message of the Bible.

00:41:56.020 --> 00:42:00.640
I'm so thankful that throughout the Word of God, it is the main focus of the Scriptures

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:06.300
of redemption and the plan of redemption as it's been referred to by William Scroggie,

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.260
great theologian of yesteryear.

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:12.140
He referred to the Bible as being the unfolding drama of redemption.

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:13.620
And I love that phraseology.

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:17.780
I love the way that he referred to the Bible that way because it is the unfolding drama

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:18.780
of redemption.

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:23.100
You read the Old Testament and how it prophesies of Messiah who would come and then you read

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:28.820
how Messiah comes and how He fulfills and all that He does and then how the church moves

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:34.020
forward on proclaiming the message of redemption.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:38.640
And I'm thankful for salvation through Christ, but you understand that the Bible speaks a

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:42.820
whole lot about sanctification as well.

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:50.260
The put off and put on principles of the Word of God, the taking heed to the Word of

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:51.260
God.

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:54.340
And this morning, God's Word requires a response.

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:57.020
You say, well, I've trusted Him as my Savior.

00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.800
I am so thankful.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:02.220
If you're here this morning, if you're tuned in via live stream, you've never trusted the

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:04.140
Lord Jesus Christ, your personal Savior.

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:08.460
Today is the day of salvation.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:13.060
The record's been given, a response is demanded.

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:16.860
But maybe this morning you say, well, I've trusted Him as my Savior.

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:19.620
And that's about as far as you've gone.

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:24.340
Can I tell you this morning that He has given you a whole Bible and desires that you would

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:36.700
take heed to all of it, to respond in obedience to it, to walk in holiness, to walk in obedience,

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:42.820
to be doers of the Word, not just picking and choosing various portions, not taking

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:46.880
and throwing away a whole segment of God's Word and saying, well, that's not really for

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:47.880
us today.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:54.780
No, no, God's given us the entirety of the Bible, and He intends for us to know and to

00:43:54.780 --> 00:44:01.300
prove what is acceptable unto the Lord so that we could bring honor and glory to our

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:02.300
Savior.

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:05.380
I'm so thankful that the witness of God is greater.

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:08.060
I'm so thankful He's given it.

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.060
It's available.

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:10.380
It's reliable.

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:15.900
This morning we need to not only take heed to it ourselves, but then we need to propagate

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:16.900
that truth.

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:19.620
There's a lost and dying world.

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:24.940
The Sunday school lesson this morning, the song service today, oh, how my heart was burdened

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:29.180
about that truth of, listen, I'm thankful that we have the Word of God.

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:33.140
We get to hear it so often, but what do we do with it?

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.900
What do we do with it?

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:41.660
I stood on the banks of the Sea of Galilee, and I also stood on the banks of the Dead

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:42.660
Sea.

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:48.100
What a great contrast between those two bodies of water.

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:53.860
The Dead Sea is much larger than the Sea of Galilee, much larger, but nothing can live

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:57.660
there, it's dead.

00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:03.860
Ten times the salt and other mineral levels are in the Dead Sea than are found in any

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:05.580
other sea.

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:06.580
Ten times the amount.

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:09.380
So yeah, you can float in it.

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:11.700
I hope you'd learn a greater lesson than just floating in it.

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:18.620
I didn't float in it, I had no interest in that.

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:24.280
It's dead because there's no outlet.

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:29.240
The Jordan River feeds the Sea of Galilee.

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:35.920
There are three other tributaries that form into the Jordan that feed the Sea of Galilee.

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.280
And then out of the Sea of Galilee is the Jordan.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.920
You know where the Jordan goes?

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:42.920
To the Dead Sea.

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:47.880
You know how much life is in the Sea of Galilee?

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.320
Holly and I stood there to take a picture.

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:52.640
We sent some pictures to you guys, and we stood there to take a picture, and you could

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.240
hear the fish jumping out of the water.

00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.020
I'm serious.

00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:03.680
No wonder they use those nets to catch fish, man, there's all kinds of fish.

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:08.520
There's life in abundance.

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:16.360
That same river goes to the Dead Sea, and it's dead because there's no outlet.

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:19.120
I don't want to be a Dead Sea Christian.

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:21.880
Amen?

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.840
God's given us so much.

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:28.240
We respond to it, we believe it, but then there's got to be an outlet.

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:32.080
There's got to be somebody that I'm sharing the truth with, that I'm trying to reach and

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:33.080
trying to...

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.200
Why?

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:38.400
Because the message that we have is a life-giving message.

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:42.560
Oh, what great opportunity God has given us.

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.560
Let's pray.

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:44.920
Father, we love You.

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.260
Thank You for loving us.

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:52.780
Thank You for the record that's been delivered.

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:57.500
As we think about a response that's demanded, I pray that we'd respond in belief and trust

00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:06.980
and faith, not only for salvation but even for sanctification as we understand the importance

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:14.860
of living in obedience to Your Word, that we would follow Your steps, that we would

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:18.740
live and walk in holiness.

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:23.220
God, if there's someone that's not sure of heaven, whether they're here or tuned in via

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:26.940
live stream, I pray that today would be the day of their salvation.

00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:31.820
I pray for every child of God, Lord, I pray that You'd help us to thank You for the record

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:37.220
that's been provided to us, the record delivered, that it is reliable and available.

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:40.260
Help us to rejoice greatly in that truth.

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:44.980
God, help us to receive it, all of it, and then help us to give it.

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:49.980
Help us to be faithful, to proclaim the truth of Your Word.

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:53.620
I pray, God, that You would move and work in these few moments as we've been ready to

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:58.580
receive and now, as we have opportunity to respond, I pray, God, that Your name would

00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:03.220
be exalted in every decision that is made, that You'd be glorified and we'll thank You

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:04.220
for it.

00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:05.220
In Christ's name we pray.

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:06.220
Would You stand with me?

00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:10.740
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed, and no one's looking around this morning.

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:15.540
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano, and as she does, the altar's open.

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:18.140
Not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how you can know for sure that

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:19.860
heaven's your home.

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:24.660
Maybe you want to come and thank God for the record, the Word of God that's been given.

00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:30.620
Maybe this morning there's areas that you have not been obedient to.

00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:34.380
You received portions of it, but not others, and you want to come and get that right with

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:35.780
the Lord.

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:41.060
Maybe this morning you want to make a commitment to God to share the truth with others.

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:42.980
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
