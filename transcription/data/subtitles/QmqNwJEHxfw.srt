1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
We're not going to quite start there, but this is the principle in which I'm hoping

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,820
to encourage us with this evening.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:15,260
In 1 Peter 5 and verse number 7, the Bible says, casting all your care upon him for he

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,620
careth for you.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,579
And keep that in mind, that will be the content of the message this evening.

6
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:26,979
But before we get there, I want you to look at a truth in Luke chapter number 10, Luke

7
00:00:26,979 --> 00:00:31,700
chapter number 10, and we'll also look at a principle over in the book of Philippians.

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,340
And I want you to look at this example in Luke chapter number 10 in the life and ministry

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,700
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:42,259
And as the Lord is ministering, the Bible tells us here about an account, particular

11
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:44,180
day, an event that took place.

12
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,500
It says in verse number 38 of Luke 10, now it came to pass as they went that he entered

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,419
into a certain village and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.

14
00:00:54,419 --> 00:01:00,139
And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus's feet and heard his word.

15
00:01:00,139 --> 00:01:06,580
But Martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him and said, Lord, does thou

16
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,580
not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone?

17
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,500
Bid her therefore that she helped me.

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:22,540
Notice verse number 41, Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful

19
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:28,419
and troubled about many things, but one thing is needful.

20
00:01:28,419 --> 00:01:33,300
And Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.

21
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,540
And I can deal with the entirety of this interaction that takes place here with Mary and Martha.

22
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,900
It's an account that we're somewhat familiar with, but I want you to notice what Jesus

23
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:48,419
said to Martha, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things.

24
00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:53,180
And this word careful that is used here in Luke chapter number 10 and verse number 41,

25
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,139
it means to be anxious, to be troubled.

26
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:59,980
And we see that she of course was cumbered about with much serving according to verse

27
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:04,500
number 40, but she was careful and troubled about many things.

28
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,419
Now, keep that thought in that example of Martha, and then look at a truth in the book

29
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:14,940
of Philippians and chapter number four, and I want you to see the instruction that the

30
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,020
apostle Paul gives to the believers in Philippi.

31
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:25,220
And we understand, and many of us can identify perhaps with Martha this evening when Jesus

32
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:31,179
says that Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things.

33
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:36,779
And there are times in our lives that we are careful, we are anxious and troubled about

34
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:37,979
many things.

35
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:43,000
Notice in Philippians chapter number four, in verse number four, the apostle Paul says

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,199
to the believers at Philippi, rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say rejoice.

37
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,559
Let your moderation be made known unto all men, the Lord is at hand.

38
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:58,300
Notice this in verse number six, be careful for nothing.

39
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:04,039
And that phrase is the title for the message this evening, be careful for nothing.

40
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:10,080
It's the same word that was used there when Jesus said to Martha in Luke chapter number

41
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:19,000
10 in verse number 41, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,839
And now Paul says to the believers at Philippi, be careful for nothing, be anxious or troubled

43
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:29,119
for nothing.

44
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:33,960
The reality is that the particular day and age in which we're living, we find that there

45
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:39,839
are many that are full of care, that are anxious and dealing with fear and anxiety

46
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:41,199
and all sorts of things.

47
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:48,240
And we see this very visible during this particular time of the pandemic, but the reality is that

48
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,339
this is something that has been ongoing for a long period of time.

49
00:03:52,339 --> 00:03:55,919
People are troubled, they're careful, they're anxious.

50
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:01,679
And we find here that for God's people, we're not to be careful for all of these things.

51
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:06,199
We're not to have this anxiety and to be troubled.

52
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:10,199
We find that we've been given this instruction, be careful for nothing.

53
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:16,160
We many times could use the word worry and deal with it within this context of worrying

54
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,679
about things.

55
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:21,839
And the reality is that we have this truth.

56
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,239
The apostle Paul didn't just say, be careful for nothing and then move on to the next principle.

57
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:32,940
But notice why it is that we can be careful for nothing, why it is that we can avoid worrying.

58
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,920
The Bible says, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your

59
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,359
requests be made known unto God.

60
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:46,880
I want you to think about that truth in verse number six of Philippians four.

61
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,399
And really, if you're with us this morning, keep it in context, even with the message

62
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:55,679
that we dealt with this morning, that there was a recognition of that woman.

63
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:03,040
For that distraught, that troubled mother, she was in despair and she was desperate over

64
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,320
the situation with her daughter.

65
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,760
The daughter was grievously vexed with a devil.

66
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,399
And the Bible, or as we looked at that message and the Bible gave us the example of that

67
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:18,320
woman and the interaction with the Lord Jesus Christ, we find that she went to Jesus and

68
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,920
she made a request.

69
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:28,679
And we saw the reality of the fact that what she recognized about who God is and who the

70
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:31,880
Lord Jesus Christ is, that she then made this request.

71
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,119
Well notice what it says here, be careful for nothing, but in everything by prayer and

72
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:44,119
supplication with thanksgiving notice, let your requests be made known unto God.

73
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:49,880
So instead of being full of care, instead of having anxiety and being troubled, instead

74
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:56,480
of worrying about the situation, we as the people of God have the privilege of prayer.

75
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,359
We can go to God.

76
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:05,640
By the way, the amount of time that we would spend praying and seeking the face of God

77
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:12,959
about the situation that may cause us to be troubled and anxious, is far better spent

78
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,359
in prayer than in worry.

79
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:19,359
Someone said that worry is like a rocking chair, it'll keep you busy but won't get

80
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,760
you anywhere.

81
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:28,779
And the reality is that we have the privilege of going to God in prayer and understanding

82
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:35,119
several things about who God is, the one to whom we're praying to, the fact that he is

83
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:41,200
the Lord God Almighty, the Lord God Omnipotent, the fact that he rules and he reigns, that

84
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,079
he's eternal, that he's Alpha and Omega, that he knows the end from the beginning,

85
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,600
that he's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

86
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,959
And so I have the opportunity, the privilege to go to God, understanding who he is and

87
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:05,839
what he's capable of doing and bringing my request unto him or I could worry about it.

88
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,559
Or I could worry, I could be careful.

89
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:11,799
And Paul says, be careful for nothing.

90
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:18,640
But in everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your request be made

91
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,640
known unto God.

92
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:28,839
Notice verse number 7 of Philippians 4, and the peace of God which passeth all understanding

93
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:34,839
shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

94
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:41,760
There's never a thing that I spend worrying about that results in peace.

95
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,239
Just more anxiety.

96
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:51,760
If you'd be honest, if there's something that you worry about, worrying about it doesn't

97
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,399
bring you any level of peace, of any calmness.

98
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:01,519
In fact, worrying about it tends to cause more problems.

99
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:07,320
Worrying, anxiety, being careful is not good for your health.

100
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,000
I mean, we can look at it from a medical perspective, I'm not a doctor so I'm not going to deal

101
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,440
with all of that, but there are some adverse physical things that happen when we're full

102
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,799
of care and worry.

103
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:24,399
And when we understand what Paul is saying to the believers here in Philippi, and we

104
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:30,480
begin to really take and apply these truths to our own lives, and understand that, listen,

105
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,159
I'm not going to worry about this thing, I'm going to go to God in prayer about this thing,

106
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,440
knowing that He's able to do something about it, and my worrying isn't going to change

107
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,479
it one bit, and then after I've spent that season in prayer, I've labored in prayer,

108
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:51,479
I've sought the face of God, not only with prayer and supplication, but with thanksgiving,

109
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:57,619
that even at the moment of making my request, I can thank Him for knowing that He will work

110
00:08:57,619 --> 00:09:00,679
exactly as He knows best.

111
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:05,599
He may not work according to what I think should be done, but we can rest in the truth

112
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:09,960
that He will do what's right.

113
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,440
And then, I can have the peace of God.

114
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,479
You say, but does it mean that that thing is removed?

115
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:19,559
Not necessarily.

116
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,039
In fact, the storm could still be very much raging.

117
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:31,400
The trouble and the trial and the circumstances could be worse than they've ever been, but

118
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,640
we can have the peace of God.

119
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,880
Why?

120
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,520
Because He is the God of peace.

121
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,780
Because He's the Prince of peace.

122
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:46,840
And He said there in John, think about this truth in John chapter number 14, when He spoke

123
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,960
these words to the disciples.

124
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,340
He said, peace I leave with you.

125
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,599
My peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth, give I unto you.

126
00:09:55,599 --> 00:10:00,000
Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

127
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,759
He says, you have heard how I said unto you,

128
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,639
I go away and come again unto you.

129
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,119
If you loved me, you would rejoice

130
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:07,880
because I said I go unto the Father,

131
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,159
for my Father is greater than I.

132
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,439
We understand that our Savior,

133
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:18,440
He has overcome the world and what a joy that is.

134
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,520
And it can bring peace in our hearts and our lives.

135
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,799
See, the truth that we find in Philippians,

136
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:28,799
we saw it illustrated there with Martha

137
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,440
during the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ

138
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,080
when she's cumbered about with much serving

139
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,479
and she says, Master, aren't you gonna tell Mary

140
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:37,400
to come and help me?

141
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,840
And he says, Martha, Martha,

142
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,119
thou art careful in trouble for many things.

143
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:45,759
One thing is needful and he refers to Mary

144
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,959
being in that position of worship and at the feet of Jesus.

145
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,360
And here we find that Paul is giving this instruction

146
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,200
to the believers that Philippi, of course,

147
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,840
preserved for us this evening

148
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,759
that we're to be careful for nothing.

149
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,599
See, if it just stopped there,

150
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:05,440
we might not know how can I do that?

151
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,360
How can I be careful for nothing?

152
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:10,879
Well, then I begin to look at what I just shared with you

153
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,279
at the rest of verse number six and verse number seven,

154
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,080
and it helps me come to that place.

155
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,239
In fact, the same word here in Philippians four

156
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:19,639
and verse number six is the same word

157
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:22,360
that we saw there in Luke 10 and verse number 41.

158
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,279
And now go over, if you will,

159
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:26,400
to 1 Peter chapter number five.

160
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,120
In 1 Peter chapter number five and verse number seven

161
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,000
gives us this great truth.

162
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And I hope that I can package it for you this evening,

163
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,360
that it makes sense as we look here at the situation.

164
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,680
Listen, many of us can identify with Martha.

165
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,400
There are times in our lives, if we'd be honest,

166
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,559
that we have been careful for many things.

167
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,360
We've worried, we've had anxiety,

168
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,599
we've been troubled and anxious over the events

169
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:56,720
and the circumstances,

170
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,519
and we find that there's a truth

171
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:00,360
that is given to the book of Philippians

172
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,440
with regard to being careful for nothing

173
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,279
and how we are to pray and seek the face of God

174
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,199
and then have that peace that passeth all understanding.

175
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:11,199
But notice what Peter tells us in 1 Peter five

176
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:12,639
and verse number seven.

177
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,240
The Bible says, casting all, how much?

178
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,880
All your care upon him,

179
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,759
for he careth for you.

180
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:29,679
It's interesting as we look at this word here, care,

181
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,199
it is not the same Greek word

182
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:35,320
that is used in Luke and in Philippians.

183
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,520
That Greek word is careful,

184
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,440
but we find that this word care is the root word

185
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,679
for the word that we find in Luke and in Philippians.

186
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:47,160
And so we see there's the similarity there.

187
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,360
We understand that he's speaking about the same thing

188
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,559
of that worry of that being troubled

189
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,759
and being anxious.

190
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,759
And here we find that Peter says,

191
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:59,160
casting all your care upon him,

192
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,080
for he careth for you.

193
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,199
And the thing that is interesting

194
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,320
about this verse of Scripture,

195
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,000
it's a simple verse of Scripture.

196
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,119
You can memorize it quite easily,

197
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:13,919
but to live it is quite the difficult thing.

198
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:19,639
The word casting means to throw upon or to place upon.

199
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,759
I mean, can you get in your mind's eye

200
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,639
this choosing of words

201
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,080
and we understand that every word of God is pure

202
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,839
and we understand that all Scripture

203
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:30,600
is given by inspiration of God.

204
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,520
And as Peter is giving this message,

205
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,080
he says casting, literally to throw upon

206
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,559
or to place upon, casting all.

207
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,279
All is an interesting word.

208
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,880
It's a simple word.

209
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,559
I had a professor in Bible college

210
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,240
that often would say all means all

211
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,320
and that's all that all means.

212
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,800
And it means each, every, any, all, the whole,

213
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,279
all things, everything.

214
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,839
I mean, it's an inclusive word.

215
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,479
And we find that he says casting all your care.

216
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:02,320
Those things that you're caring about,

217
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,759
the ones that belong to you,

218
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,440
those items that would bring you a level of worry

219
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,160
and anxiety in your life,

220
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,600
the things that you are caring upon

221
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,320
that are taking your attention,

222
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,279
it says casting all your care upon him

223
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:19,959
who's he talking about?

224
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:20,839
Talking about God.

225
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:26,320
Remember, what did Paul say back in Philippians four,

226
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,279
be careful for nothing but in everything

227
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,959
by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving,

228
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:33,679
let your requests be made known unto God, right?

229
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,359
And we seek the face of God

230
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:38,760
and we understand that he is able

231
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,040
and we find that he then says in the peace of God,

232
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,519
which passes all understanding.

233
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,760
And so we find here that the truth from Peter

234
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,119
to the believers is to cast all your care upon him.

235
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:53,679
Now, I want you to understand

236
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:55,440
as we begin to look at this verse

237
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,040
in first Peter chapter five and verse number seven,

238
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,679
that these individuals that he is writing to,

239
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,600
the believers in the first century

240
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,480
that Peter is ministering to,

241
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,079
these are individuals that are dealing

242
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,600
with great levels of hardship.

243
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,079
These are individuals that are dealing

244
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:13,079
with the persecution under Nero

245
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,480
and they're dealing with all sorts of difficulties.

246
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,720
And we find that Peter tells them this

247
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,959
in first Peter one in verse number six,

248
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,279
wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a season,

249
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,720
if need be you are in heaviness

250
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,239
through manifold temptations,

251
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:32,720
that the trial of your faith being much more precious

252
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,279
than of gold that perisheth,

253
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:35,880
though it be tried with fire

254
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,160
might be found unto praise and honor and glory

255
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,880
at the appearing of Jesus Christ,

256
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,559
whom having not seen you love

257
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:44,359
and whom though now you see him not yet believing

258
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:47,200
you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory,

259
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,760
receiving the end of your faith,

260
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,239
even the salvation of your souls.

261
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:54,760
We find that as we would look here

262
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,239
at the folks that Peter is writing to,

263
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:00,880
he would tell them in chapter number four

264
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,320
in verse number 12,

265
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,320
beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial,

266
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,839
which is to try you

267
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,239
as though some strange thing happened unto you.

268
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,279
See, the reality is these believers in the first century,

269
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,200
they were facing some serious situations.

270
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,559
They were facing things

271
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:24,359
that we cannot even begin to relate to.

272
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:28,640
In fact, as we read much of church history,

273
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,559
as we read the church history

274
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,799
that is contained in the Bible of the first century,

275
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:37,200
we read others that have written of church history

276
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
throughout the centuries

277
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,720
and we can begin to remember

278
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,320
and to see what our brothers and sisters

279
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,760
have endured and suffered throughout the centuries,

280
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,640
we find that many times

281
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,119
the things that we endure pale in comparison.

282
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,760
And to these people that Peter says,

283
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,440
though you're being tried,

284
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,480
though you're in this fiery trial,

285
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,839
casting all your care upon Him.

286
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,279
Why?

287
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,760
Why the instruction, Peter?

288
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,359
Why would you tell us to cast all of our care?

289
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:17,559
The reality is that it seems obvious

290
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:19,839
if you're telling somebody to cast your care

291
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,040
that we carry cares, right?

292
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,359
It's a human thing.

293
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,839
It's natural for us as human beings

294
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:32,200
to have this Martha syndrome

295
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,079
of being careful and troubled about many things

296
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:38,399
and having that worry and that anxiety.

297
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:41,279
There are some people that just in their DNA,

298
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:43,959
like just nothing seems to affect them.

299
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:45,399
I mean, they just go through life

300
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:48,040
and it just seems like, what is up with this person?

301
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,880
Like, it just seems like they have this

302
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,679
just island mentality all of the time,

303
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,200
like nothing ever, there's no urgency,

304
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,399
there's no care.

305
00:17:58,399 --> 00:18:00,760
And then there's others that just seem like

306
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,399
it's in our DNA to just want to care about everything

307
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:07,200
and worry about every little detail.

308
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,920
You may fall somewhere in the middle,

309
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,920
but the reality is that we can understand

310
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,399
when this instruction is given,

311
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:19,320
casting all your care upon Him.

312
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,279
We have at times in our lives,

313
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:25,519
and for some of us more often than others,

314
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,559
we have that Martha syndrome

315
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,559
of being careful and troubled for many things.

316
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,640
What do we do?

317
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,080
How do we deal with it?

318
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,919
Well, we take what Paul says,

319
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,640
we take what Peter says,

320
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,760
we follow the instruction.

321
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,640
He says, casting all your care upon Him,

322
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,479
notice this wonderful promise.

323
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:46,840
We sang tonight,

324
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,880
standing on the promises to start our service.

325
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,400
And I mean, there are so many promises in the Word of God.

326
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,799
I mentioned already that it's Peter

327
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,840
that makes that statement that we have.

328
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,440
He actually says it in second Peter one in verse number four

329
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,159
whereby are given unto us

330
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:06,320
exceeding great and precious promises.

331
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,080
And it's amazing to me.

332
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,000
And actually, as you study first and second Peter

333
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,359
and see the way in which he uses the word precious,

334
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,840
you see this old fisherman that's using the word precious.

335
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,440
And he looks at these promises,

336
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,119
obviously we understand inspiration of the Bible,

337
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,719
but he uses this expression

338
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:24,599
to speak about the promises of God

339
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,239
being exceeding great and precious.

340
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:27,880
Notice this one here,

341
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,880
for He, God, careth for you.

342
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,640
He careth for you.

343
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:40,479
Now, the thing that's interesting,

344
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,559
as we look at the Bible,

345
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,280
as we look at our own lives,

346
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,239
is that God's interested in the individual.

347
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,760
I mentioned this morning by way of introduction,

348
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,320
we're looking at the gospel account there in Matthew

349
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,440
and Mark also gave us a record

350
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,239
of that particular interaction between that trouble.

351
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:05,339
mother and the Lord Jesus Christ that oftentimes throughout the Gospels we

352
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:09,239
have these opportunities to read through Matthew Mark Luke and John and to read

353
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:12,979
about the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ and as we read about the

354
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:16,739
life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ there are times in which we see

355
00:20:16,739 --> 00:20:22,199
him ministering to the multitudes right the multitudes are gathered in the

356
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:26,919
feeding of the 5,000 and the feeding of the 4,000 and there are times in which we

357
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:32,199
see the Lord Jesus Christ ministering amongst the multitudes the fact of the

358
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:36,119
matter is that the woman that had the issue of blood for 12 years I mean she

359
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:40,439
came through she wanted to just touch the hem of his garment he said who

360
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:44,519
touched me and the disciples are like I mean you're thronged with people what do

361
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:50,359
you mean who touched you we see him ministering to the multitudes we see the

362
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:53,319
Lord Jesus Christ and the interactions as I mentioned this morning with the

363
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:57,519
religious crowd describes the Pharisees the Sadducees the religious leaders of

364
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,899
the day and we see those interactions but oh how precious it is when we see

365
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:09,639
him interacting with the individual the individual I think about the times in

366
00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:13,959
which you look at the gospel accounts and you see in John chapter number four

367
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:19,319
when he said I must needs go through Samaria right we speak of John 4 with

368
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:26,279
the woman at the well and you look at the particulars of that passage of

369
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:32,039
Scripture and really it would have been very unnatural for them to go through

370
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:36,799
Samaria in fact during that particular era Jews would go out of their way to

371
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,699
bypass they would be inconvenienced so they would not go through Samaria and we

372
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:46,399
find that Jesus says I must go through Samaria I must needs go to Samaria and

373
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:50,279
he goes and there's this woman at the well we find the disciples leave

374
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:55,159
remember he was they needed water and they needed food and they went to go get

375
00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:00,599
some things and during that time he's interacting with whom an individual the

376
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:09,039
woman at the well we could see how that the maniac of Gadara and you look at the

377
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,559
fact of the Scriptures and if you follow the timeline of the life and ministry of

378
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:17,159
the Lord Jesus Christ they get on the ship and they go over and they come into

379
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:24,239
the coast of Gadara and there's that one man that maniac and we find that Jesus

380
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:28,719
ministers and this man that was naked and outside of his mind that was

381
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:32,719
possessed of demons because of the interaction that he had with the Lord

382
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:38,239
Jesus Christ he's made whole and you know right after that maniac is healed

383
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:42,639
and saved and then sitting at the feet of Jesus you know what they do they get

384
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:51,959
on the boat they leave for one the maniac of Gadara and we could go on this

385
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:55,799
this evening and we could look at a number of examples of dealing with the

386
00:22:55,799 --> 00:23:01,839
the fact that Jesus is concerned for the individual and when I look at this verse

387
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:07,279
of Scripture and I find this truth casting all your care upon him for he

388
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:14,239
careth for you and I understand you being singular and plural at the same

389
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:19,359
time he careth for all of us collectively as his people but he cares

390
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:25,639
for me individual or individually as an individual and to understand that the

391
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:33,679
God of the universe that he cares about me that he is interested in my life

392
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:39,559
personally that he loves me personally I shared with the the family just last

393
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:43,399
week during our devotions and I've shared with you what we've been doing

394
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:48,159
with our family devotions in recent months and how that we've been selecting

395
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:54,879
an individual each day I'm pulling a name from a cup and that person gets to

396
00:23:54,879 --> 00:23:59,479
read our devotional but also share some things from their own personal daily

397
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:06,119
devotions that day it's been so good and so rich and just precious and just

398
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:10,639
a few weeks ago I don't know maybe a week and a half ago actually my name was

399
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:15,159
pulled from the the cup and on that particular day I had read much of the

400
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:19,720
book of John in my own personal devotions and a truth that stood out for

401
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:26,079
me from John chapter 11 was a truth that I've known but just the way that the

402
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,160
truth hit me from the passage of Scripture there's many wonderful truths

403
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:35,759
that God gives us in John 11 with regard to his plan and so on and so forth but

404
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:40,039
we find the Bible when we think about the fact that God loves us as

405
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:45,359
individuals you know it's interesting when Lazarus was sick there in John

406
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,919
chapter 11 when his sister sent those servants you know what they said to the

407
00:24:49,919 --> 00:25:02,160
Lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick he whom thou lovest is sick we find that

408
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:08,279
on several occasions here in John chapter 11 that the truth is revealed to

409
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:14,519
us with regard to the love that Jesus had for an individual for God so loved

410
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:19,440
the world we understand that truth and we rejoice in that truth but then when

411
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:26,440
we narrow it right in and say that means me individually and we find that

412
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:35,079
Peter says casting all your care upon him for he careth for you you know that

413
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:42,479
God wants you to cast your care upon him he does he doesn't want us to carry it I

414
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:47,959
think about this in the context of many things and we could look at the truth in

415
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:55,239
Matthew chapter 5 as Jesus is speaking there and giving the sermon sorry

416
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:59,359
Matthew chapter 6 the sermon on them out and as he's talking to them about not

417
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,559
being concerned about the things that they would eat or drink and so on and so

418
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,839
forth and the fact that they're to seek first the kingdom of God you know I I

419
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:12,440
don't want my kids to worry about how the food is going to be on the table or

420
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,000
how this is going to happen as a parent you don't want your children being

421
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:24,079
careful worrying about those things God is our Heavenly Father he doesn't want

422
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:29,639
us worried about the things of this world he wants us casting throwing down

423
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:35,279
placing upon he wants us to cast all of our care upon him why because he cares

424
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:41,539
for us he careth for you as an individual see sometimes in our lives we

425
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:46,639
suffer with the Martha syndrome we see it in Luke 10 in verse 41 we started

426
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:51,679
there this evening sometimes we suffer with that thing and we deal with that

427
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:58,679
we are careful troubled about many things oftentimes there are things that

428
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:05,679
we could never change way beyond our ability but even if there were things

429
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,359
that we could change we're not supposed to be careful about it we're not we're

430
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:14,720
supposed to worry about them and we take the instruction of Paul and of Peter and

431
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,919
we say to you this evening casting all your care upon him for he careth for you

432
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:28,079
what a great promise to know that God cares about you he cares about me and he

433
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,160
wants you to cast your care upon him what are you anxious about what are you

434
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:39,440
worried about would you spend that time in prayer instead of worrying about

435
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:45,199
instead of taking the time to worry and fret over it just spend that time in

436
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:50,639
prayer he's able to do something about it let your request be made known unto

437
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:58,239
God and then we can have the result that peace of God which passeth all

438
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:04,880
understanding worry has never produced peace in my life it just hasn't when I

439
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,079
was a kid my mom used to tell me I was a worrywart do you remember that yeah

440
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:15,440
that's why Brianna got that passed down amen and she's saying thanks thanks dad

441
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,440
throwing me right under the bus but when I was a kid my mom used to tell me all

442
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,160
the time I was a worrywart and I'd worry about things I don't even know why I'd

443
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,959
worry about things I'd worry about worrying about something and then after

444
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:33,359
you and I'm not saying that I've conquered it completely but man when you

445
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,320
get in the truth of the Word of God and you say this isn't something I have to

446
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,799
be careful about I don't have to worry about it it doesn't mean I don't care

447
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:45,279
about what happens just means I'm not gonna worry about it I'm not gonna be

448
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:51,959
full of that care anxiety and trouble why because I'm gonna go to God and let

449
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:56,919
him take care of it and let him deal with it I'm gonna cast physically that

450
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:01,359
process of casting all our care upon him now here's the here's the real catch

451
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:08,080
don't take it back right once you cast it upon him and you say I'm gonna I'm

452
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:14,520
gonna leave this with the Lord leave it there right don't leave from that place

453
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,359
of prayer and go ahead and take all those cares back with you no leave it

454
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:25,559
there let God work let God do what God can do casting all your care upon him

455
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:32,520
Paul said be careful for nothing father we love you we thank you for loving us

456
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,559
we thank you for the privilege of being able to gather together this evening

457
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:45,440
thank you for just the the truth of your word and I know that many of us can

458
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:51,080
relate to this Martha syndrome as we've kind of called it this evening there

459
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:59,039
are times in our lives we'd be honest that we are full of care we worry we are

460
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,039
troubled we have anger

461
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:04,239
anxiety, anxiousness.

462
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:07,139
Lord, would you help us

463
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:10,759
to follow the admonition of Scripture?

464
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:13,239
Would you help us to experience Your grace in this area?

465
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:15,599
Help us to recognize

466
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:16,759
that You care about us,

467
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:18,319
that You love us

468
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,479
as an individual.

469
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:22,519
We know that there are over 7 billion people

470
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:26,359
in the world today.

471
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:31,119
You are the Almighty God.

472
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:35,479
You care about us as individuals.

473
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:38,399
We can bring and cast our care upon You.

474
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,799
Would You help us, Lord,

475
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,279
to have the peace of God

476
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:45,439
which passeth all understanding?

477
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:48,399
We'll thank You for the work that You do in our hearts.

478
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,759
It's in Christ's name we pray,

479
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:51,759
Amen.
