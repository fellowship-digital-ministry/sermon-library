1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
I'm thankful for the Word of God.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,799
The last couple of weeks,

3
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:05,719
we've had the opportunity to study,

4
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:07,800
we've noted the greatness of God,

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,279
and we've said that God's greatness

6
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:11,920
is revealed first through inspiration.

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,520
I'm thankful that the Bible tells us

8
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,280
that all scripture is given by inspiration of God

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,840
and is profitable.

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,280
I'm so thankful that God has given us His Word

11
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,020
and not only the truth of inspiration,

12
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,079
but then we dealt with the truth of preservation,

13
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,600
and preservation reveals the greatness of God.

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,680
I'm thankful this morning that God has preserved His Word.

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,759
I said this last week,

16
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,400
that inspiration is a precious Bible truth,

17
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,279
but without preservation,

18
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:43,560
inspiration really only affects

19
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,799
the initial immediate recipients.

20
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:48,959
And I'm thankful that this morning,

21
00:00:48,959 --> 00:00:53,180
when we have the truth of the preserved Word of God,

22
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,159
that we can rejoice in how great our God is.

23
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,240
He is eternal.

24
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,599
I think about what the psalmist said.

25
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:00,520
We're here in 2 Peter.

26
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,360
We're gonna stay here,

27
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,799
but I want you to hear these words from the psalmist

28
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:06,639
in Psalm 111, in verse number four.

29
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:07,839
The Bible says this,

30
00:01:07,839 --> 00:01:09,760
He, speaking of the Lord,

31
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,360
hath made His wonderful works,

32
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,319
notice these words,

33
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:16,639
to be remembered.

34
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,839
He, the Lord,

35
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:22,360
hath made His wonderful works

36
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,599
to be remembered.

37
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:26,199
How did He make them to be remembered?

38
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,599
Right here.

39
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:30,120
Right here.

40
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,519
This morning, we can read of things

41
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:35,519
that have taken place thousands of years ago.

42
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:37,720
We can read of those biblical accounts.

43
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,160
We can read of God's work and all that God has done,

44
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,639
and we say we rejoice greatly.

45
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:44,480
Why?

46
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,959
Because God has made His works to be remembered.

47
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,800
And this morning,

48
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,720
we can rejoice in understanding that truth.

49
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,199
We understand this morning as well

50
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,519
that God's word continues to be under attack.

51
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,139
It's always been under attack.

52
00:01:58,139 --> 00:02:00,400
We find that back in the garden,

53
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,239
Satan said,

54
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,919
yea, hath God said,

55
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:03,760
and then he says,

56
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,040
ye shall not surely die.

57
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,599
And we know that the Bible continues to be under attack

58
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,199
still to this very day.

59
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,839
In fact, this morning,

60
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,880
as we think about the Bible being attacked,

61
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,559
we would say that liberalism would say

62
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:19,039
that a Bible is just a book of suggestions.

63
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,360
Sometimes good suggestions,

64
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,520
but suggestions nonetheless.

65
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,800
And this book is not a book of suggestions.

66
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,860
This is a book of God's word.

67
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,479
This is profitable for us as the people of God.

68
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,520
We could speak of those which have the approach

69
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,240
and the idea that God's word could have errors.

70
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,360
It could be wrong.

71
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,699
And, but every word of God is pure

72
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:42,559
because it's been given by inspiration.

73
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:43,600
And it's God's word.

74
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,000
It's been preserved for us.

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,020
So we believe that the Bible is inerrant.

76
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,199
It is incapable of having error.

77
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,000
And I'm thankful for that truth.

78
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,279
In fact, this morning,

79
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:55,600
there are some that would say that the Bible

80
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,800
is just no longer relevant.

81
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,380
You say, do they really say that?

82
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,039
Well, sometimes they don't say it with their words,

83
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,960
but they say it with their actions.

84
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,880
They make decisions, they make choices.

85
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,720
They do things that reveal to us what they really believe.

86
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,839
Because the fact of the matter,

87
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:12,020
I've said this often over the years,

88
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:17,020
is that our belief impacts our behavior,

89
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,919
but our behavior reveals what we believe.

90
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:24,039
And so when you find individuals, organizations,

91
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,960
groups of people within the broad term of Christendom

92
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,279
that are behaving in a certain way

93
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:34,160
that is contrary to what God's word says,

94
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,360
then really what they're telling us through their behavior

95
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,520
is that God's word really is no longer relevant.

96
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,800
Well, I beg to differ.

97
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,000
God's word is absolutely relevant.

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,119
God who is eternal has given us an eternal book

99
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,759
and it is relevant.

100
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,800
It is for us today.

101
00:03:51,619 --> 00:03:52,440
There are some that have the idea

102
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,720
that the Bible must be updated.

103
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,279
There are some that have the idea

104
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:02,279
that experience supersedes biblical truth.

105
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,919
No, the Bible stands.

106
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,600
And as we look at the passage of Scripture

107
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,080
before us this morning,

108
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,240
I find that Peter, as he's writing to these believers,

109
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,479
he uses this term, speaking of God's word,

110
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,359
he says it's a more sure word.

111
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,720
We're gonna use that as our title this morning.

112
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,519
And you can see that in verse number 19,

113
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,760
but pick it up with me in verse number 12.

114
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,160
And notice what Peter,

115
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,359
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

116
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:32,000
is writing to these believers.

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,559
The Bible says in verse number 12,

118
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:36,839
wherefore, I will not be negligent

119
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:41,079
to put you always in remembrance of these things,

120
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,279
though you know them,

121
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,119
and be established in the present truth.

122
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:51,119
Yea, I think it meet as long as I am in this tabernacle

123
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:55,760
to stir you up by putting you in remembrance,

124
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,640
knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle,

125
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,079
even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath showed me.

126
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,160
What is Peter talking about?

127
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,359
He said, I'm gonna die.

128
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,079
The reality is that each and every one of us

129
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,920
are gonna die one day.

130
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,480
And Peter understood that he was coming

131
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,760
near the end of his life,

132
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,799
as the Lord had revealed to him.

133
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:18,600
And now, of course, speaking under the inspiration

134
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,760
of the Holy Spirit of God,

135
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,359
we find that he's writing these words.

136
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:24,399
And he says, listen, as long as I'm in this tabernacle,

137
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,480
as long as I'm in this body,

138
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,480
I understand that I must soon put off this my tabernacle,

139
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,239
but as long as I'm here, I'm seeking to influence you,

140
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:33,000
and I'm seeking to instruct you,

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,519
and I'm seeking to give you truth.

142
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:36,119
And notice what he says in verse number 15.

143
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:37,640
Why is he doing this?

144
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,640
Moreover, I will endeavor that ye may be able,

145
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,359
after my decease, to have these things

146
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:48,799
always in remembrance.

147
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:50,959
Peter says, I'm not gonna be here forever.

148
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,000
And we're passing the baton to a next generation,

149
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,959
to a future generation.

150
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,600
And Peter says, I wanna influence,

151
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,679
and instruct, and impact you.

152
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,399
I wanna give you the truth of God's word,

153
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,640
so that after I'm gone, after my decease,

154
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,200
that you'll have these things always in remembrance,

155
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,559
and that the work of God would continue to move forward.

156
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,040
In verse 16, he says, for we have not followed

157
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,440
cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you

158
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,239
the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,

159
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:25,760
but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.

160
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,679
For he received from God the Father honor and glory,

161
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,959
when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory

162
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:35,920
this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.

163
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,839
In this voice which came from heaven,

164
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,399
we heard when we were with him in the holy mount.

165
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:48,239
We have also a more sure word of prophecy.

166
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,119
Where unto?

167
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:52,279
Ye do well that ye take heed,

168
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,559
as unto a light that shineth in a dark place

169
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:59,000
unto the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts.

170
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,839
Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scriptures

171
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,000
of any private interpretation,

172
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,519
for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man,

173
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,040
but a holy man of God spake,

174
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,040
as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

175
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,160
In verses 20 and 21, we referenced those verses

176
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,239
of scripture in our first message,

177
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:18,959
that inspiration reveals the greatness of God.

178
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,160
And in that message, we discuss the process of inspiration.

179
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,679
How did God give us his word?

180
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,880
We understand that he promised,

181
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,559
he said that all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

182
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,519
And then in verses 20 and 21 of the book of 2 Peter,

183
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,320
he helps us understand the process

184
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,600
in which he gave us his word.

185
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,279
Now I want you to think about Peter.

186
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,279
And many of us, we can relate to Peter,

187
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,679
and we can think of Peter, and we read of Peter's life,

188
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:47,279
and we say, man, that's someone that I can relate to.

189
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,600
That's one of the disciples that I learned from his life,

190
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,440
and I see some things in Peter's life

191
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,040
that are very relatable to me in my life.

192
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,799
But Peter, as he's writing here,

193
00:07:57,799 --> 00:07:59,160
of course, he's an apostle,

194
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,000
he walked with the Lord Jesus Christ.

195
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,839
And you think about the ministry that God gave him,

196
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,920
and here at this particular time,

197
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,320
as he's ready to depart from this earth

198
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,040
and enter into glory,

199
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,260
we find that he's endeavoring to instruct.

200
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,760
And he says, you have a more sure word.

201
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,679
As I think about that truth

202
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:27,600
that he shares with us here in verse number 19,

203
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,619
and he shares with the recipients,

204
00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:31,519
the original recipients,

205
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,159
these believers, by the way,

206
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,880
they were in need of encouragement.

207
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,520
We find that they were in need of instruction.

208
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,280
If you look at the book of 1 Peter,

209
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,679
and you find the timing of 1 and 2 Peter,

210
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,080
there was great persecution, there was false teaching,

211
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,760
there was all sorts of things that were taking place,

212
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,500
and these believers were in need

213
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,440
of both encouragement and instruction.

214
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,599
And Peter clearly says in verse number 16,

215
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:58,200
we've not followed cunningly devised fables.

216
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,559
These are not just stories.

217
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:03,760
These are, no, no, we're eyewitnesses of his majesty.

218
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,200
And we find that he's writing, again,

219
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,359
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God.

220
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:09,119
And so as we look at this passage of Scripture,

221
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,520
I want you to consider two things with me this morning.

222
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,840
Number one, I want you to consider

223
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,799
the sufficiency of God's word,

224
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:18,000
the sufficiency of God's word.

225
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,119
I'm thankful this morning

226
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:22,099
that God has given us exactly what we need.

227
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:24,679
I'm thankful that as we open this book this morning,

228
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:28,020
that we can find the answers to life's questions.

229
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,640
I've mentioned in previous messages

230
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,760
with regard to studying and teaching

231
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,659
and preaching about the word of God,

232
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:37,799
that this morning, God's word has the answer,

233
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,599
that there are many books that can inform,

234
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:41,440
but only this book will transform.

235
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,440
And as we desire to maybe help ourselves in some way,

236
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,479
I wanna be a better husband, I wanna be a better father,

237
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:51,440
I wanna be a better wife or mother,

238
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,739
or whatever it might be,

239
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:55,719
that the reality is that God's word provides us

240
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:59,799
with instruction with every role that we'll have in life.

241
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:04,019
As we think about those roles and we find those principles that God has given us and

242
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:09,519
we incorporate those principles in our lives and we're doers of the Word and not hearers

243
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,519
only, we find that God's Word is sufficient.

244
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:17,839
That's why we're not looking for any new revelation.

245
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,919
God's given us exactly what we need and we hold it in our hands this morning.

246
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:25,919
And I want you to think about the sufficiency of God's Word, and I want you to think about

247
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,839
Peter writing this particular letter to these believers, and I want you to think about the

248
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,199
mindset sometimes that we can have.

249
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:38,639
Peter, again I mentioned a moment ago, he was an apostle.

250
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,199
Peter, he was at the Mount of Transfiguration.

251
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:48,319
As you read verse 17 and 18 and the end of 16 with it, and you read that he's speaking

252
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:52,959
specifically about the time at the Mount of Transfiguration.

253
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,699
See Peter was an apostle, but Peter was in that inner circle.

254
00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:00,319
We find that often as you think about that inner circle, it would be three individuals.

255
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:06,639
It would be Peter, James, and John, and you would find how God would allow them as they

256
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,439
walked with the Lord Jesus Christ to experience certain things that even the others didn't

257
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:12,439
experience.

258
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:17,359
And Peter was one with James and John that were on the Mount of Transfiguration.

259
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:19,039
What a blessed truth.

260
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:23,359
What a great experience that Peter had there on the Mount of Transfiguration.

261
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:25,519
He walked with the Lord Jesus Christ.

262
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:33,759
The Bible tells us that he heard the voice of the Father there at the Mount of Transfiguration.

263
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,799
What we find in verse number 17 at the end of the verse, the Bible says, this is my beloved

264
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,819
Son in whom I am well pleased.

265
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:45,719
And we can read that in the Gospel account and we can see that, but notice what the Bible

266
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:50,999
says in verse number 18, and this voice which came from heaven, notice what it says, we

267
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:52,599
heard.

268
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:58,559
We heard when we were with Him in the Holy Mount.

269
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,639
See Peter, he was a leader.

270
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,959
God used him.

271
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,719
In fact, the Lord Jesus Christ said to Peter after he told him that Satan hath desired

272
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:15,699
to have him, that he had sifted his wheat, he said, I have prayed for thee.

273
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:19,219
When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.

274
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:22,979
We find that God is using Peter in a great way.

275
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:26,819
You can read of his life and ministry in the book of Acts, and you can see here in 1 and

276
00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:29,419
2 Peter how God was using Peter.

277
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:33,139
But the reality is that Peter would soon die.

278
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:39,379
Peter was not going to last forever on this earth, and none of us will either.

279
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:40,659
And so what is Peter doing?

280
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,979
Well, Peter is pointing them to the Word of God.

281
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:47,739
He's helping them to understand the sufficiency of God's Word.

282
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:52,099
He's helping them to understand here in this passage of Scripture, listen, you're not just

283
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:55,419
following me as an individual that was an apostle, you're not just following me as an

284
00:12:55,419 --> 00:13:00,059
individual that walked with the Lord Jesus Christ, that even had the opportunity to go

285
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:05,019
to the Mount of Transfiguration and to hear the voice of the Father.

286
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:13,599
No, I want to point you to the sufficiency of Scripture, because he says we have also

287
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:19,399
a more sure word of prophecy.

288
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:26,039
That's a blessed truth and a blessed thought this morning, because people tend to gravitate

289
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:28,359
towards individuals that have experiences.

290
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:35,039
They begin to put a certain amount of trust and confidence in an individual, and we could

291
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:40,239
think about these that are being ministered here in 2 Peter, these believers that are

292
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:45,119
being ministered to, and how they would possibly gravitate to Peter and want to hear what Peter

293
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:46,119
says.

294
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:50,959
But Peter says, no, no, God's Word is sufficient, and I want to point you to God's Word.

295
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,879
Notice back just earlier in chapter number 1, go back to verse number 3, if you will,

296
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,679
and notice what Peter says at the beginning of this book, again, under the inspiration

297
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:05,879
of the Holy Spirit of God, notice what the Bible says in verse number 3, according as

298
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:14,719
His divine power, notice what it says, hath given unto us all things that pertain unto

299
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:22,440
life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him that hath called us to glory and virtue.

300
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,799
I'm thankful that God's given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness.

301
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:32,859
I'm thankful the Bible says, according as His divine power hath given unto us all things

302
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:37,979
that pertain unto life and godliness, and we find that in verse number 4, He says, whereby

303
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:45,739
are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these ye might be partakers

304
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:50,779
of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.

305
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:55,220
Now let me ask you, in verse number 4, as we look at this, how is it this morning that

306
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:01,059
we know about these exceeding great and precious promises that God has given?

307
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:04,500
He's recorded them for us in the Word of God.

308
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,299
Oftentimes we'll sing the song, Standing on the Promises, and what a great song it is,

309
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:13,099
and as we sing that song, we're reminded, perhaps, our minds as we're singing and meditating

310
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:18,059
upon the words of that song, our minds are filled with promises from God's Word.

311
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:22,059
In fact, there are times that in our service, when we sing that song, that I'll come to

312
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:25,859
the pulpit and I'll say, who's got a promise that they're thankful for?

313
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:28,899
And someone will share a promise, and another promise, and another promise.

314
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:34,139
Listen, I'm thankful that God said, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall

315
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,139
be saved.

316
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:39,220
That's a wonderful promise in Romans chapter 10 and verse number 13, and we ought to be

317
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:44,659
grateful for that, but the reality is that God has given us so many promises, and as

318
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:50,739
we look into God's precious Word, we read of those promises and we can say, yes, they're

319
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:54,819
exceeding great and precious.

320
00:15:54,819 --> 00:16:00,899
This morning, in Sunday school, someone said, I'm thankful that God's always with us.

321
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,859
He said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.

322
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:06,979
It's a precious promise.

323
00:16:06,979 --> 00:16:11,220
What about this promise in John 14 when he says, I will come again?

324
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,659
Aren't you thankful that Jesus is coming again?

325
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:21,179
I mean, we could spend the remainder of our time this morning speaking about the promises

326
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:25,059
that God has given, but as we're looking at this passage of Scripture and considering

327
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:31,099
this more sure Word and the sufficiency of God's Word that Peter says to these believers

328
00:16:31,099 --> 00:16:35,279
in the beginning of this passage of Scripture, he says, listen, God's given us all things

329
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,619
that pertain unto life and godliness.

330
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:44,179
He's given us exceeding great and precious promises, and how thankful we ought to be.

331
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:49,259
But notice he says this also at the end of verse number four, having escaped the corruption

332
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,979
that is in the world through lust.

333
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:52,619
How do we escape that corruption?

334
00:16:52,619 --> 00:16:57,259
Again, through the cleansing of God's Word.

335
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:02,339
You read the book of Ephesians, and you read about the cleansing of the Word in the fifth

336
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:06,859
chapter, and what a blessing to think about the fact that we can escape that corruption

337
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,859
that is in the world.

338
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:12,099
Listen, we acknowledge this morning that there's corruption in the world.

339
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,699
We can escape that corruption that is in the world.

340
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:15,699
Why?

341
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:18,179
Because God's given us a book, the Bible.

342
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:19,179
The Bible is sufficient.

343
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:25,440
Turn over to the book of Luke, if you will.

344
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:31,899
No doubt as you're turning to the book of Luke, Peter knew, and those that he's writing

345
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:38,859
to in 2 Peter were familiar with the first epistle that he wrote to them.

346
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:43,859
And of course, in that particular epistle, as we studied last week in chapter one in

347
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:50,319
verse 23 and 25, he spoke about the Word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.

348
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:55,019
And as he spoke of that in the first epistle, then in the second epistle he's saying we

349
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:58,539
have a more sure Word.

350
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:02,739
He's helping these believers to understand the sufficiency of God's Word.

351
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:05,779
Look in the book of Luke, if you will, in the 16th chapter, beginning in verse number

352
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:06,779
19.

353
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:14,659
In Luke 16, in verse number 19, this is what the Bible says, and there was a certain rich

354
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:21,139
man which was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day.

355
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:26,819
There was a certain beggar named Lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sores.

356
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:30,539
Desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table, moreover, the dogs

357
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,140
came and licked his sores.

358
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:37,459
And it came to pass, in verse 22, the Bible says, the beggar died and was carried by the

359
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:38,899
angels in Abraham's bosom.

360
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:40,500
The rich man also died and was buried.

361
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,419
Now, let me say this, and I'm not preaching from this entire passage this morning, I'm

362
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:50,019
using it as a reference point, but understand this morning that as of the point of demand

363
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:51,019
wants to die.

364
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:52,700
And after this, the judgment.

365
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,580
The beggar died and the rich man died.

366
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,979
The Bible tells us that.

367
00:18:55,979 --> 00:18:58,580
Listen, every person is going to die.

368
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:04,339
As we look here and we notice the Bible says that, speaking of the beggar that he was carried

369
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:08,459
by the angels in Abraham's bosom, and then it says that the rich man also died and was

370
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:10,419
buried and in hell he lifted up his eyes.

371
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:15,419
I want you to understand this, that the poor man, the beggar, he didn't go to Abraham's

372
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:18,459
bosom because he was poor.

373
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:22,339
Nor did the rich man go to hell because he was rich.

374
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:27,299
We find that what determines our eternal destination is what we do with Christ.

375
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:31,739
And whether we accept the Lord Jesus Christ as our personal Savior.

376
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:35,299
Understanding that I'm a sinner in need of the Savior, and He is the only Savior, and

377
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,299
we understand that.

378
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:41,299
Listen, the law in life for these individuals, the one being a beggar and the one being rich,

379
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:44,940
has zero to do with where they end up in eternity.

380
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,459
God's providing with us the backdrop and helping us understand this, and it's important for

381
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:51,140
us to recognize that truth.

382
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,019
It tells us that in hell he lift up his eyes, in verse 23, being in torments, and seeth

383
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:59,380
Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom, and he cried and said, Father Abraham, have

384
00:19:59,380 --> 00:19:59,820
mercy on me.

385
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,940
on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue.

386
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,260
Notice what he says, for I am tormented in this flame.

387
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,380
Next time somebody tells you that they're going to go to hell and they're going to enjoy

388
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,420
it and have a party, you just remind them of Luke 16.

389
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,340
I've had many people tell me that over the years.

390
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,460
It's a lie of the devil.

391
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,180
Hell is a terrible place.

392
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,640
The Bible tells us in verse 25, but Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime

393
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,720
receivest thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things.

394
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,800
But now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.

395
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,960
And beside all this, between us and you, there's a great gulf thick, so that they which would

396
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,520
pass from hence to you cannot, neither can they pass to us that would come from thence.

397
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:47,240
Verse 26 helps us to understand the fact that what you do with Christ in this life, once

398
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,760
you die, it's too late.

399
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,800
I've often said from the book of Philippians, the Bible says that every knee should bow

400
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,200
and every tongue should confess.

401
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,000
And I've said this often as I've looked at that passage of Scripture, it's not a matter

402
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,040
of if, it's a matter of when.

403
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,440
And when makes all the difference.

404
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,600
It says in verse number 27, then he said, I pray thee, therefore, Father, that thou

405
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,960
wouldest send him to my father's house.

406
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,560
Now it's very interesting as we look at the end of chapter 16, the concern of this rich

407
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,560
man.

408
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,120
Initially, the concern of the rich man is his own comfort.

409
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,760
He's tormented in this flame and he's desiring that there'd be opportunity for the tip of

410
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,880
the finger of this beggar to be in water and to cool his tongue.

411
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,320
But we find that after he finds out that it's just not possible, that he says, listen, I

412
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,840
pray thee, therefore, Father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house.

413
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,840
Why?

414
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:53,120
For I have five brethren that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place

415
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,920
of torment.

416
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:03,360
The truth of verse number 28 should be impactful in our lives.

417
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,900
This rich man died.

418
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:11,640
Because he had not trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as his personal Savior, he's in hell.

419
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:21,080
The Bible tells us that he's got great concern for his brethren, lest they come into this

420
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,720
place of torment.

421
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,760
He knew his brothers.

422
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,720
Seems quite obvious to me that he knew that they were headed to the same destination and

423
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,080
had a great concern for them.

424
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,960
Verse 29, notice what the Bible says, Abraham saith unto him, they, the five brothers from

425
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,920
verse 28, they have Moses and the prophets.

426
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,440
Let them hear them.

427
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,280
What is he saying in verse 29?

428
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,680
They have the Scriptures.

429
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,640
They have the Word of God.

430
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,640
Remember in the book of 2 Timothy, we looked at it two weeks ago that all Scripture is

431
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,260
given by inspiration of God.

432
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,480
But before that, we find that Paul says to Timothy that from a child thou hast known

433
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,400
the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation.

434
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,440
And then he says all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, is profitable for doctrine,

435
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,760
for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God might

436
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,360
be perfect, truly furnished unto all good works.

437
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:31,040
And so we find that here, that Abraham's response to this man, he wants this beggar that's died,

438
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:36,640
he wants him to go back to his brother's house, and Abraham says, no, they have the Scriptures.

439
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,760
They have Moses and the prophets.

440
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,800
Let them hear them.

441
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,400
Notice the response in verse 30, and he said, nay, father Abraham, but if one went unto

442
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,840
them from the dead, they will repent.

443
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,600
Now I think he believed that.

444
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,440
I want you to notice how the text ends.

445
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:04,040
And he said unto him, if they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded

446
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,440
the one rose from the dead.

447
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:14,920
A lot of people today looking for some great miracle, kind of like Naaman.

448
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:21,880
But God said, my word is sufficient, and I've given my word.

449
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:27,480
And Peter, though he had walked with the Lord Jesus Christ, though he had been at the Mount

450
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:33,080
of Transfiguration, though he had heard the voice of God, he understood that his time

451
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,740
on earth was coming to an end.

452
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:42,820
And he says to these believers that I want to remind you of some things, I want to teach

453
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,420
you some things, I want to give you the truth.

454
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,420
Why?

455
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:51,140
Because after I'm departed, after my decease, I want you to be able to remember and to continue.

456
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:58,980
And we find that, he says, we have also a more sure word of prophecy.

457
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:04,460
I can imagine, I've alluded to this already this morning, but I can imagine how there

458
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:12,260
were some that would like to just hear Peter because of what he had experienced, because

459
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,300
of what his life experience had been.

460
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:22,700
But we find that Peter says we have also a more sure word of prophecy.

461
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,220
We note this morning the sufficiency of God's word.

462
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,820
Number two, I want you to consider with me the superiority of God's word.

463
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,540
God's word is superior.

464
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:37,580
Of course, we find the Bible says we have also, picking up in verse 19, back in 2 Peter

465
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:43,100
chapter number 1, we have also a more sure word of prophecy, whereunto you do well that

466
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,420
you take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place unto the day dawn and the

467
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,540
day star arise in your hearts.

468
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,339
By the way, the end of verse number 19 is going to be the subject matter that we'll

469
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:54,020
deal with next week.

470
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,980
Now that we understand that God's given his word by inspiration, he's promised to preserve

471
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:05,460
his word, we have a more sure word, what's my approach to this book?

472
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:11,140
How do those truths that we've just established over these last few weeks, how do those truths

473
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,980
impact my approach to the word of God?

474
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:20,980
And we find that verse 20, he says, knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture

475
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:25,339
is of any private interpretation, for the prophecy came not in old time by the will

476
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:30,440
of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

477
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,500
The word of God is superior because it is given by inspiration and is providentially

478
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
preserved.

479
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,380
We see that in verse 20 and 21.

480
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,860
The reality this morning is that when we think about this truth that says that no prophecy

481
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,980
of scripture is of any private interpretation, the prophecy came not in old time by the will

482
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,980
of man.

483
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,020
I've said this before, Isaiah didn't just decide he was going to sit down and write

484
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,020
scripture.

485
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,260
Ezekiel didn't just decide he was going to sit down and write scripture.

486
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:01,140
No, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost moved these men and they spake as they were moved

487
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,420
by the Holy Ghost.

488
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:07,100
And it's all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

489
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:12,220
And that in itself is what sets the Bible apart from any other book.

490
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:17,820
That's why we find that Peter is saying we have also a more sure word.

491
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,920
Not only is the Bible sufficient, but the Bible is superior.

492
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:28,520
When we look to the truth that's contained within this book and we rest in the truth

493
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,920
that's contained within this book, why?

494
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,200
Because it's God's word.

495
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,200
And it's superior.

496
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:41,000
Listen, when you have thoughts in your mind, when you have ideas, when you have philosophies,

497
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:48,399
you better bring those things into agreement with God's word because God's word is superior.

498
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:54,679
See when my philosophy, when my worldview is wrong, when I'm in error, I must get into

499
00:27:54,679 --> 00:28:00,040
the Bible to have that corrected so that I have a biblical perspective, so that I have

500
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,740
a biblical foundation.

501
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,920
As we look at this passage of scripture and we think about the word of God being superior,

502
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,160
we understand that it's superior because of what it is, because of it being God's word.

503
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,059
But I want you to notice from the text of scripture two thoughts with regard to God's

504
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,220
word being superior.

505
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,779
I would say this, God's word is superior to leadership.

506
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:26,619
The word of God is superior to leadership.

507
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:28,860
What do I mean by that?

508
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,780
Well sometimes people look at a leader kind of like they would look at Peter.

509
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:39,940
And all of a sudden what that leader says begins to carry great weight, begins to have

510
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,020
some level of influence in the lives of individuals.

511
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:48,140
But God's word is superior to leadership.

512
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,580
God's word is superior to leadership.

513
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:55,059
Listen, today we have people that would talk about the church fathers.

514
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:57,580
What would they mean by that?

515
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,979
Well they're meaning by individuals that have gone on before us and they reference some

516
00:29:01,979 --> 00:29:07,260
of the writings of the church fathers and they'll say, well we'll reference those writings

517
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:13,780
of the church fathers and those writings have some level of credibility.

518
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:21,140
Those writings have some level of superiority with regard to whatever matter they deal with.

519
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:26,100
But I would contend that God's word is superior.

520
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,739
There are some church fathers that wrote things that are consistent with what's found in the

521
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:32,660
Bible.

522
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:37,020
But we must always take those writings and filter them through the Bible.

523
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,020
Why?

524
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,460
Because the Bible is true.

525
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,859
The Bible is God's word.

526
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:44,059
The Bible is superior to leadership.

527
00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:47,739
Peter was in a place of leadership and as we've looked and we've already read the verses

528
00:29:47,739 --> 00:29:53,940
in verses 12 through 15 and thinking about his leadership and the place where God has

529
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:59,859
put him in this time in his life and he says, listen, as he's pointing these beliefs.

530
00:29:59,859 --> 00:30:05,839
believers to the more sure word of prophecy, to the word of God, he's saying, listen, the

531
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:10,199
Bible is superior to me as a leader.

532
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:15,239
There are leaders that go astray.

533
00:30:15,239 --> 00:30:18,559
There are churches that go astray.

534
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,799
It happens.

535
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:26,159
They leave this book.

536
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:33,039
If a leader, if I, as the pastor of Fellowship Baptist Church, begin teaching something that

537
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:39,279
is contrary to this book, this book is superior to leadership.

538
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,799
And you ought to get a new leader, amen?

539
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,039
And that's me as the pastor saying that.

540
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:54,879
What happens so often is churches get hijacked, is the term that I'll use, and as they get

541
00:30:54,879 --> 00:31:00,999
hijacked, good, solid people within those churches say, well, I guess we're going to

542
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:03,279
go find another church.

543
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,199
And they allow the church to be hijacked.

544
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:11,079
But the Bible is superior to leadership.

545
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,439
We use the King James Bible.

546
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:13,919
There's an issue going on right now in America.

547
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,159
I'm not sure if you're aware of it.

548
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:19,719
There's an issue over the King James Bible right now that's probably as big as it was

549
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:21,719
50 years ago.

550
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:25,679
For a long period of time, the King James Bible kind of battle kind of simmered a little

551
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:31,639
bit broadly speaking, but we've got a group of people today, I mean, this just happened

552
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:39,199
two weeks ago, group of people today that are taking churches like ours that are King

553
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:45,559
James and they're leading them to a different modern translation.

554
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:52,279
And then they had, on February 8th and 9th, I think it was, they had a conference and

555
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:57,799
invited other pastors to come to teach them how to lead your church away from the King

556
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:04,279
James, yeah, just a few weeks ago.

557
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:11,759
And what I'd say this morning is that we have a more sure word and God's Word is not only

558
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:17,519
sufficient but God's Word is superior and it's superior to leadership.

559
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:23,399
By the way, let me say this, the integrity of an individual is to be questioned when

560
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:27,959
they take over a ministry with the intent of leading it in a different direction.

561
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:32,359
It's an integrity issue and it's unfortunate.

562
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:36,079
But this morning, what do we see Peter saying?

563
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:43,799
Peter's saying, we have a more sure word, the superiority of God's Word.

564
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,919
But Peter, you walked with Christ.

565
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,319
But Peter, you were at the Mount of Transfiguration.

566
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:53,679
But Peter, you heard the voice of the Father.

567
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,119
God's Word is superior, God's Word is superior than leadership.

568
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:03,039
Let me say this, not only is God's Word superior to leadership, but God's Word is superior

569
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,759
to experience.

570
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,359
God's Word is superior to experience.

571
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,999
Now this is something that is very important for us to understand.

572
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:17,239
Peter had these great experiences and, of course, I've mentioned already about him walking

573
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:21,619
with the Lord Jesus Christ and we've mentioned about the Mount of Transfiguration, specifically

574
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:27,119
that he mentions here within this text of Scripture, and though he had these great experiences,

575
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,879
he's going to point the believers that he's ministering to, to the fact that we have also

576
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:34,079
a more sure word of prophecy.

577
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:40,519
See, there are people today that would elevate experience over God's Word.

578
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,399
It's happening all over the place today.

579
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:45,999
They would elevate experience over God's Word.

580
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:49,119
And what happens in our lives is we have some experience.

581
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:53,999
Listen, experience is real.

582
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:59,239
When you have somebody that's experienced something, it is almost impossible to convince

583
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:02,519
them they've not had that experience.

584
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:06,639
I spoke with a man years ago, he said, I saw a vision, and I mean, he was absolutely

585
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:09,399
100% convinced that he saw a vision.

586
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:14,039
And I was just a young man, I was probably 19, 20 years old, 20, maybe 21, just in that

587
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:17,599
ballpark, a young man, and I thought, this guy's crazy.

588
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,679
That's my initial thought when he was explaining this to me.

589
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,000
But then as I listened to him, I didn't tell him he was crazy, that's just what I thought,

590
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,639
and then as I listened to him, I realized he was absolutely certain that he had this

591
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,639
experience.

592
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:33,419
There was absolutely nothing I was going to do to tell him he didn't have that experience.

593
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:37,919
There are people today that are having experiences, and they're experiences that are contrary

594
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:40,119
to God's Word.

595
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:44,519
And what happens is when they have an experience that's contrary to God's Word, unfortunately,

596
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:48,719
there are many people that take and they say, well, that was my experience, and all of a

597
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:55,119
sudden their experience trumps the Word of God.

598
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:01,879
But Peter's saying, no, no, no, listen, God's Word is sufficient and God's Word is superior,

599
00:35:01,879 --> 00:35:07,439
and God's Word is superior to leadership, but it's also superior to experience.

600
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:13,799
Turn over to the book of 2 Corinthians, if you will, and let me read a passage of Scripture

601
00:35:13,799 --> 00:35:20,119
to you as we consider this thought that God's Word is superior to experience.

602
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:25,399
God's Word is superior to experience.

603
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:29,919
People today say, well, I want to figure out, I want to understand what it is that I experienced.

604
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:36,079
I want to have an understanding as I look to the Bible and I see the truth of the Word

605
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,399
of God, but yet I had this experience and I want to try to understand how does that

606
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:42,399
jive?

607
00:35:42,399 --> 00:35:44,119
What did that really mean?

608
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:48,359
We must dig into the Bible, we must dig into the Bible.

609
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:58,639
The Bible tells us in verse number 13 of 2 Corinthians chapter number 11, 2 Corinthians

610
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:06,759
chapter number 11 beginning in verse number 13, the Bible says, for such are false apostles,

611
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:14,079
deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.

612
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:22,119
I want you to notice verse 14, it says, in no marvel, for Satan himself is transformed

613
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:30,699
into an angel of light, therefore, it's no great thing if his ministers also be transformed

614
00:36:30,699 --> 00:36:37,399
as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works.

615
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:45,159
These verses of Scripture in 2 Corinthians 11 are verses that should cause us to be sober,

616
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:52,699
to understand the spiritual battle that we're engaged in and the tactics of the enemy.

617
00:36:52,699 --> 00:36:56,359
In fact, earlier in this book, and you don't need to turn back, but in 2 Corinthians chapter

618
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:01,639
number 2 and verse number 11, Paul says this, lest Satan should get an advantage of us for

619
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:05,639
we are not ignorant of his devices.

620
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:09,599
And as we look at this 11th chapter of the book of 2 Corinthians, we find that God is

621
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,279
revealing to us some of how it is that the enemy works.

622
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:19,759
And he says, no marvel, for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light, and

623
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:25,159
if he is, it says, therefore, it's no great thing if his ministers also be transformed

624
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:32,279
as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works.

625
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:35,039
So the Word of God is superior to experience.

626
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:40,519
You say, well, I experienced such and such, and I had this experience.

627
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:44,799
I talk to people and ask them about being saved, are you sure that heaven's your home?

628
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:47,119
Well, this is my experience.

629
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,559
I'm not asking you about your experience, I'm asking if you've trusted Christ as your

630
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:52,559
Savior.

631
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:56,919
I've had people say, in fact, I've seen a number of videos in the past week about this

632
00:37:56,919 --> 00:38:01,919
very thing, that people have said, well, I've spoken in tongues.

633
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:05,000
And they begin to try to say that speaking in tongues is the evidence of either being

634
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,519
saved or being filled with the Holy Spirit of God, but as you look at the Bible, it's

635
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:12,839
not always that…yes, there's a biblical truth of tongues, but they always speak in

636
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:13,839
a known language.

637
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:19,079
It's a sign for the unbelievers, the Bible tells us, for the Jews.

638
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:24,679
And begin to have this experience, and they cannot understand their experience with regard

639
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,959
to what does the Bible say, why?

640
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:34,119
Because what happens, we begin to elevate our experience over what God said in His Word.

641
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:38,760
But God's Word is superior to experience.

642
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:45,079
And we must understand that we bring every…in fact, in this same passage in chapter number

643
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:51,279
10, look back actually at 2 Corinthians chapter number 10, notice what he says in verse number

644
00:38:51,279 --> 00:38:52,279
five.

645
00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:56,279
This is…it goes right together with this when you think about experience, in 2 Corinthians

646
00:38:56,279 --> 00:39:00,479
10, in verse number five, he says, casting down imaginations and every high thing that

647
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:04,799
exalted itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought

648
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:06,079
to the obedience of Christ.

649
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,380
I would say this, not only bringing every thought into obedience of Christ, but every

650
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,880
experience of the obedience of Christ.

651
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,079
What is this that happened?

652
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:15,719
What did I experience here, there, or somewhere else?

653
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:23,200
But we say God's Word is superior to our experiences, it's superior.

654
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:33,559
So Peter, he's about to die, he says, I must put off this, my earthly tabernacle.

655
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:37,880
But though this is going to happen shortly, I want to give you some truth.

656
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:43,119
I want to help you, I want to instruct you, and influence you, and impact you, and I want

657
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:54,359
to point you to the Word of God, because we have also a more sure word of prophecy.

658
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:59,719
Listen, this book, because of what it is, is so precious.

659
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:07,679
And we must elevate the Lord Jesus Christ, and we must place a priority on the preaching

660
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:09,719
of God's Word.

661
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:15,399
And understanding, even as we look next week, why are we taking three weeks to set the foundation

662
00:40:15,399 --> 00:40:17,919
for how it is that I approach the Bible?

663
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:22,639
Because we will never, I will never, and you will never approach the Bible in the way that

664
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:28,599
we should if we don't first understand what it is.

665
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:34,119
If we don't first have an understanding of what this book is, we're not going to approach

666
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:37,039
it the way that we should.

667
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:42,439
It's no longer going to be a situation of, I'll read it if I get around to it.

668
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:46,919
No, it's going to take a place of priority.

669
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:47,919
I must.

670
00:40:47,919 --> 00:40:56,039
We'll say, as Job said, the words of thy mouth are more necessary than my food.

671
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,859
You think about that.

672
00:40:57,859 --> 00:41:02,059
Most of us aren't skipping any meals, I haven't skipped any recently at least, and the reality

673
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:06,699
is that we get hungry for sustenance.

674
00:41:06,699 --> 00:41:12,859
I wonder how often we get hungry for God's Word.

675
00:41:12,859 --> 00:41:15,579
I just need to get in the Bible.

676
00:41:15,579 --> 00:41:17,979
I just can't wait to read.

677
00:41:17,979 --> 00:41:24,539
I'm so excited for what God's going to show me, what God's going to reveal to me.

678
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:31,579
You see, when we understand what this book is, it will impact greatly what our approach

679
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:34,219
to this book is.

680
00:41:34,219 --> 00:41:38,859
He says in the same passage of Scripture, we have a more sure word of prophecy.

681
00:41:38,859 --> 00:41:43,139
He says this, and I love the imagery, and I'll give you a sneak peek the next week.

682
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:47,699
He says, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed.

683
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:53,659
It is in our best interest to take heed to God's Word because of what it is.

684
00:41:53,779 --> 00:42:02,179
Then he uses an illustration, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place.

685
00:42:02,179 --> 00:42:05,339
Have you ever been in a dark place?

686
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:08,619
I mean, today it's light out, if we turn all the lights off in here, you'd still be able

687
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:09,619
to see perfectly fine.

688
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:13,659
How many of you have ever been to the caverns out in Shenandoah?

689
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:16,859
I don't know if they still do this or not, but the last time I was there, they turned

690
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:19,299
all the lights off.

691
00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:22,179
Anyone have that experience when you went to the caverns and they turn all the lights

692
00:42:22,179 --> 00:42:26,379
off and they said, wave your hand in front of you, and you can't see anything?

693
00:42:26,379 --> 00:42:29,859
I mean, it is dark, right?

694
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:33,459
You experienced it?

695
00:42:33,459 --> 00:42:38,859
So if we're in that place and it's dark like that, and you pull out a handy Fellowship

696
00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:45,019
Baptist Church key chain flashlight, because we give those things out every year, but you

697
00:42:45,019 --> 00:42:50,619
grab one of those things and you're in the room down there with 50 people, and you turn

698
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:52,579
that light on, what do you think is going to happen?

699
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:54,979
It's going to get people's attention.

700
00:42:54,979 --> 00:42:57,859
You're going to look to that light.

701
00:42:57,859 --> 00:43:00,179
I mean, without thinking about it.

702
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:03,579
In fact, if you're knowledgeable that somebody is going to turn on a light and you try to

703
00:43:03,579 --> 00:43:06,339
tell yourself, don't look, don't look, don't you ever do that?

704
00:43:06,339 --> 00:43:08,039
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it.

705
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:11,779
But man, that light comes on and it's just an instinct.

706
00:43:11,779 --> 00:43:15,619
That's the illustration that Peter uses.

707
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:21,019
And we do well that we take heed, and he says that as we're looking at a light that

708
00:43:21,019 --> 00:43:27,979
shineth in a dark place, but we understand this morning, God's Word is sufficient.

709
00:43:27,979 --> 00:43:32,579
People today are running around looking for some kind of new revelation, looking for some

710
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:37,819
new experience, while at the same time they're neglecting this book.

711
00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:45,179
I don't know, God said, I've given you the Bible, and it's a more sure word of prophecy.

712
00:43:45,739 --> 00:43:47,259
It is sufficient.

713
00:43:47,259 --> 00:43:51,099
Peter says, I want to point you to the Word of God.

714
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:52,099
It's sufficient.

715
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:59,219
And then he says, it's superior, superior to leadership.

716
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,699
Leaders can be wrong.

717
00:44:00,699 --> 00:44:03,539
I've been wrong.

718
00:44:03,539 --> 00:44:04,539
Leaders can be wrong.

719
00:44:04,539 --> 00:44:06,539
We are humans.

720
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:14,219
Peter can be wrong, not as he's penning Scripture, but in his leadership, but God's Word is never

721
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:15,739
wrong.

722
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:23,699
It's incapable of error, and therefore, Peter says it's superior to leadership.

723
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:25,299
It's superior to your leadership.
