1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,639
Oh, man, it's all true, but I'm thankful that the word of God continues

2
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:09,060
and says that he has a plan for us to be redeemed,

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:14,560
to be reconciled to God through the blood of Jesus Christ.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,979
Isn't that wonderful?

5
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:18,700
And I'm so thankful this morning to be a Christian.

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,700
I'm thankful that the gospel came to my family,

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,819
that my dad heard the truth of the gospel.

8
00:00:24,819 --> 00:00:28,159
And of course, the privilege that I have had to be saved

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,239
and then to walk with the Lord.

10
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,900
The reality is that when I trust that Christ and when you trust it,

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,240
Christ, is that we were delivered from the penalty and power of sin.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,880
The penalty of sin is this for the wages of sin is death.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,380
That's the penalty.

14
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,919
And that salvation, we were delivered from the penalty of sin.

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,180
That death that's being spoken of in Romans six is the second death.

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,139
And if you look at Revelation, the Bible tells us that

17
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:02,919
if we've been born again, that the second death has no power over us.

18
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:04,919
And that's glorious.

19
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:07,040
That is wonderful. Amen.

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,379
And it gives us a joy that's unspeakable.

21
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:15,480
It gives us a desire to live for him and to walk with him.

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,519
And it causes us to to to just interpret the things

23
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,860
in which we're dealing with on this earth, that I'm just a pilgrim and a stranger.

24
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,319
I mean, this world is not my home. Amen.

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,160
Aren't you thankful for that?

26
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,120
And what a blessing.

27
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,080
And we find that we were delivered from the penalty of sin.

28
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,800
We're also delivered from the power of sin.

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,000
The Book of Romans in the sixth chapter, we'll look at

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,379
at the end of the message this morning.

31
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:43,980
Paul says that sin shall no longer have dominion over you.

32
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:48,839
And what a blessing to know that God gives us the victory,

33
00:01:48,839 --> 00:01:51,319
the strength to to overcome.

34
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,680
But the reality is that as we sojourn in this sinful world,

35
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,860
we still have this flesh.

36
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,440
Amen. Wouldn't you want to be wonderful

37
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,860
if when we got saved, like the flesh was just no longer part of us anymore?

38
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,279
I think it'd be a wonderful thing, wouldn't it?

39
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:14,460
You know, one day this mortal shall put on immortality.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,500
Amen. This corruption shall put on incorruption.

41
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,039
What a blessing.

42
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:22,940
But until that day, you have the flesh and I have the flesh.

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,119
Amen. And Galatians five in verse number 17 tells us

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,860
that the flesh lusteth against the spirit.

45
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,199
They're at enmity, one against the other.

46
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,880
Have you found it to be so?

47
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,619
Amen. There's a great conflict that we deal with, right?

48
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,800
And we understand this conflict.

49
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,380
And the reality is that prior to salvation,

50
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,339
you really didn't have a conflict with your flesh.

51
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:50,220
Right. I mean, you just fed the flesh

52
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,320
and you just fulfilled the appetites of the flesh.

53
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,860
And there was no you were not quickened.

54
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,699
You were not made alive.

55
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:57,820
The spirit of God did not dwell within you.

56
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:03,160
And therefore you did not have the same conflict prior to salvation

57
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,199
that you currently do as a saved child of God dealing with your flesh.

58
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,460
You didn't have that conflict.

59
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,800
But now you have that conflict.

60
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,300
And we find that when we have that conflict

61
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,880
and we understand what God tells us with regard to that,

62
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:21,979
we can rejoice greatly that he's given us instruction

63
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,220
on how to deal with the flesh during this period of time

64
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,059
before we go to be with the Lord.

65
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:30,779
Now, one day, as I mentioned a moment ago, one glorious day,

66
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:32,899
we will be with him.

67
00:03:32,899 --> 00:03:34,699
What a glorious day.

68
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:36,899
I shall see him. Amen.

69
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,580
These aren't just songs that cause you to kind of, oh, this is wishful thinking.

70
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,500
No, no. It is absolute truth that one day, one glorious day,

71
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,160
we will be in the very presence of God almighty.

72
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,839
Notice in First Corinthians 15, I want to begin reading

73
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,460
in verse number 39.

74
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,259
The study this morning is in Colossians three, and we'll make it there

75
00:03:59,259 --> 00:03:59,960
in just a moment.

76
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,759
But notice in First Corinthians 15 in verse number 39,

77
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:05,639
all flesh is not the same flesh.

78
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,600
But there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beast,

79
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,440
another of fishes and another of birds.

80
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,419
There are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial.

81
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:17,220
But the glory of the celestial is one in the glory of the terrestrial is another.

82
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,940
There is one glory of the sun, another glory, the moon,

83
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,140
another glory, the stars for one star differs from another star in glory.

84
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,399
So also is the resurrection of the dead.

85
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:29,980
It is sown in corruption.

86
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:33,279
Notice it is raised in incorruption.

87
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,079
It is sown in dishonor.

88
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,459
It is raised in glory.

89
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:37,820
It is sown in weakness.

90
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,619
It is raised in power.

91
00:04:39,619 --> 00:04:41,600
It is sown a natural body.

92
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,220
It is raised a spiritual body.

93
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:47,859
There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body.

94
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:49,980
And so it is written.

95
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,480
The first man, Adam, was made a living soul.

96
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,019
The last Adam was made a quickening spirit referring to the Lord Jesus Christ.

97
00:04:57,019 --> 00:05:00,739
Verse 46, how be it that was not first, which is spiritual,

98
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:05,079
but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual.

99
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,660
The first man is of the earth earthy.

100
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:12,420
The second man is the Lord from heaven and is excuse me, verse 48,

101
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,920
as is the earthy such one, they also that are earthy

102
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:21,500
and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.

103
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:24,559
And as we have borne the image of the earthy,

104
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,519
we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.

105
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,820
Now this, I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit

106
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,399
the kingdom of God, neither does corruption inherit incorruption.

107
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,859
Behold, I show you a mystery.

108
00:05:40,059 --> 00:05:44,739
We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in the moment

109
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,320
in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound

110
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:55,239
and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed

111
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,000
for this corruptible.

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,500
Notice this must put on incorruption.

113
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:06,000
Notice this mortal must put on immortality.

114
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,399
So in this corruptible shall have put on incorruption

115
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,100
and this mortal shall have put on immortality.

116
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,980
Then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written.

117
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:17,399
Death is swallowed up in victory.

118
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,059
Oh, death, where is thy sting?

119
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:22,660
Oh, grave, where is thy victory?

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,700
The sting of death is sin and the strength of the of sin is the law.

121
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:32,959
But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory

122
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:35,079
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

123
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:39,799
Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, unmovable,

124
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,220
always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know,

125
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,140
that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

126
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:51,839
One day we're going to be with them.

127
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:56,220
The last trump is going to sound and we will be changed.

128
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,140
And this corruption shall put on incorruption and this mortal

129
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,760
shall put on immortality.

130
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,760
But until that day, you have the flesh and so do I.

131
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,059
So Colossians chapter number three.

132
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:11,940
To start this particular chapter is you'll be mindful

133
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,019
if you've studied along with us.

134
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:17,279
The Apostle Paul begins chapter number three by reminding

135
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,739
the people of God of their position.

136
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,899
Aren't you so thankful to understand your position in Christ

137
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:27,459
that we have been born again, that we're Christians, we're his children,

138
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:31,579
we've been adopted and we can cry Abba Father

139
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:34,959
and we have access to the very throne room of heaven

140
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,920
that that Jesus Christ is our advocate,

141
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,339
that we have this position.

142
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,799
And we understand that as we looked at those first few verses

143
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:47,899
of Colossians three, that when we're mindful of our position,

144
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:51,899
it will have an influence upon our pursuits, the things that I'm pursuing.

145
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:55,779
If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above. Right.

146
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:58,779
We don't set our affection on these things of the earth,

147
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:01,739
but we're setting our affection on things above.

148
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:05,600
And so we find that Paul reminds these believers

149
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:09,399
to start this chapter of their position, their pursuits.

150
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,480
And now we find that as we enter into this next section in Colossians three,

151
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,940
that he Paul will provide critical instruction regarding our walk with God.

152
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,059
You know, I'm so thankful that God gives us truth

153
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,119
in his word with regard to how to walk with him.

154
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:30,579
How to behave ourselves.

155
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:34,840
What it is that pleases God and what it is that displeases God.

156
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,500
Aren't you thankful for that?

157
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,140
See, at times in our lives, maybe you've said it.

158
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,179
Maybe you've heard someone else say it.

159
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,640
I've heard scores of people say it when they seem to want to attack

160
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,979
biblical Christianity and they say it's nothing more than a list of rules

161
00:08:51,979 --> 00:08:54,559
and do's and don'ts and so on and so forth.

162
00:08:54,739 --> 00:08:59,700
But the reality is that I'm thankful that God in his infinite wisdom

163
00:08:59,859 --> 00:09:03,599
and his grace and his mercy has revealed to us

164
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:07,320
the things that please him and the things that displease him.

165
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,440
For had he not provided us with those things, we would not know.

166
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,080
We'd be living and wondering, is this is this pleasing to God?

167
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,000
Is it not pleasing to God?

168
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,799
Paul says to the believers in Ephesus, prove that which is acceptable.

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,419
We're to prove all things.

170
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,599
Let the words of my mouth, right?

171
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:30,979
The meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight.

172
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,239
How do we know if it's acceptable in his sight?

173
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:39,580
And so Paul is going to enter into this critical text of Scripture

174
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,380
in which he deals with our walk with God.

175
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:45,340
As we examine this critical instruction this morning,

176
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,539
we'll be looking just at verses five through seven.

177
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,539
I want you to take note of a couple of things.

178
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:52,380
If you've already noticed in your bulletin this morning,

179
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:57,859
the title for the message is this, Crucify Your Flesh.

180
00:09:58,539 --> 00:09:59,739
Crucify.

181
00:09:59,739 --> 00:10:00,999
Your flesh.

182
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:02,679
Notice in v. 5,

183
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:06,179
Paul begins and says this,

184
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:08,899
"'Mortify therefore your members

185
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,219
which are upon the earth,

186
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:13,679
fornication, uncleanness,

187
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,599
inordinate affection,

188
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:17,099
evil concupiscence,

189
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:18,599
and covetousness,

190
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:20,739
which is idolatry.

191
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:22,439
For which things sake

192
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:24,559
the wrath of God cometh

193
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,259
on the children of disobedience,

194
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:31,439
in the which ye also walked

195
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:34,859
some time when ye lived in them.

196
00:10:34,859 --> 00:10:38,139
Crucify your flesh."

197
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:40,459
I want you to notice as we look at this passage,

198
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:44,579
first of all, note how direct Paul is.

199
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:47,019
As we notice the statement that begins v. 5,

200
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:48,939
we find that the Apostle Paul

201
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,419
is using some very strong language.

202
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:53,139
He gets into the text

203
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:55,899
and he is using this strong language

204
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:57,099
from the beginning.

205
00:10:57,099 --> 00:10:57,939
And he says,

206
00:10:57,939 --> 00:11:00,059
"'Mortify therefore your members

207
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,899
which are upon the earth.'"

208
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:03,579
You say, man, that sounds kind of strong.

209
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,339
It is.

210
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:06,939
And we find these being very direct.

211
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:09,419
You know, sometimes we need to be direct with people.

212
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,879
Sometimes we need to be direct with ourselves.

213
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,859
Amen?

214
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:14,379
Listen, you go to the doctor

215
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:16,039
and you've been having some difficulties

216
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:16,959
and some problems,

217
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,579
and you just know that something

218
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:20,419
doesn't seem right within your body,

219
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:21,699
and you go to the doctor.

220
00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:23,739
You want the doctor as they go

221
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:26,219
and they administer a whole host of tests

222
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,539
and they begin to analyze the results

223
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:31,179
and you want them to be direct with you.

224
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:32,219
What's going on, doc?

225
00:11:32,219 --> 00:11:33,299
I mean, tell me what's going on.

226
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:35,059
Oh, everything's gonna be okay.

227
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:37,319
No, no, something's not right.

228
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:39,459
Be direct.

229
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:42,419
And Paul gets right after it.

230
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:45,119
The word mortify means to put to death.

231
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:47,699
It means to slay.

232
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:50,499
It really carries with it this context.

233
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:52,899
I want you to think about it in this regard.

234
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:57,899
It means this, to deprive of power.

235
00:11:57,979 --> 00:12:00,739
How many of you have found that your flesh is powerful?

236
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:04,379
Yeah, your flesh has desires, amen?

237
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:09,379
And so when we're going to deprive of power,

238
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:12,179
and so he says, mortify.

239
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:14,019
Notice he says, therefore,

240
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:16,419
your members which are upon the earth.

241
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:17,259
What's he talking about?

242
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:18,139
He's talking about our flesh,

243
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:19,539
our members which are upon the earth.

244
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,619
Listen, at the moment of salvation,

245
00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:24,499
if God so chose it to be so,

246
00:12:24,499 --> 00:12:25,819
the moment you got saved,

247
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:28,699
he could have translated you directly to heaven.

248
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:31,219
At times, if we'd be honest with one another,

249
00:12:31,219 --> 00:12:34,779
we'd say, I wish it were that way, right?

250
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:38,339
Because this world, man, sometimes it just gets, mm.

251
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:40,299
I don't know what that word is, but mm,

252
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:41,939
you know what I mean?

253
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:43,299
Are you following me?

254
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:45,339
You feel what I'm saying this morning, right?

255
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:48,119
And so the reality is that God hasn't chosen it

256
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:48,959
to be that way.

257
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,719
He says, you're in the world,

258
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,279
but you're not of the world.

259
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:55,599
He says that in that same passage in John 17,

260
00:12:55,599 --> 00:12:59,799
as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you.

261
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:03,479
And so God in his infinite wisdom,

262
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:06,759
he has chosen that we as his people

263
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:09,879
are here as lights in a dark world.

264
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:14,559
You'd be mindful of the truth of John 13.

265
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:17,599
When Jesus washed the feet of the disciples,

266
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:20,079
why was it that he washed the feet of the disciples?

267
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,239
Because you get dirty in this world.

268
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:26,319
In that particular era, in that culture,

269
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:28,519
you would go and there'd be a bathhouse

270
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:30,239
in which you would go and you'd get bathed

271
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,279
and you'd get cleaned up,

272
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,759
but then you'd have to walk back to your residence,

273
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,999
and in so doing, as you'd wear those sandals,

274
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:37,719
your feet would get dirty.

275
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:42,799
You'd walk the same paths as all the other livestock walk,

276
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:44,959
and you could understand in your mind's eye

277
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,259
how that could be a dirty situation.

278
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,719
And we find that when Peter, he says,

279
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,039
no, no, no, Lord, you're not gonna wash me,

280
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:55,479
and Peter receives the answer from Jesus

281
00:13:55,479 --> 00:13:57,279
that if I don't do this, then you're not any of mine,

282
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,599
and he says, well, then not my feet only,

283
00:13:58,599 --> 00:14:01,559
but all of me, right, is that what he says?

284
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:02,679
What does Jesus say?

285
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,079
No, if you've already been washed,

286
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,279
if you've already been cleansed,

287
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,879
you've already had salvation,

288
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,999
then all we need to do now is wash your feet, why?

289
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:12,359
Because in this world, man,

290
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:15,239
we just have to live in this polluted world.

291
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:18,059
And if we don't deal with our flesh,

292
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:21,519
if we don't mortify our members which are upon the earth,

293
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,619
we're gonna deal with some real problems.

294
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:27,039
Understand, as we look here,

295
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,839
as we think about what was said earlier

296
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,559
when we talked about our position,

297
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,559
notice in verse number three what Paul says

298
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:35,319
to these believers in Colossae here.

299
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:38,679
He says, for ye are dead.

300
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,839
Now, that's positional, that's positional.

301
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,319
And so as we think about the positional truth

302
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,359
that Paul gives to these believers in verse number three,

303
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:51,559
for ye are dead, then we'd understand

304
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:54,759
that the practical response to that reality

305
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:58,880
of verse number three is that I'm to mortify, therefore,

306
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,959
our members which are upon the earth.

307
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,119
If I'm dead with Christ, if I'm dead,

308
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:07,839
then I need to then take that positional truth

309
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,799
and apply it practically in my life.

310
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,919
And the practical response to understanding

311
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,519
that ye are dead is that you mortify, therefore.

312
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,399
Remember, every time you see the word therefore,

313
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,720
you look and you find contextually why,

314
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,880
what is it that he's referring to?

315
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,539
The simple just quote or saying is when you see therefore,

316
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:30,239
find out what it's there for.

317
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:32,179
And he says, mortify, therefore,

318
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:36,160
your members which are upon the earth.

319
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,079
This is a personal responsibility.

320
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:42,799
Before Holly printed out the bulletin yesterday,

321
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,880
I asked her to change the title of the message.

322
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,419
Initially, I had entitled the message, crucify the flesh.

323
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:52,160
And the more I meditated upon the truth

324
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,519
and the more I prepared for the message,

325
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:56,039
I said, hey honey, you haven't printed

326
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,139
the bulletin yet, correct?

327
00:15:57,139 --> 00:15:57,979
And she said, no.

328
00:15:57,979 --> 00:16:00,799
I said, can you change that from crucify the flesh

329
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,639
to crucify your flesh?

330
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:04,479
Why?

331
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:06,199
Because it's a personal responsibility.

332
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,679
You understand this morning that I can't crucify your flesh

333
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,559
and you can't crucify my flesh.

334
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,679
Have you ever wanted to crucify someone else's flesh?

335
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:14,839
I'm not saying in a wrong way.

336
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:16,880
I'm not saying in an inappropriate way.

337
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,079
I'm saying that you've wanted to help them, right?

338
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,720
You see them walking in an erroneous way.

339
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,959
You see them fulfilling the lust of the flesh.

340
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,639
You see the enemy gaining an advantage

341
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:30,799
and you say, I wish I could do this for you.

342
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:33,519
But you know what?

343
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,359
You can't.

344
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:36,500
You can't.

345
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:40,479
Because it's a personal responsibility.

346
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:44,139
Crucify your flesh.

347
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:45,459
Crucify your flesh.

348
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,039
Can you be mindful this morning

349
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,940
of what the Lord Jesus Christ said?

350
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,799
You don't need to turn there,

351
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:52,299
but perhaps you'd like to jot it down.

352
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:53,720
Matthew 5, 29 and 30.

353
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,919
I'm not gonna read the entirety

354
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,579
of either one of those verses.

355
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:57,959
But you'll be mindful of the verses

356
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,000
when I share with you what he says.

357
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,160
If your eye offends you, pluck it out.

358
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:07,559
If your hand offends you, cut it off.

359
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,799
You say, well, that's kind of strong.

360
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,279
Yeah, it is.

361
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:16,239
Just as Paul's instruction here,

362
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:18,039
mortify therefore.

363
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,239
I mean, put it to death, slay it.

364
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:24,399
I like the idea of depriving it of power.

365
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,839
Depriving it of power.

366
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:31,839
So we find, as we look at this instruction

367
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,239
and we begin in verse number five,

368
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:35,959
we find how direct Paul is.

369
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:38,079
He gets straight to the point.

370
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,759
I want you to also notice with me

371
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,759
how detailed Paul is.

372
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,679
See, in this passage of Scripture,

373
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:46,519
he's gonna call sin by name.

374
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,440
And by the way, if you think

375
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,079
you're gonna get away with it this morning,

376
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,419
just come back next Sunday.

377
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:54,720
Because the practicality of it

378
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,559
gets even more where the rubber meets the road.

379
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,079
You say, oh man, I dodged a bullet.

380
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,519
I'm not guilty of any of those sins.

381
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:01,940
Come back next week.

382
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,059
Because we'll deal with some more by name.

383
00:18:04,979 --> 00:18:06,139
Right, because what's Paul saying?

384
00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:08,619
Mortify therefore your members,

385
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:09,859
which are upon the earth.

386
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:12,099
Notice as we think about the detail,

387
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:14,579
he says this, fornication, uncleanness,

388
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:17,059
inordinate affection, evil concupiscence,

389
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:20,779
and covetousness, which is idolatry.

390
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:22,380
If we were to summarize the list

391
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,019
that's provided in verse number five,

392
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:28,099
perhaps we would summarize it by saying lust and greed.

393
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:29,979
Perhaps we'd summarize it by saying

394
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:32,739
impurity and covetousness.

395
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:36,339
But as we look, we find that Paul does not summarize.

396
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:38,899
We find that Paul uses details

397
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:42,779
and he's going to call sin by its name.

398
00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:48,399
This morning, the first that's mentioned is fornication.

399
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,859
This word can be used very broadly

400
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:53,859
or it can be used very narrowly.

401
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:55,260
But in its broadest sense,

402
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,299
the word fornication means sexual immorality of any sort.

403
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,419
Sexual immorality of any sort.

404
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:07,020
And Paul begins there with fornication.

405
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,619
He then enters into the next word

406
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:12,659
that he uses, uncleanness.

407
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:16,000
Here again, dealing with sexual impurity,

408
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,380
dealing with lustful thinking.

409
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,659
Listen, do we not live in a society

410
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:26,659
in which we are bombarded every single day with these sins?

411
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,859
Is it not that we live in a society

412
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:31,739
that has made millions, billions of dollars

413
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:33,599
on these industries?

414
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,059
Why?

415
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:39,219
Because they know the desire of the flesh.

416
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:43,940
Why do they market things the way that they market things?

417
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:50,020
Because they know the desire of the flesh, right?

418
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:53,140
Listen, these folks in marketing, they're not dumb.

419
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,520
Really, the enemy understands

420
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,260
the way that our flesh operates.

421
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,899
My dad was preaching on.

422
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:02,179
Wednesday evening as he's going through Psalm 23,

423
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:04,899
and I'm enjoying the study, I trust that you are as well,

424
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:06,759
and I know that he's enjoying doing it,

425
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:10,139
and the reality is that he spoke about the sins

426
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:13,379
during the time of the life and ministry

427
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,699
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

428
00:20:14,699 --> 00:20:16,499
and he spoke about the things that we deal with,

429
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:18,859
and really John summarizes it this way.

430
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:20,799
If we would look at sin as a whole,

431
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,499
it's really summarized in 1 John 2 and verse number 16,

432
00:20:24,499 --> 00:20:26,779
it's the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,

433
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:28,039
and the pride of life.

434
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,739
Within those three categories, you can fit everything,

435
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,619
and the lust of the flesh is serious.

436
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:39,119
So he says fornication, he says uncleanness.

437
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,159
Notice, inordinate affection.

438
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:45,359
Really, this carries with it the idea

439
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:50,359
of a depraved or evil passion.

440
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:53,999
Depraved or evil passion.

441
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:57,919
It is believed commonly that this particular phrase,

442
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,559
inordinate affection that would be used

443
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,079
in this particular era,

444
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,599
was really a way of speaking of homosexuality.

445
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:12,719
And no doubt, homosexuality is a depraved or vile passion.

446
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:14,299
Is it not?

447
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:17,159
You read Romans 1 and you understand.

448
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:19,519
Listen, homosexuality is nothing new.

449
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:24,339
It's not new for us in the 21st century.

450
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:29,139
I got a phone call from somebody while I was in Branson.

451
00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:30,799
It was an unusual phone call,

452
00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:35,399
and it turned even more unusual very quickly.

453
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:40,379
And that unusual phone conversation turned into questions

454
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:45,139
about various social things that are taking place

455
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:47,819
in our world that began to ask me about alcohol

456
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:50,559
and various things, and before long,

457
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,859
they began to ask me about the subject of homosexuality.

458
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:59,579
And they concluded, based upon their own understanding,

459
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:02,819
before I could even answer any question that they asked me,

460
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:03,659
they said this.

461
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:06,559
They said, well, you probably hate those people, don't you?

462
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,459
And I said, the reality is that I have no hate

463
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:10,459
for those people.

464
00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:13,259
They're bound in sin.

465
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:19,099
I want them to be delivered by the Lord Jesus Christ.

466
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:19,999
Amen?

467
00:22:19,999 --> 00:22:21,359
They need to be saved.

468
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:24,679
And they didn't understand all that I was saying.

469
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:25,919
It was a very, I'm telling you,

470
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,719
it was an unusual conversation.

471
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:31,759
I was standing in the park at Silver Dollar City

472
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,519
having this conversation, and I'm like,

473
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,579
what in the world is going on here?

474
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:38,719
I got a text message, call me as soon as you can.

475
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:40,399
I don't really know, none of you would even know

476
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:41,539
who this person is.

477
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:44,219
And this began to ask questions.

478
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,319
And listen, the common belief of religious,

479
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:52,279
quote-unquote, people is that someone that's caught up

480
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:55,239
in some sort of sin such as this, that we hate people.

481
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:56,919
We don't hate people.

482
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:58,079
We love people.

483
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:01,679
We desire to see people saved, amen?

484
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:06,879
And so, does it mean because we speak of what God's words,

485
00:23:06,879 --> 00:23:10,119
I understand they're trying to label it as hate speech.

486
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:11,899
They're trying to use that against us,

487
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:14,619
but the reality is that when you tell somebody

488
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:16,399
of the error of their way,

489
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:18,559
is that hating them or loving them?

490
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:21,959
When you tell somebody of the error of their way,

491
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:24,939
and you tell them how that they can find forgiveness

492
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:27,479
and deliverance and how that they can have

493
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:28,879
that right standing with God,

494
00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:32,279
is that hating them or is that loving them?

495
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:35,519
Oh, it's a message of love, amen?

496
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,599
And I'm so thankful that God has given us His Word.

497
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:41,919
And we desire to hold true to that which He's given us.

498
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,619
We find that the next phrase that's used there

499
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:46,219
is evil concupiscence.

500
00:23:46,219 --> 00:23:48,759
It's not a, many of these words are not words

501
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:50,479
that we use or phrases that we use,

502
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:55,239
but this carries with it the idea of evil lusts,

503
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:58,979
specifically for that which is forbidden.

504
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:01,239
That's evil concupiscence,

505
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:04,399
this lust for that which is forbidden.

506
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:07,639
You understand that God has is that we look at His Word,

507
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:09,879
there are some things that He has forbidden us

508
00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:12,079
from participating in.

509
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:14,979
Now here's the thing, He's not gonna make you not do it.

510
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:17,479
Amen?

511
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:19,559
Have you found it to be so?

512
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,219
Your flesh, remember those desires.

513
00:24:22,219 --> 00:24:25,619
And you say that you're in, you fall,

514
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:26,679
you're in this situation,

515
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:28,579
you're saying I'm not supposed to be doing this.

516
00:24:28,579 --> 00:24:29,799
How did I get here?

517
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:31,639
You ever wonder that?

518
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:34,119
Because you have the flesh, it's like I have the flesh.

519
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:35,679
We all have the flesh.

520
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,319
And so we find that He speaks about this evil concupiscence,

521
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:41,919
notice, to end the phrase, or to end the verse,

522
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,499
end covetousness.

523
00:24:45,499 --> 00:24:48,379
Covetousness is dealt with all throughout the Scriptures,

524
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:50,819
we find it as the 10th commandment,

525
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:52,299
that we're not to covet.

526
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:53,859
We understand that here,

527
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:58,859
covetousness means greed, a want for more.

528
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:01,179
No contentment, really.

529
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:03,259
You know that we can be covetous,

530
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:06,979
and the reality is that 10th commandment of covetousness,

531
00:25:06,979 --> 00:25:09,699
that single thing of covetousness

532
00:25:09,699 --> 00:25:12,539
can cause us to break all of the other commandments.

533
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:17,059
And here's something that's interesting.

534
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:19,099
Did you notice the end of the verse in verse number five?

535
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:23,419
Here's what he likens it to, which is idolatry.

536
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:26,979
What do you think about when you think about idolatry?

537
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:29,619
Honestly, what do you think about?

538
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:31,379
Somebody tell me, what do you think about?

539
00:25:31,379 --> 00:25:33,659
False god, a statue, right?

540
00:25:35,379 --> 00:25:36,419
Yeah.

541
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:39,579
Psalm 135, the things that are made with the wood

542
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,299
and the things that are fashioned by man, right?

543
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:42,339
Those are the things you think about

544
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:44,459
when you think about idolatry, right?

545
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:46,819
You say, man, I don't have any idols.

546
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:49,739
I don't have anything like that in my house.

547
00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:54,739
But Paul says covetousness, which is idolatry.

548
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:59,779
John says keep yourself from idols in 1 John.

549
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:02,779
And so we look here and we find that he says

550
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:06,339
that this covetousness is likened to idolatry.

551
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:07,979
Why is that?

552
00:26:07,979 --> 00:26:10,579
Because the reality is that covetousness

553
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:13,559
will cause us that greed, that want for more,

554
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:17,259
will cause us to put things in the place of God.

555
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:20,799
Because I want something, whatever that something is.

556
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,479
Here, contextually dealing with the impurity

557
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:26,179
that is dealt with through all of these phrases

558
00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:27,259
that are mentioned.

559
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:32,659
And that covetousness, he says it's idolatry.

560
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:35,159
Now, as we look at this passage of Scripture

561
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:38,279
and we notice as we look at verse number five

562
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:42,259
that Paul is very direct.

563
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:45,119
We find that Paul is very detailed.

564
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:49,059
And I ask myself this question and perhaps

565
00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:50,899
you can ask the question this morning

566
00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:53,459
or I'll ask it for you, why?

567
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:56,359
Why is it that Paul is so direct?

568
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:59,339
Why is it that Paul is so detailed?

569
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:01,619
Why is it that under the inspiration

570
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,219
of the Holy Spirit of God,

571
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:05,979
he had to use the words that he did?

572
00:27:05,979 --> 00:27:08,339
You understand that every word of God is pure.

573
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:13,299
See, sometimes we don't want to crucify the flesh,

574
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:16,619
we want to coddle the flesh, right?

575
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:18,659
Because how many have ever heard that term

576
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,739
of comfort food, right?

577
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,219
You say, man, this is just gonna make me feel comfortable.

578
00:27:23,219 --> 00:27:24,819
It's just gonna make me feel good, right?

579
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:27,019
Because I had a bad day, I had a whatever,

580
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:28,519
and then you have the comfort food

581
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:30,159
and then maybe you don't feel as good

582
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,579
as you thought you were gonna feel.

583
00:27:31,579 --> 00:27:33,659
And especially if you get on the scale the next day,

584
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:37,139
you don't feel as good as you thought you were gonna feel.

585
00:27:37,139 --> 00:27:37,979
Amen?

586
00:27:37,979 --> 00:27:40,059
Holly got on the scale after we went on vacation.

587
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:41,779
She said, man, that wasn't good.

588
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:43,259
And I said, no vacation is good

589
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:45,339
unless you gain weight, amen?

590
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:48,019
And I got one suit I tried on,

591
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:50,259
it didn't fit me after going on vacation, you know?

592
00:27:50,259 --> 00:27:51,339
I mean, it's just the way it works.

593
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:52,619
I'm gonna start working on that

594
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:54,259
and try to get that under control.

595
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:56,699
But the reality is that, listen,

596
00:27:56,699 --> 00:27:59,339
we don't want to coddle our flesh.

597
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:02,379
We must crucify our flesh.

598
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:04,739
You know that I hate snakes.

599
00:28:04,739 --> 00:28:06,419
There would be absolutely no reason

600
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,859
for you to keep a poisonous snake in your presence

601
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:13,099
and just allow it to be in your presence, right?

602
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:14,179
No way.

603
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:18,059
Well, I just kind of put that thing over in its place.

604
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:21,379
No, no, you better kill that thing, amen?

605
00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:22,539
I mean, I'm being serious.

606
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:23,819
I know Dean stepped out.

607
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:24,659
I don't know where he went,

608
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:25,979
but it's a good thing he's not gonna get upset

609
00:28:25,979 --> 00:28:27,499
with me this morning.

610
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:30,139
But you understand, I'm not trying

611
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:32,819
to simply relocate a poisonous snake.

612
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:34,259
I'm sorry, I'm not.

613
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:37,299
I'm trying to kill it.

614
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:43,739
I'm not trying to just coddle my flesh.

615
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:44,779
I need to mortify it.

616
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:48,179
I need to render it powerless,

617
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:51,659
to deprive it of its power.

618
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:54,779
And so why is it that Paul is so direct?

619
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:57,739
Why is it that Paul is so detailed?

620
00:28:57,739 --> 00:28:59,219
I think for this reason.

621
00:29:00,499 --> 00:29:03,659
Because Paul understood, number three this morning,

622
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:08,499
he understood how dangerous the flesh is.

623
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:11,019
He understood the dangers.

624
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:14,339
He understood how dangerous our flesh is.

625
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:16,459
Listen, we have an enemy.

626
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:20,139
And our enemy wants to devour us, correct?

627
00:29:20,139 --> 00:29:23,859
He doesn't wanna just mess with us a little bit.

628
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:24,859
He wants to devour us.

629
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:26,259
He wants to destroy us.

630
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:30,179
And we find that as we look at the passage of Scripture

631
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:34,139
and we begin to understand how Paul is being very direct

632
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,899
and how Paul is being very detailed,

633
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,379
I can only conclude in my mind this morning

634
00:29:38,379 --> 00:29:40,579
that it's because he understands the danger.

635
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:43,859
He understands how dangerous the flesh is.

636
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:46,539
Notice in verse number six of our text of Scripture,

637
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:48,619
it says this, for which things sake,

638
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:50,019
what is he talking about?

639
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:53,099
Those things that we just looked at in verse number five.

640
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:56,259
For those things, for which things sake, notice this,

641
00:29:56,259 --> 00:30:00,019
the wrath of God cometh on the children.

642
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:01,719
of disobedience.

643
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:03,319
You understand that disobedience

644
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:05,639
leads to discipline.

645
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:07,399
What does the Word of God tell us?

646
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:08,759
You can read in Proverbs 3.

647
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:12,159
You can read over in Hebrews 13,

648
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,179
that whom the Lord loveth,

649
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,899
He chasteneth.

650
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,279
Amen?

651
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,499
In 1 Corinthians 11,

652
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:21,919
if we would judge ourselves,

653
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,979
but the reality is that as he goes through

654
00:30:23,979 --> 00:30:26,199
and dealing there with the Lord's Supper,

655
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,399
he says for this cause,

656
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:29,679
why, they were eating and drinking unworthily

657
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,079
for this cause, many are sick and weakly among you

658
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,679
and some are asleep.

659
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,899
They've died.

660
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:38,099
I remember reading a book while I was in college

661
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:39,899
and the preacher that wrote the book,

662
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:41,479
and I don't remember the author,

663
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:43,319
but it was a preacher of yesteryear,

664
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:45,119
and he made this analogy as he dealt

665
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:47,119
with the sin in the life of a believer,

666
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,599
and he said this, he said that first,

667
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,799
God will bring conviction in your life.

668
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:56,079
And if you don't respond to the conviction,

669
00:30:56,199 --> 00:31:00,239
God will bring chastening in your life.

670
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:02,319
And if you don't respond to the chastening,

671
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:06,119
God will bring a coffin in your life.

672
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:08,439
And I remember reading that when I was about 19 years old,

673
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:12,159
and I'm like, well, that's kind of strong, isn't it?

674
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,879
Begin to look at the truth of God's Word

675
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:17,399
and understand, listen, I'm thankful

676
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:19,559
that God is long-suffering.

677
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,559
I'm thankful that He's gracious and He's merciful

678
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:23,879
and He's ready to pardon.

679
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:25,439
His mercy endureth forever,

680
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,039
but you understand that our God is just,

681
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:32,879
and we must never, never mistake

682
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:36,679
God's long-suffering for God's approval, amen?

683
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:38,599
God never approved sin.

684
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:41,279
He died for sin.

685
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:47,679
What is it that Joseph said after Potiphar's wife

686
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,839
multiple times sought to cast her eyes upon her

687
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:52,999
and lie with me, lie with me, lie with me?

688
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:56,159
How then can I do this great wickedness

689
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,759
and sin against God?

690
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:02,039
See, that's how we gotta view it.

691
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:04,459
We gotta understand it in that fashion.

692
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:09,279
When David penned the repentant Psalm of Psalm 51

693
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,959
against thee, and thee only have I done this wickedness.

694
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:15,359
Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation

695
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:18,119
after he says, create me a clean heart.

696
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:22,159
And so we find that disobedience will lead to discipline.

697
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,359
Notice what he says here, the wrath of God.

698
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,639
I don't want God's anger or wrath.

699
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:30,239
Do you?

700
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,039
If you say, yeah, I'm signing up for that, you're crazy.

701
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,319
I mean, honestly, you are absolutely insane.

702
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:39,599
Read the Old Testament.

703
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:45,319
Read about how God judged.

704
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:46,319
Read 1 Corinthians 10.

705
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:48,119
These things are written for our example

706
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:50,399
and sample is what the word is there.

707
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,819
But read it and see how God judged.

708
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,239
And Paul says, for which things,

709
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:57,599
in the which, for which things sake,

710
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:00,999
the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience.

711
00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:03,879
See, I'm no, as we understand this truth

712
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:05,599
and we understand God's righteousness

713
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:07,719
and we understand God's justice,

714
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,919
and we look at this and we understand

715
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,839
that he's speaking about the children of disobedience,

716
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:15,339
thankful, I'm not a child of disobedience anymore,

717
00:33:15,339 --> 00:33:18,999
but if I behave in that manner,

718
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:23,759
then I'm going to also be in danger of God's judgment.

719
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:24,639
Amen?

720
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:25,719
I'm gonna be in danger of God.

721
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:27,319
What did God say to the children of Israel?

722
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:29,959
You know, many times we can,

723
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:32,919
the children of Israel, the Hebrew people,

724
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:35,099
they most represent us.

725
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:37,079
I mean, honestly, in so many ways.

726
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:38,839
You know what the Hebrew children thought

727
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:40,599
when they went into the land of promise?

728
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:42,319
They thought, man, look at how good we are

729
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:45,139
and we get all of this and it's so wonderful.

730
00:33:45,139 --> 00:33:47,279
And God says, hey, listen, before you exalt yourself,

731
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:49,439
remember that because of the sin

732
00:33:49,439 --> 00:33:52,479
and the iniquity of the people, they've been judged.

733
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:54,079
And by the way, note it down

734
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:57,239
that if you do the same things, you're gonna be judged.

735
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:59,439
Is that not, I mean, I know that's not, quote,

736
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:01,879
verse of the Bible, but in essence,

737
00:34:01,879 --> 00:34:04,959
that's what God says to the children of Israel.

738
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,559
And what did they do?

739
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,519
They learned their ways.

740
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:10,239
They behaved in the same manner

741
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,319
in which the inhabitants of the land behaved.

742
00:34:14,279 --> 00:34:15,639
And what happened?

743
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,879
Well, you read the book of Judges.

744
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:19,679
They were oppressed for long periods of time.

745
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:24,759
You read about in the books of history

746
00:34:24,759 --> 00:34:27,119
of the Old Testament and some of the prophets as well

747
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,559
about how they were taken into captivity.

748
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:33,559
God's serious.

749
00:34:34,479 --> 00:34:36,319
And Paul understood the danger.

750
00:34:36,319 --> 00:34:38,079
So he talks about in verse number six

751
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,799
that disobedience will lead to discipline.

752
00:34:39,799 --> 00:34:41,599
In verse number seven, notice where he says,

753
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,059
in the witchy also walk some time when you lived in them.

754
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,999
See, many times throughout the Word of God,

755
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:53,999
we'll see this phraseology of in times past, but now.

756
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,999
And we think here, though those words aren't all used,

757
00:34:56,999 --> 00:34:59,199
he says, ye also walked some time,

758
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,159
in the witchy also walk some time when ye lived in them.

759
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:03,239
What's he talking about?

760
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:07,359
Their life prior to calvary, their life prior to conversion.

761
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,559
And here's the thing, the flesh has a desire,

762
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:11,559
and we understand that.

763
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:13,759
I've belabored that point this morning,

764
00:35:13,759 --> 00:35:16,119
but if we understand that the flesh has a desire

765
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:18,559
and we understand that for whatever period of time

766
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:21,479
before we got saved, there were certain things

767
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:26,319
that our flesh gained an appetite for, correct?

768
00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:27,799
And guess what?

769
00:35:27,799 --> 00:35:31,079
Those things are going to continue

770
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:33,079
to be a thorn in your side.

771
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:35,519
Have you found it to be so?

772
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:39,399
Listen, I'm thankful that God can give us the victory,

773
00:35:39,399 --> 00:35:42,239
and he can, and I'm thankful that God can deliver us,

774
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:45,079
and he will, but the reality this morning

775
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:46,999
is that when we understand what Paul is saying

776
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:48,479
in verse number seven, he's saying,

777
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,559
listen, in the witchy also walk some time.

778
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:52,239
These people that he's writing to,

779
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:55,239
perhaps some of them within the Church of Colossae,

780
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:57,399
they had been guilty of the very sins

781
00:35:57,399 --> 00:36:01,119
that are mentioned by name in verse number five.

782
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:04,699
And when they had been guilty of those very sins

783
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:06,279
that are mentioned in verse number five,

784
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:08,919
Paul says, that's why you need to mortify your members

785
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:10,519
which are upon the earth,

786
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:13,159
because you had an appetite for those things,

787
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:15,399
and you have to have victory.

788
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:17,079
And the only way you're gonna have victory

789
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,999
is if you deal with the flesh.

790
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:22,319
How many of you like broccoli?

791
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:25,919
I like broccoli, it's like my favorite veggie.

792
00:36:28,439 --> 00:36:29,959
How many of you like fruits and vegetables?

793
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:32,119
Listen, I like broccoli, I like cookies too.

794
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:35,159
Amen?

795
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:39,319
For a lot of our kids, if you put a cookie on a plate

796
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:40,399
and put some broccoli on a plate,

797
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:42,839
they're picking the cookie.

798
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:45,199
And guess what, sometimes we do the same thing.

799
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,039
Why?

800
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:49,999
Because I have an appetite for it, right?

801
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,339
How many of you have an appetite for sugar?

802
00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:55,559
How many of you ever tried to cut sugar out of your diet?

803
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:58,159
You ever try to cut sugar out of your diet?

804
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:00,679
And you have this, listen, I am,

805
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:03,999
I can run with anybody for a one-week diet.

806
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:05,399
I'm telling you, I'm honest.

807
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:08,799
I can run a one-week diet like nobody's business.

808
00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:12,199
I cannot have sugar at all for a whole week.

809
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,399
I can do the whole deal.

810
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,879
And then I'm like, let me just have a little bit.

811
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,139
Hey honey, now I ask Brianna,

812
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,639
hey Brianna, would you make a gallon of sweet tea?

813
00:37:27,819 --> 00:37:30,059
And then I'm just gonna have eight ounces.

814
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:33,339
And before long, the whole gallon is gone.

815
00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:34,519
I'm not talking about a week,

816
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,519
I'm talking about like a day and a half.

817
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:40,519
Why?

818
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,799
Because my body likes sugar.

819
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,399
Your flesh and my flesh likes to sin.

820
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:52,479
Paul understands the danger

821
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:57,679
and therefore he's direct and he's detailed.

822
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:59,079
Someone said this,

823
00:38:00,399 --> 00:38:04,139
a church, a pastor was preaching on sin,

824
00:38:04,139 --> 00:38:06,599
sort of like I'm preaching this morning.

825
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:08,699
And a man came to him after the service and said,

826
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:12,619
I don't think you need to be preaching this way

827
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:17,619
because sin in the life of a believer is different

828
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:19,999
than sin in the life of a lost person.

829
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:23,859
And the pastor with great wisdom said,

830
00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:26,219
you're absolutely right, it's worse.

831
00:38:27,899 --> 00:38:28,979
It's worse.

832
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:33,719
Amen.

833
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:37,059
Look at some passages with me in the book of Romans

834
00:38:37,059 --> 00:38:39,539
if you will, Romans chapter number six.

835
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:41,439
Paul understood the dangers

836
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:45,219
and he gives us formula here.

837
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:48,419
Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth.

838
00:38:48,419 --> 00:38:51,239
Crucify your flesh.

839
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:53,279
In Romans chapter number six,

840
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:58,299
I want you to begin looking with me at verse number six

841
00:38:58,299 --> 00:39:00,719
when Paul says this as he's writing the believers there,

842
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:02,919
he says, knowing this,

843
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:06,919
that our old man is crucified with him,

844
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:10,319
that the body of sin might be destroyed,

845
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:15,319
that henceforth we should not serve sin.

846
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:19,439
Skip down and look at verse number 11.

847
00:39:19,439 --> 00:39:24,439
Likewise, reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed

848
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:29,919
unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

849
00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:34,779
Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body,

850
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:37,259
that you should obey it in the lust thereof.

851
00:39:37,259 --> 00:39:39,239
Neither yield ye your members

852
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:42,099
as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin,

853
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:45,479
but yield yourselves unto God

854
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:47,499
as those that are alive from the dead

855
00:39:47,499 --> 00:39:50,779
and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God,

856
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:54,899
for sin shall not have dominion over you,

857
00:39:54,899 --> 00:39:57,659
for you're not under the law, but under grace.

858
00:39:57,659 --> 00:39:59,419
Notice he says in verse number 11,

859
00:39:59,419 --> 00:40:00,259
likewise,

860
00:40:00,259 --> 00:40:02,219
and reckon ye also yourselves

861
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:03,719
to be dead indeed unto sin,

862
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:06,679
but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord."

863
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,099
We're to be dead to sin,

864
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:10,099
but alive unto God.

865
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:13,859
This is a paradox of the Christian life.

866
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:15,239
And as I understand,

867
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:16,819
as he said in verse 6,

868
00:40:16,819 --> 00:40:20,779
that my old man is crucified with Him,

869
00:40:20,779 --> 00:40:22,979
that the body of sin might be destroyed,

870
00:40:22,979 --> 00:40:28,259
that we should not serve sin.

871
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,039
Verse 17, look at it there.

872
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:32,699
Skip down and look at verse 17.

873
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:35,499
But God be thanked.

874
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:36,579
Notice when he says

875
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:40,619
that ye were the servants of sin.

876
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:41,999
You know, before you got saved,

877
00:40:41,999 --> 00:40:43,999
you couldn't help yourself.

878
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:45,539
Honestly.

879
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:47,339
As much as you try.

880
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:49,259
That's why when we speak about salvation,

881
00:40:49,259 --> 00:40:50,959
we say that it's not reformation,

882
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:52,839
it's transformation.

883
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:54,839
It's not that I'm trying to clean myself up.

884
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:56,559
It's not that I'm trying to go through

885
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:59,559
some program and whatever step program.

886
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:02,399
No. Salvation is transformation.

887
00:41:02,399 --> 00:41:03,599
If any man be in Christ,

888
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,739
he is a new creature.

889
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:05,979
Old things are passed away.

890
00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:07,859
Behold, all things are become new.

891
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:11,699
And it's a glorious transformation.

892
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:14,439
And so we find that prior to salvation,

893
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:15,739
we were servants of sin.

894
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:17,119
We could not help ourselves.

895
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:17,939
It says this,

896
00:41:17,939 --> 00:41:21,279
but ye have obeyed from the heart

897
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:23,699
that form of doctrine which was delivered to you.

898
00:41:23,699 --> 00:41:24,899
What's he speaking about?

899
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,999
He's talking about the Gospel.

900
00:41:26,999 --> 00:41:28,239
You've obeyed the Gospel.

901
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:29,279
You've been saved.

902
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:30,539
You've been born again.

903
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:31,359
Now it says,

904
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:36,159
being then made free from sin,

905
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:40,119
ye became the servants of righteousness.

906
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:41,359
Now let me ask you,

907
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,359
if you're going to be a servant,

908
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,579
would you rather be a servant to sin

909
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:49,699
or a servant of righteousness?

910
00:41:49,699 --> 00:41:50,279
Amen.

911
00:41:50,279 --> 00:41:53,199
I mean, it seems pretty simple, does it not?

912
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:54,659
But if you're going to be a servant of righteousness

913
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:55,499
and not a servant of sin,

914
00:41:55,499 --> 00:41:57,419
you better deal with your flesh.

915
00:41:57,419 --> 00:41:59,659
You better reckon it to be dead.

916
00:41:59,659 --> 00:42:01,299
Acknowledge it to be so.

917
00:42:01,299 --> 00:42:05,039
Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth.

918
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:07,539
Romans 7 verse 15.

919
00:42:07,539 --> 00:42:08,619
Notice what Paul says.

920
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:10,919
See, Paul understood.

921
00:42:10,919 --> 00:42:13,299
He gives us this passage of Scripture.

922
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:15,799
We often refer to it very passingly,

923
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:18,039
but I want to read it to you this morning.

924
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:18,879
As it's written,

925
00:42:18,879 --> 00:42:20,159
it says in verse 15,

926
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:24,339
for that which I do, I allow not.

927
00:42:24,339 --> 00:42:28,179
For what I would, that do I not.

928
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:31,639
But what I hate, that do I.

929
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:33,799
If then I do that which I would not,

930
00:42:33,799 --> 00:42:36,339
I consent under the law that it is good.

931
00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:38,139
Now then it is no more I that do it,

932
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:40,379
but sin that dwelleth in me.

933
00:42:40,379 --> 00:42:42,979
For I know that in me,

934
00:42:42,979 --> 00:42:44,679
that is in my flesh,

935
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:47,179
dwelleth no good thing.

936
00:42:47,179 --> 00:42:49,299
For to will is present with me,

937
00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:52,639
but how to perform that which is good I find not.

938
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:55,639
Can you relate to Paul?

939
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:57,519
You can relate to him, right?

940
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:00,179
Paul, I understand.

941
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:01,399
He says in verse 19,

942
00:43:01,399 --> 00:43:03,479
for the good that I would, I do not.

943
00:43:03,479 --> 00:43:06,179
But the evil which I would not, that I do.

944
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:07,939
Now if I do that I would not,

945
00:43:07,939 --> 00:43:09,179
it is no more I that do it,

946
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:11,099
but sin that dwelleth in me.

947
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:12,519
I find in a law,

948
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:13,639
that when I would do good,

949
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:15,639
evil is present with me.

950
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:16,939
For I delight in the law of God

951
00:43:16,939 --> 00:43:17,899
after the inward man,

952
00:43:17,899 --> 00:43:19,479
but I see another law in my members,

953
00:43:19,479 --> 00:43:21,559
warring against the law of my mind,

954
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:23,059
and bringing me into captivity

955
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,399
to the law of sin,

956
00:43:24,399 --> 00:43:25,439
which is in my members.

957
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:28,559
Have you experienced this?

958
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:33,019
O wretched man that I am!

959
00:43:33,019 --> 00:43:35,099
Who shall deliver me

960
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:38,439
from the body of this death?

961
00:43:38,439 --> 00:43:41,199
I thank God

962
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:43,699
through Jesus Christ our Lord.

963
00:43:43,699 --> 00:43:45,099
So then with the mind,

964
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:46,939
I myself serve the law of God,

965
00:43:46,939 --> 00:43:49,899
but with the flesh, the law of sin.

966
00:43:49,899 --> 00:43:52,659
Listen, I'm thankful that God gives the victory.

967
00:43:52,659 --> 00:43:54,699
We talked about 1 Corinthians 15 and 57,

968
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:57,079
but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory.

969
00:43:57,079 --> 00:43:58,779
Listen, the reality is that

970
00:43:58,779 --> 00:44:00,579
we can relate with Paul.

971
00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:01,779
We can look at this and say,

972
00:44:01,779 --> 00:44:03,239
O wretched man that I am!

973
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:04,939
I mean, perhaps you're there right now

974
00:44:04,939 --> 00:44:05,779
at this moment.

975
00:44:05,779 --> 00:44:07,779
Perhaps you've been there this past week.

976
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:09,579
Maybe you'll be there this upcoming week.

977
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:10,399
Because why?

978
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:13,279
The fiery darts are going to be fired upon you.

979
00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:15,079
The temptations to do evil,

980
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:17,039
the appeal to your flesh,

981
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:20,839
they're going to be there.

982
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:22,679
Mortify therefore your members

983
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:26,299
which are upon the earth.

984
00:44:26,299 --> 00:44:28,299
For I know that in me that is in my flesh

985
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:30,259
dwelleth no good thing.

986
00:44:30,259 --> 00:44:32,719
Your flesh is weak and my flesh is weak.

987
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:34,499
How foolish of us to think,

988
00:44:34,499 --> 00:44:36,219
oh, well, I can just go over here

989
00:44:36,219 --> 00:44:37,679
and experience this a little bit

990
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:40,579
and I'm going to be able to be strong.

991
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:43,919
There's a warning about that in 1 Corinthians.

992
00:44:43,919 --> 00:44:44,959
In chapter 10.

993
00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:46,419
You don't need to turn there.

994
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:48,339
We're going to look at some more stuff here

995
00:44:48,339 --> 00:44:50,139
in the book of Romans.

996
00:44:50,139 --> 00:44:52,519
But in 1 Corinthians 10 and verse number 12.

997
00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:54,479
Wherefore, let him that thinketh he standeth

998
00:44:54,479 --> 00:44:57,059
take heed lest he fall.

999
00:44:58,019 --> 00:44:59,719
I've often used this analogy.

1000
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:03,419
If a man's been saved

1001
00:45:03,419 --> 00:45:06,259
and he's saved out of alcoholism,

1002
00:45:07,779 --> 00:45:09,019
it'd be a really foolish thing

1003
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:11,139
for that man to go to a bar to get a Coke.

1004
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:13,539
Would it not?

1005
00:45:14,539 --> 00:45:18,259
Just make a choice not to go to that place.

1006
00:45:18,259 --> 00:45:19,339
Amen?

1007
00:45:19,339 --> 00:45:21,259
Because you know what you've dealt with

1008
00:45:21,259 --> 00:45:23,979
and you're going to go put yourself in that position

1009
00:45:23,979 --> 00:45:27,179
after years of being in bondage to that alcoholism

1010
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:28,539
and you're going to put yourself there and say,

1011
00:45:28,539 --> 00:45:30,359
but I'm just going to get a Coke.

1012
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:31,819
Get a Coke somewhere else.

1013
00:45:31,819 --> 00:45:33,379
Amen?

1014
00:45:33,379 --> 00:45:34,579
I mean, honestly.

1015
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:39,379
It's foolish for us to put ourselves in positions

1016
00:45:39,379 --> 00:45:44,379
in which our flesh is going to receive that temptation.

1017
00:45:45,979 --> 00:45:47,179
That's why it's so imperative

1018
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:49,379
that we walk in the very presence of God.

1019
00:45:50,839 --> 00:45:52,659
Listen, don't be embarrassed

1020
00:45:52,659 --> 00:45:54,859
by having to tell someone I can't go there.

1021
00:45:56,499 --> 00:45:59,079
It's just not good for me to go to that place.

1022
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:01,679
It's not good for me to be exposed to those things.

1023
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:05,379
I want to protect my eye gate.

1024
00:46:05,379 --> 00:46:06,379
Amen?

1025
00:46:06,379 --> 00:46:08,259
Don't be embarrassed by that.

1026
00:46:08,259 --> 00:46:11,139
Understand that you're mortifying your members.

1027
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:13,659
You're dealing with your flesh.

1028
00:46:13,659 --> 00:46:16,059
And that's a good thing for us to do.

1029
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:17,539
Romans chapter number 12.

1030
00:46:18,979 --> 00:46:20,499
Paul says this in verses one and two,

1031
00:46:20,499 --> 00:46:22,779
a very familiar passage of scripture.

1032
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:28,539
I beseech you therefore brethren, by the mercies of God,

1033
00:46:28,539 --> 00:46:31,459
notice that you present your bodies a living sacrifice,

1034
00:46:31,459 --> 00:46:33,039
wholly acceptable unto God,

1035
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:34,199
which is your reasonable service.

1036
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:36,519
Notice this, and be not conformed to this world,

1037
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:38,319
but be transformed by the renewing of your mind

1038
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,159
that you may prove what is that good and acceptable

1039
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:41,479
and perfect will of God.

1040
00:46:41,479 --> 00:46:42,879
Can I submit to you this morning

1041
00:46:42,879 --> 00:46:44,879
that if you've been saved out of a life of sin,

1042
00:46:44,879 --> 00:46:48,039
if you've been saved out of the world's philosophy

1043
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:50,159
and the world's agenda and the world's thinking,

1044
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:51,499
that it's really easy for you

1045
00:46:51,499 --> 00:46:53,239
to go back to worldly thinking?

1046
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:59,199
It's a whole lot harder to get renewed in your mind.

1047
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:00,039
Why?

1048
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:01,079
Because you already know it.

1049
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:04,159
You've already lived in it.

1050
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:05,759
You already know the world's philosophy.

1051
00:47:05,759 --> 00:47:06,959
You already know the way that things,

1052
00:47:06,959 --> 00:47:08,359
do you understand what I'm saying?

1053
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:10,819
And so this admonition in verse number two

1054
00:47:10,819 --> 00:47:12,519
of be not conformed to the world,

1055
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:13,659
listen to this world,

1056
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:17,039
the reality is that I've already come out of the world,

1057
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:18,479
but that there's some things

1058
00:47:18,479 --> 00:47:20,399
that I still remember about the world,

1059
00:47:20,399 --> 00:47:23,599
and there's some things that my flesh very easily remember

1060
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,799
and can get right back into, right?

1061
00:47:27,799 --> 00:47:31,799
It's a whole lot harder to say I'm gonna be renewed,

1062
00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:34,399
transformed by the renewing of my mind.

1063
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:37,399
It requires that we spend time in this book.

1064
00:47:39,879 --> 00:47:43,039
It's like Paul said in Galatians two in verse number 20,

1065
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:45,679
I am crucified with Christ.

1066
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:47,639
I am crucified with Christ.

1067
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:49,399
Nevertheless, I live, yet not I,

1068
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:51,439
but Christ liveth in me.

1069
00:47:51,439 --> 00:47:52,959
And he says this, he says,

1070
00:47:52,959 --> 00:47:54,679
the life which I now live in the flesh,

1071
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:57,559
I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me

1072
00:47:57,559 --> 00:47:59,139
and gave himself for me.

1073
00:48:00,139 --> 00:48:05,139
This morning, I believe that Paul,

1074
00:48:06,979 --> 00:48:09,819
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

1075
00:48:09,819 --> 00:48:13,659
was as direct and detailed in Colossians three

1076
00:48:13,659 --> 00:48:15,859
and verse number five as he was

1077
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:17,899
because he understood the dangerous,

1078
00:48:18,759 --> 00:48:20,939
the fact that the flesh is dangerous.

1079
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:25,339
He understood this danger.

1080
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:27,059
And I wonder this morning,

1081
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:28,499
do we understand the danger?

1082
00:48:29,499 --> 00:48:31,699
I believe this morning that the Holy Spirit of God

1083
00:48:31,699 --> 00:48:36,379
who reveals the truth lives within us.

1084
00:48:36,379 --> 00:48:38,259
Do you believe that?

1085
00:48:38,259 --> 00:48:41,899
And if he lives within us or since he lives within us,

1086
00:48:41,899 --> 00:48:46,339
he is able to enable us to apply the truth,

1087
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:51,179
to live the truth because he lives within us.

1088
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:54,739
You say, I'm just trying so hard.

1089
00:48:54,739 --> 00:48:56,979
Stop trying and start submitting.

1090
00:48:59,419 --> 00:49:00,819
Say, I'm just trying to do all this stuff.

1091
00:49:00,819 --> 00:49:02,739
Don't try to do it in your own power.

1092
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,379
You're weak.

1093
00:49:04,379 --> 00:49:06,079
You're no match for Satan.

1094
00:49:08,419 --> 00:49:10,219
But as you walk in the Spirit,

1095
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:11,859
we have this wonderful promise.

1096
00:49:11,859 --> 00:49:14,819
I mentioned Galatians five and verse number 17

1097
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:17,699
where the Bible says that the flesh lusteth

1098
00:49:17,699 --> 00:49:19,179
against the Spirit.

1099
00:49:19,179 --> 00:49:20,419
But I want to close this morning

1100
00:49:20,419 --> 00:49:22,779
with this wonderful promise from Galatians five

1101
00:49:22,779 --> 00:49:24,059
in verse number 16.

1102
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:27,859
Paul says, this I say then,

1103
00:49:27,859 --> 00:49:32,859
walk in the Spirit and ye shall not fulfill

1104
00:49:33,859 --> 00:49:36,239
the lust of the flesh.

1105
00:49:37,259 --> 00:49:39,199
You say, pastor, my flesh is lusting.

1106
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:40,039
I know.

1107
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,619
Don't feel like you're some weird person.

1108
00:49:45,059 --> 00:49:47,319
This battle that we have is a battle

1109
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:49,339
that we have because of conversion.

1110
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:56,059
And you're not unusual or weird

1111
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:59,099
because you have this lust of your flesh.

1112
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:04,499
the authority of the Word of God, if you walk in the Spirit, you shall not fulfill

1113
00:50:04,499 --> 00:50:10,139
the lust of the flesh." He goes on in this passage of Scripture and he says this in

1114
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:18,899
verse 24, and they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections

1115
00:50:18,899 --> 00:50:27,859
and lusts. I ask you this morning, have you crucified your flesh? Maybe I should

1116
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:33,379
say it this way, are you crucifying your flesh? I die daily. Listen, it's not a one

1117
00:50:33,379 --> 00:50:36,579
and done. I crucified my flesh back on whatever date. You better crucify that

1118
00:50:36,579 --> 00:50:45,699
bad boy again. You understand what I'm saying? He says, they that are Christ have

1119
00:50:45,699 --> 00:50:55,379
crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. Crucify your flesh. I can't do

1120
00:50:55,379 --> 00:51:01,819
it for you and you can't do it for me. It's a personal responsibility. But Paul

1121
00:51:01,819 --> 00:51:08,279
speaks with such passion. He's so direct and he's so detailed because he

1122
00:51:08,279 --> 00:51:13,779
understands the dangers. And I wonder this morning, how many of us would say,

1123
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:26,099
man, I need to deal with my flesh. I need to just let God be God and submit

1124
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:32,219
myself to Him. See, we're to be strong in the Lord and the power of His might. Put

1125
00:51:32,219 --> 00:51:35,579
on the whole armor of God because we wrestle not against flesh and blood,

1126
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:40,539
against spiritual wickedness in high places. And this morning you don't have

1127
00:51:40,539 --> 00:51:43,899
the power, neither do I, but the power lives within us. It's the Holy Spirit of

1128
00:51:43,899 --> 00:51:49,619
God. We need to resist. But before we can ever resist, we must submit. That's what

1129
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:57,819
James says. Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee.

1130
00:51:57,819 --> 00:52:04,779
Isn't that a wonderful promise? Listen, this morning Paul, very direct. And again,

1131
00:52:04,779 --> 00:52:08,859
if you say, man, I was able to get through that list without any problem,

1132
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:16,859
come back next Sunday. Amen. Read ahead. You'll be like, man, if you're not here

1133
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:19,339
next Sunday, I'm going to know that you read and you said, man, I don't want to

1134
00:52:19,339 --> 00:52:25,459
hear that message. That's going to hit way too close to home. Come back tonight.

1135
00:52:25,459 --> 00:52:32,419
We're going to look at Genesis chapter 20. You know what? Abraham, his flesh got

1136
00:52:32,419 --> 00:52:36,779
in the way in Genesis chapter 20. I'm going to deal with it tonight. The messages

1137
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:42,299
will be related. And that's just God does that. I'm not smart enough to do all

1138
00:52:42,299 --> 00:52:48,619
that. But I hope that God would help us because each and every one of us, we deal

1139
00:52:48,619 --> 00:52:55,259
with the flesh. We deal with it. And we must mortify therefore your members

1140
00:52:55,259 --> 00:53:02,779
which are upon the earth. Let's pray. Father, how we love you this morning. How

1141
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:10,059
we thank you for your word, for your instruction. God, I pray that somehow this

1142
00:53:10,059 --> 00:53:17,419
morning you've taken your precious word and you've ministered to your people. I

1143
00:53:17,419 --> 00:53:25,779
thank you for how you've ministered to my heart. And I pray that we would

1144
00:53:25,779 --> 00:53:38,339
crucify our flesh. That we'd understand the importance of this truth. Would you

1145
00:53:38,339 --> 00:53:45,219
work as only you can? We'll give you the glory. For it's in Christ's name we pray.

1146
00:53:45,219 --> 00:53:47,219
We just...
