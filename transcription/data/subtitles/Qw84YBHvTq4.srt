1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,719
to make a difference, and Jude says of some having compassion, making a difference, and

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:12,319
I trust that God would use each of us to make a difference in our world, and we need a difference

3
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:13,319
in our world.

4
00:00:13,319 --> 00:00:14,319
Amen?

5
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:15,319
And we are the light.

6
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:18,159
The Bible says that we're the salt of the earth, the light of the world, and what a

7
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:23,520
blessing to be the representatives, the ambassadors of the Lord Jesus Christ.

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:30,159
Joshua chapter number two, Joshua chapter number two this morning, and we have transitioned

9
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:37,319
from our first phase, if you will, for our theme for 2023, great is the Lord and greatly

10
00:00:37,319 --> 00:00:42,919
to be praised, and really the first phase that we spent so many months on was discovering

11
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:48,720
God's greatness, and I'm so thankful that God has given us the complete word of God,

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,520
and He's given us within the canon of Scripture, He has revealed to us His greatness, and what

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,680
a wonderful truth that we can discover and make, be aware of as the psalmist said, I

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,119
know that the Lord is great.

15
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:08,120
Phase two, which we moved into last week, was declaring the greatness of God.

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,120
The psalmist says, I know the Lord is great, but this says, I will declare His greatness,

17
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,519
and what a great truth that we have of knowing how great our God is, but there's a world

18
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:23,879
that needs to know how great our God is, and we need to declare His greatness as we

19
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:28,839
finish up the calendar year, we will move into phase three when we deal with living

20
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:34,559
in light of His greatness, and how does His greatness, who He is, how great He is, how

21
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:39,559
does it impact how you live, how does it impact how I live, and that'll be phase number three,

22
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:44,800
but this morning is lesson two, message number two with this second phase, and last week

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,879
we looked at the proclamation of Jethro, and this week we're gonna look at the proclamation

24
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:55,080
of Rahab in Joshua chapter number two, and I understand as you study through the pages

25
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:01,519
of God's word, that there are many that proclaimed or declared the greatness of God, and I'm

26
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:07,160
not seeking to just be obscure for the purpose of being obscure, but I want to, as we look

27
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,520
at several of these examples, look at some folks that maybe we would not immediately

28
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,080
think of of people that declared the greatness of God. No doubt if I were to say to you this

29
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,399
morning, tell me some Bible characters that declared that God was great, Paul would be

30
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:27,880
on the list, and Isaiah, and Jeremiah, and no doubt Daniel would be on your list, and

31
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,720
Moses, and David, and so on and so forth, then I'm not saying that there's anything

32
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,839
wrong with any of those Bible characters that declared the greatness of God, in fact we

33
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,880
will study some of them. But you know it's impactful when you think about Jethro proclaiming

34
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:49,880
how great God is, and how Moses had an influence, an impact in his life, and he stands up and

35
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:56,679
proclaims that wonderful truth that we looked at last week, how he stands up and he makes

36
00:02:56,679 --> 00:03:03,679
that proclamation after hearing all that God did and how God worked in the life of Moses

37
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:10,600
and in the children of Israel, and he says, now I know, he was convinced of, he had this

38
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,919
assurance of, as we come to Joshua chapter number two, really the text of scripture,

39
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:20,360
if we look at the entirety of it, we find that Joshua as he's preparing to enter into

40
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:27,199
and lead the children of Israel into the land of promise, that he sends two spies to the

41
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,759
city of Jericho. Now remember that Joshua was one of the twelve spies that was sent

42
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:39,000
by Moses into the land of promise, and that didn't work out so well, Joshua and Caleb

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,479
were the only two that brought back a faith-filled report, the other ten did not believe God,

44
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:50,160
they looked at the giants and they looked at the walled cities and said we're not able,

45
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:56,320
and they were discouraged and they influenced the entire nation of Israel, so much so that

46
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,279
when Joshua and Caleb stood up to still to calm the people and to tell them if the Lord

47
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:07,720
delight in us then God is able, they did not deny the existence of the giants, they did

48
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,740
not deny the fact that there were walled cities, they just knew how great God was and they

49
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:18,079
knew that God said and God would do. But we find that the people of Israel are ready to

50
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:24,320
stone Joshua and Caleb and they ended up wandering in the wilderness, but Joshua and Caleb were

51
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,559
too, I think about that wilderness wandering, the journeys, the forty years, and I think

52
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:34,959
about their expectation because they had the promise of God that they would enter into

53
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:41,640
the land of promise, and as they wandered along I think that they had their focus upon

54
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:47,119
seeing what God said that they would see, and Joshua now as Moses has died, he's the

55
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:53,839
leader humanly speaking of the nation of Israel, and he sends these two spies and he gives them

56
00:04:53,839 --> 00:05:00,799
their responsibility to go there into Jericho. We find that the king of Jericho, the leader

57
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06,920
in verse number two, is made aware of these two spies and what their mission is. They

58
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:12,519
organize a search party for the purpose of being able to find these spies and deal with

59
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:17,799
them accordingly, but according to verse number six, Rahab took them to the roof of her house

60
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:24,000
and she hid them with the stalks of flax and they were secure there, and we find that at

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,720
the end of chapter number two, the Bible tells us that these two spies, they return, according

62
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,119
to verses 23 and 24, and they bring back a report to Joshua and they deliver this message

63
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:42,799
to Joshua. But we find that between the spies entering and the spies returning, there's

64
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:49,799
this great interaction that is recorded for us between these two spies and this lady with

65
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,640
the name of Rahab. And as we look at this particular interaction from verses eight through

66
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:02,200
21 this morning, the focus of our study will be that portion of scripture, and we'll consider

67
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:08,600
this morning, as we did last week, the proclamation of Jethro, this morning, the proclamation

68
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,040
of Rahab. Notice with me, if you will, in verse number eight, we'll pick it up there,

69
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:20,000
the Bible says, and before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof.

70
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,519
And so these two spies are there on the roof, I mentioned already in verse number six, that's

71
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:29,239
where they were safe, and she comes up to the roof and they're going to have this interaction,

72
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:34,720
this conversation. The Bible says in verse number nine that she said unto the men, I

73
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,679
know that the Lord hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and

74
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:45,799
that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you. For we have heard how the

75
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:50,279
Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when ye came out of Egypt, and what ye

76
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:55,480
did unto the two kings of the Amorites that were on the other side of Jordan, Sihon and

77
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:02,239
Og, whom ye utterly destroyed. And as soon as we heard these things, our hearts did melt,

78
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:07,239
but neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you, for the Lord your

79
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:12,519
God, he is God in heaven above and in earth beneath. At the end of verse number 11 is

80
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:16,920
where you read that proclamation that we will focus our attention on this morning, where

81
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:22,320
Rahab says, for the Lord your God, he is a God in heaven above and in earth beneath.

82
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,160
As we look at this portion of scripture, I want you to notice with me, if you're taking

83
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,760
notes, number one this morning, notice what Rahab revealed. In verses eight through 11,

84
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,679
during this interaction, this conversation between Rahab and these two spies, we find

85
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:42,600
that Rahab revealed some things to them. In verse number 10, notice the phraseology where

86
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:49,239
Rahab says, for we have heard. That's not only Rahab, but that's the inhabitants there

87
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:55,839
of the city of Jericho, and we find that Rahab says we've heard, and she begins to explain

88
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:02,480
to these two spies what it was that they heard. Number one, they heard about the miraculous

89
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,239
Red Sea crossing. We read about that portion of scripture and that event that's given to

90
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:13,040
us and recorded for us in Exodus chapter 14, and what a mountaintop passage of scripture

91
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:19,739
Exodus 14 is, and you get to read about God's deliverance of his people out of Egypt and

92
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:24,880
how he miraculously parted the Red Sea, and how the children of Israel, they walked, the

93
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:34,000
Bible says, on dry ground, not mucky, muddy. No, it was dry ground. God worked a miracle,

94
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,640
and the Egyptians, they saw what happened, and they assayed to go after them, and God

95
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,659
caused the chariot wheels to come off, and they got stuck, and they were destroyed there

96
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:50,280
in the Red Sea, and God wrought wonderfully. In fact, in chapter 15 of the book of Exodus,

97
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:56,000
there's great rejoicing and singing that takes place, and here we find that Rahab,

98
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,760
one of the inhabitants of the city of Jericho, she says to these two spies, for we have heard.

99
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:10,119
What did we hear? We heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea. Notice where

100
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:18,679
it says, for you. The Lord did this for you when you came out of Egypt. Listen, I'm thankful

101
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:25,440
that God works for us. I'm thankful for what God does for us in our lives. And here Rahab

102
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,219
is saying, I understand, we have heard what God did for you, and I want you to notice

103
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:38,840
that she mentions about this miraculous Red Sea crossing and what a great miracle that

104
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,960
was, and we find that she continues in verse number 10 and speaks about the complete victory

105
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,880
over Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, who were on the other side of Jordan, and

106
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,559
you can read back into the text within Numbers and Deuteronomy and read about the account

107
00:09:54,559 --> 00:10:01,559
there and the victory, the complete victory that God gave. And so we find that it is a

108
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,439
as Rahab is having this interaction with these two spies,

109
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,999
that she reveals some things,

110
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:09,399
and first what she reveals is what she heard.

111
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:13,519
But then notice with me what she knew.

112
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,959
Now, we looked at verse number 10 to see what she heard,

113
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,979
but we look back at verse number nine to see what she knew.

114
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:21,279
What was the conclusion that she reached

115
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,519
based upon that which she heard?

116
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,999
Notice in verse number nine,

117
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,199
and she said unto the men,

118
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:31,199
"'Notice I know that the Lord hath given you

119
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:32,839
"'the land.'"

120
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:35,259
She knew that.

121
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,839
She was thoroughly convinced of that.

122
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,199
And notice that she says,

123
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:42,999
she uses the name Jehovah for God.

124
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:46,379
"'I know that Jehovah God, your God,

125
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,199
"'he hath given you the land.'"

126
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:52,999
And we find that she, Rahab, knew this.

127
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:56,719
She understood based upon that which she heard

128
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:58,559
and that which had transpired.

129
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,279
She knew, she was convinced,

130
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,659
and she reveals that to these two spies.

131
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:07,759
And then we notice the impact,

132
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:10,299
and notice in verse number nine,

133
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:13,479
the impact of what they heard and what she knew,

134
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:14,919
the impact, in verse number nine,

135
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:19,559
it says, "'And that your terror is fallen upon us,

136
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:22,680
"'and that all the inhabitants of the land faint

137
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,360
"'because of you.'"

138
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,519
Wow, that's impactful.

139
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,680
In verse number 11, it continues on.

140
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,279
Notice the phrase that says,

141
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,519
"'As soon as we heard these things.'"

142
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,299
I'm not sure, the Bible doesn't tell us

143
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:40,000
how word reached to the city of Jericho

144
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,040
with regard to the crossing of the Red Sea,

145
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,799
the miraculous event that took place

146
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:47,799
and God delivering his people from Egypt.

147
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,519
We do not know how they found out

148
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,119
about the complete victory there over Sihon and Og,

149
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:55,799
but they heard and they understood some things.

150
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,680
And the Bible says that as soon as we heard these things,

151
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,559
notice the Bible says this in verse number 11,

152
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,079
"'Our hearts did melt.'"

153
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,159
Our hearts did melt.

154
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,839
And it continues and says,

155
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,039
"'Neither did there remain any more courage

156
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,119
"'in any man because of you.'"

157
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,819
That's quite the impact, is it not,

158
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:21,160
of what they heard and what she knew,

159
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,800
the conclusion that she reached

160
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,160
based upon what she heard,

161
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,559
the Lord has given you the land,

162
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:28,839
that she tells these two spies

163
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,599
as she's revealing to them the condition, if you will,

164
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:36,880
the pulse of the people of Jericho

165
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,080
because of what's transpired.

166
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,880
Now, remember, the people of Jericho,

167
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,800
they're in a pretty nice, defensed, walled city,

168
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,559
are they not?

169
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,199
In fact, we read about the conquering of Jericho,

170
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:50,020
that particular city, and the walls

171
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,599
as they come past them about and so on and so forth.

172
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:55,720
And we find that as we look at this passage of Scripture,

173
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,759
and we understand that there were 10 spies

174
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:01,440
that had been sent out by Moses,

175
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,839
and they were concerned about the walled cities,

176
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,199
but these that are within the walled cities,

177
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:10,039
because of what they heard God did and how God worked,

178
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,639
they say that, "'Our hearts did melt,

179
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,899
"'neither did there remain any more courage

180
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:17,839
"'in any man because of you.'"

181
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,819
Wow, I wonder this morning,

182
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,259
as we notice in our text of Scripture,

183
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:27,139
what Rahab revealed to these two spies,

184
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,419
and the impact that the truth had

185
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:32,500
upon the inhabitants of Jericho,

186
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,779
the impact that it had on them,

187
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:38,580
that God would deliver them through the Red Sea,

188
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,179
that God would give them complete victory in Sihon and Og,

189
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:45,940
and how it impacted them, that their hearts did melt,

190
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,259
that the inhabitants of the land fainted because of them,

191
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:51,779
that they had no courage left in them.

192
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:55,899
I wonder, on the opposite side this morning,

193
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:58,339
how does it impact you and how does it impact me

194
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:00,239
when we see what our God's able to do?

195
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:03,020
Because you know what it should do?

196
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,020
It should give us faith.

197
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,539
It should give us expectation.

198
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,979
It should cause us to anticipate what is God going to do?

199
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:14,660
And we think about the impact on the inhabitants

200
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,779
of the land, but if we were to contrast it this morning,

201
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:20,220
when you think about those 10 spies,

202
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,579
and we know that it happened 40 years previous

203
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:26,260
when those 10 spies, they go in and they see the giants

204
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,139
and the walled cities and all that they see,

205
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:32,779
and they're discouraged and they are responding

206
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:35,899
in just a terrible way.

207
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:39,500
And God, in fact, says in Numbers 14,

208
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,019
when he's speaking to Moses,

209
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:44,899
how long will it be, e'er my people believe me?

210
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:48,500
All that God did for the children of Israel,

211
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,339
they experienced it firsthand,

212
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:54,619
and many of them had no faith and no courage,

213
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:56,419
and they weren't willing to go forward,

214
00:14:56,419 --> 00:14:58,480
but yet the inhabitants of the land,

215
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,480
when they heard what God did, they were afraid.

216
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:04,980
They had no courage.

217
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,980
I wonder this morning, when we hear the wonderful accounts

218
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,459
of what God has done, when you read your Bible,

219
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:17,139
when you hear the preaching and teaching of God's word,

220
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,419
when you see what God is doing in the lives of others,

221
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:23,299
does it encourage you this morning?

222
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:26,660
Does it cause you to have your faith increased?

223
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,260
See, this morning, we're to live by faith, are we not?

224
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,739
The just shall live by faith.

225
00:15:33,739 --> 00:15:35,220
How do we have faith?

226
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,419
How do we have our faith increased?

227
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:38,880
So then faith cometh by hearing,

228
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,119
and hearing by the word of God.

229
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:42,779
We know that the Bible says, for by grace are you saved

230
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,899
through faith, and that not of yourselves is the gift

231
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:47,200
of God, not of works as any man should boast,

232
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,059
but after we're saved, we're to live by faith.

233
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:53,820
We're to be people of faith.

234
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,139
You know, as God has given us the account here

235
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:00,540
in what's being revealed to these two spies from Rahab,

236
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,019
and we see the impact and the influence

237
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:05,779
that the report had upon those inhabitants,

238
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:08,639
I just wonder this morning, as we would look

239
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,339
at our own lives, as we would evaluate ourselves,

240
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:14,839
we ought to be some people of faith.

241
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:16,500
We ought to be some people that trust God,

242
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,679
that believe God.

243
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,639
Listen, we should not hear the reports that are going on

244
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,059
in our world today, and seeing the things that are going on,

245
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:25,739
and saying, oh, woe is me, we're so defeated.

246
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:27,940
No, no, we're on the winning side.

247
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,179
If God before us, who can be against us?

248
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:33,540
And we are more than conquerors through him that loved us,

249
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,619
and we understand this morning

250
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:39,700
that we are able to have victory,

251
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,440
but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory

252
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,500
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

253
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,619
Listen, I'm thankful that one day I'm gonna go to heaven,

254
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:49,899
but reality is that we can have victory

255
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:52,660
even here upon this earth.

256
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,619
God doesn't expect for you or for me

257
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:57,419
to live defeated Christian lives.

258
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:00,139
He doesn't expect us to live under the circumstances.

259
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:02,260
He doesn't expect us to live by sight.

260
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,320
No, we're to live by faith.

261
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,540
And as we read the biblical content

262
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,059
that he's provided us with,

263
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:12,019
that he gives us those truths

264
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:14,339
so that we would have our faith increase,

265
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,919
so that we would trust him, so that we would prove him.

266
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:21,540
Our God is trustworthy.

267
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,540
We sang this morning, great is thy faithfulness.

268
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:29,700
Aren't you thankful that God is faithful?

269
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,380
I'm thankful this morning that God will never forsake you.

270
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,179
He'll never forsake me.

271
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,619
I'm thankful that God is at work.

272
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:38,500
And this morning, as much as we can see

273
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,380
from the text of scripture,

274
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,500
the impact that was upon the inhabitants

275
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,899
of the land of Jericho, of the city of Jericho,

276
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,220
I just wonder this morning,

277
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,600
how does what God is doing and has done,

278
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,519
how does that impact you and I this morning?

279
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,779
Number two, if you're taking notes,

280
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:59,139
we notice, first of all, what Rahab revealed.

281
00:17:59,139 --> 00:18:01,799
Number two, notice what Rahab declared.

282
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,220
We've already made mention of it

283
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,700
at the end of verse number 11.

284
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,179
This great declaration of Rahab,

285
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:11,119
where she declares to these two spies,

286
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:13,700
she says at the end of the verse,

287
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,459
verse number 11, for the Lord your God.

288
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:19,299
Now, it makes it very clear and very plain

289
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,320
who she's speaking of.

290
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,739
She's not speaking of any of the false gods of the land.

291
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:26,779
She's not speaking of any of those idols

292
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:28,660
that she would be aware of,

293
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,739
that the inhabitants of the land,

294
00:18:30,739 --> 00:18:32,540
remember, they're warned, the children of Israel

295
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,179
were given warning about entering into the land

296
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:39,340
and the idols and the false idolatrous worship

297
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,640
that they would be faced with.

298
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,159
But here we find that Rahab says, for the Lord your God,

299
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:48,460
notice what she says, he is God in heaven above

300
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,940
and in earth beneath.

301
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,859
What a great statement, a great proclamation,

302
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:58,260
as she makes this declarative statement,

303
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,900
as she understands all that she has been made aware of

304
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,739
and all that she has grasped

305
00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:06,460
as she's looking at these events that have unfolded

306
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,219
and she reaches this wonderful conclusion

307
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:12,140
and she declares with great certainty

308
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,500
that the Lord your God, he is God in heaven above

309
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,340
and in earth beneath.

310
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,099
You know what I think she's saying?

311
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:24,140
He's not like any other small G-O-D.

312
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:28,219
Moses, God speaks to Moses and says

313
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:31,739
that their rock isn't like our rock.

314
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,779
And I think what Rahab is recognizing,

315
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:37,859
what Rahab is declaring here is that yes,

316
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:40,859
I'm familiar with other quote-unquote deities,

317
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:44,539
I'm familiar with other idols and the false worship

318
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:48,260
and all of the pagan idolatry that's in the land,

319
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,739
but they're not like your God.

320
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:54,179
It's a wonderful proclamation.

321
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,940
This morning, we serve the living God.

322
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,340
Listen, we ought to rejoice this morning

323
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,979
in understanding who we.

324
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:03,359
We serve.

325
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:11,899
I know that it's typical that during the resurrection service and that Resurrection Sunday, Easter

326
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:17,299
Sunday is referred to it, that we'll sing those songs about He lives and Christ the

327
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:22,179
Lord is risen today and up from the grave He arose, but you understand that every single

328
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,439
Sunday we meet because we serve a risen Savior.

329
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:29,379
We meet on Sunday because it's the Lord's day, it's the first day, it's the day of the

330
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:34,579
resurrection and we meet because we serve a risen Savior.

331
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:39,699
And listen, our God that we serve, He is alive.

332
00:20:39,699 --> 00:20:41,259
He is active.

333
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:46,979
He is able and this morning when we understand that, when we see what this proclamation is

334
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:50,679
from Rahab and we say, yes, that's my God.

335
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:55,399
He is the one that's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

336
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:59,079
He is the one that is actively working in our world today.

337
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:03,659
He's the one that would use me and would use you to bring honor and glory to Himself.

338
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:06,799
Man, what a God we serve.

339
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:12,819
It's a privilege to know the God that we serve.

340
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:17,359
Listen, there are a lot of people around the world that are blinded.

341
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,979
The Bible says that the God of this world in 2 Corinthians chapter number 4, He had

342
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:25,119
blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel should

343
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:27,159
shine in unto them.

344
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:34,839
And I'm thankful this morning that God in His amazing grace and His mercy, He allowed

345
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:38,279
me to know Him.

346
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:40,839
He allowed you to know Him.

347
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:44,279
I wonder this morning, how did you first learn about God?

348
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:48,119
You know, sometimes I ask people if they're sure that they're going to go to heaven when

349
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:51,359
they die and they say, oh yeah, I'm a Christian.

350
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,639
Tell me a little bit more about that.

351
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:53,999
Well, I've just always been a Christian.

352
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:55,519
I was born a Christian.

353
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:58,919
You're not born a Christian.

354
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:05,319
You're born in enmity with God, biblically speaking.

355
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:11,039
And we begin to think about when the Lord made Himself known to us.

356
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,559
Some of us got saved young in life.

357
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:18,319
Some of us got saved in our middle ages, if you will.

358
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:21,359
Some got saved older in life.

359
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:27,319
But I wonder this morning, as we think about this proclamation, what Rahab declared to

360
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:33,119
these two spies in verse number 11, I wonder when it was in your life that you recognized

361
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,959
that the Lord God Jehovah is the only God.

362
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:39,719
And He is the only Savior.

363
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:41,039
He's the only way.

364
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,119
See, for some, you were taught that from the youngest of age.

365
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,759
For some in our church, those little children that are in the nursery and then go into the

366
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,639
children's church and are here for student ministries, they're learning from the earliest

367
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,559
of days who God is.

368
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:02,359
But, you know, when I was their age, when I was a young teenager, I didn't know who

369
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:04,319
the God of the Bible was.

370
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:06,959
I had no idea.

371
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:08,079
And some of you can relate.

372
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:13,599
Some of you can understand that you did not know who Jehovah God was.

373
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:19,119
But I wonder this morning, as we think about this truth and we think about this, what Rahab

374
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:26,359
declares to these two spies, I wonder this morning, when did you understand who Jesus

375
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:29,679
is, who God is?

376
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,319
And are you thankful this morning that He's made Himself known to you?

377
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:40,879
You think about the truth of the Apostle Paul in Athens, and he says that they're superstitious

378
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:46,039
and they had all of those various monuments and what have you, and they had this altar

379
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:49,599
to the unknown God.

380
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,239
And Paul says, as he goes in and speaks to those people, speaking about that particular

381
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:58,119
altar, he says, Him declare I unto you.

382
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:03,879
Listen, there was a time in your life, there was a time in Rahab's life where she recognized

383
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:07,239
that there's something different about the Lord your God.

384
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:11,559
There's a time that we realize, listen, God is true, God is real.

385
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:16,439
And I wonder, after we've recognized that, after we've been saved and we've been born

386
00:24:16,439 --> 00:24:22,679
again by the grace of God, I wonder how often we're declaring how wonderful He is.

387
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:28,839
I wonder how often those words pass through our lips about how He's a wonderful Savior

388
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:33,159
and that we would lift up and exalt His name.

389
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:36,919
We notice in the text of Scripture what Rahab revealed.

390
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:38,239
We notice what she declared.

391
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:41,879
And I want you to notice with me number three what she requested.

392
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:43,439
Notice what Rahab requested.

393
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:48,399
In verse number 12, she'd made that great declaration in verse number 11.

394
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:50,899
And then she says, now therefore.

395
00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:56,799
Notice what she says in verse number 12, I pray you, swear unto me by the Lord since

396
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:02,119
I have showed you kindness that you will show also, that you will also show kindness unto

397
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:04,079
my Father's house.

398
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,999
And notice she says, and give me a true token.

399
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:13,759
And that you will save alive my father, my mother, my brethren, my sisters, and all that

400
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:17,999
they have and deliver our lives from death.

401
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:22,879
The men answered her, our life for yours if you utter not this our business.

402
00:25:22,879 --> 00:25:28,479
And it shall be when the Lord hath given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly

403
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:30,279
with thee.

404
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:35,319
Then she let them down by a cord through the window, for her house was upon the town wall

405
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:38,119
and she dwelt upon the wall.

406
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:42,879
She said unto them, get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you.

407
00:25:42,879 --> 00:25:47,259
Hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers be returned.

408
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:50,439
And afterward may you go your way.

409
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:54,719
The men said unto her, we will be blameless of this thine oath, which thou hast made us

410
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,719
swear.

411
00:25:55,719 --> 00:26:01,979
Behold, verse 18, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread

412
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:05,659
in the window, which thou didst let us down by.

413
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:10,299
And thou shalt bring thy father, thy mother, thy brethren, and all thy father's household

414
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:12,859
home unto thee.

415
00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:17,899
And it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street,

416
00:26:17,899 --> 00:26:22,539
his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless.

417
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:27,699
And whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand

418
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:28,699
be upon him.

419
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:33,859
And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath, which thou

420
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:36,019
hast made us to swear.

421
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:40,419
Verse 21, she said, according unto your words, so be it.

422
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:46,459
She sent them away and they departed, and she bound the scarlet line in the window.

423
00:26:46,459 --> 00:26:52,259
As we look at this request that is made in her response to the agreement, we find that,

424
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:57,219
I would say this, that her faith is evidenced by her actions.

425
00:26:57,219 --> 00:27:00,099
She truly believed what she declared.

426
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:03,419
She believed, as she said in verse number nine, I know that the Lord hath given you

427
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:04,419
the land.

428
00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:09,339
She says in verse number 12, that I pray you, swearing to me by the Lord, since I have showed

429
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:15,299
you kindness, that you will save us alive, as you get into verse number 13.

430
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:21,899
And we find that she was thoroughly convinced, she was believing what she had declared, that

431
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:26,259
they truly were going to come in and conquer.

432
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:27,539
She's concerned.

433
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:31,539
We find that there's a plea that she gives, a plea for protection.

434
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:35,539
I want you to understand that she's not just concerned for her own self.

435
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:37,219
She's concerned for her family.

436
00:27:37,219 --> 00:27:38,819
She's concerned for others.

437
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:43,099
And as we would make a spiritual application from this passage of scripture this morning,

438
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:48,299
and we'd understand the request that she's making to these two spies and the plea for

439
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:53,539
protection, I would say to you this morning that as we consider the application of being

440
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:58,299
saved, of being born again, that listen, if we're saved this morning, we ought to have

441
00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:00,259
a concern for others.

442
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:05,939
We ought to have a burden for someone else to have salvation through the Lord Jesus Christ.

443
00:28:05,939 --> 00:28:06,939
Why?

444
00:28:06,939 --> 00:28:10,899
Because we understand that apart from being saved by the blood of Jesus Christ, man is

445
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:16,019
going to die and enter into a Christless eternity where they will spend forever in a place called

446
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:17,499
the Lake of Fire.

447
00:28:17,499 --> 00:28:22,139
And we ought to have a burden that others...

448
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:23,899
That burden starts with our own family.

449
00:28:23,899 --> 00:28:29,939
I think about the truth in the book of Luke as the interaction of Lazarus and the rich

450
00:28:29,939 --> 00:28:30,939
man.

451
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:34,500
And the rich man is in hell and he's concerned about his brethren.

452
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,500
And what does he say?

453
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,459
He says, let Lazarus go back and speak to them because I don't want them to come to

454
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:44,260
this place, this place of torment.

455
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:51,099
We understand that in the text, his belief, that rich man's belief is that if one were

456
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:56,979
to rise from the dead, that his brothers would believe, but it's so clearly spelled

457
00:28:56,979 --> 00:29:01,940
out in that portion of scripture that they have Moses and the prophets.

458
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:06,459
If they won't believe that, then they won't believe though one rose from the dead.

459
00:29:06,459 --> 00:29:07,459
You know what that tells me?

460
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:10,500
There's power in this word.

461
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,219
We're born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the word of God, which

462
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:17,219
liveth and abideth forever.

463
00:29:17,219 --> 00:29:20,940
I'm so thankful that God uses his word.

464
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:26,500
He's given us his complete canon of scripture and we can rest assured this morning that

465
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,059
he uses his word.

466
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:31,739
And as we look at her plea for protection, it's not just personal.

467
00:29:31,739 --> 00:29:38,019
She's concerned for others, her family, and she's desiring that they would have this deliverance

468
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:42,899
when they would come into the land, that they would be delivered from death.

469
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:48,820
You know, so many people today, even as we would look at the actual understanding of

470
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:55,739
Joshua 2 with regard to the content, the physical death that would come to the inhabitants

471
00:29:55,739 --> 00:29:56,739
of Jericho.

472
00:29:56,739 --> 00:30:00,940
You know, there are a lot of people that we come into contact with every single day of

473
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,659
our lives.

474
00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:05,939
that they are concerned about their physical well-being.

475
00:30:07,219 --> 00:30:10,299
They're fearful of dying physically.

476
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:13,859
But so often there's little thought

477
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:15,979
that's given to the second death.

478
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:20,619
And this morning, as much as people would wanna be spared

479
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:24,259
from physical death, and we've seen in recent years,

480
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:26,459
not only in our country, but around the world,

481
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:31,459
we have seen how that self-preservation has been obvious

482
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:34,979
that people are so concerned about life

483
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:38,599
and being able to protect themselves.

484
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:40,339
I'm not saying that we should be haphazard.

485
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,059
I'm not suggesting that we shouldn't be concerned

486
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:44,979
about our health, but what I'm saying this morning

487
00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:48,339
is that the immediate context of what we're dealing with

488
00:30:48,339 --> 00:30:51,299
is the physical death, but we ought to understand

489
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:54,539
this morning that there is something that's far greater,

490
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:55,939
and that's the second death.

491
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,139
Notice there's an agreement that is made,

492
00:31:00,139 --> 00:31:03,539
and the explanation is given in verses 14 through 20.

493
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:06,539
I will not read all of the verses of Scripture again

494
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:08,439
as I've read them just a moment ago,

495
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:12,159
but I want you to see a couple of things in particular.

496
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,539
Number one, I want you to notice in verse 18,

497
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,499
the Bible says, behold, when we come into the land,

498
00:31:17,499 --> 00:31:19,219
listen, there was a certain expectation

499
00:31:19,219 --> 00:31:21,059
that these spies had.

500
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:22,439
There was an understanding

501
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:24,839
that they were going to be returning,

502
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:27,779
that God did promise to give them the land,

503
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:29,019
and they would be returning.

504
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:31,819
It says, when we come into the land, notice what they say,

505
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:36,819
thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window,

506
00:31:37,699 --> 00:31:40,059
which thou didst let us down by.

507
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:44,179
I want you to think about that line of scarlet thread.

508
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:47,259
In fact, there are records all the way dating back

509
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:52,059
to the first century where people, theologians and scholars,

510
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:55,219
if you will, would look at this scarlet thread

511
00:31:55,219 --> 00:31:58,099
as a picture representing the very blood

512
00:31:58,139 --> 00:31:59,899
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

513
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:02,379
And so often as we look at the Old Testament

514
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:03,939
and we look at the typologies

515
00:32:03,939 --> 00:32:06,999
and we look at the prophecies that are given,

516
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:09,299
there's no doubt in my mind that when you think

517
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:11,619
about this line of a scarlet thread,

518
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:14,219
that yes, this would identify her place,

519
00:32:14,219 --> 00:32:17,019
but it also would reveal her faith.

520
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:19,859
And we find that she was given this instruction

521
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:21,219
in verse number 18.

522
00:32:21,219 --> 00:32:24,479
The instruction not only was given with regard

523
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:27,339
to binding the line of scarlet thread in the window,

524
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:30,819
but notice what it continues to say in verse 18 and 19.

525
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:34,459
It says this, and thou shalt bring thy father

526
00:32:34,459 --> 00:32:37,059
and thy mother and thy brethren

527
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:41,419
and all thy father's household home unto thee.

528
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:46,219
Verse 19, and it shall be that whosoever shall go out

529
00:32:46,219 --> 00:32:48,539
of the doors of thy house into the street,

530
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:53,539
his blood shall be upon his head and we will be guiltless.

531
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:56,899
And whosoever shall be with thee in the house,

532
00:32:56,899 --> 00:33:01,899
his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him.

533
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:05,379
As we begin to look at this verse of scripture

534
00:33:05,379 --> 00:33:07,699
in verses 18 and 19 and think about the agreement

535
00:33:07,699 --> 00:33:09,859
that is made that is explained here,

536
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:12,099
we find that not only do they speak about binding

537
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:13,819
this line of scarlet thread,

538
00:33:13,819 --> 00:33:15,939
but we find that they make it abundantly clear

539
00:33:15,939 --> 00:33:17,999
that there's only one place of safety.

540
00:33:18,859 --> 00:33:21,179
There's just one place of safety.

541
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:23,019
What a great picture.

542
00:33:23,019 --> 00:33:26,299
I think about the truth of God's word

543
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:29,499
with regard to even in the earliest pages

544
00:33:29,499 --> 00:33:32,159
of the Old Testament pointing to the truth

545
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,119
of being one place for safety, for refuge.

546
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,619
I think about the ark.

547
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,119
The ark.

548
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:45,139
There's just one place of refuge, just one place of safety.

549
00:33:45,139 --> 00:33:50,139
Eight people survived the flood, God's judgment.

550
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,779
All eight of those people were in the ark.

551
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:57,019
They were in the ark.

552
00:33:57,019 --> 00:34:01,039
I think about the Passover and I think about the truth

553
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,899
of the instruction that God gives to the initial,

554
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:08,379
the immediate in the book of Exodus

555
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,339
with regard to the applying of the blood

556
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,779
and the 10th plague, the death of the firstborn.

557
00:34:13,779 --> 00:34:16,819
And I find that when that Passover was instituted

558
00:34:16,819 --> 00:34:20,739
that there was but one way to have safety,

559
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:22,819
to have deliverance.

560
00:34:22,819 --> 00:34:26,059
If someone said, well, I understand what Moses said.

561
00:34:26,059 --> 00:34:27,339
It's not a matter of ignorance.

562
00:34:27,339 --> 00:34:29,579
It's just a matter of I'm gonna do it my way.

563
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,459
I think that I could do it this way.

564
00:34:32,459 --> 00:34:35,099
I think I could change this and it doesn't,

565
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:37,979
why does it really have to be that way?

566
00:34:37,979 --> 00:34:39,779
Because that's what God said.

567
00:34:39,779 --> 00:34:41,859
Because that's what God said.

568
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:43,779
So often people want to fight with God

569
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:46,539
instead of just submitting to God.

570
00:34:47,459 --> 00:34:50,819
I think about this one, what about the brazen serpent?

571
00:34:50,819 --> 00:34:52,419
Because of the complaining of the people,

572
00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:56,019
God sent forth fiery serpents.

573
00:34:56,019 --> 00:34:57,579
They were crying out.

574
00:34:57,579 --> 00:35:01,899
God then instructed Moses to make a brazen serpent

575
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,139
and to fashion that serpent upon a pole

576
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:05,619
and to set it in the midst of the camp.

577
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:07,139
And he said that when somebody was bitten

578
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:09,339
that if they looked, we sing the song,

579
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:10,779
look and live, my brother, live.

580
00:35:10,779 --> 00:35:12,419
Look to Jesus now and live, why?

581
00:35:12,419 --> 00:35:13,579
Because it's a picture.

582
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:16,439
Jesus in fact referenced it in the book of John.

583
00:35:19,419 --> 00:35:21,619
And we find that that brazen serpent,

584
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,379
somebody could have gotten bitten

585
00:35:23,379 --> 00:35:24,699
by one of those fiery serpents

586
00:35:24,699 --> 00:35:26,979
and they could try any way they wanted to,

587
00:35:26,979 --> 00:35:29,179
they could do anything else in their power,

588
00:35:29,179 --> 00:35:31,139
but if they didn't look to that brazen serpent,

589
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:32,819
they were gonna die.

590
00:35:32,819 --> 00:35:33,659
People died.

591
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:39,139
But yet we find that there was just

592
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:41,819
a single place of safety, the ark.

593
00:35:41,819 --> 00:35:45,619
There was just one way to spare death during the Passover.

594
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:50,139
That was in following precisely what God said

595
00:35:50,139 --> 00:35:51,819
with the application of the blood.

596
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:53,379
We find that with the brazen serpent,

597
00:35:53,379 --> 00:35:58,379
there's just one way to avoid death by those fiery serpents.

598
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:01,539
And we find it so true as you come to the New Testament

599
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:03,919
and understand the truth of the gospel,

600
00:36:03,919 --> 00:36:06,779
that there's just one way to get to heaven.

601
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:09,139
We sing the song, one way God said to get to heaven,

602
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:11,859
Jesus is the only way.

603
00:36:11,859 --> 00:36:13,659
Why do we say that?

604
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:15,419
Do we say that because we're narrow-minded?

605
00:36:15,419 --> 00:36:19,499
Do we say that because we're just not

606
00:36:19,499 --> 00:36:23,299
willing to accept other ideas or thoughts?

607
00:36:23,299 --> 00:36:26,019
No, no, we say that because God himself said it.

608
00:36:27,459 --> 00:36:29,979
Because the Bible says that Jesus spake and said,

609
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:34,979
I, singularly, I am the way

610
00:36:35,879 --> 00:36:37,939
and the truth and the life.

611
00:36:37,939 --> 00:36:40,919
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

612
00:36:42,919 --> 00:36:45,259
I understand this morning that there are many

613
00:36:45,259 --> 00:36:47,419
that are changing that idea and they're saying,

614
00:36:47,419 --> 00:36:50,779
well, you just need to be sincere in what you believe.

615
00:36:50,779 --> 00:36:53,179
You just need to, no, no, you can be sincere

616
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:54,899
about whatever but be wrong.

617
00:36:57,099 --> 00:36:59,539
There are many people today that are sincerely wrong.

618
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:02,139
It's not a matter of questioning their sincerity.

619
00:37:03,899 --> 00:37:05,459
It's in what they're believing.

620
00:37:06,899 --> 00:37:10,299
And this morning, we find that as this agreement

621
00:37:10,299 --> 00:37:13,659
is made between these two spies in Rahab,

622
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:16,339
that they make it abundantly clear to her

623
00:37:16,939 --> 00:37:19,659
that she had to bind this line of scarlet thread,

624
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:23,859
that there's only one place of safety,

625
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:27,079
just one place of safety this morning.

626
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:31,459
It was only those that would be in the house

627
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:33,079
that would be spared death.

628
00:37:33,979 --> 00:37:37,679
Only those that were in the ark were spared death.

629
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:40,219
And I wonder, as the New Testament verbiage is used,

630
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:42,379
that we are in Christ.

631
00:37:42,379 --> 00:37:44,779
I wonder this morning, are you in Christ?

632
00:37:44,779 --> 00:37:46,539
Have you trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

633
00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:50,579
as your personal Savior, understanding that you're a sinner

634
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:53,019
and that He is the only Savior?

635
00:37:57,139 --> 00:38:00,419
If so, you have the assurance of heaven.

636
00:38:00,419 --> 00:38:02,999
If not, today is the day of salvation.

637
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:05,859
What a joy.

638
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:08,459
We find that the evidence of Rahab's faith

639
00:38:08,459 --> 00:38:11,819
is given to us in verse 21, where the Bible says that as,

640
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:14,379
now think about, get in your mind the picture

641
00:38:14,979 --> 00:38:18,499
of what happened, she lets them down over the wall there,

642
00:38:18,499 --> 00:38:21,479
according to verse number 15, and she let them down,

643
00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:23,779
and then there's this conversation that takes place,

644
00:38:23,779 --> 00:38:26,139
and they make the terms of the agreement.

645
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:27,499
And then it says in verse 21,

646
00:38:27,499 --> 00:38:29,659
that according unto your word, so be it,

647
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:30,979
this is her speaking to them,

648
00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:33,099
she sent them away and they departed.

649
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:33,979
And notice what it says,

650
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:38,559
she bound the scarlet line in the window.

651
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:39,859
You know what's significant to me about that?

652
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:43,619
She did it immediately, without delay.

653
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:44,899
Some people you talk to about Christ,

654
00:38:44,899 --> 00:38:45,819
they say, let me think about it,

655
00:38:45,819 --> 00:38:50,059
let me get back to you on that.

656
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:52,940
I'm not saying that I would ever twist anybody's arm,

657
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,859
but the Bible does say that today is the day of salvation.

658
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,619
We don't know what's on tomorrow.

659
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:00,299
You don't know what's on tomorrow.

660
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:05,099
Boast not thyself of tomorrow, in fact, the proverb says.

661
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:05,940
Why?

662
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,059
We don't know what a day will bring forth.

663
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:12,899
And so we find that she immediately puts this scarlet line,

664
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:15,739
this line of scarlet thread in her window.

665
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:18,259
And I want you to understand contextually,

666
00:39:18,259 --> 00:39:19,819
in the book of Joshua,

667
00:39:19,819 --> 00:39:22,759
they're not marching around the city at this point.

668
00:39:23,979 --> 00:39:27,659
Understand they've not even crossed the Jordan River yet.

669
00:39:29,259 --> 00:39:30,459
When the spies are sent,

670
00:39:30,459 --> 00:39:32,779
they've not yet crossed the Jordan River,

671
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:36,819
and yet Rahab was so thoroughly convinced

672
00:39:36,819 --> 00:39:38,819
that she put that line in her window,

673
00:39:38,819 --> 00:39:41,579
that scarlet thread, immediately.

674
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,459
Now, that scarlet line, that scarlet thread,

675
00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:48,500
that would, I mentioned already, identify her place,

676
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,059
but it also would reveal her faith.

677
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:53,219
I wonder, the Bible doesn't tell us,

678
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:56,339
and so it's just a I wonder type of a situation,

679
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:59,459
but I wonder if anyone asked Rahab,

680
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:02,019
what do you got that scarlet?

681
00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:06,479
thread hanging out of your window for? Have you ever thought that? I mean, I

682
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:12,119
would probably ask. Rahab was in a position, she was there, her house was

683
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:17,879
a prominent place, and no doubt people knew who she was. In fact, when the Bible

684
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:21,319
talks about those spies entering in, where did the King of Jericho,

685
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:24,839
where did the Serf party first went? To her house. Why? Because they knew that

686
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,359
that's where the spies went. She tells them that they were sent out and so on

687
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:32,699
and so forth, but we find that she then has this scarlet thread that's

688
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:40,699
hanging out of her window. Hey Rahab, what's that scarlet thread for? I'd like

689
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:45,899
to think that at least somebody asked her that question, and I'd love to hear

690
00:40:45,899 --> 00:40:52,779
how Rahab would respond to that question. Now, the Bible doesn't give us the record

691
00:40:52,779 --> 00:40:58,119
of any of those types of interactions, but this morning, I want you to

692
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:03,199
understand that we as New Testament believers, no, we don't put a scarlet

693
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:10,079
thread out our window, but God has given us a responsibility to go and declare

694
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,799
who He is, to be His representatives, His ambassadors. We find this morning that

695
00:41:15,799 --> 00:41:20,359
even as these young people just did a wonderful job singing that song called

696
00:41:20,499 --> 00:41:24,139
to make a difference, understand this morning that each and every one of us

697
00:41:24,139 --> 00:41:29,139
have been called to make a difference, to take up the truth of the gospel and

698
00:41:29,139 --> 00:41:34,739
proclaim it to a lost and dying world. Why? Because we know the truth, and we

699
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:40,019
know that He's given us the mission, the responsibility. I want you to just

700
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:45,499
briefly go over, if you will, to Joshua chapter number 6, and I want you to see

701
00:41:45,499 --> 00:41:49,699
that as we come to this chapter, we find that God gives the instruction. They've

702
00:41:49,699 --> 00:41:53,199
already entered into the land, they've set up the memorials, the circumcision

703
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,239
of the people has taken place, and Jericho would be the first place that

704
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:59,959
they come to, and the Bible says that Jericho was straightly shut up because

705
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:02,899
of the children of Israel. None went out, none came in, according to verse number

706
00:42:02,899 --> 00:42:08,159
1. The instruction is given with regard to encompassing the city about and all

707
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:12,319
that would take place, and all of that is given, but I want you to jump down all

708
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,639
the way to verse 17, if you will. The Bible says, "...and the city shall be

709
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:20,899
accursed, even it and all that are therein to the Lord." Notice what it says,

710
00:42:20,899 --> 00:42:25,699
"...only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house,

711
00:42:25,699 --> 00:42:30,779
because she hid the messengers that we sent. And ye, and any wives, keep

712
00:42:30,779 --> 00:42:33,659
yourselves from the accursed thing that you make yourselves accursed when you

713
00:42:33,659 --> 00:42:37,859
take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse and trouble it." We

714
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:41,179
find that the walls fell down flat, according to verse number 20. In verse

715
00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:45,199
number 22, notice the Bible says, "...but Joshua had said unto the two men that had

716
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:49,499
spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house," who is that? That's Rahab,

717
00:42:49,499 --> 00:42:55,379
"...and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye swear unto her.

718
00:42:55,379 --> 00:43:01,379
And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab." Aren't you

719
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:06,019
thankful for chapter number 6 that gives us the conclusion of what we read

720
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:09,859
in chapter 2? It says that they brought out Rahab, notice, "...and her father,

721
00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:14,259
and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had, and they brought out all

722
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:19,719
her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel. And they burnt the city

723
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:25,239
with fire, and all that was therein." I want you to understand, look at verse 25,

724
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:28,519
"...and Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all

725
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:32,919
that she had. And she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day, because she hid the

726
00:43:32,919 --> 00:43:38,719
messengers which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho." We notice the the proclamation

727
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:45,339
of Rahab, but I want you to see that the quote-unquote end of the story for Rahab,

728
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:50,059
we understand that she's in the genealogy of the Lord Jesus Christ, we

729
00:43:50,059 --> 00:43:53,419
understand that she's mentioned in the book of Hebrews, and also in the book of

730
00:43:53,419 --> 00:44:00,379
James, understand she's never given any kind of commendation for any dishonest

731
00:44:00,379 --> 00:44:04,779
statements that she made, but always for her faith, and understand this morning

732
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:12,919
that the spies, they came back, and they took her out. Listen, one day my Savior's

733
00:44:12,919 --> 00:44:19,759
coming back, and he's taking me out. Amen? Listen, the Bible tells us that Jesus is

734
00:44:19,759 --> 00:44:24,839
coming again, and listen, if you're saved this morning, if you've trusted Christ as

735
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:30,479
your Savior this morning, understand that Jesus said, I will come again. And what's

736
00:44:30,479 --> 00:44:35,739
he gonna do? I'm gonna, he says, that you're gonna be with me forever. Amen? The

737
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:39,299
Bible says that the dead in Christ shall rise first, then we which are alive and

738
00:44:39,299 --> 00:44:43,579
remain shall be caught up together in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.

739
00:44:43,579 --> 00:44:48,959
And what a wonderful promise. Listen, that's my expectation, that's my end, is

740
00:44:48,959 --> 00:44:53,859
that I'm gonna meet my Savior face-to-face. And that period of time

741
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:58,539
between Rahab having that interaction with those spies, and making that

742
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:03,199
proclamation that she made where she declares who she understood God to be,

743
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:08,679
and then she put that scarlet thread in her window, yes, identifying her place, but

744
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:15,279
more importantly, revealing her faith. And I want you to think about Rahab. Listen,

745
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:18,099
the Bible tells us in verse number one of chapter six that all the city was

746
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:21,919
shut up, no one went out, no one came in. But I think Rahab had a different

747
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:26,999
perspective. I think for the inhabitants of Jericho, listen, when the nation of

748
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:30,819
Israel compassed the city, there were probably all kinds of mixed thoughts as

749
00:45:30,819 --> 00:45:36,299
to what was going on. But I think Rahab was anxiously awaiting. You know why? She

750
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:43,979
knew. She knew that her life would be spared. She knew that God had given the

751
00:45:43,979 --> 00:45:48,299
land to the people of Israel. She understood all of those things, but she

752
00:45:48,299 --> 00:45:54,819
had an expectation. And they marched around day number two. Can you imagine?

753
00:45:55,399 --> 00:45:59,879
Again and again, and all that takes place, and then when those walls fall down

754
00:45:59,879 --> 00:46:08,119
flat, God miraculously allowed for her house not to fall. It's amazing. Joshua

755
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:11,399
sent those messengers, and they brought Rahab and all of her family that was

756
00:46:11,399 --> 00:46:16,159
there out. There's one place of refuge, of safety. This morning, we see the

757
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:22,719
proclamation of Rahab. She understood who God was, who God is. This morning, we see

758
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:27,219
all of the events that unfold with this interaction, and how encouraged we are.

759
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:32,499
And I just wonder, how are we doing on declaring, on proclaiming how great our

760
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:40,019
God is? Are we more like the 10 spies that just always kind of doubting, and

761
00:46:40,019 --> 00:46:47,259
uncertain, and just kind of floundering around, and living by sight? Or are we

762
00:46:47,259 --> 00:46:52,799
recognizing that God is able, that God has a plan, and God has a purpose, and

763
00:46:52,799 --> 00:46:58,959
God will use us for His honor and for His glory? We serve a great God. He is God

764
00:46:58,959 --> 00:47:05,879
above. He is the Lord God Almighty. He lives, and He reigns, and He will reign

765
00:47:05,879 --> 00:47:10,999
forevermore. The Bible says, the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. And I'm so thankful

766
00:47:10,999 --> 00:47:15,479
to serve a risen Savior. Let's pray together. Father, we love You. We thank

767
00:47:15,479 --> 00:47:20,019
You for loving us. God, I pray this morning that if there's one that's

768
00:47:20,019 --> 00:47:23,519
unsure of heaven, they've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal

769
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:28,099
Savior. God, I pray that today would be the day of their salvation. I pray, Lord,

770
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:32,819
that if You would move and work in that individual's life, whether they're here

771
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:36,939
locally or tuned in via live stream, God, that they would not delay, that they

772
00:47:36,939 --> 00:47:42,179
would respond in faith, and obedience, and trust the Lord Jesus Christ, His

773
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:45,919
finished work at Calvary, His death, burial, and glorious resurrection. They'd

774
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:50,759
be saved by the blood of Christ. Lord, I pray for every child of God. Lord, I

775
00:47:50,759 --> 00:47:58,119
wonder this morning how Your truth truly impacts us, how understanding who You are

776
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:02,479
impacts the way that we live our lives. Are we actively proclaiming and

777
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:10,999
declaring to others how great You are? I pray, Lord, that You would help us to be

778
00:48:11,019 --> 00:48:17,259
challenged by the life and testimony of Rahab. Lord, help us to have that kind of

779
00:48:17,259 --> 00:48:23,659
faith. Lord, help us to expect, to anticipate Your soon return. Help us to

780
00:48:23,659 --> 00:48:27,499
be busy about what You've called us to do. I pray that in these few moments of

781
00:48:27,499 --> 00:48:31,139
invitation that You have Your will in way. You'd move and work in hearts and

782
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:35,099
lives as only You can. We'll be careful to thank You for all that You'll do. For

783
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:37,899
it's in Christ's name we pray. Would You stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are

784
00:48:37,899 --> 00:48:42,119
closed, end of each of our services.
