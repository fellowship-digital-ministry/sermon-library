WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.719
to make a difference, and Jude says of some having compassion, making a difference, and

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:12.319
I trust that God would use each of us to make a difference in our world, and we need a difference

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:13.319
in our world.

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:14.319
Amen?

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:15.319
And we are the light.

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:18.159
The Bible says that we're the salt of the earth, the light of the world, and what a

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:23.520
blessing to be the representatives, the ambassadors of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.159
Joshua chapter number two, Joshua chapter number two this morning, and we have transitioned

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:37.319
from our first phase, if you will, for our theme for 2023, great is the Lord and greatly

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:42.919
to be praised, and really the first phase that we spent so many months on was discovering

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:48.720
God's greatness, and I'm so thankful that God has given us the complete word of God,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.520
and He's given us within the canon of Scripture, He has revealed to us His greatness, and what

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.680
a wonderful truth that we can discover and make, be aware of as the psalmist said, I

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.119
know that the Lord is great.

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:08.120
Phase two, which we moved into last week, was declaring the greatness of God.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.120
The psalmist says, I know the Lord is great, but this says, I will declare His greatness,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.519
and what a great truth that we have of knowing how great our God is, but there's a world

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:23.879
that needs to know how great our God is, and we need to declare His greatness as we

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:28.839
finish up the calendar year, we will move into phase three when we deal with living

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:34.559
in light of His greatness, and how does His greatness, who He is, how great He is, how

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:39.559
does it impact how you live, how does it impact how I live, and that'll be phase number three,

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:44.800
but this morning is lesson two, message number two with this second phase, and last week

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.879
we looked at the proclamation of Jethro, and this week we're gonna look at the proclamation

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:55.080
of Rahab in Joshua chapter number two, and I understand as you study through the pages

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.519
of God's word, that there are many that proclaimed or declared the greatness of God, and I'm

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:07.160
not seeking to just be obscure for the purpose of being obscure, but I want to, as we look

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.520
at several of these examples, look at some folks that maybe we would not immediately

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.080
think of of people that declared the greatness of God. No doubt if I were to say to you this

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.399
morning, tell me some Bible characters that declared that God was great, Paul would be

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:27.880
on the list, and Isaiah, and Jeremiah, and no doubt Daniel would be on your list, and

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.720
Moses, and David, and so on and so forth, then I'm not saying that there's anything

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.839
wrong with any of those Bible characters that declared the greatness of God, in fact we

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.880
will study some of them. But you know it's impactful when you think about Jethro proclaiming

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.880
how great God is, and how Moses had an influence, an impact in his life, and he stands up and

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.679
proclaims that wonderful truth that we looked at last week, how he stands up and he makes

00:02:56.679 --> 00:03:03.679
that proclamation after hearing all that God did and how God worked in the life of Moses

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:10.600
and in the children of Israel, and he says, now I know, he was convinced of, he had this

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.919
assurance of, as we come to Joshua chapter number two, really the text of scripture,

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:20.360
if we look at the entirety of it, we find that Joshua as he's preparing to enter into

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.199
and lead the children of Israel into the land of promise, that he sends two spies to the

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:32.759
city of Jericho. Now remember that Joshua was one of the twelve spies that was sent

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:39.000
by Moses into the land of promise, and that didn't work out so well, Joshua and Caleb

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.479
were the only two that brought back a faith-filled report, the other ten did not believe God,

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:50.160
they looked at the giants and they looked at the walled cities and said we're not able,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.320
and they were discouraged and they influenced the entire nation of Israel, so much so that

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.279
when Joshua and Caleb stood up to still to calm the people and to tell them if the Lord

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:07.720
delight in us then God is able, they did not deny the existence of the giants, they did

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.740
not deny the fact that there were walled cities, they just knew how great God was and they

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.079
knew that God said and God would do. But we find that the people of Israel are ready to

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.320
stone Joshua and Caleb and they ended up wandering in the wilderness, but Joshua and Caleb were

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.559
too, I think about that wilderness wandering, the journeys, the forty years, and I think

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:34.959
about their expectation because they had the promise of God that they would enter into

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:41.640
the land of promise, and as they wandered along I think that they had their focus upon

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.119
seeing what God said that they would see, and Joshua now as Moses has died, he's the

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:53.839
leader humanly speaking of the nation of Israel, and he sends these two spies and he gives them

00:04:53.839 --> 00:05:00.799
their responsibility to go there into Jericho. We find that the king of Jericho, the leader

00:05:00.799 --> 00:05:06.920
in verse number two, is made aware of these two spies and what their mission is. They

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.519
organize a search party for the purpose of being able to find these spies and deal with

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:17.799
them accordingly, but according to verse number six, Rahab took them to the roof of her house

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:24.000
and she hid them with the stalks of flax and they were secure there, and we find that at

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.720
the end of chapter number two, the Bible tells us that these two spies, they return, according

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:36.119
to verses 23 and 24, and they bring back a report to Joshua and they deliver this message

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:42.799
to Joshua. But we find that between the spies entering and the spies returning, there's

00:05:42.799 --> 00:05:49.799
this great interaction that is recorded for us between these two spies and this lady with

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.640
the name of Rahab. And as we look at this particular interaction from verses eight through

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:02.200
21 this morning, the focus of our study will be that portion of scripture, and we'll consider

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:08.600
this morning, as we did last week, the proclamation of Jethro, this morning, the proclamation

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.040
of Rahab. Notice with me, if you will, in verse number eight, we'll pick it up there,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:20.000
the Bible says, and before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.519
And so these two spies are there on the roof, I mentioned already in verse number six, that's

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:29.239
where they were safe, and she comes up to the roof and they're going to have this interaction,

00:06:29.239 --> 00:06:34.720
this conversation. The Bible says in verse number nine that she said unto the men, I

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.679
know that the Lord hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and

00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:45.799
that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you. For we have heard how the

00:06:45.799 --> 00:06:50.279
Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when ye came out of Egypt, and what ye

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:55.480
did unto the two kings of the Amorites that were on the other side of Jordan, Sihon and

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:02.239
Og, whom ye utterly destroyed. And as soon as we heard these things, our hearts did melt,

00:07:02.239 --> 00:07:07.239
but neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you, for the Lord your

00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:12.519
God, he is God in heaven above and in earth beneath. At the end of verse number 11 is

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:16.920
where you read that proclamation that we will focus our attention on this morning, where

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:22.320
Rahab says, for the Lord your God, he is a God in heaven above and in earth beneath.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.160
As we look at this portion of scripture, I want you to notice with me, if you're taking

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.760
notes, number one this morning, notice what Rahab revealed. In verses eight through 11,

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.679
during this interaction, this conversation between Rahab and these two spies, we find

00:07:35.679 --> 00:07:42.600
that Rahab revealed some things to them. In verse number 10, notice the phraseology where

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:49.239
Rahab says, for we have heard. That's not only Rahab, but that's the inhabitants there

00:07:49.239 --> 00:07:55.839
of the city of Jericho, and we find that Rahab says we've heard, and she begins to explain

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:02.480
to these two spies what it was that they heard. Number one, they heard about the miraculous

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.239
Red Sea crossing. We read about that portion of scripture and that event that's given to

00:08:07.239 --> 00:08:13.040
us and recorded for us in Exodus chapter 14, and what a mountaintop passage of scripture

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:19.739
Exodus 14 is, and you get to read about God's deliverance of his people out of Egypt and

00:08:19.739 --> 00:08:24.880
how he miraculously parted the Red Sea, and how the children of Israel, they walked, the

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:34.000
Bible says, on dry ground, not mucky, muddy. No, it was dry ground. God worked a miracle,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.640
and the Egyptians, they saw what happened, and they assayed to go after them, and God

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.659
caused the chariot wheels to come off, and they got stuck, and they were destroyed there

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:50.280
in the Red Sea, and God wrought wonderfully. In fact, in chapter 15 of the book of Exodus,

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:56.000
there's great rejoicing and singing that takes place, and here we find that Rahab,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:04.760
one of the inhabitants of the city of Jericho, she says to these two spies, for we have heard.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:10.119
What did we hear? We heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea. Notice where

00:09:10.119 --> 00:09:18.679
it says, for you. The Lord did this for you when you came out of Egypt. Listen, I'm thankful

00:09:18.679 --> 00:09:25.440
that God works for us. I'm thankful for what God does for us in our lives. And here Rahab

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:32.219
is saying, I understand, we have heard what God did for you, and I want you to notice

00:09:32.219 --> 00:09:38.840
that she mentions about this miraculous Red Sea crossing and what a great miracle that

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.960
was, and we find that she continues in verse number 10 and speaks about the complete victory

00:09:44.039 --> 00:09:48.880
over Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, who were on the other side of Jordan, and

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:54.559
you can read back into the text within Numbers and Deuteronomy and read about the account

00:09:54.559 --> 00:10:01.559
there and the victory, the complete victory that God gave. And so we find that it is a

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:05.439
as Rahab is having this interaction with these two spies,

00:10:05.439 --> 00:10:06.999
that she reveals some things,

00:10:06.999 --> 00:10:09.399
and first what she reveals is what she heard.

00:10:10.439 --> 00:10:13.519
But then notice with me what she knew.

00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:15.959
Now, we looked at verse number 10 to see what she heard,

00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:18.979
but we look back at verse number nine to see what she knew.

00:10:18.979 --> 00:10:21.279
What was the conclusion that she reached

00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:23.519
based upon that which she heard?

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:24.999
Notice in verse number nine,

00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:26.199
and she said unto the men,

00:10:26.199 --> 00:10:31.199
"'Notice I know that the Lord hath given you

00:10:31.719 --> 00:10:32.839
"'the land.'"

00:10:33.879 --> 00:10:35.259
She knew that.

00:10:35.259 --> 00:10:37.839
She was thoroughly convinced of that.

00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:39.199
And notice that she says,

00:10:39.199 --> 00:10:42.999
she uses the name Jehovah for God.

00:10:42.999 --> 00:10:46.379
"'I know that Jehovah God, your God,

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:49.199
"'he hath given you the land.'"

00:10:49.199 --> 00:10:52.999
And we find that she, Rahab, knew this.

00:10:52.999 --> 00:10:56.719
She understood based upon that which she heard

00:10:56.719 --> 00:10:58.559
and that which had transpired.

00:10:58.559 --> 00:11:01.279
She knew, she was convinced,

00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:05.659
and she reveals that to these two spies.

00:11:05.659 --> 00:11:07.759
And then we notice the impact,

00:11:07.759 --> 00:11:10.299
and notice in verse number nine,

00:11:10.299 --> 00:11:13.479
the impact of what they heard and what she knew,

00:11:13.479 --> 00:11:14.919
the impact, in verse number nine,

00:11:14.919 --> 00:11:19.559
it says, "'And that your terror is fallen upon us,

00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:22.680
"'and that all the inhabitants of the land faint

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.360
"'because of you.'"

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.519
Wow, that's impactful.

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:30.680
In verse number 11, it continues on.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.279
Notice the phrase that says,

00:11:32.279 --> 00:11:35.519
"'As soon as we heard these things.'"

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:37.299
I'm not sure, the Bible doesn't tell us

00:11:37.299 --> 00:11:40.000
how word reached to the city of Jericho

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.040
with regard to the crossing of the Red Sea,

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.799
the miraculous event that took place

00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:47.799
and God delivering his people from Egypt.

00:11:47.799 --> 00:11:49.519
We do not know how they found out

00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:53.119
about the complete victory there over Sihon and Og,

00:11:53.119 --> 00:11:55.799
but they heard and they understood some things.

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:58.680
And the Bible says that as soon as we heard these things,

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.559
notice the Bible says this in verse number 11,

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:04.079
"'Our hearts did melt.'"

00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:06.159
Our hearts did melt.

00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:07.839
And it continues and says,

00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:11.039
"'Neither did there remain any more courage

00:12:11.039 --> 00:12:14.119
"'in any man because of you.'"

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.819
That's quite the impact, is it not,

00:12:17.819 --> 00:12:21.160
of what they heard and what she knew,

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.800
the conclusion that she reached

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.160
based upon what she heard,

00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:26.559
the Lord has given you the land,

00:12:26.559 --> 00:12:28.839
that she tells these two spies

00:12:28.839 --> 00:12:32.599
as she's revealing to them the condition, if you will,

00:12:32.599 --> 00:12:36.880
the pulse of the people of Jericho

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.080
because of what's transpired.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.880
Now, remember, the people of Jericho,

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.800
they're in a pretty nice, defensed, walled city,

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.559
are they not?

00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:48.199
In fact, we read about the conquering of Jericho,

00:12:48.199 --> 00:12:50.020
that particular city, and the walls

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.599
as they come past them about and so on and so forth.

00:12:52.599 --> 00:12:55.720
And we find that as we look at this passage of Scripture,

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.759
and we understand that there were 10 spies

00:12:58.759 --> 00:13:01.440
that had been sent out by Moses,

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.839
and they were concerned about the walled cities,

00:13:03.839 --> 00:13:06.199
but these that are within the walled cities,

00:13:06.199 --> 00:13:10.039
because of what they heard God did and how God worked,

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:12.639
they say that, "'Our hearts did melt,

00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:14.899
"'neither did there remain any more courage

00:13:14.899 --> 00:13:17.839
"'in any man because of you.'"

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.819
Wow, I wonder this morning,

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.259
as we notice in our text of Scripture,

00:13:24.259 --> 00:13:27.139
what Rahab revealed to these two spies,

00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:30.419
and the impact that the truth had

00:13:30.419 --> 00:13:32.500
upon the inhabitants of Jericho,

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.779
the impact that it had on them,

00:13:34.779 --> 00:13:38.580
that God would deliver them through the Red Sea,

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.179
that God would give them complete victory in Sihon and Og,

00:13:42.179 --> 00:13:45.940
and how it impacted them, that their hearts did melt,

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.259
that the inhabitants of the land fainted because of them,

00:13:49.259 --> 00:13:51.779
that they had no courage left in them.

00:13:51.779 --> 00:13:55.899
I wonder, on the opposite side this morning,

00:13:55.899 --> 00:13:58.339
how does it impact you and how does it impact me

00:13:58.339 --> 00:14:00.239
when we see what our God's able to do?

00:14:02.099 --> 00:14:03.020
Because you know what it should do?

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.020
It should give us faith.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.539
It should give us expectation.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.979
It should cause us to anticipate what is God going to do?

00:14:10.979 --> 00:14:14.660
And we think about the impact on the inhabitants

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.779
of the land, but if we were to contrast it this morning,

00:14:18.019 --> 00:14:20.220
when you think about those 10 spies,

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.579
and we know that it happened 40 years previous

00:14:23.579 --> 00:14:26.260
when those 10 spies, they go in and they see the giants

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.139
and the walled cities and all that they see,

00:14:28.139 --> 00:14:32.779
and they're discouraged and they are responding

00:14:32.779 --> 00:14:35.899
in just a terrible way.

00:14:35.899 --> 00:14:39.500
And God, in fact, says in Numbers 14,

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.019
when he's speaking to Moses,

00:14:41.019 --> 00:14:44.899
how long will it be, e'er my people believe me?

00:14:44.899 --> 00:14:48.500
All that God did for the children of Israel,

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.339
they experienced it firsthand,

00:14:51.339 --> 00:14:54.619
and many of them had no faith and no courage,

00:14:54.619 --> 00:14:56.419
and they weren't willing to go forward,

00:14:56.419 --> 00:14:58.480
but yet the inhabitants of the land,

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.480
when they heard what God did, they were afraid.

00:15:03.619 --> 00:15:04.980
They had no courage.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:09.980
I wonder this morning, when we hear the wonderful accounts

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.459
of what God has done, when you read your Bible,

00:15:13.459 --> 00:15:17.139
when you hear the preaching and teaching of God's word,

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.419
when you see what God is doing in the lives of others,

00:15:21.419 --> 00:15:23.299
does it encourage you this morning?

00:15:23.299 --> 00:15:26.660
Does it cause you to have your faith increased?

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:31.260
See, this morning, we're to live by faith, are we not?

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.739
The just shall live by faith.

00:15:33.739 --> 00:15:35.220
How do we have faith?

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.419
How do we have our faith increased?

00:15:37.419 --> 00:15:38.880
So then faith cometh by hearing,

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.119
and hearing by the word of God.

00:15:40.119 --> 00:15:42.779
We know that the Bible says, for by grace are you saved

00:15:42.779 --> 00:15:44.899
through faith, and that not of yourselves is the gift

00:15:44.899 --> 00:15:47.200
of God, not of works as any man should boast,

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.059
but after we're saved, we're to live by faith.

00:15:52.179 --> 00:15:53.820
We're to be people of faith.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:57.139
You know, as God has given us the account here

00:15:57.139 --> 00:16:00.540
in what's being revealed to these two spies from Rahab,

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.019
and we see the impact and the influence

00:16:03.019 --> 00:16:05.779
that the report had upon those inhabitants,

00:16:05.779 --> 00:16:08.639
I just wonder this morning, as we would look

00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:11.339
at our own lives, as we would evaluate ourselves,

00:16:11.339 --> 00:16:14.839
we ought to be some people of faith.

00:16:14.839 --> 00:16:16.500
We ought to be some people that trust God,

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.679
that believe God.

00:16:17.679 --> 00:16:20.639
Listen, we should not hear the reports that are going on

00:16:20.639 --> 00:16:23.059
in our world today, and seeing the things that are going on,

00:16:23.059 --> 00:16:25.739
and saying, oh, woe is me, we're so defeated.

00:16:25.739 --> 00:16:27.940
No, no, we're on the winning side.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.179
If God before us, who can be against us?

00:16:30.179 --> 00:16:33.540
And we are more than conquerors through him that loved us,

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.619
and we understand this morning

00:16:35.619 --> 00:16:39.700
that we are able to have victory,

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.440
but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.500
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.619
Listen, I'm thankful that one day I'm gonna go to heaven,

00:16:47.619 --> 00:16:49.899
but reality is that we can have victory

00:16:49.899 --> 00:16:52.660
even here upon this earth.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.619
God doesn't expect for you or for me

00:16:54.619 --> 00:16:57.419
to live defeated Christian lives.

00:16:57.419 --> 00:17:00.139
He doesn't expect us to live under the circumstances.

00:17:00.139 --> 00:17:02.260
He doesn't expect us to live by sight.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.320
No, we're to live by faith.

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.540
And as we read the biblical content

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.059
that he's provided us with,

00:17:10.059 --> 00:17:12.019
that he gives us those truths

00:17:12.019 --> 00:17:14.339
so that we would have our faith increase,

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:17.919
so that we would trust him, so that we would prove him.

00:17:19.299 --> 00:17:21.540
Our God is trustworthy.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:26.540
We sang this morning, great is thy faithfulness.

00:17:27.459 --> 00:17:29.700
Aren't you thankful that God is faithful?

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.380
I'm thankful this morning that God will never forsake you.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.179
He'll never forsake me.

00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:36.619
I'm thankful that God is at work.

00:17:36.779 --> 00:17:38.500
And this morning, as much as we can see

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.380
from the text of scripture,

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:44.500
the impact that was upon the inhabitants

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.899
of the land of Jericho, of the city of Jericho,

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.220
I just wonder this morning,

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:52.600
how does what God is doing and has done,

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.519
how does that impact you and I this morning?

00:17:55.519 --> 00:17:56.779
Number two, if you're taking notes,

00:17:56.779 --> 00:17:59.139
we notice, first of all, what Rahab revealed.

00:17:59.139 --> 00:18:01.799
Number two, notice what Rahab declared.

00:18:01.799 --> 00:18:03.220
We've already made mention of it

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:04.700
at the end of verse number 11.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.179
This great declaration of Rahab,

00:18:07.179 --> 00:18:11.119
where she declares to these two spies,

00:18:12.339 --> 00:18:13.700
she says at the end of the verse,

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:17.459
verse number 11, for the Lord your God.

00:18:17.459 --> 00:18:19.299
Now, it makes it very clear and very plain

00:18:19.299 --> 00:18:21.320
who she's speaking of.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.739
She's not speaking of any of the false gods of the land.

00:18:24.739 --> 00:18:26.779
She's not speaking of any of those idols

00:18:26.779 --> 00:18:28.660
that she would be aware of,

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.739
that the inhabitants of the land,

00:18:30.739 --> 00:18:32.540
remember, they're warned, the children of Israel

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.179
were given warning about entering into the land

00:18:35.179 --> 00:18:39.340
and the idols and the false idolatrous worship

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:40.640
that they would be faced with.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.159
But here we find that Rahab says, for the Lord your God,

00:18:44.159 --> 00:18:48.460
notice what she says, he is God in heaven above

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.940
and in earth beneath.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:55.859
What a great statement, a great proclamation,

00:18:55.859 --> 00:18:58.260
as she makes this declarative statement,

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.900
as she understands all that she has been made aware of

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.739
and all that she has grasped

00:19:03.739 --> 00:19:06.460
as she's looking at these events that have unfolded

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.219
and she reaches this wonderful conclusion

00:19:09.219 --> 00:19:12.140
and she declares with great certainty

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.500
that the Lord your God, he is God in heaven above

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.340
and in earth beneath.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.099
You know what I think she's saying?

00:19:21.099 --> 00:19:24.140
He's not like any other small G-O-D.

00:19:25.739 --> 00:19:28.219
Moses, God speaks to Moses and says

00:19:28.219 --> 00:19:31.739
that their rock isn't like our rock.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.779
And I think what Rahab is recognizing,

00:19:34.779 --> 00:19:37.859
what Rahab is declaring here is that yes,

00:19:37.859 --> 00:19:40.859
I'm familiar with other quote-unquote deities,

00:19:40.859 --> 00:19:44.539
I'm familiar with other idols and the false worship

00:19:44.539 --> 00:19:48.260
and all of the pagan idolatry that's in the land,

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.739
but they're not like your God.

00:19:52.099 --> 00:19:54.179
It's a wonderful proclamation.

00:19:54.179 --> 00:19:56.940
This morning, we serve the living God.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.340
Listen, we ought to rejoice this morning

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.979
in understanding who we.

00:20:01.979 --> 00:20:03.359
We serve.

00:20:03.359 --> 00:20:11.899
I know that it's typical that during the resurrection service and that Resurrection Sunday, Easter

00:20:11.899 --> 00:20:17.299
Sunday is referred to it, that we'll sing those songs about He lives and Christ the

00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:22.179
Lord is risen today and up from the grave He arose, but you understand that every single

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:25.439
Sunday we meet because we serve a risen Savior.

00:20:25.439 --> 00:20:29.379
We meet on Sunday because it's the Lord's day, it's the first day, it's the day of the

00:20:29.379 --> 00:20:34.579
resurrection and we meet because we serve a risen Savior.

00:20:34.579 --> 00:20:39.699
And listen, our God that we serve, He is alive.

00:20:39.699 --> 00:20:41.259
He is active.

00:20:41.259 --> 00:20:46.979
He is able and this morning when we understand that, when we see what this proclamation is

00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:50.679
from Rahab and we say, yes, that's my God.

00:20:50.679 --> 00:20:55.399
He is the one that's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:20:55.399 --> 00:20:59.079
He is the one that is actively working in our world today.

00:20:59.079 --> 00:21:03.659
He's the one that would use me and would use you to bring honor and glory to Himself.

00:21:03.659 --> 00:21:06.799
Man, what a God we serve.

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:12.819
It's a privilege to know the God that we serve.

00:21:12.819 --> 00:21:17.359
Listen, there are a lot of people around the world that are blinded.

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:20.979
The Bible says that the God of this world in 2 Corinthians chapter number 4, He had

00:21:20.979 --> 00:21:25.119
blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel should

00:21:25.119 --> 00:21:27.159
shine in unto them.

00:21:27.239 --> 00:21:34.839
And I'm thankful this morning that God in His amazing grace and His mercy, He allowed

00:21:34.839 --> 00:21:38.279
me to know Him.

00:21:38.279 --> 00:21:40.839
He allowed you to know Him.

00:21:40.839 --> 00:21:44.279
I wonder this morning, how did you first learn about God?

00:21:44.279 --> 00:21:48.119
You know, sometimes I ask people if they're sure that they're going to go to heaven when

00:21:48.119 --> 00:21:51.359
they die and they say, oh yeah, I'm a Christian.

00:21:51.359 --> 00:21:52.639
Tell me a little bit more about that.

00:21:52.639 --> 00:21:53.999
Well, I've just always been a Christian.

00:21:53.999 --> 00:21:55.519
I was born a Christian.

00:21:55.519 --> 00:21:58.919
You're not born a Christian.

00:21:58.919 --> 00:22:05.319
You're born in enmity with God, biblically speaking.

00:22:05.319 --> 00:22:11.039
And we begin to think about when the Lord made Himself known to us.

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:12.559
Some of us got saved young in life.

00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:18.319
Some of us got saved in our middle ages, if you will.

00:22:18.319 --> 00:22:21.359
Some got saved older in life.

00:22:21.359 --> 00:22:27.319
But I wonder this morning, as we think about this proclamation, what Rahab declared to

00:22:27.319 --> 00:22:33.119
these two spies in verse number 11, I wonder when it was in your life that you recognized

00:22:33.119 --> 00:22:37.959
that the Lord God Jehovah is the only God.

00:22:37.959 --> 00:22:39.719
And He is the only Savior.

00:22:39.719 --> 00:22:41.039
He's the only way.

00:22:41.039 --> 00:22:45.119
See, for some, you were taught that from the youngest of age.

00:22:45.119 --> 00:22:49.759
For some in our church, those little children that are in the nursery and then go into the

00:22:50.159 --> 00:22:54.639
children's church and are here for student ministries, they're learning from the earliest

00:22:54.639 --> 00:22:57.559
of days who God is.

00:22:57.559 --> 00:23:02.359
But, you know, when I was their age, when I was a young teenager, I didn't know who

00:23:02.359 --> 00:23:04.319
the God of the Bible was.

00:23:04.319 --> 00:23:06.959
I had no idea.

00:23:06.959 --> 00:23:08.079
And some of you can relate.

00:23:08.079 --> 00:23:13.599
Some of you can understand that you did not know who Jehovah God was.

00:23:13.599 --> 00:23:19.119
But I wonder this morning, as we think about this truth and we think about this, what Rahab

00:23:19.879 --> 00:23:26.359
declares to these two spies, I wonder this morning, when did you understand who Jesus

00:23:26.359 --> 00:23:29.679
is, who God is?

00:23:29.679 --> 00:23:34.319
And are you thankful this morning that He's made Himself known to you?

00:23:34.319 --> 00:23:40.879
You think about the truth of the Apostle Paul in Athens, and he says that they're superstitious

00:23:40.879 --> 00:23:46.039
and they had all of those various monuments and what have you, and they had this altar

00:23:46.039 --> 00:23:49.599
to the unknown God.

00:23:49.599 --> 00:23:54.239
And Paul says, as he goes in and speaks to those people, speaking about that particular

00:23:54.239 --> 00:23:58.119
altar, he says, Him declare I unto you.

00:23:58.119 --> 00:24:03.879
Listen, there was a time in your life, there was a time in Rahab's life where she recognized

00:24:03.879 --> 00:24:07.239
that there's something different about the Lord your God.

00:24:07.239 --> 00:24:11.559
There's a time that we realize, listen, God is true, God is real.

00:24:11.559 --> 00:24:16.439
And I wonder, after we've recognized that, after we've been saved and we've been born

00:24:16.439 --> 00:24:22.679
again by the grace of God, I wonder how often we're declaring how wonderful He is.

00:24:22.679 --> 00:24:28.839
I wonder how often those words pass through our lips about how He's a wonderful Savior

00:24:28.839 --> 00:24:33.159
and that we would lift up and exalt His name.

00:24:33.159 --> 00:24:36.919
We notice in the text of Scripture what Rahab revealed.

00:24:36.919 --> 00:24:38.239
We notice what she declared.

00:24:38.239 --> 00:24:41.879
And I want you to notice with me number three what she requested.

00:24:41.879 --> 00:24:43.439
Notice what Rahab requested.

00:24:43.439 --> 00:24:48.399
In verse number 12, she'd made that great declaration in verse number 11.

00:24:48.399 --> 00:24:50.899
And then she says, now therefore.

00:24:50.899 --> 00:24:56.799
Notice what she says in verse number 12, I pray you, swear unto me by the Lord since

00:24:56.799 --> 00:25:02.119
I have showed you kindness that you will show also, that you will also show kindness unto

00:25:02.119 --> 00:25:04.079
my Father's house.

00:25:04.079 --> 00:25:07.999
And notice she says, and give me a true token.

00:25:08.039 --> 00:25:13.759
And that you will save alive my father, my mother, my brethren, my sisters, and all that

00:25:13.759 --> 00:25:17.999
they have and deliver our lives from death.

00:25:17.999 --> 00:25:22.879
The men answered her, our life for yours if you utter not this our business.

00:25:22.879 --> 00:25:28.479
And it shall be when the Lord hath given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly

00:25:28.479 --> 00:25:30.279
with thee.

00:25:30.279 --> 00:25:35.319
Then she let them down by a cord through the window, for her house was upon the town wall

00:25:35.319 --> 00:25:38.119
and she dwelt upon the wall.

00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:42.879
She said unto them, get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you.

00:25:42.879 --> 00:25:47.259
Hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers be returned.

00:25:47.259 --> 00:25:50.439
And afterward may you go your way.

00:25:50.439 --> 00:25:54.719
The men said unto her, we will be blameless of this thine oath, which thou hast made us

00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:55.719
swear.

00:25:55.719 --> 00:26:01.979
Behold, verse 18, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread

00:26:02.099 --> 00:26:05.659
in the window, which thou didst let us down by.

00:26:05.659 --> 00:26:10.299
And thou shalt bring thy father, thy mother, thy brethren, and all thy father's household

00:26:10.299 --> 00:26:12.859
home unto thee.

00:26:12.859 --> 00:26:17.899
And it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street,

00:26:17.899 --> 00:26:22.539
his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless.

00:26:22.539 --> 00:26:27.699
And whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand

00:26:27.699 --> 00:26:28.699
be upon him.

00:26:29.179 --> 00:26:33.859
And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath, which thou

00:26:33.859 --> 00:26:36.019
hast made us to swear.

00:26:36.019 --> 00:26:40.419
Verse 21, she said, according unto your words, so be it.

00:26:40.419 --> 00:26:46.459
She sent them away and they departed, and she bound the scarlet line in the window.

00:26:46.459 --> 00:26:52.259
As we look at this request that is made in her response to the agreement, we find that,

00:26:52.259 --> 00:26:57.219
I would say this, that her faith is evidenced by her actions.

00:26:57.219 --> 00:27:00.099
She truly believed what she declared.

00:27:00.099 --> 00:27:03.419
She believed, as she said in verse number nine, I know that the Lord hath given you

00:27:03.419 --> 00:27:04.419
the land.

00:27:04.419 --> 00:27:09.339
She says in verse number 12, that I pray you, swearing to me by the Lord, since I have showed

00:27:09.339 --> 00:27:15.299
you kindness, that you will save us alive, as you get into verse number 13.

00:27:15.299 --> 00:27:21.899
And we find that she was thoroughly convinced, she was believing what she had declared, that

00:27:21.899 --> 00:27:26.259
they truly were going to come in and conquer.

00:27:26.259 --> 00:27:27.539
She's concerned.

00:27:27.539 --> 00:27:31.539
We find that there's a plea that she gives, a plea for protection.

00:27:31.539 --> 00:27:35.539
I want you to understand that she's not just concerned for her own self.

00:27:35.539 --> 00:27:37.219
She's concerned for her family.

00:27:37.219 --> 00:27:38.819
She's concerned for others.

00:27:38.819 --> 00:27:43.099
And as we would make a spiritual application from this passage of scripture this morning,

00:27:43.099 --> 00:27:48.299
and we'd understand the request that she's making to these two spies and the plea for

00:27:48.299 --> 00:27:53.539
protection, I would say to you this morning that as we consider the application of being

00:27:53.579 --> 00:27:58.299
saved, of being born again, that listen, if we're saved this morning, we ought to have

00:27:58.299 --> 00:28:00.259
a concern for others.

00:28:00.259 --> 00:28:05.939
We ought to have a burden for someone else to have salvation through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:28:05.939 --> 00:28:06.939
Why?

00:28:06.939 --> 00:28:10.899
Because we understand that apart from being saved by the blood of Jesus Christ, man is

00:28:10.899 --> 00:28:16.019
going to die and enter into a Christless eternity where they will spend forever in a place called

00:28:16.019 --> 00:28:17.499
the Lake of Fire.

00:28:17.499 --> 00:28:22.139
And we ought to have a burden that others...

00:28:22.139 --> 00:28:23.899
That burden starts with our own family.

00:28:23.899 --> 00:28:29.939
I think about the truth in the book of Luke as the interaction of Lazarus and the rich

00:28:29.939 --> 00:28:30.939
man.

00:28:30.939 --> 00:28:34.500
And the rich man is in hell and he's concerned about his brethren.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:35.500
And what does he say?

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:39.459
He says, let Lazarus go back and speak to them because I don't want them to come to

00:28:39.459 --> 00:28:44.260
this place, this place of torment.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:51.099
We understand that in the text, his belief, that rich man's belief is that if one were

00:28:51.099 --> 00:28:56.979
to rise from the dead, that his brothers would believe, but it's so clearly spelled

00:28:56.979 --> 00:29:01.940
out in that portion of scripture that they have Moses and the prophets.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:06.459
If they won't believe that, then they won't believe though one rose from the dead.

00:29:06.459 --> 00:29:07.459
You know what that tells me?

00:29:07.459 --> 00:29:10.500
There's power in this word.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:14.219
We're born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the word of God, which

00:29:14.219 --> 00:29:17.219
liveth and abideth forever.

00:29:17.219 --> 00:29:20.940
I'm so thankful that God uses his word.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:26.500
He's given us his complete canon of scripture and we can rest assured this morning that

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.059
he uses his word.

00:29:28.059 --> 00:29:31.739
And as we look at her plea for protection, it's not just personal.

00:29:31.739 --> 00:29:38.019
She's concerned for others, her family, and she's desiring that they would have this deliverance

00:29:38.019 --> 00:29:42.899
when they would come into the land, that they would be delivered from death.

00:29:42.899 --> 00:29:48.820
You know, so many people today, even as we would look at the actual understanding of

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:55.739
Joshua 2 with regard to the content, the physical death that would come to the inhabitants

00:29:55.739 --> 00:29:56.739
of Jericho.

00:29:56.739 --> 00:30:00.940
You know, there are a lot of people that we come into contact with every single day of

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:01.659
our lives.

00:30:01.659 --> 00:30:05.939
that they are concerned about their physical well-being.

00:30:07.219 --> 00:30:10.299
They're fearful of dying physically.

00:30:12.099 --> 00:30:13.859
But so often there's little thought

00:30:13.859 --> 00:30:15.979
that's given to the second death.

00:30:17.819 --> 00:30:20.619
And this morning, as much as people would wanna be spared

00:30:20.619 --> 00:30:24.259
from physical death, and we've seen in recent years,

00:30:24.259 --> 00:30:26.459
not only in our country, but around the world,

00:30:26.459 --> 00:30:31.459
we have seen how that self-preservation has been obvious

00:30:31.459 --> 00:30:34.979
that people are so concerned about life

00:30:36.339 --> 00:30:38.599
and being able to protect themselves.

00:30:38.599 --> 00:30:40.339
I'm not saying that we should be haphazard.

00:30:40.339 --> 00:30:43.059
I'm not suggesting that we shouldn't be concerned

00:30:43.059 --> 00:30:44.979
about our health, but what I'm saying this morning

00:30:44.979 --> 00:30:48.339
is that the immediate context of what we're dealing with

00:30:48.339 --> 00:30:51.299
is the physical death, but we ought to understand

00:30:51.299 --> 00:30:54.539
this morning that there is something that's far greater,

00:30:54.539 --> 00:30:55.939
and that's the second death.

00:30:57.919 --> 00:31:00.139
Notice there's an agreement that is made,

00:31:00.139 --> 00:31:03.539
and the explanation is given in verses 14 through 20.

00:31:03.539 --> 00:31:06.539
I will not read all of the verses of Scripture again

00:31:06.539 --> 00:31:08.439
as I've read them just a moment ago,

00:31:08.439 --> 00:31:12.159
but I want you to see a couple of things in particular.

00:31:12.159 --> 00:31:14.539
Number one, I want you to notice in verse 18,

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:17.499
the Bible says, behold, when we come into the land,

00:31:17.499 --> 00:31:19.219
listen, there was a certain expectation

00:31:19.219 --> 00:31:21.059
that these spies had.

00:31:21.059 --> 00:31:22.439
There was an understanding

00:31:22.439 --> 00:31:24.839
that they were going to be returning,

00:31:24.839 --> 00:31:27.779
that God did promise to give them the land,

00:31:27.779 --> 00:31:29.019
and they would be returning.

00:31:29.019 --> 00:31:31.819
It says, when we come into the land, notice what they say,

00:31:31.819 --> 00:31:36.819
thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window,

00:31:37.699 --> 00:31:40.059
which thou didst let us down by.

00:31:40.919 --> 00:31:44.179
I want you to think about that line of scarlet thread.

00:31:44.179 --> 00:31:47.259
In fact, there are records all the way dating back

00:31:47.259 --> 00:31:52.059
to the first century where people, theologians and scholars,

00:31:52.059 --> 00:31:55.219
if you will, would look at this scarlet thread

00:31:55.219 --> 00:31:58.099
as a picture representing the very blood

00:31:58.139 --> 00:31:59.899
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:31:59.899 --> 00:32:02.379
And so often as we look at the Old Testament

00:32:02.379 --> 00:32:03.939
and we look at the typologies

00:32:03.939 --> 00:32:06.999
and we look at the prophecies that are given,

00:32:06.999 --> 00:32:09.299
there's no doubt in my mind that when you think

00:32:09.299 --> 00:32:11.619
about this line of a scarlet thread,

00:32:11.619 --> 00:32:14.219
that yes, this would identify her place,

00:32:14.219 --> 00:32:17.019
but it also would reveal her faith.

00:32:17.019 --> 00:32:19.859
And we find that she was given this instruction

00:32:19.859 --> 00:32:21.219
in verse number 18.

00:32:21.219 --> 00:32:24.479
The instruction not only was given with regard

00:32:24.479 --> 00:32:27.339
to binding the line of scarlet thread in the window,

00:32:27.339 --> 00:32:30.819
but notice what it continues to say in verse 18 and 19.

00:32:30.819 --> 00:32:34.459
It says this, and thou shalt bring thy father

00:32:34.459 --> 00:32:37.059
and thy mother and thy brethren

00:32:37.059 --> 00:32:41.419
and all thy father's household home unto thee.

00:32:41.419 --> 00:32:46.219
Verse 19, and it shall be that whosoever shall go out

00:32:46.219 --> 00:32:48.539
of the doors of thy house into the street,

00:32:48.539 --> 00:32:53.539
his blood shall be upon his head and we will be guiltless.

00:32:53.539 --> 00:32:56.899
And whosoever shall be with thee in the house,

00:32:56.899 --> 00:33:01.899
his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him.

00:33:02.619 --> 00:33:05.379
As we begin to look at this verse of scripture

00:33:05.379 --> 00:33:07.699
in verses 18 and 19 and think about the agreement

00:33:07.699 --> 00:33:09.859
that is made that is explained here,

00:33:09.859 --> 00:33:12.099
we find that not only do they speak about binding

00:33:12.099 --> 00:33:13.819
this line of scarlet thread,

00:33:13.819 --> 00:33:15.939
but we find that they make it abundantly clear

00:33:15.939 --> 00:33:17.999
that there's only one place of safety.

00:33:18.859 --> 00:33:21.179
There's just one place of safety.

00:33:21.179 --> 00:33:23.019
What a great picture.

00:33:23.019 --> 00:33:26.299
I think about the truth of God's word

00:33:26.299 --> 00:33:29.499
with regard to even in the earliest pages

00:33:29.499 --> 00:33:32.159
of the Old Testament pointing to the truth

00:33:32.159 --> 00:33:35.119
of being one place for safety, for refuge.

00:33:35.119 --> 00:33:36.619
I think about the ark.

00:33:39.279 --> 00:33:40.119
The ark.

00:33:41.219 --> 00:33:45.139
There's just one place of refuge, just one place of safety.

00:33:45.139 --> 00:33:50.139
Eight people survived the flood, God's judgment.

00:33:51.919 --> 00:33:55.779
All eight of those people were in the ark.

00:33:55.779 --> 00:33:57.019
They were in the ark.

00:33:57.019 --> 00:34:01.039
I think about the Passover and I think about the truth

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:05.899
of the instruction that God gives to the initial,

00:34:05.899 --> 00:34:08.379
the immediate in the book of Exodus

00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:10.339
with regard to the applying of the blood

00:34:10.339 --> 00:34:13.779
and the 10th plague, the death of the firstborn.

00:34:13.779 --> 00:34:16.819
And I find that when that Passover was instituted

00:34:16.819 --> 00:34:20.739
that there was but one way to have safety,

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:22.819
to have deliverance.

00:34:22.819 --> 00:34:26.059
If someone said, well, I understand what Moses said.

00:34:26.059 --> 00:34:27.339
It's not a matter of ignorance.

00:34:27.339 --> 00:34:29.579
It's just a matter of I'm gonna do it my way.

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:32.459
I think that I could do it this way.

00:34:32.459 --> 00:34:35.099
I think I could change this and it doesn't,

00:34:35.099 --> 00:34:37.979
why does it really have to be that way?

00:34:37.979 --> 00:34:39.779
Because that's what God said.

00:34:39.779 --> 00:34:41.859
Because that's what God said.

00:34:41.859 --> 00:34:43.779
So often people want to fight with God

00:34:44.839 --> 00:34:46.539
instead of just submitting to God.

00:34:47.459 --> 00:34:50.819
I think about this one, what about the brazen serpent?

00:34:50.819 --> 00:34:52.419
Because of the complaining of the people,

00:34:53.379 --> 00:34:56.019
God sent forth fiery serpents.

00:34:56.019 --> 00:34:57.579
They were crying out.

00:34:57.579 --> 00:35:01.899
God then instructed Moses to make a brazen serpent

00:35:01.899 --> 00:35:04.139
and to fashion that serpent upon a pole

00:35:04.139 --> 00:35:05.619
and to set it in the midst of the camp.

00:35:05.619 --> 00:35:07.139
And he said that when somebody was bitten

00:35:07.139 --> 00:35:09.339
that if they looked, we sing the song,

00:35:09.339 --> 00:35:10.779
look and live, my brother, live.

00:35:10.779 --> 00:35:12.419
Look to Jesus now and live, why?

00:35:12.419 --> 00:35:13.579
Because it's a picture.

00:35:13.579 --> 00:35:16.439
Jesus in fact referenced it in the book of John.

00:35:19.419 --> 00:35:21.619
And we find that that brazen serpent,

00:35:21.619 --> 00:35:23.379
somebody could have gotten bitten

00:35:23.379 --> 00:35:24.699
by one of those fiery serpents

00:35:24.699 --> 00:35:26.979
and they could try any way they wanted to,

00:35:26.979 --> 00:35:29.179
they could do anything else in their power,

00:35:29.179 --> 00:35:31.139
but if they didn't look to that brazen serpent,

00:35:31.139 --> 00:35:32.819
they were gonna die.

00:35:32.819 --> 00:35:33.659
People died.

00:35:35.519 --> 00:35:39.139
But yet we find that there was just

00:35:39.139 --> 00:35:41.819
a single place of safety, the ark.

00:35:41.819 --> 00:35:45.619
There was just one way to spare death during the Passover.

00:35:45.619 --> 00:35:50.139
That was in following precisely what God said

00:35:50.139 --> 00:35:51.819
with the application of the blood.

00:35:51.819 --> 00:35:53.379
We find that with the brazen serpent,

00:35:53.379 --> 00:35:58.379
there's just one way to avoid death by those fiery serpents.

00:35:58.699 --> 00:36:01.539
And we find it so true as you come to the New Testament

00:36:01.539 --> 00:36:03.919
and understand the truth of the gospel,

00:36:03.919 --> 00:36:06.779
that there's just one way to get to heaven.

00:36:06.779 --> 00:36:09.139
We sing the song, one way God said to get to heaven,

00:36:09.139 --> 00:36:11.859
Jesus is the only way.

00:36:11.859 --> 00:36:13.659
Why do we say that?

00:36:13.659 --> 00:36:15.419
Do we say that because we're narrow-minded?

00:36:15.419 --> 00:36:19.499
Do we say that because we're just not

00:36:19.499 --> 00:36:23.299
willing to accept other ideas or thoughts?

00:36:23.299 --> 00:36:26.019
No, no, we say that because God himself said it.

00:36:27.459 --> 00:36:29.979
Because the Bible says that Jesus spake and said,

00:36:29.979 --> 00:36:34.979
I, singularly, I am the way

00:36:35.879 --> 00:36:37.939
and the truth and the life.

00:36:37.939 --> 00:36:40.919
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:36:42.919 --> 00:36:45.259
I understand this morning that there are many

00:36:45.259 --> 00:36:47.419
that are changing that idea and they're saying,

00:36:47.419 --> 00:36:50.779
well, you just need to be sincere in what you believe.

00:36:50.779 --> 00:36:53.179
You just need to, no, no, you can be sincere

00:36:53.179 --> 00:36:54.899
about whatever but be wrong.

00:36:57.099 --> 00:36:59.539
There are many people today that are sincerely wrong.

00:36:59.539 --> 00:37:02.139
It's not a matter of questioning their sincerity.

00:37:03.899 --> 00:37:05.459
It's in what they're believing.

00:37:06.899 --> 00:37:10.299
And this morning, we find that as this agreement

00:37:10.299 --> 00:37:13.659
is made between these two spies in Rahab,

00:37:13.659 --> 00:37:16.339
that they make it abundantly clear to her

00:37:16.939 --> 00:37:19.659
that she had to bind this line of scarlet thread,

00:37:19.659 --> 00:37:23.859
that there's only one place of safety,

00:37:23.859 --> 00:37:27.079
just one place of safety this morning.

00:37:28.059 --> 00:37:31.459
It was only those that would be in the house

00:37:31.459 --> 00:37:33.079
that would be spared death.

00:37:33.979 --> 00:37:37.679
Only those that were in the ark were spared death.

00:37:37.679 --> 00:37:40.219
And I wonder, as the New Testament verbiage is used,

00:37:40.219 --> 00:37:42.379
that we are in Christ.

00:37:42.379 --> 00:37:44.779
I wonder this morning, are you in Christ?

00:37:44.779 --> 00:37:46.539
Have you trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:37:46.539 --> 00:37:50.579
as your personal Savior, understanding that you're a sinner

00:37:50.579 --> 00:37:53.019
and that He is the only Savior?

00:37:57.139 --> 00:38:00.419
If so, you have the assurance of heaven.

00:38:00.419 --> 00:38:02.999
If not, today is the day of salvation.

00:38:04.359 --> 00:38:05.859
What a joy.

00:38:05.859 --> 00:38:08.459
We find that the evidence of Rahab's faith

00:38:08.459 --> 00:38:11.819
is given to us in verse 21, where the Bible says that as,

00:38:11.819 --> 00:38:14.379
now think about, get in your mind the picture

00:38:14.979 --> 00:38:18.499
of what happened, she lets them down over the wall there,

00:38:18.499 --> 00:38:21.479
according to verse number 15, and she let them down,

00:38:21.479 --> 00:38:23.779
and then there's this conversation that takes place,

00:38:23.779 --> 00:38:26.139
and they make the terms of the agreement.

00:38:26.139 --> 00:38:27.499
And then it says in verse 21,

00:38:27.499 --> 00:38:29.659
that according unto your word, so be it,

00:38:29.659 --> 00:38:30.979
this is her speaking to them,

00:38:30.979 --> 00:38:33.099
she sent them away and they departed.

00:38:33.099 --> 00:38:33.979
And notice what it says,

00:38:33.979 --> 00:38:38.559
she bound the scarlet line in the window.

00:38:38.559 --> 00:38:39.859
You know what's significant to me about that?

00:38:39.859 --> 00:38:43.619
She did it immediately, without delay.

00:38:43.619 --> 00:38:44.899
Some people you talk to about Christ,

00:38:44.899 --> 00:38:45.819
they say, let me think about it,

00:38:45.819 --> 00:38:50.059
let me get back to you on that.

00:38:50.059 --> 00:38:52.940
I'm not saying that I would ever twist anybody's arm,

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.859
but the Bible does say that today is the day of salvation.

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.619
We don't know what's on tomorrow.

00:38:58.619 --> 00:39:00.299
You don't know what's on tomorrow.

00:39:01.299 --> 00:39:05.099
Boast not thyself of tomorrow, in fact, the proverb says.

00:39:05.099 --> 00:39:05.940
Why?

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:08.059
We don't know what a day will bring forth.

00:39:08.059 --> 00:39:12.899
And so we find that she immediately puts this scarlet line,

00:39:13.219 --> 00:39:15.739
this line of scarlet thread in her window.

00:39:15.739 --> 00:39:18.259
And I want you to understand contextually,

00:39:18.259 --> 00:39:19.819
in the book of Joshua,

00:39:19.819 --> 00:39:22.759
they're not marching around the city at this point.

00:39:23.979 --> 00:39:27.659
Understand they've not even crossed the Jordan River yet.

00:39:29.259 --> 00:39:30.459
When the spies are sent,

00:39:30.459 --> 00:39:32.779
they've not yet crossed the Jordan River,

00:39:32.779 --> 00:39:36.819
and yet Rahab was so thoroughly convinced

00:39:36.819 --> 00:39:38.819
that she put that line in her window,

00:39:38.819 --> 00:39:41.579
that scarlet thread, immediately.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.459
Now, that scarlet line, that scarlet thread,

00:39:45.459 --> 00:39:48.500
that would, I mentioned already, identify her place,

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:51.059
but it also would reveal her faith.

00:39:51.059 --> 00:39:53.219
I wonder, the Bible doesn't tell us,

00:39:53.219 --> 00:39:56.339
and so it's just a I wonder type of a situation,

00:39:56.339 --> 00:39:59.459
but I wonder if anyone asked Rahab,

00:40:00.579 --> 00:40:02.019
what do you got that scarlet?

00:40:02.019 --> 00:40:06.479
thread hanging out of your window for? Have you ever thought that? I mean, I

00:40:06.479 --> 00:40:12.119
would probably ask. Rahab was in a position, she was there, her house was

00:40:12.119 --> 00:40:17.879
a prominent place, and no doubt people knew who she was. In fact, when the Bible

00:40:17.879 --> 00:40:21.319
talks about those spies entering in, where did the King of Jericho,

00:40:21.319 --> 00:40:24.839
where did the Serf party first went? To her house. Why? Because they knew that

00:40:24.839 --> 00:40:28.359
that's where the spies went. She tells them that they were sent out and so on

00:40:28.359 --> 00:40:32.699
and so forth, but we find that she then has this scarlet thread that's

00:40:32.699 --> 00:40:40.699
hanging out of her window. Hey Rahab, what's that scarlet thread for? I'd like

00:40:40.699 --> 00:40:45.899
to think that at least somebody asked her that question, and I'd love to hear

00:40:45.899 --> 00:40:52.779
how Rahab would respond to that question. Now, the Bible doesn't give us the record

00:40:52.779 --> 00:40:58.119
of any of those types of interactions, but this morning, I want you to

00:40:58.119 --> 00:41:03.199
understand that we as New Testament believers, no, we don't put a scarlet

00:41:03.199 --> 00:41:10.079
thread out our window, but God has given us a responsibility to go and declare

00:41:10.079 --> 00:41:15.799
who He is, to be His representatives, His ambassadors. We find this morning that

00:41:15.799 --> 00:41:20.359
even as these young people just did a wonderful job singing that song called

00:41:20.499 --> 00:41:24.139
to make a difference, understand this morning that each and every one of us

00:41:24.139 --> 00:41:29.139
have been called to make a difference, to take up the truth of the gospel and

00:41:29.139 --> 00:41:34.739
proclaim it to a lost and dying world. Why? Because we know the truth, and we

00:41:34.739 --> 00:41:40.019
know that He's given us the mission, the responsibility. I want you to just

00:41:40.019 --> 00:41:45.499
briefly go over, if you will, to Joshua chapter number 6, and I want you to see

00:41:45.499 --> 00:41:49.699
that as we come to this chapter, we find that God gives the instruction. They've

00:41:49.699 --> 00:41:53.199
already entered into the land, they've set up the memorials, the circumcision

00:41:53.199 --> 00:41:56.239
of the people has taken place, and Jericho would be the first place that

00:41:56.239 --> 00:41:59.959
they come to, and the Bible says that Jericho was straightly shut up because

00:41:59.959 --> 00:42:02.899
of the children of Israel. None went out, none came in, according to verse number

00:42:02.899 --> 00:42:08.159
1. The instruction is given with regard to encompassing the city about and all

00:42:08.159 --> 00:42:12.319
that would take place, and all of that is given, but I want you to jump down all

00:42:12.319 --> 00:42:16.639
the way to verse 17, if you will. The Bible says, "...and the city shall be

00:42:16.639 --> 00:42:20.899
accursed, even it and all that are therein to the Lord." Notice what it says,

00:42:20.899 --> 00:42:25.699
"...only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house,

00:42:25.699 --> 00:42:30.779
because she hid the messengers that we sent. And ye, and any wives, keep

00:42:30.779 --> 00:42:33.659
yourselves from the accursed thing that you make yourselves accursed when you

00:42:33.659 --> 00:42:37.859
take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse and trouble it." We

00:42:37.859 --> 00:42:41.179
find that the walls fell down flat, according to verse number 20. In verse

00:42:41.179 --> 00:42:45.199
number 22, notice the Bible says, "...but Joshua had said unto the two men that had

00:42:45.199 --> 00:42:49.499
spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house," who is that? That's Rahab,

00:42:49.499 --> 00:42:55.379
"...and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye swear unto her.

00:42:55.379 --> 00:43:01.379
And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab." Aren't you

00:43:01.379 --> 00:43:06.019
thankful for chapter number 6 that gives us the conclusion of what we read

00:43:06.019 --> 00:43:09.859
in chapter 2? It says that they brought out Rahab, notice, "...and her father,

00:43:09.859 --> 00:43:14.259
and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had, and they brought out all

00:43:14.259 --> 00:43:19.719
her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel. And they burnt the city

00:43:19.719 --> 00:43:25.239
with fire, and all that was therein." I want you to understand, look at verse 25,

00:43:25.239 --> 00:43:28.519
"...and Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all

00:43:28.519 --> 00:43:32.919
that she had. And she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day, because she hid the

00:43:32.919 --> 00:43:38.719
messengers which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho." We notice the the proclamation

00:43:38.719 --> 00:43:45.339
of Rahab, but I want you to see that the quote-unquote end of the story for Rahab,

00:43:45.339 --> 00:43:50.059
we understand that she's in the genealogy of the Lord Jesus Christ, we

00:43:50.059 --> 00:43:53.419
understand that she's mentioned in the book of Hebrews, and also in the book of

00:43:53.419 --> 00:44:00.379
James, understand she's never given any kind of commendation for any dishonest

00:44:00.379 --> 00:44:04.779
statements that she made, but always for her faith, and understand this morning

00:44:04.839 --> 00:44:12.919
that the spies, they came back, and they took her out. Listen, one day my Savior's

00:44:12.919 --> 00:44:19.759
coming back, and he's taking me out. Amen? Listen, the Bible tells us that Jesus is

00:44:19.759 --> 00:44:24.839
coming again, and listen, if you're saved this morning, if you've trusted Christ as

00:44:24.839 --> 00:44:30.479
your Savior this morning, understand that Jesus said, I will come again. And what's

00:44:30.479 --> 00:44:35.739
he gonna do? I'm gonna, he says, that you're gonna be with me forever. Amen? The

00:44:35.739 --> 00:44:39.299
Bible says that the dead in Christ shall rise first, then we which are alive and

00:44:39.299 --> 00:44:43.579
remain shall be caught up together in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.

00:44:43.579 --> 00:44:48.959
And what a wonderful promise. Listen, that's my expectation, that's my end, is

00:44:48.959 --> 00:44:53.859
that I'm gonna meet my Savior face-to-face. And that period of time

00:44:53.859 --> 00:44:58.539
between Rahab having that interaction with those spies, and making that

00:44:58.599 --> 00:45:03.199
proclamation that she made where she declares who she understood God to be,

00:45:03.199 --> 00:45:08.679
and then she put that scarlet thread in her window, yes, identifying her place, but

00:45:08.679 --> 00:45:15.279
more importantly, revealing her faith. And I want you to think about Rahab. Listen,

00:45:15.279 --> 00:45:18.099
the Bible tells us in verse number one of chapter six that all the city was

00:45:18.099 --> 00:45:21.919
shut up, no one went out, no one came in. But I think Rahab had a different

00:45:21.919 --> 00:45:26.999
perspective. I think for the inhabitants of Jericho, listen, when the nation of

00:45:27.059 --> 00:45:30.819
Israel compassed the city, there were probably all kinds of mixed thoughts as

00:45:30.819 --> 00:45:36.299
to what was going on. But I think Rahab was anxiously awaiting. You know why? She

00:45:36.299 --> 00:45:43.979
knew. She knew that her life would be spared. She knew that God had given the

00:45:43.979 --> 00:45:48.299
land to the people of Israel. She understood all of those things, but she

00:45:48.299 --> 00:45:54.819
had an expectation. And they marched around day number two. Can you imagine?

00:45:55.399 --> 00:45:59.879
Again and again, and all that takes place, and then when those walls fall down

00:45:59.879 --> 00:46:08.119
flat, God miraculously allowed for her house not to fall. It's amazing. Joshua

00:46:08.119 --> 00:46:11.399
sent those messengers, and they brought Rahab and all of her family that was

00:46:11.399 --> 00:46:16.159
there out. There's one place of refuge, of safety. This morning, we see the

00:46:16.159 --> 00:46:22.719
proclamation of Rahab. She understood who God was, who God is. This morning, we see

00:46:22.739 --> 00:46:27.219
all of the events that unfold with this interaction, and how encouraged we are.

00:46:27.219 --> 00:46:32.499
And I just wonder, how are we doing on declaring, on proclaiming how great our

00:46:32.499 --> 00:46:40.019
God is? Are we more like the 10 spies that just always kind of doubting, and

00:46:40.019 --> 00:46:47.259
uncertain, and just kind of floundering around, and living by sight? Or are we

00:46:47.259 --> 00:46:52.799
recognizing that God is able, that God has a plan, and God has a purpose, and

00:46:52.799 --> 00:46:58.959
God will use us for His honor and for His glory? We serve a great God. He is God

00:46:58.959 --> 00:47:05.879
above. He is the Lord God Almighty. He lives, and He reigns, and He will reign

00:47:05.879 --> 00:47:10.999
forevermore. The Bible says, the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. And I'm so thankful

00:47:10.999 --> 00:47:15.479
to serve a risen Savior. Let's pray together. Father, we love You. We thank

00:47:15.479 --> 00:47:20.019
You for loving us. God, I pray this morning that if there's one that's

00:47:20.019 --> 00:47:23.519
unsure of heaven, they've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal

00:47:23.519 --> 00:47:28.099
Savior. God, I pray that today would be the day of their salvation. I pray, Lord,

00:47:28.099 --> 00:47:32.819
that if You would move and work in that individual's life, whether they're here

00:47:32.819 --> 00:47:36.939
locally or tuned in via live stream, God, that they would not delay, that they

00:47:36.939 --> 00:47:42.179
would respond in faith, and obedience, and trust the Lord Jesus Christ, His

00:47:42.179 --> 00:47:45.919
finished work at Calvary, His death, burial, and glorious resurrection. They'd

00:47:45.919 --> 00:47:50.759
be saved by the blood of Christ. Lord, I pray for every child of God. Lord, I

00:47:50.759 --> 00:47:58.119
wonder this morning how Your truth truly impacts us, how understanding who You are

00:47:58.119 --> 00:48:02.479
impacts the way that we live our lives. Are we actively proclaiming and

00:48:02.479 --> 00:48:10.999
declaring to others how great You are? I pray, Lord, that You would help us to be

00:48:11.019 --> 00:48:17.259
challenged by the life and testimony of Rahab. Lord, help us to have that kind of

00:48:17.259 --> 00:48:23.659
faith. Lord, help us to expect, to anticipate Your soon return. Help us to

00:48:23.659 --> 00:48:27.499
be busy about what You've called us to do. I pray that in these few moments of

00:48:27.499 --> 00:48:31.139
invitation that You have Your will in way. You'd move and work in hearts and

00:48:31.139 --> 00:48:35.099
lives as only You can. We'll be careful to thank You for all that You'll do. For

00:48:35.099 --> 00:48:37.899
it's in Christ's name we pray. Would You stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are

00:48:37.899 --> 00:48:42.119
closed, end of each of our services.
