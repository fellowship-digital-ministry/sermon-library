1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Continue our study here through 1 Thessalonians 5,

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,139
eventually we'll be over in 2 Thessalonians 3 as well.

3
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:10,500
And these instructions that have been provided

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,140
to the church at Thessalonica,

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,819
I mentioned it's the title for our series

6
00:00:14,819 --> 00:00:19,139
here on Wednesday evenings, Walk Worthy, Please God.

7
00:00:19,139 --> 00:00:21,780
And I'm thankful that the church at Thessalonica

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,299
was a good church, a model church,

9
00:00:24,299 --> 00:00:27,739
but we find that at the end of each letter

10
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:31,420
that God has Paul right to these churches.

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,139
We find that God gives them instruction.

12
00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:38,860
He gives them these very concise statements of instruction

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,360
beginning in verse 12 of chapter five of the first letter.

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,740
We've been studying, we've made it through verse 18.

15
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,020
Tonight we'll be looking at verse 19.

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,619
And this is lesson number 12.

17
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:51,220
We've had the opportunity to take each of these

18
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,520
pieces of instruction.

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,540
And we know that as we take the word of God,

20
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,020
it tells us that it's profitable for us.

21
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,779
And as we apply God's word in our lives,

22
00:01:01,779 --> 00:01:04,379
then we can walk worthy and please God.

23
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,220
And God does care how we live, how we walk.

24
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,300
And he wants us as individuals

25
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,339
and then obviously as churches to please him.

26
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,919
And I'm thankful that he's given us the instruction

27
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:18,300
so that we can know how we can please him.

28
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,540
He begins in verse 12, we beseech you.

29
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,660
And then we mentioned already, but in verse 14,

30
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,419
he says, we exhort you.

31
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,699
And so this evening, as we continue studying,

32
00:01:26,699 --> 00:01:29,339
we find that the Bible says very simply

33
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:33,220
in verse number 19, quench not the spirit.

34
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,339
Quench not the spirit.

35
00:01:34,339 --> 00:01:37,180
It's the title for the message this evening from verse 19.

36
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,300
The Bible tells us that lost men

37
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,860
can resist the Holy Spirit.

38
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,620
In fact, Stephen lays this charge

39
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,900
against the council that he's preaching to.

40
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,459
It's recorded in his sermon there in Acts chapter number seven

41
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:54,099
that they do always resist the Holy Ghost.

42
00:01:54,779 --> 00:01:57,660
And that resistance, and we can understand

43
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,099
as Stephen is preaching, the conviction

44
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:02,559
that would be upon them and their resistance

45
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:04,260
to the work of the Holy Spirit.

46
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,900
We find that the Bible teaches that every believer

47
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,559
is indwelled by the Spirit of God.

48
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:12,539
At the moment of salvation,

49
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:15,580
we find that the Holy Spirit of God indwells us.

50
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,100
And the New Testament records for us

51
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,940
many aspects with regard to the ministry

52
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,740
of the Holy Spirit, the ministry of the Holy Spirit

53
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,300
in the life of a believer.

54
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,740
We understand that he is the divine teacher

55
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,220
and what a blessing to know that he guides us

56
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,660
into all truth and we find that he's the comforter

57
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,300
and we could go on and we look at the various aspects

58
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,660
of the ministry of the Holy Spirit of God.

59
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,380
But we find that the New Testament also gives us a warning

60
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,500
that as believers, according to Ephesians four

61
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,300
and verse number 30, we can grieve the Holy Spirit.

62
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,339
We can grieve the Holy Spirit.

63
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:58,979
In fact, Paul says this in Ephesians four

64
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,020
and verse number 30,

65
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,740
and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,

66
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,300
whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.

67
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,380
And so we find that that instruction is given there

68
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,179
and obviously when we sin, we grieve the Spirit of God,

69
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:16,979
the Holy Spirit.

70
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:21,979
And so we find here the second warning, if you will,

71
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,580
is given to us here in our text this evening

72
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,020
that as believers, not only can we grieve the Holy Spirit,

73
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,199
but we learn here that we can quench the Holy Spirit.

74
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,300
The Lord and his infinite wisdom,

75
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,380
and I'm thankful that God is the all wise God.

76
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,820
It's very interesting to me,

77
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,699
and I mentioned this briefly last Wednesday evening,

78
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:45,860
the placement of this verse of scripture.

79
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,059
Quench not the Spirit.

80
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:49,740
And we think about that word quench

81
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,699
and it carries with it the idea of to put out

82
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,380
or to extinguish.

83
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,059
And we think about the work of the Holy Spirit

84
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:57,419
and the lives of God's people.

85
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:59,300
We're indwelled by the Spirit of God,

86
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,940
but the Spirit of God will convict us

87
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,940
and he'll work in our lives

88
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,860
and he will give us that direction and what have you.

89
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,860
And we find that the Holy Spirit is active

90
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,460
and moving in the lives of his people

91
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,779
and God and his infinite wisdom

92
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:20,420
put this verse of scripture here

93
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,700
in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 19,

94
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,619
quench not the Spirit.

95
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:29,420
Immediately following three powerful commands

96
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,799
that we are given.

97
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:33,059
We are given these three powerful commands

98
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:35,299
in verse 16, 17, and 18,

99
00:04:35,299 --> 00:04:38,220
and then we're told quench not the Spirit.

100
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,880
There's a little doubt in my mind

101
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,739
that these three commands in verse 16, 17, and 18

102
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:47,500
have brought conviction to many of God's people

103
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,260
over the centuries.

104
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,260
What are those three?

105
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,239
Well, we've studied them the last several weeks,

106
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:56,739
but number one, rejoice evermore.

107
00:04:56,739 --> 00:05:00,739
Literally to rejoice at all times.

108
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:05,739
He says rejoice evermore, pray without ceasing.

109
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,820
In everything give thanks,

110
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,339
for this is the will of God and Christ Jesus concerning you.

111
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,420
And we find that as we look at these three powerful commands

112
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,459
these concise statements that we understand as individuals

113
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:23,940
and then we understand corporately as a church

114
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,899
that we are to be busy praising the Lord,

115
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:31,779
praising him at all times and praying about everything.

116
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:34,739
When we take those three commands of scripture,

117
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:38,700
if we take them and we read them and we understand them,

118
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,779
I believe that the Holy Spirit

119
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:43,299
would convict many of God's people.

120
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,980
Why?

121
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,700
Well, we have a hard time rejoicing at all times.

122
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,779
We have a hard time praying about everything,

123
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:51,459
pray without ceasing.

124
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:56,459
In fact, prayer is often neglected by God's people.

125
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:59,339
One of the greatest privileges that we have,

126
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:02,540
prayer is often neglected.

127
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,899
We find that there are many over the years

128
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:07,040
that you might say to them, I'll pray for you,

129
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,260
and they look at you as if that's all you're gonna do.

130
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,820
And really that's the greatest thing we could ever do.

131
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,739
We find this evening that the Holy Spirit of God,

132
00:06:17,739 --> 00:06:20,220
all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

133
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,019
Holy men spake as they were moved by the Spirit.

134
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:27,040
We find that he says, quench not the Spirit.

135
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,339
Again, the word quench means to put out, to extinguish,

136
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:32,679
often be used if you think about a fire

137
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:34,859
and you think about the fire burning

138
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:38,140
and you were to dump cold water on that fire

139
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,540
and quench the fire and to extinguish it, to put it out.

140
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,980
So as I look at this passage of scripture this evening

141
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,019
and I think about this command, quench not the Spirit,

142
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:49,420
really I don't have points for it,

143
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,940
I've got a bunch of questions for you tonight.

144
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,820
And the lesson this evening is gonna be

145
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,820
in the form of questions.

146
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
And the first question that I ask you this evening

147
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,420
when we think about this command of scripture,

148
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,380
quench not the Spirit, number one,

149
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,179
and I want you to answer these questions

150
00:07:05,179 --> 00:07:06,540
honestly to yourself.

151
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,859
Obviously, God already knows the answer,

152
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:11,500
but allow God to search you and to know your heart.

153
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,019
Number one, do you invite the Holy Spirit to convict you?

154
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,700
What do I mean by that?

155
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,260
Well, when you pray, when you read your Bible,

156
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,739
when you come to church, do you pray

157
00:07:25,739 --> 00:07:28,420
that the Holy Spirit of God would convict you,

158
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,179
that he would not leave you to yourself,

159
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:33,299
that he would deal with you?

160
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:36,579
And see, as I read God's word each day of my life,

161
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:40,619
I don't pray exactly the same prayer each morning,

162
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:44,420
but I pray very similar things with regard

163
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,299
to Psalm 119 and verse 18,

164
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:48,899
Lord, open thou mine eyes,

165
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:51,700
that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law,

166
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,500
but I also pray that God would take his word

167
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,380
and that he would comfort me,

168
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,940
but also that he would convict me,

169
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,500
that God would teach me from his word

170
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,140
the things that I ought to be doing

171
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,179
that maybe I'm not doing,

172
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:07,779
the things that I ought not be doing that I am doing,

173
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:11,940
and we invite, listen, I desire the Holy Spirit of God

174
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,859
to work in my life, and the question tonight is,

175
00:08:14,859 --> 00:08:17,980
do we ask God to convict us?

176
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,859
Do we ask him?

177
00:08:18,859 --> 00:08:19,779
Do we invite him?

178
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:21,899
Do we welcome that conviction?

179
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:24,100
See, many times, unfortunately,

180
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,980
we can gain this improper approach or response,

181
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,980
I should say, to the thought of conviction.

182
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,299
We might be tending to fall on the side

183
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,739
that conviction's this bad thing.

184
00:08:36,739 --> 00:08:38,380
No, conviction's a good thing.

185
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,619
It's good when God convicts us.

186
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:43,979
It's good when he's stepping on our toes,

187
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,460
when he's dealing with us about areas of our lives.

188
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,299
Why?

189
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:50,179
Because none of us are perfect.

190
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:51,020
Amen?

191
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,859
We all have room for growth.

192
00:08:53,859 --> 00:08:55,059
Amen?

193
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:57,179
We're to be like Christ.

194
00:08:57,179 --> 00:08:59,900
That's our ultimate goal,

195
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,900
that we might be like him.

196
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:04,580
He left us an example that we should follow his steps,

197
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,580
and all of us are on this journey at a different level,

198
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,900
at a different place in our Christian journey,

199
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,539
but the reality is that none of us

200
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:15,059
are ever gonna reach a place of sinless perfection,

201
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:17,460
and there's room for God to work,

202
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,460
and we, as we go to the Bible,

203
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,059
yes, I'm thankful that God's word will give us comfort

204
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:24,739
in how we need comfort,

205
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:27,979
but at the very same time, God's word will convict us,

206
00:09:27,979 --> 00:09:29,179
and the question this evening,

207
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:30,979
when we think about this statement,

208
00:09:30,979 --> 00:09:32,059
quench not the spirit,

209
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:34,380
this command that's been given to us,

210
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,580
quench not the spirit,

211
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,940
I wonder this evening,

212
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,299
what is your approach to God's word?

213
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:43,460
Do you invite the Holy Spirit to convict you?

214
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,179
Do you make that request?

215
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:46,419
I think of the psalmist.

216
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,380
Search me, oh God.

217
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,219
And what?

218
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:53,260
Show me if there be any wicked way.

219
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,739
That's what he says, Psalm 139.

220
00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:58,299
And so as we begin to understand this invitation,

221
00:09:58,299 --> 00:09:59,859
and understanding.

222
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:05,159
how the Lord works and how he uses his word. Number two this evening, a second question

223
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:13,239
for you. Do you expect the Holy Spirit to convict you? Are you expecting it? What do

224
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:21,319
I mean by that? You know, when you go to certain places, you have certain levels of expectations.

225
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:26,799
You understand as you're going to, maybe you're going for a meal, you're going to someone's

226
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:31,979
home for something and you have expectations. I wonder when you come to church, I wonder

227
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:37,019
when you approach that holy time with the Lord of spending time in his word, in those

228
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:45,519
daily devotions, are you expecting God to work? Are you expecting him to confront you

229
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,099
about some things? You've invited him to do so, but then you're expecting, I mean you're

230
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:56,059
looking for it, you're anticipating it. I wonder as we come to church, and I'm thankful

231
00:10:56,059 --> 00:11:00,019
this evening that you're here obviously, but I begin to think about our approach to

232
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:07,419
church and as we enter into the house of God that we're coming and we're expecting to hear

233
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:15,359
from God. We come with that expectation, we're anticipating, I wonder what God has for me

234
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:22,559
in this service. I wonder how God is going to work in my life in this service. Does that

235
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:29,559
make sense to you this evening? Because God is a God that is obviously, he transcends

236
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:39,559
us and he's everywhere present. He loves all people, but God is a personal God. It's amazing

237
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:47,159
how God will work as we come inviting and expecting God to work. You know there are

238
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:53,919
times that God might work just through one of the songs. Plenty of times in my life that

239
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,199
we would just be singing songs and I almost could say, hey it'd be okay right now if we

240
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:03,919
just had an invitation after the singing. Why? Because God can use the songs. Why? Because

241
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,919
there are many of the, I mean the songs that we sing in our hymnals, the reason that we

242
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:13,759
use the hymnals that we do, those songs are biblically based and God will use them in

243
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:21,239
our lives. We find this evening that we ought to have that not only inviting God to convict

244
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:26,639
us but then expecting that he will. When we're reading the scriptures, expecting that God's

245
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,359
going to confront us on something. It's a good thing. Let me ask you this question,

246
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:38,039
number three this evening, do you give the Holy Spirit opportunity to convict you? It's

247
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:43,679
one thing to invite it or to expect it, but I wonder this evening is what kind of opportunity

248
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:49,799
do we give the Holy Spirit to convict us? What do I mean by that? Well, we ought to

249
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:55,079
be reading God's Word regularly. You know there's a danger when we talk about reading

250
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:59,799
God's Word where we can just get comfortable reading certain portions of scripture that

251
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:06,559
maybe are our favorite portions of scripture while we neglect other portions of scripture.

252
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:13,879
It's sad to me today how many people have this perspective and it's gaining great levels

253
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:21,319
of followers that we're New Testament believers, we don't need the Old Testament. That's baloney.

254
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:25,679
God wouldn't have preserved it for us if we didn't need it, amen? But God preserved it

255
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,599
for us. Not only did he preserve it for us, but he told us in the New Testament that the

256
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:37,719
things which were written aforetime were written for our learning and for our admonition. Now

257
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:45,199
this evening, admittedly, any one of us could probably name a book of the Bible that might

258
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:51,119
be our favorite book of the Bible, and that's okay. But what's not okay is to only read

259
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:59,839
that book of the Bible. Amen? It's not okay to just read the portions of scripture that

260
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:05,839
you're familiar with that you say, man, these ones, Psalm 23 really comforts me. You read

261
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,479
Psalm 23 every single day of your life, I'm glad it comforts you, but God gave us a whole,

262
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:19,199
he gave us 1189 chapters in 66 books. And he wants us to read all of it. You know, the

263
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,559
more you read the Bible, the more you know of portions of scripture that are probably

264
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:30,319
going to step on your toes than other places. Don't ignore those portions of scripture.

265
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:34,439
Regularly read the Bible. Have a plan for how you're going to read the Bible. And I

266
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:39,519
don't care what plan you use. I don't care if you follow the pattern that I like to follow.

267
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,959
That's my personality. That's what works for me. But the reality is that everybody ought

268
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:48,759
to be reading the Bible. If you're a child of God, you better read the Bible every day.

269
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:54,959
And that's giving opportunity to the Holy Spirit of God to convict you, because he uses

270
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:02,539
the scriptures to convict us. I would say this with regard to giving the Holy Spirit

271
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:07,079
opportunity to convict you, not only reading the Word regularly, but we need to be attending

272
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:13,839
a church regularly that preaches the Word faithfully. You know, there's plenty of churches

273
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,899
that you can go to today that can make you feel good. Just the way it is. I was reading

274
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:27,359
just earlier today about the truth in 2 Timothy chapter number 4, about itching ears. And

275
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:33,599
we have churches all across our landscape today that are catering to that group of people.

276
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:38,759
And it's just the way it is. It's unfortunate, but when we desire, when we understand, and

277
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:44,639
I'm getting to the thought here this evening with Quench Not the Spirit, listen, we need

278
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,799
to give the Spirit of God opportunity to work in our lives and to bring that conviction.

279
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,319
Now you're here this evening, so obviously you understand the importance of being in

280
00:15:54,319 --> 00:16:00,599
church and being in a church that preaches the Bible. And as a pastor, as a preacher,

281
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:05,839
I seek the will of God with regard to the portions of scripture that I'm preaching.

282
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:12,479
I seek the Lord with regard to particular studies that we go through and how we approach

283
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:17,159
the scriptures. I was sharing with Joseph just the other night in family devotions,

284
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:23,919
and I had jotted down a few weeks ago, as I was sitting in the office, just the books

285
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:29,959
of the Bible that I have had the privilege that God has allowed me to teach or preach

286
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:36,239
through since I've been here. Man, it's been exciting. I've enjoyed it. I have to be careful.

287
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:41,719
Just like I say, don't just read the books that you are most, you know, familiar with

288
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:46,119
or that you like the most. I can't just keep going and preaching the same book of the Bible

289
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:53,000
every year. Why? Because we need all of it. We need all of it. And we find this evening

290
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,719
that I have learned in my own life and through the preaching ministry that when we preach

291
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:03,599
line upon line, precept upon precept, when we preach through books of the Bible, teach

292
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:07,359
through books of the Bible, man, the Holy Spirit of God has an opportunity to just kind

293
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:14,519
of hit everything that's in there. And that's good for us. We don't just skip over portions

294
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:20,319
of scripture. Well, they're not very popular today. That's okay. They're biblical. And

295
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:26,379
that's what we're worried about. So how is it that we give the Holy Spirit opportunity

296
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:31,500
to convict us? And then I get to this question and really dealing with this verse of scripture

297
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:39,259
this evening, and it's this, how do we respond to the conviction? How do we respond to the

298
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:45,819
conviction? So, we acknowledge this evening that we ought to be inviting and expecting

299
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:52,419
and giving opportunity for that conviction to come into our lives, but the question tonight

300
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:57,779
that really pertains to the verse of scripture that is before us with quench not the spirit

301
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:07,539
is how do we respond to the conviction? It's a great question. We have an invitation not

302
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:12,299
on Wednesday evenings, but on Sunday morning, Sunday evening, we have an invitation. And

303
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:17,459
the purpose of that invitation is to give opportunity for folks to respond. And I understand

304
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:21,339
that not everyone's comfortable with going to an old-fashioned altar. And some people

305
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:25,779
like to pray right where they are. Some people like to go home and pray about it. But I would

306
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:34,219
argue that once you leave here, that moment of how God was working in your life, circumstances

307
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:40,419
change in a hurry. Things get all kinds of just crazy with regard to this is going on

308
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:44,299
and that's going on and the kids are telling you this. And when are we eating? And is dinner

309
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:48,899
ready yet? And I'm starving. I'm going to die. I'm so hungry. And so on and so forth.

310
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:54,619
And guess what? Before you know it, you don't even really have any remembrance of what happened

311
00:18:54,619 --> 00:19:00,979
maybe 30 minutes, an hour earlier, how God was working, how God was pinpointing something

312
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:08,140
in your life, how He was convicting you. And so if we invite the Holy Spirit to convict

313
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:14,119
us, if we're expecting it and we're giving opportunity, but we fail to respond properly

314
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:22,159
to it, what is it really worth? But we find this evening that we must respond properly.

315
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:28,919
We must refuse to quench the Spirit. There are times, no doubt, that the Holy Spirit

316
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:35,000
of God will bring conviction in our lives and it can be uncomfortable. Amen? Conviction

317
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,119
can be uncomfortable. It's designed to be so. Amen? Y'all looking at me like I'm crazy

318
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:51,640
tonight. Listen. Conviction is good. Chastisement is good. It proves that we're His children.

319
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:59,880
Amen? Conviction is good. I'd be concerned if God was never convicting me.

320
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:06,640
me. Honestly, I'd be concerned. Why? Because I know I'm not perfect. I've read enough of

321
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,880
the Bible to know I'm never going to be perfect this side of heaven. And so if I can go day

322
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:17,760
after day and read the Bible and never be convicted, I'm concerned about that. What's

323
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,360
going on? Why is there no conviction? And but I need to refuse to quench the Spirit.

324
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,520
Rather, I must rejoice that He's working, that He's dealing with me. I must rejoice

325
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:35,240
that He cares enough, He loves me enough to bring that conviction in my life to deal with

326
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:42,520
me. And as I rejoice, I then decide that I'm going to respond appropriately to that conviction.

327
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,920
And what is that appropriate response? Well, I would say that we ought to respond immediately

328
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:54,280
when the Holy Spirit of God is convicting us. Because those delays, it's amazing how

329
00:20:54,280 --> 00:21:02,440
quickly the enemy can slip in there and kind of cause you to think, well, it's really not

330
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:08,140
that big of a deal. We begin to excuse and we begin to justify. Listen, we can go through

331
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,320
Scriptures this evening and we can look at examples of those that have gone before us

332
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:19,560
that have excused their sin. Remember a guy by the name of Saul? Right? It wasn't me.

333
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:25,960
It was the people. Right? That's what he said. But we can think about people that justify

334
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,800
their sin. We can think about people that try to hide their sin. And so, when the Holy

335
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,400
Spirit of God is convicting us, we must respond. And I believe that when we respond immediately,

336
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,320
it's best. That's why, again, on Sunday mornings and Sunday evenings, we have the opportunity

337
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:49,480
for that time of invitation so that it gives people an opportunity not only to have received

338
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:56,480
the Word of God, but then to respond to the Word of God. Because we don't want to have

339
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:06,480
that delay. In that moment of delay, in that time of delay, we can get so distracted. We

340
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:13,440
can forget about all that had taken place. I believe that not only must we respond promptly

341
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:21,320
or immediately, but I believe that it's important that we respond fully, completely. You know,

342
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:27,160
God's work in your life is an individual work. He's not going to work outside of the principles

343
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,380
that He's given us in His Word. God's never going to lead you to do something that's contrary

344
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:36,960
to His Word. We understand those principles that we could look to, but we find that God's

345
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,000
dealing with each of us as individuals. And so, as God is dealing with us as individuals,

346
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,120
we don't look around and say, well, am I the only one? Why aren't other people? No,

347
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:55,279
we sing the song, though none go with me, still I will follow. Right? And God is working

348
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:01,320
in our hearts and He's working in our lives individually, and as He is, we must respond

349
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:08,000
appropriately. We must deal with that time of conviction and say, God, have Your way

350
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:18,000
in my life. It's kind of that idea of waving that flag of surrender, being yielded to the

351
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,520
Holy Spirit. You know, it's important for us to understand this evening the importance

352
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:28,000
of being yielded and being surrendered. We can come to a place in our lives where we

353
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,120
no longer are yielded to the work that God is doing in our lives. We sit in a church

354
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,639
service but we're distracted the whole time wondering about this, that, or the other thing,

355
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:43,680
and when this is going to end, and how we're going to deal with, and I understand life

356
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:51,960
is full of all kinds of circumstances. It's easy to come to a church service distracted.

357
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:58,919
It's easy to be concerned about what the next thing is and what we need to do, and maybe

358
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:04,800
to, well, I'll deal with that later. The question is, does later ever really come?

359
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:11,840
Does later ever come? This evening, when we look at this truth that we find here in 1

360
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,679
Thessalonians 5 and verse 19, I believe the Holy Spirit of God, obviously God does all

361
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:23,839
things well and right, but He puts this quench not the spirit right in the midst of all of

362
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:29,679
this instruction, this concise instruction that's given to the church at Thessalonica.

363
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:35,520
I tend to believe, listen, you can read through these verses of Scripture from verse 12 to

364
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:42,600
28 in a matter of just a few minutes. We've spent at this point 11 weeks looking at just

365
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:49,559
half of these verses. You can read through them in just a few minutes, but in the midst

366
00:24:49,559 --> 00:25:01,320
of them, quench not the spirit. And I just wonder this evening, as the church at Thessalonica

367
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:06,080
first received this letter, and they're reading these things, and you ever get to the point

368
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,880
where you read things quickly? Right? I'm not just saying that you're a fast reader,

369
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,119
just you read through things, and then you get to quench not the spirit. It kind of slows

370
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:24,839
you down a little bit, at least for me, because through these commands that God has given,

371
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:33,080
the conviction's coming. Rejoice evermore. I wonder tonight, I'm just asking myself,

372
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:38,779
but I'm asking it out loud, so therefore I'm asking you as well, how am I doing with that?

373
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:49,540
Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In everything give thanks, for this is the will

374
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:58,100
of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. Quench not the spirit, verse 19. So, as the Holy

375
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,459
Spirit of God would be using those commands, and obviously I didn't even look at all of

376
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:07,540
them because there are several beginning in verse number 12 of the commands that we read,

377
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:16,260
but we find that as we look at just the three immediately that precede this particular principle

378
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,660
or command of Scripture, quench not the spirit, man, there's great conviction that comes in

379
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:34,980
my life. Why? I don't think I'm the only one, but I'm guilty of not rejoicing at all times.

380
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:44,540
There are things that happen in our lives that cause us to complain, murmur, yeah? Pray

381
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:52,220
without ceasing. There are times that we fail to pray. We may try to do this, that and the

382
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:57,779
other all in our own strength and our own power. Say, hey, why don't we pray about this

383
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:04,820
after we've tried and exhausted all sorts of things? In everything give thanks. See,

384
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:13,260
tonight, quench not the spirit. God's working. God moves. The Holy Spirit of God indwells

385
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:20,000
every believer. And tonight, as we understand the truth of the indwelling of the Spirit

386
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,860
of God, He tells us in Ephesians that we can grieve the Spirit, but He tells us here in

387
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:34,380
1 Thessalonians that we can quench the Spirit. And He says, quench not the spirit. I hope

388
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:39,980
tonight that we would say, I don't want to quench the Spirit. I want the Spirit of God

389
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:47,179
to be working in my life. I desire Him to be convicting me. I desire when I come to

390
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:54,100
church to be challenged with what I should be doing, with how I should change something

391
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:59,880
in my life through whatever means it is that the Holy Spirit uses in the service, whether

392
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,779
it's the song service, the preaching, a combination of both, that I'm desiring the Holy Spirit

393
00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:12,260
of God to work in my life and I do not want to quench His work. I want to respond to it

394
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:23,899
appropriately, immediately, completely, fully, letting God have His way in our lives. Again,

395
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:29,500
conviction sometimes can be looked at as being a negative thing. I argue tonight that it's

396
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:35,580
a wonderful thing when the Holy Spirit of God reaches down into the life of an individual

397
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:42,580
through whatever aspect of personal Bible reading, public worship in a church setting,

398
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,419
one-on-one conversation with brothers and sisters in Christ, and the Holy Spirit of

399
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:55,419
God convicts us. It's a good thing. And we must learn tonight, quench not the Spirit.

400
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:06,020
Respond. Respond in obedience. Search me, O God. Desire for Him to work and then respond

401
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,580
accordingly. Quench not the Spirit. Let's pray. Father, we love You. We thank You for

402
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:16,940
loving us. We thank You for Your Word tonight. And Lord, I pray that You would help us to

403
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:23,940
take this simple charge, exhortation, quench not the Spirit. God, I wonder this evening

404
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:35,419
how You're working in the lives of Your people. I mean in our daily walk with You as we read

405
00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:41,660
Your Word. I pray that we read it each day. I pray that we read it fully, the entirety

406
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:47,700
of it. God, I pray that as we read Your Word that You would comfort us but also that You

407
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:54,700
would convict us. You would show us areas of our lives that we need to change, things

408
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,020
that we need to stop doing, things that we need to start doing.

409
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:03,020
that we might be holy in all manner of conversation,

410
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:06,400
that we might walk worthy and please Thee.

411
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,320
And God, I pray that as the Holy Spirit of God convicts us

412
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,560
as He works in our lives,

413
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,020
I pray that we would refuse to quench the Spirit.

414
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,520
I pray that we would determine that we'll respond,

415
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:23,480
respond in obedience, respond immediately, no delays,

416
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,020
respond fully, completely.

417
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:32,020
Though maybe others aren't responding in like fashion,

418
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,900
we understand that You work in our lives as individuals,

419
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,020
and we will stand before You as individuals.

420
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,640
God, I pray that You'd help us.

421
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,320
Blessed now through our time of prayer,

422
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,720
we thank You for the privilege of prayer.

423
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,560
I pray, God, that You'd be honored and glorified

424
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,320
through the remainder of the service.

425
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,020
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

426
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,020
I think about that little song that we sing,

427
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,320
I'll say yes, Lord, yes, to Your will and to Your way.

428
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,180
I'll say yes, Lord, yes, I will trust You and obey.

429
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,440
And then the songwriter said this,

430
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,640
when Your Spirit speaks to me, you know what that is?

431
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,260
That's expectation, right?

432
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,900
I'm expecting that Your Spirit's gonna speak to me,

433
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,180
then my answer's gonna be what?

434
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,220
With my whole heart I'll agree,

435
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,140
and my answer will be yes, Lord, yes.

436
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,420
And what a great song that is, a little chorus that is.

437
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,420
Does anyone need a?
