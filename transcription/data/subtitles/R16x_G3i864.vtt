00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
Continue our study here through 1 Thessalonians 5,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.139
eventually we'll be over in 2 Thessalonians 3 as well.

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:10.500
And these instructions that have been provided

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.140
to the church at Thessalonica,

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.819
I mentioned it's the title for our series

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:19.139
here on Wednesday evenings, Walk Worthy, Please God.

00:00:19.139 --> 00:00:21.780
And I'm thankful that the church at Thessalonica

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.299
was a good church, a model church,

00:00:24.299 --> 00:00:27.739
but we find that at the end of each letter

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.420
that God has Paul right to these churches.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.139
We find that God gives them instruction.

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:38.860
He gives them these very concise statements of instruction

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.360
beginning in verse 12 of chapter five of the first letter.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.740
We've been studying, we've made it through verse 18.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.020
Tonight we'll be looking at verse 19.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.619
And this is lesson number 12.

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:51.220
We've had the opportunity to take each of these

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.520
pieces of instruction.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.540
And we know that as we take the word of God,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.020
it tells us that it's profitable for us.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.779
And as we apply God's word in our lives,

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:04.379
then we can walk worthy and please God.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.220
And God does care how we live, how we walk.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.300
And he wants us as individuals

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.339
and then obviously as churches to please him.

00:01:12.339 --> 00:01:14.919
And I'm thankful that he's given us the instruction

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:18.300
so that we can know how we can please him.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.540
He begins in verse 12, we beseech you.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.660
And then we mentioned already, but in verse 14,

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.419
he says, we exhort you.

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:26.699
And so this evening, as we continue studying,

00:01:26.699 --> 00:01:29.339
we find that the Bible says very simply

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:33.220
in verse number 19, quench not the spirit.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.339
Quench not the spirit.

00:01:34.339 --> 00:01:37.180
It's the title for the message this evening from verse 19.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.300
The Bible tells us that lost men

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.860
can resist the Holy Spirit.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.620
In fact, Stephen lays this charge

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.900
against the council that he's preaching to.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.459
It's recorded in his sermon there in Acts chapter number seven

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.099
that they do always resist the Holy Ghost.

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:57.660
And that resistance, and we can understand

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.099
as Stephen is preaching, the conviction

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:02.559
that would be upon them and their resistance

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:04.260
to the work of the Holy Spirit.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.900
We find that the Bible teaches that every believer

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.559
is indwelled by the Spirit of God.

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:12.539
At the moment of salvation,

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.580
we find that the Holy Spirit of God indwells us.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.100
And the New Testament records for us

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.940
many aspects with regard to the ministry

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.740
of the Holy Spirit, the ministry of the Holy Spirit

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.300
in the life of a believer.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.740
We understand that he is the divine teacher

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.220
and what a blessing to know that he guides us

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.660
into all truth and we find that he's the comforter

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.300
and we could go on and we look at the various aspects

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.660
of the ministry of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.380
But we find that the New Testament also gives us a warning

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.500
that as believers, according to Ephesians four

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.300
and verse number 30, we can grieve the Holy Spirit.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.339
We can grieve the Holy Spirit.

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:58.979
In fact, Paul says this in Ephesians four

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:00.020
and verse number 30,

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.740
and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.300
whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.380
And so we find that that instruction is given there

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.179
and obviously when we sin, we grieve the Spirit of God,

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:16.979
the Holy Spirit.

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:21.979
And so we find here the second warning, if you will,

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.580
is given to us here in our text this evening

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.020
that as believers, not only can we grieve the Holy Spirit,

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.199
but we learn here that we can quench the Holy Spirit.

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:35.300
The Lord and his infinite wisdom,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.380
and I'm thankful that God is the all wise God.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.820
It's very interesting to me,

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.699
and I mentioned this briefly last Wednesday evening,

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:45.860
the placement of this verse of scripture.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.059
Quench not the Spirit.

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:49.740
And we think about that word quench

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.699
and it carries with it the idea of to put out

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.380
or to extinguish.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.059
And we think about the work of the Holy Spirit

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:57.419
and the lives of God's people.

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.300
We're indwelled by the Spirit of God,

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.940
but the Spirit of God will convict us

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.940
and he'll work in our lives

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.860
and he will give us that direction and what have you.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.860
And we find that the Holy Spirit is active

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.460
and moving in the lives of his people

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.779
and God and his infinite wisdom

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:20.420
put this verse of scripture here

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.700
in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 19,

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.619
quench not the Spirit.

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:29.420
Immediately following three powerful commands

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.799
that we are given.

00:04:30.799 --> 00:04:33.059
We are given these three powerful commands

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:35.299
in verse 16, 17, and 18,

00:04:35.299 --> 00:04:38.220
and then we're told quench not the Spirit.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.880
There's a little doubt in my mind

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.739
that these three commands in verse 16, 17, and 18

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:47.500
have brought conviction to many of God's people

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.260
over the centuries.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.260
What are those three?

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.239
Well, we've studied them the last several weeks,

00:04:52.239 --> 00:04:56.739
but number one, rejoice evermore.

00:04:56.739 --> 00:05:00.739
Literally to rejoice at all times.

00:05:00.739 --> 00:05:05.739
He says rejoice evermore, pray without ceasing.

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:09.820
In everything give thanks,

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.339
for this is the will of God and Christ Jesus concerning you.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.420
And we find that as we look at these three powerful commands

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.459
these concise statements that we understand as individuals

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:23.940
and then we understand corporately as a church

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.899
that we are to be busy praising the Lord,

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:31.779
praising him at all times and praying about everything.

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:34.739
When we take those three commands of scripture,

00:05:34.739 --> 00:05:38.700
if we take them and we read them and we understand them,

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.779
I believe that the Holy Spirit

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.299
would convict many of God's people.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.980
Why?

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.700
Well, we have a hard time rejoicing at all times.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.779
We have a hard time praying about everything,

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:51.459
pray without ceasing.

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:56.459
In fact, prayer is often neglected by God's people.

00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:59.339
One of the greatest privileges that we have,

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:02.540
prayer is often neglected.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.899
We find that there are many over the years

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:07.040
that you might say to them, I'll pray for you,

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.260
and they look at you as if that's all you're gonna do.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.820
And really that's the greatest thing we could ever do.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.739
We find this evening that the Holy Spirit of God,

00:06:17.739 --> 00:06:20.220
all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.019
Holy men spake as they were moved by the Spirit.

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:27.040
We find that he says, quench not the Spirit.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.339
Again, the word quench means to put out, to extinguish,

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:32.679
often be used if you think about a fire

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:34.859
and you think about the fire burning

00:06:34.859 --> 00:06:38.140
and you were to dump cold water on that fire

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.540
and quench the fire and to extinguish it, to put it out.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.980
So as I look at this passage of scripture this evening

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.019
and I think about this command, quench not the Spirit,

00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:49.420
really I don't have points for it,

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.940
I've got a bunch of questions for you tonight.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.820
And the lesson this evening is gonna be

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.820
in the form of questions.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.820
And the first question that I ask you this evening

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.420
when we think about this command of scripture,

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.380
quench not the Spirit, number one,

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.179
and I want you to answer these questions

00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:06.540
honestly to yourself.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.859
Obviously, God already knows the answer,

00:07:08.859 --> 00:07:11.500
but allow God to search you and to know your heart.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.019
Number one, do you invite the Holy Spirit to convict you?

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.700
What do I mean by that?

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.260
Well, when you pray, when you read your Bible,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.739
when you come to church, do you pray

00:07:25.739 --> 00:07:28.420
that the Holy Spirit of God would convict you,

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.179
that he would not leave you to yourself,

00:07:31.179 --> 00:07:33.299
that he would deal with you?

00:07:33.299 --> 00:07:36.579
And see, as I read God's word each day of my life,

00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:40.619
I don't pray exactly the same prayer each morning,

00:07:40.619 --> 00:07:44.420
but I pray very similar things with regard

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.299
to Psalm 119 and verse 18,

00:07:47.299 --> 00:07:48.899
Lord, open thou mine eyes,

00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:51.700
that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law,

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.500
but I also pray that God would take his word

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.380
and that he would comfort me,

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.940
but also that he would convict me,

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.500
that God would teach me from his word

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.140
the things that I ought to be doing

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.179
that maybe I'm not doing,

00:08:05.179 --> 00:08:07.779
the things that I ought not be doing that I am doing,

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:11.940
and we invite, listen, I desire the Holy Spirit of God

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.859
to work in my life, and the question tonight is,

00:08:14.859 --> 00:08:17.980
do we ask God to convict us?

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:18.859
Do we ask him?

00:08:18.859 --> 00:08:19.779
Do we invite him?

00:08:19.779 --> 00:08:21.899
Do we welcome that conviction?

00:08:21.899 --> 00:08:24.100
See, many times, unfortunately,

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.980
we can gain this improper approach or response,

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.980
I should say, to the thought of conviction.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.299
We might be tending to fall on the side

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:36.739
that conviction's this bad thing.

00:08:36.739 --> 00:08:38.380
No, conviction's a good thing.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.619
It's good when God convicts us.

00:08:41.619 --> 00:08:43.979
It's good when he's stepping on our toes,

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:47.460
when he's dealing with us about areas of our lives.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.299
Why?

00:08:48.299 --> 00:08:50.179
Because none of us are perfect.

00:08:50.179 --> 00:08:51.020
Amen?

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.859
We all have room for growth.

00:08:53.859 --> 00:08:55.059
Amen?

00:08:55.059 --> 00:08:57.179
We're to be like Christ.

00:08:57.179 --> 00:08:59.900
That's our ultimate goal,

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.900
that we might be like him.

00:09:02.619 --> 00:09:04.580
He left us an example that we should follow his steps,

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.580
and all of us are on this journey at a different level,

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.900
at a different place in our Christian journey,

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.539
but the reality is that none of us

00:09:12.539 --> 00:09:15.059
are ever gonna reach a place of sinless perfection,

00:09:15.059 --> 00:09:17.460
and there's room for God to work,

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.460
and we, as we go to the Bible,

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.059
yes, I'm thankful that God's word will give us comfort

00:09:23.059 --> 00:09:24.739
in how we need comfort,

00:09:24.739 --> 00:09:27.979
but at the very same time, God's word will convict us,

00:09:27.979 --> 00:09:29.179
and the question this evening,

00:09:29.179 --> 00:09:30.979
when we think about this statement,

00:09:30.979 --> 00:09:32.059
quench not the spirit,

00:09:32.059 --> 00:09:34.380
this command that's been given to us,

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.580
quench not the spirit,

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.940
I wonder this evening,

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.299
what is your approach to God's word?

00:09:40.299 --> 00:09:43.460
Do you invite the Holy Spirit to convict you?

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.179
Do you make that request?

00:09:45.179 --> 00:09:46.419
I think of the psalmist.

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.380
Search me, oh God.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.219
And what?

00:09:49.219 --> 00:09:53.260
Show me if there be any wicked way.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.739
That's what he says, Psalm 139.

00:09:55.739 --> 00:09:58.299
And so as we begin to understand this invitation,

00:09:58.299 --> 00:09:59.859
and understanding.

00:09:59.859 --> 00:10:05.159
how the Lord works and how he uses his word. Number two this evening, a second question

00:10:05.159 --> 00:10:13.239
for you. Do you expect the Holy Spirit to convict you? Are you expecting it? What do

00:10:13.239 --> 00:10:21.319
I mean by that? You know, when you go to certain places, you have certain levels of expectations.

00:10:21.319 --> 00:10:26.799
You understand as you're going to, maybe you're going for a meal, you're going to someone's

00:10:26.799 --> 00:10:31.979
home for something and you have expectations. I wonder when you come to church, I wonder

00:10:31.979 --> 00:10:37.019
when you approach that holy time with the Lord of spending time in his word, in those

00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:45.519
daily devotions, are you expecting God to work? Are you expecting him to confront you

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:51.099
about some things? You've invited him to do so, but then you're expecting, I mean you're

00:10:51.099 --> 00:10:56.059
looking for it, you're anticipating it. I wonder as we come to church, and I'm thankful

00:10:56.059 --> 00:11:00.019
this evening that you're here obviously, but I begin to think about our approach to

00:11:00.019 --> 00:11:07.419
church and as we enter into the house of God that we're coming and we're expecting to hear

00:11:07.419 --> 00:11:15.359
from God. We come with that expectation, we're anticipating, I wonder what God has for me

00:11:15.359 --> 00:11:22.559
in this service. I wonder how God is going to work in my life in this service. Does that

00:11:22.559 --> 00:11:29.559
make sense to you this evening? Because God is a God that is obviously, he transcends

00:11:29.559 --> 00:11:39.559
us and he's everywhere present. He loves all people, but God is a personal God. It's amazing

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:47.159
how God will work as we come inviting and expecting God to work. You know there are

00:11:47.159 --> 00:11:53.919
times that God might work just through one of the songs. Plenty of times in my life that

00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:58.199
we would just be singing songs and I almost could say, hey it'd be okay right now if we

00:11:58.199 --> 00:12:03.919
just had an invitation after the singing. Why? Because God can use the songs. Why? Because

00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:07.919
there are many of the, I mean the songs that we sing in our hymnals, the reason that we

00:12:07.919 --> 00:12:13.759
use the hymnals that we do, those songs are biblically based and God will use them in

00:12:13.759 --> 00:12:21.239
our lives. We find this evening that we ought to have that not only inviting God to convict

00:12:21.239 --> 00:12:26.639
us but then expecting that he will. When we're reading the scriptures, expecting that God's

00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:31.359
going to confront us on something. It's a good thing. Let me ask you this question,

00:12:31.359 --> 00:12:38.039
number three this evening, do you give the Holy Spirit opportunity to convict you? It's

00:12:38.039 --> 00:12:43.679
one thing to invite it or to expect it, but I wonder this evening is what kind of opportunity

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:49.799
do we give the Holy Spirit to convict us? What do I mean by that? Well, we ought to

00:12:49.799 --> 00:12:55.079
be reading God's Word regularly. You know there's a danger when we talk about reading

00:12:55.079 --> 00:12:59.799
God's Word where we can just get comfortable reading certain portions of scripture that

00:12:59.799 --> 00:13:06.559
maybe are our favorite portions of scripture while we neglect other portions of scripture.

00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:13.879
It's sad to me today how many people have this perspective and it's gaining great levels

00:13:13.879 --> 00:13:21.319
of followers that we're New Testament believers, we don't need the Old Testament. That's baloney.

00:13:21.319 --> 00:13:25.679
God wouldn't have preserved it for us if we didn't need it, amen? But God preserved it

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:30.599
for us. Not only did he preserve it for us, but he told us in the New Testament that the

00:13:30.759 --> 00:13:37.719
things which were written aforetime were written for our learning and for our admonition. Now

00:13:37.719 --> 00:13:45.199
this evening, admittedly, any one of us could probably name a book of the Bible that might

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:51.119
be our favorite book of the Bible, and that's okay. But what's not okay is to only read

00:13:51.119 --> 00:13:59.839
that book of the Bible. Amen? It's not okay to just read the portions of scripture that

00:13:59.879 --> 00:14:05.839
you're familiar with that you say, man, these ones, Psalm 23 really comforts me. You read

00:14:05.839 --> 00:14:10.479
Psalm 23 every single day of your life, I'm glad it comforts you, but God gave us a whole,

00:14:10.479 --> 00:14:19.199
he gave us 1189 chapters in 66 books. And he wants us to read all of it. You know, the

00:14:19.199 --> 00:14:23.559
more you read the Bible, the more you know of portions of scripture that are probably

00:14:23.559 --> 00:14:30.319
going to step on your toes than other places. Don't ignore those portions of scripture.

00:14:30.319 --> 00:14:34.439
Regularly read the Bible. Have a plan for how you're going to read the Bible. And I

00:14:34.439 --> 00:14:39.519
don't care what plan you use. I don't care if you follow the pattern that I like to follow.

00:14:39.519 --> 00:14:43.959
That's my personality. That's what works for me. But the reality is that everybody ought

00:14:43.959 --> 00:14:48.759
to be reading the Bible. If you're a child of God, you better read the Bible every day.

00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:54.959
And that's giving opportunity to the Holy Spirit of God to convict you, because he uses

00:14:54.959 --> 00:15:02.539
the scriptures to convict us. I would say this with regard to giving the Holy Spirit

00:15:02.539 --> 00:15:07.079
opportunity to convict you, not only reading the Word regularly, but we need to be attending

00:15:07.079 --> 00:15:13.839
a church regularly that preaches the Word faithfully. You know, there's plenty of churches

00:15:13.839 --> 00:15:19.899
that you can go to today that can make you feel good. Just the way it is. I was reading

00:15:19.899 --> 00:15:27.359
just earlier today about the truth in 2 Timothy chapter number 4, about itching ears. And

00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:33.599
we have churches all across our landscape today that are catering to that group of people.

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:38.759
And it's just the way it is. It's unfortunate, but when we desire, when we understand, and

00:15:38.759 --> 00:15:44.639
I'm getting to the thought here this evening with Quench Not the Spirit, listen, we need

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:50.799
to give the Spirit of God opportunity to work in our lives and to bring that conviction.

00:15:50.799 --> 00:15:54.319
Now you're here this evening, so obviously you understand the importance of being in

00:15:54.319 --> 00:16:00.599
church and being in a church that preaches the Bible. And as a pastor, as a preacher,

00:16:00.599 --> 00:16:05.839
I seek the will of God with regard to the portions of scripture that I'm preaching.

00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:12.479
I seek the Lord with regard to particular studies that we go through and how we approach

00:16:12.479 --> 00:16:17.159
the scriptures. I was sharing with Joseph just the other night in family devotions,

00:16:17.159 --> 00:16:23.919
and I had jotted down a few weeks ago, as I was sitting in the office, just the books

00:16:23.919 --> 00:16:29.959
of the Bible that I have had the privilege that God has allowed me to teach or preach

00:16:30.039 --> 00:16:36.239
through since I've been here. Man, it's been exciting. I've enjoyed it. I have to be careful.

00:16:36.239 --> 00:16:41.719
Just like I say, don't just read the books that you are most, you know, familiar with

00:16:41.719 --> 00:16:46.119
or that you like the most. I can't just keep going and preaching the same book of the Bible

00:16:46.119 --> 00:16:53.000
every year. Why? Because we need all of it. We need all of it. And we find this evening

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.719
that I have learned in my own life and through the preaching ministry that when we preach

00:16:58.719 --> 00:17:03.599
line upon line, precept upon precept, when we preach through books of the Bible, teach

00:17:03.599 --> 00:17:07.359
through books of the Bible, man, the Holy Spirit of God has an opportunity to just kind

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:14.519
of hit everything that's in there. And that's good for us. We don't just skip over portions

00:17:14.519 --> 00:17:20.319
of scripture. Well, they're not very popular today. That's okay. They're biblical. And

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:26.379
that's what we're worried about. So how is it that we give the Holy Spirit opportunity

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:31.500
to convict us? And then I get to this question and really dealing with this verse of scripture

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:39.259
this evening, and it's this, how do we respond to the conviction? How do we respond to the

00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:45.819
conviction? So, we acknowledge this evening that we ought to be inviting and expecting

00:17:45.819 --> 00:17:52.419
and giving opportunity for that conviction to come into our lives, but the question tonight

00:17:52.419 --> 00:17:57.779
that really pertains to the verse of scripture that is before us with quench not the spirit

00:17:57.779 --> 00:18:07.539
is how do we respond to the conviction? It's a great question. We have an invitation not

00:18:07.539 --> 00:18:12.299
on Wednesday evenings, but on Sunday morning, Sunday evening, we have an invitation. And

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:17.459
the purpose of that invitation is to give opportunity for folks to respond. And I understand

00:18:17.459 --> 00:18:21.339
that not everyone's comfortable with going to an old-fashioned altar. And some people

00:18:21.339 --> 00:18:25.779
like to pray right where they are. Some people like to go home and pray about it. But I would

00:18:25.779 --> 00:18:34.219
argue that once you leave here, that moment of how God was working in your life, circumstances

00:18:34.219 --> 00:18:40.419
change in a hurry. Things get all kinds of just crazy with regard to this is going on

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:44.299
and that's going on and the kids are telling you this. And when are we eating? And is dinner

00:18:44.299 --> 00:18:48.899
ready yet? And I'm starving. I'm going to die. I'm so hungry. And so on and so forth.

00:18:48.899 --> 00:18:54.619
And guess what? Before you know it, you don't even really have any remembrance of what happened

00:18:54.619 --> 00:19:00.979
maybe 30 minutes, an hour earlier, how God was working, how God was pinpointing something

00:19:00.979 --> 00:19:08.140
in your life, how He was convicting you. And so if we invite the Holy Spirit to convict

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:14.119
us, if we're expecting it and we're giving opportunity, but we fail to respond properly

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:22.159
to it, what is it really worth? But we find this evening that we must respond properly.

00:19:22.159 --> 00:19:28.919
We must refuse to quench the Spirit. There are times, no doubt, that the Holy Spirit

00:19:28.919 --> 00:19:35.000
of God will bring conviction in our lives and it can be uncomfortable. Amen? Conviction

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.119
can be uncomfortable. It's designed to be so. Amen? Y'all looking at me like I'm crazy

00:19:42.119 --> 00:19:51.640
tonight. Listen. Conviction is good. Chastisement is good. It proves that we're His children.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:59.880
Amen? Conviction is good. I'd be concerned if God was never convicting me.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:06.640
me. Honestly, I'd be concerned. Why? Because I know I'm not perfect. I've read enough of

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.880
the Bible to know I'm never going to be perfect this side of heaven. And so if I can go day

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:17.760
after day and read the Bible and never be convicted, I'm concerned about that. What's

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:23.360
going on? Why is there no conviction? And but I need to refuse to quench the Spirit.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:28.520
Rather, I must rejoice that He's working, that He's dealing with me. I must rejoice

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:35.240
that He cares enough, He loves me enough to bring that conviction in my life to deal with

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:42.520
me. And as I rejoice, I then decide that I'm going to respond appropriately to that conviction.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:47.920
And what is that appropriate response? Well, I would say that we ought to respond immediately

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:54.280
when the Holy Spirit of God is convicting us. Because those delays, it's amazing how

00:20:54.280 --> 00:21:02.440
quickly the enemy can slip in there and kind of cause you to think, well, it's really not

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:08.140
that big of a deal. We begin to excuse and we begin to justify. Listen, we can go through

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:12.320
Scriptures this evening and we can look at examples of those that have gone before us

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:19.560
that have excused their sin. Remember a guy by the name of Saul? Right? It wasn't me.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:25.960
It was the people. Right? That's what he said. But we can think about people that justify

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:32.800
their sin. We can think about people that try to hide their sin. And so, when the Holy

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:38.400
Spirit of God is convicting us, we must respond. And I believe that when we respond immediately,

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.320
it's best. That's why, again, on Sunday mornings and Sunday evenings, we have the opportunity

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:49.480
for that time of invitation so that it gives people an opportunity not only to have received

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:56.480
the Word of God, but then to respond to the Word of God. Because we don't want to have

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:06.480
that delay. In that moment of delay, in that time of delay, we can get so distracted. We

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:13.440
can forget about all that had taken place. I believe that not only must we respond promptly

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:21.320
or immediately, but I believe that it's important that we respond fully, completely. You know,

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:27.160
God's work in your life is an individual work. He's not going to work outside of the principles

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:31.380
that He's given us in His Word. God's never going to lead you to do something that's contrary

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:36.960
to His Word. We understand those principles that we could look to, but we find that God's

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:43.000
dealing with each of us as individuals. And so, as God is dealing with us as individuals,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.120
we don't look around and say, well, am I the only one? Why aren't other people? No,

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:55.279
we sing the song, though none go with me, still I will follow. Right? And God is working

00:22:55.279 --> 00:23:01.320
in our hearts and He's working in our lives individually, and as He is, we must respond

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:08.000
appropriately. We must deal with that time of conviction and say, God, have Your way

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:18.000
in my life. It's kind of that idea of waving that flag of surrender, being yielded to the

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.520
Holy Spirit. You know, it's important for us to understand this evening the importance

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:28.000
of being yielded and being surrendered. We can come to a place in our lives where we

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.120
no longer are yielded to the work that God is doing in our lives. We sit in a church

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:39.639
service but we're distracted the whole time wondering about this, that, or the other thing,

00:23:39.639 --> 00:23:43.680
and when this is going to end, and how we're going to deal with, and I understand life

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:51.960
is full of all kinds of circumstances. It's easy to come to a church service distracted.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:58.919
It's easy to be concerned about what the next thing is and what we need to do, and maybe

00:23:58.919 --> 00:24:04.800
to, well, I'll deal with that later. The question is, does later ever really come?

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:11.840
Does later ever come? This evening, when we look at this truth that we find here in 1

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.679
Thessalonians 5 and verse 19, I believe the Holy Spirit of God, obviously God does all

00:24:16.679 --> 00:24:23.839
things well and right, but He puts this quench not the spirit right in the midst of all of

00:24:23.839 --> 00:24:29.679
this instruction, this concise instruction that's given to the church at Thessalonica.

00:24:29.679 --> 00:24:35.520
I tend to believe, listen, you can read through these verses of Scripture from verse 12 to

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:42.600
28 in a matter of just a few minutes. We've spent at this point 11 weeks looking at just

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:49.559
half of these verses. You can read through them in just a few minutes, but in the midst

00:24:49.559 --> 00:25:01.320
of them, quench not the spirit. And I just wonder this evening, as the church at Thessalonica

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:06.080
first received this letter, and they're reading these things, and you ever get to the point

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:11.880
where you read things quickly? Right? I'm not just saying that you're a fast reader,

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:16.119
just you read through things, and then you get to quench not the spirit. It kind of slows

00:25:16.119 --> 00:25:24.839
you down a little bit, at least for me, because through these commands that God has given,

00:25:24.839 --> 00:25:33.080
the conviction's coming. Rejoice evermore. I wonder tonight, I'm just asking myself,

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:38.779
but I'm asking it out loud, so therefore I'm asking you as well, how am I doing with that?

00:25:38.779 --> 00:25:49.540
Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In everything give thanks, for this is the will

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:58.100
of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. Quench not the spirit, verse 19. So, as the Holy

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:02.459
Spirit of God would be using those commands, and obviously I didn't even look at all of

00:26:02.459 --> 00:26:07.540
them because there are several beginning in verse number 12 of the commands that we read,

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:16.260
but we find that as we look at just the three immediately that precede this particular principle

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:20.660
or command of Scripture, quench not the spirit, man, there's great conviction that comes in

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:34.980
my life. Why? I don't think I'm the only one, but I'm guilty of not rejoicing at all times.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:44.540
There are things that happen in our lives that cause us to complain, murmur, yeah? Pray

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:52.220
without ceasing. There are times that we fail to pray. We may try to do this, that and the

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:57.779
other all in our own strength and our own power. Say, hey, why don't we pray about this

00:26:57.779 --> 00:27:04.820
after we've tried and exhausted all sorts of things? In everything give thanks. See,

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:13.260
tonight, quench not the spirit. God's working. God moves. The Holy Spirit of God indwells

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:20.000
every believer. And tonight, as we understand the truth of the indwelling of the Spirit

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.860
of God, He tells us in Ephesians that we can grieve the Spirit, but He tells us here in

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:34.380
1 Thessalonians that we can quench the Spirit. And He says, quench not the spirit. I hope

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:39.980
tonight that we would say, I don't want to quench the Spirit. I want the Spirit of God

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:47.179
to be working in my life. I desire Him to be convicting me. I desire when I come to

00:27:47.179 --> 00:27:54.100
church to be challenged with what I should be doing, with how I should change something

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:59.880
in my life through whatever means it is that the Holy Spirit uses in the service, whether

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:05.779
it's the song service, the preaching, a combination of both, that I'm desiring the Holy Spirit

00:28:05.779 --> 00:28:12.260
of God to work in my life and I do not want to quench His work. I want to respond to it

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:23.899
appropriately, immediately, completely, fully, letting God have His way in our lives. Again,

00:28:24.339 --> 00:28:29.500
conviction sometimes can be looked at as being a negative thing. I argue tonight that it's

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:35.580
a wonderful thing when the Holy Spirit of God reaches down into the life of an individual

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:42.580
through whatever aspect of personal Bible reading, public worship in a church setting,

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:48.419
one-on-one conversation with brothers and sisters in Christ, and the Holy Spirit of

00:28:48.419 --> 00:28:55.419
God convicts us. It's a good thing. And we must learn tonight, quench not the Spirit.

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:06.020
Respond. Respond in obedience. Search me, O God. Desire for Him to work and then respond

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:10.580
accordingly. Quench not the Spirit. Let's pray. Father, we love You. We thank You for

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:16.940
loving us. We thank You for Your Word tonight. And Lord, I pray that You would help us to

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:23.940
take this simple charge, exhortation, quench not the Spirit. God, I wonder this evening

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:35.419
how You're working in the lives of Your people. I mean in our daily walk with You as we read

00:29:35.419 --> 00:29:41.660
Your Word. I pray that we read it each day. I pray that we read it fully, the entirety

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:47.700
of it. God, I pray that as we read Your Word that You would comfort us but also that You

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:54.700
would convict us. You would show us areas of our lives that we need to change, things

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:58.020
that we need to stop doing, things that we need to start doing.

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:03.020
that we might be holy in all manner of conversation,

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:06.400
that we might walk worthy and please Thee.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.320
And God, I pray that as the Holy Spirit of God convicts us

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.560
as He works in our lives,

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:15.020
I pray that we would refuse to quench the Spirit.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:18.520
I pray that we would determine that we'll respond,

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:23.480
respond in obedience, respond immediately, no delays,

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.020
respond fully, completely.

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:32.020
Though maybe others aren't responding in like fashion,

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:36.900
we understand that You work in our lives as individuals,

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:40.020
and we will stand before You as individuals.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.640
God, I pray that You'd help us.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.320
Blessed now through our time of prayer,

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.720
we thank You for the privilege of prayer.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.560
I pray, God, that You'd be honored and glorified

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.320
through the remainder of the service.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.020
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.020
I think about that little song that we sing,

00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:00.320
I'll say yes, Lord, yes, to Your will and to Your way.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:04.180
I'll say yes, Lord, yes, I will trust You and obey.

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:05.440
And then the songwriter said this,

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.640
when Your Spirit speaks to me, you know what that is?

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.260
That's expectation, right?

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.900
I'm expecting that Your Spirit's gonna speak to me,

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.180
then my answer's gonna be what?

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:17.220
With my whole heart I'll agree,

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:22.140
and my answer will be yes, Lord, yes.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:25.420
And what a great song that is, a little chorus that is.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.420
Does anyone need a?
