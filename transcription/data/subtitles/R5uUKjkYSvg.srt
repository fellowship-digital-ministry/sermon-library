1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And for obvious reasons, perhaps, I've been reminded in recent days, recent months, of the brevity of life.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And you say, Pastor, you're young. I do feel like I'm still young.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
But the reality is that just recently I celebrated my 42nd birthday.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And you say, I wish I were 42. I understand.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But here's what the psalmist says, that we spend our years as a tale that is told.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The days of our years are three score years and ten.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And so if I have 70 or 80 years, I've already expended half of those.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And some of you said, I'm living on borrowed time. Amen.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And the reality, though, is when you see your daughter married,

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
it makes you all of a sudden think, man, life is going fast.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And I can remember bringing Juliana home from the hospital.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And I can remember walking through our house at the time and showing her all of the rooms

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and acting like she could understand what I was telling her

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and telling her where her bedroom would be and so on and so forth.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And then I remember the first evening, and Josh and Aaron, not to discourage you,

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
but I remember the first evening at home, she didn't sleep a wink.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And it was just cry, cry, cry. And she had slept good at the hospital.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And Holly was just not getting any sleep whatsoever.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And there was a good husband. I said, I got it.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Blake, amen, right? I said, I got it. I can handle this.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And I took Juliana out in the living room. And I bet you, I mean, I don't think it was five minutes.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Five minutes is dad time for sure.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And I went back into the room and Holly sat straight up in the bed and she said, what's wrong?

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And I said, I don't know. I think she needs to go back to the hospital.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And that was my medical training kicking into high gear.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And there's no other option here. She must go back to the hospital.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And obviously Holly was able to handle things.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But the reality is that all of a sudden you start thinking about life and the brevity of life.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And life is short. James tells us, what is your life?

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanisheth away.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
As we're going to think about the just life in general,

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and I begin to think about the New Testament and obviously having Acts 20,

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
we're going to look at a number of passages this morning.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But I think about our life as God would use in the New Testament,

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
really as an analogy of our life, that of a race. It's likened to a race.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We think about this analogy that God would use,

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and we'd often say over the years that this race is more like a marathon than it is a sprint.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But you think about a race and there's a finish line.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And for us, we understand that's when we will take our last breath upon this earth

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and see our Savior, and what a wonderful joy that will be.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But the reality is that we don't know where the finish line is.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We understand, as I've read there from Psalm 90, the 70 or 80 years.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And yet we find that if we were to visit a cemetery, a graveyard today,

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
that you will find as you walk through those rows of headstones,

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
you will find a variety of ages of those that have deceased.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And we find that though I may think at 42 years old that I have many years until I reach my finish line,

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
the fact of the matter is that my finish line could be before yours.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I sat in the room of a lady that was dying with cancer several years ago,

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and the doctors had told her it would just be a couple of days before she would leave this earth,

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and her husband was lost.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And I sat in that room with the husband and the wife and another family member,

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and she had a testimony of salvation, the lady with cancer, but the husband was lost.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And I looked at that man and I said,

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
you understand that the doctors have said that within just a few days your wife is going to pass from this earth,

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
but the reality, sir, is that you could possibly die before her.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't have anything wrong.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You know how many people go on the highway every day?

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't think they have anything wrong.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And bam, they're in eternity.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So we think about this truth of our lives, and we think about seeking to reach that finish line,

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and really some have said it this way,

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
finishing is more important, or how you finish is more important than how you start.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I never ran in track. It was never my, I don't have the build for track, obviously.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I played baseball and football, but I understood some things about track and field,

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and one of the things, you're going to run a race,

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
you know, the guy that starts out 100 miles an hour to start,

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
he may run out of steam pretty quick.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And we look at the Christian life, and as I consider the remarks of Paul here in Acts chapter number 20,

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
as he's speaking to the leaders of the church at Ephesus,

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and he's called them together to where he is as he's on his way to Jerusalem,

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and he's going to give them some parting statements, he's going to seek to encourage them,

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
but Paul makes a statement in Acts 20 and verse 24 that really just grabs my attention.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And the Bible tells us that Paul says,

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
but none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself,

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
so that I might finish my course with joy.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
to testify the gospel of the grace of God.

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
As Paul is speaking to these leaders of the church at Ephesus,

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
he is going to tell them of his own desire that he wants to finish his course with joy.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And I read that statement here in Acts 20 and verse number 24,

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
and many of us are familiar with 2 Timothy chapter number 4,

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
turn over there if you will, in 2 Timothy chapter number 4,

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and I want you to notice that Paul now is writing to his son in the faith,

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and of course if we could have the picture of a race and really this marathon,

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
we find that Paul is seeking to instruct Timothy and to give Timothy,

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
really kind of pass that baton, if you will, to Timothy.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
In fact, in the second chapter of the book of 2 Timothy,

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
he says, the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses,

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Though Paul's race was nearing the end, his life here on earth was nearing the end,

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
he was seeking to invest and influence Timothy,

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
who would still continue to run his leg of the race, if you will,

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
that he would have that responsibility.

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But we come to the fourth chapter, and Paul says this in verse number 6,

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
for I am now ready to be offered.

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The time of my departure is at hand.

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Notice when he says, I have fought a good fight,

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I have finished my course,

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I have kept the faith.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
As I look at the statement in verse number 7,

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
he says, I have finished my course,

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
and then he says, I have kept the faith.

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I really believe that those two statements are really dependent upon one another,

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and they really reveal to us what we find in Acts 20 and verse number 24,

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
when he says that I might finish my course with joy.

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The keeping the faith was the joyful part of finishing his course.

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And we find here this morning that as we look at the statement of Paul in Acts 20 and verse number 24,

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and we read 2 Timothy 4 and verses 6 and 7,

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
the big question in my mind is,

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,000
how do we get from Acts 20 and 24 to 2 Timothy 4, 6 and 7?

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
How do we get from, I want to finish my course with joy,

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
to, I have finished.

114
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I've kept the faith.

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
How do we get there?

116
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Let me say this, right at the beginning, it's not going to happen by chance.

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's not going to happen on accident.

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And I've titled the message, Finish with No Regrets.

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Finish with No Regrets.

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I want you to think about this if you're taking notes this morning from Acts 20 and verse number 24.

121
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I would say this, there is a stated purpose.

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
A stated purpose.

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Paul was very clear on what his purpose was.

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You think about people today that are trying to find purpose in their life.

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
They're looking all over the place of, why am I here?

126
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What am I supposed to do?

127
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What is the purpose?

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And Paul has a stated purpose in Acts 20 and verse number 24.

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He said, but none of these things move me,

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
neither count I my life dear unto myself.

131
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And then he makes the statement that we've used and really focusing on this morning,

132
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
that I might finish my course with joy.

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That's a great purpose statement, is it not?

134
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You think about the life of a believer, someone that's been born again,

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
someone that's been saved by the wonderful grace of God,

136
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
that we would have as our purpose statement,

137
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
that we seek to bring honor and glory to God,

138
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
that we seek to finish our course with joy,

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
that we would do all that God has called us to do.

140
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That's a great mission statement.

141
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's a stated purpose.

142
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I find that Paul doesn't just say, yeah, I want to finish.

143
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He says, no.

144
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He said that I might finish my course with joy.

145
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The reality is that each of us will take a final breath.

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
As Brother Mershon often says,

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm looking for the upper taker, not the undertaker.

148
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'd love to hear the trumpet of the Lord sound

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and to be transported and meet the Lord in the air at the rapture, amen?

150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

151
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But the reality is that if the Lord does not come in our lifetime,

152
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
we're going to take our final breath one day.

153
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And Paul says, I want to finish with joy.

154
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I think about this stated purpose, not only finishing with joy,

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
but I really get the idea of finishing strong.

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,579
says in verse 24, that I might finish my course with joy and the ministry which I

157
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:10,260
have received of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God.

158
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,859
He understood that he'd been given a ministry, been given a responsibility, and

159
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:18,120
Paul says I want to finish. And I don't want to just finish, I want to finish

160
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,780
with joy, but I think also about this aspect of finishing strong. You think

161
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,299
about a race and you think about the the the participants as they're running a

162
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:30,399
race. They want to kick it in for that last period of time. They want to finish

163
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,000
strong as they're reaching that finish line. They're gonna give it all. They

164
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,040
don't want to finish the race and be like I could go run a couple more miles.

165
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:47,560
No, I want to be poured out. I want to leave it all. I want to finish strong. Not

166
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,959
necessarily talking about physical strength, though in a race we might talk

167
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,799
about physical strength, but this morning we think about the illustration of the

168
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:59,779
race, the analogy that God would use really of our spiritual life, that we

169
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:05,300
would finish with spiritual strength. That we would pray and ask God to give

170
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,559
us the the spiritual strength that we need. That we could be strong in the Lord

171
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:16,459
and in the power of His might. That in the evil day that we could stand, not in

172
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:21,819
our own strength, not our own power, but in God's strength and in God's power. And

173
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:26,879
Paul says I want to finish my course. I want to finish with joy. I want to finish

174
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:33,000
with strength. I have this idea that I'd like to finish pleasing the one for whom

175
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,040
I live. You think about those that run a race. Physically speaking, many times

176
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,319
there are spectators. There are people that are applauding as they get to the

177
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:48,819
finish line. There may be medals that are presented to those that finished in a

178
00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:55,180
medal category. But I want to finish my race. I want to finish my life pleasing

179
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:03,940
the one who died for me. The one for whom we live. And we find that Paul is

180
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:09,699
recognizing that the Lord Jesus Christ saved him, gave him a ministry, and I

181
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:15,300
believe that he took the responsibility seriously. He clearly indicates and he

182
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:21,259
wants others to know what his desire is. He's not keeping this private. He's

183
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:26,740
saying publicly to these leaders of the church at Ephesus, he says, listen, I want

184
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:32,860
to finish my course with joy. I want to do what God's called me to do. A stated

185
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:39,820
purpose. A stated purpose is important. Any successful corporation or any

186
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:45,139
corporation who desires to be successful is going to have a mission statement.

187
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:50,339
When they have that mission statement, it clearly sets what the goal, the objective

188
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:54,500
is. What is their purpose? Why are they in business? What are they seeking to

189
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,740
accomplish? And as a child of God, when we consider this stated purpose this

190
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,380
morning, it's good for us to have a stated purpose. It'd be good for everyone

191
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,899
to leave here and say, I want to finish my course with joy. But the truth of the

192
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:14,539
matter is that a stated purpose requires, number two, a strategic plan because it

193
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:20,979
will not happen by chance. It will not happen on accident that we finish with

194
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:26,940
joy, that we finish with no regrets. We think about the purpose that we

195
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,460
would stay as Paul did in Acts 20 and verse 24. It's important that we would

196
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:36,419
have such a purpose. It's imperative, however, that we would have a plan that

197
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:42,020
would help us get to that desired end. That's why we read Acts 20 and then read

198
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,860
2 Timothy chapter number 4 because we find that it's in Acts 20 that Paul

199
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:51,179
makes this declaration, but we find that it's in 2 Timothy 4. He comes to the

200
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:55,619
end of his life and he says, I finished. I've kept the faith. How did he get there?

201
00:13:55,619 --> 00:14:01,619
How did he get there? As we begin to develop a strategic plan for our own lives, we

202
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:05,660
remember and we're mindful of the fact that we have an enemy who wants to

203
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:09,940
devour us. We have an enemy that wants to destroy us. We have an enemy that wants

204
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:15,300
to hinder us from doing what God's called us to do. In fact, Paul says it

205
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,940
this way to the believers in Galatia. Those were the churches that were

206
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:23,299
established during that first missionary journey. What a joy to see how the

207
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:28,260
church at Antioch sent out Paul and Barnabas and they went. And you think

208
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,700
about those four churches that were established in those cities, but Paul

209
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:39,019
says, ye did run well. Who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth? In

210
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:44,820
Galatians 5 and verse number 7. See, there's an enemy and the enemy wants to

211
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:51,739
hinder us. The enemy wants to keep us from trying to reach that stated purpose,

212
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:57,059
that goal, and we find it as we have the opportunity to develop a strategic plan

213
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:03,540
that God would help us to reach that stated purpose, to accomplish the

214
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,660
goal that we've stated. I have five thoughts for you on how we could develop

215
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:14,220
a strategic plan. This is not an exhaustive plan, just five thoughts, but I

216
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,059
think first and foremost we must develop a proper view of God. If we don't see God

217
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:23,980
in his rightful place, everything else is going to kind of fall apart. I think

218
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,899
about Isaiah in Isaiah chapter number 6. In the year that King Uzziah died, Isaiah saw

219
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:35,779
the Lord high and lifted up. His train did fill the temple. Heard the angels say,

220
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:43,739
holy, holy, holy. Our God is holy. And as we see our God in his rightful place, as

221
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:48,700
we understand and we develop that proper view of who God is, it really sets

222
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,579
everything else in order. And if we do not have that established up front, if we

223
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:57,660
do not develop that proper view of God, it's going to be very challenging for us

224
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,019
to have a proper view of anything else in life. We must understand and

225
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:07,339
acknowledge that he is King of Kings, and he is Lord of Lords, that he is the Lord

226
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:13,299
God omnipotent, and he reigns, he rules. And we find that he's our Savior, he's

227
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:18,380
our Redeemer, he is our Lord. We develop that proper view of God, we see him high,

228
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:23,459
holy, and lifted up, and we find that, listen, the only way this morning for you

229
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:28,339
to develop a proper view of God is going to be by getting into this book.

230
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:32,260
You understand this morning that Congress isn't going to give you a

231
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,339
proper view of who God is. You understand this morning that the

232
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:39,140
entertainment business is not going to give you a proper view of who God is. You

233
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,619
understand this morning that the school house is not going to give you a

234
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:48,140
proper view of who God is. We find that as you look at society as a whole, they

235
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:54,859
want to present God differently than how the Bible describes who God is. Let

236
00:16:54,859 --> 00:17:01,859
God be true and every man a liar. We find this morning that we must dig into the

237
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:07,100
Word of God if we're going to develop a proper view of who God is. By the way,

238
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,940
aren't you thankful that God revealed himself to us in his precious Word? What

239
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:20,299
a joy! Without the Bible, I would not know that God loves me. Without the Bible, I

240
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:26,899
would not know God's plan of redemption. Without the Bible, we could go on and on

241
00:17:26,899 --> 00:17:32,619
and on, because everything that I know about God has come from this precious

242
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:37,700
book. It's true that the heavens declare the glory of God. The firmament showeth

243
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,380
forth his handiwork. But those people that are in remote areas of the world

244
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,820
that only see the heavens and they don't have this book, they

245
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:52,380
understand that somebody had to do this, but they don't know who that somebody is.

246
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:57,899
They can't know him intimately if they do not have the Word of God. And so we

247
00:17:57,899 --> 00:18:02,700
develop that proper view of who God is. After developing a proper view of who

248
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:08,100
God is, number two, we would develop a proper view of self. I will never have a

249
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:13,059
proper view of myself if I do not first have a proper view of God, because until

250
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:17,980
I have that proper view of God, my view of self is skewed. We think of ourselves

251
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:25,820
a lot better than we should. Amen? We really do. I am so thankful to be a child

252
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:31,459
of God, to be joint heirs with Jesus Christ. What a joy! I'm heaven-bound, amen?

253
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:35,739
But the reality is it's all because of His grace. The choir sang it this morning.

254
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:41,780
It's only because of God's grace. And we begin to think about that proper view of

255
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,260
myself. I think about the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians chapter number 15. Paul

256
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:52,140
says this when he's acknowledging the work of God in his own life and in what

257
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,739
God has done. You think about him declaring the gospel in the great

258
00:18:56,859 --> 00:19:01,460
resurrection chapter in 1 Corinthians 15, but in verse number 7 he says,

259
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,619
after that he was seen of James, then of all the Apostles, and in verse number 8

260
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:10,340
he begins to speak about himself. He says, and last of all he was seen of me also,

261
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:19,659
as of one born out of due time. For I am the least of the Apostles. Let him not

262
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:24,700
meet to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the church of God, but by the

263
00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:33,859
grace of God I am what I am. Man, that's good. We could read 2 Corinthians

264
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:37,539
chapter number 12 and see Paul understanding how he's developing a

265
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:41,739
proper view of himself. I think about what Paul says in 1 Timothy 1 in

266
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:46,900
verse number 15, and again we've looked at this verse in previous messages, but

267
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,059
the reality in 1 Timothy 1 and verse number 15 is that Paul says this is a

268
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:57,340
faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into

269
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:02,099
the world to save sinners. By the way, aren't you thankful for

270
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:03,099
for that."

271
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:06,699
But then Paul says this, "...of whom I am chief."

272
00:20:06,699 --> 00:20:13,459
Wow, that's a good view of self.

273
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:19,159
I understand I'm not going to go anywhere and give a self-esteem talk and really help

274
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:25,739
people with that kind of a message, but it's all about God, it's all about God.

275
00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:32,379
Paul says, "...I was a sinner in need of a Savior, and that was my greatest need.

276
00:20:32,379 --> 00:20:38,499
And Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief."

277
00:20:38,499 --> 00:20:40,419
What a joy.

278
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:46,219
We develop that proper view of God, we develop that proper view of self, and then I believe

279
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:53,059
we must, if you are going to have this strategic plan to get from Acts 20 to 2 Timothy 4, we

280
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:56,619
must develop an eternal perspective.

281
00:20:56,619 --> 00:21:02,739
So often I feel like we, if we're not careful, we can get so bogged down with the temporal

282
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:04,699
things.

283
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:10,979
And I understand that we live within the constraints of time, but one day time is going to be no

284
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:11,979
more.

285
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,439
And eternity is our future.

286
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:21,939
And that little hyphen or dash on the headstone between the year of birth and the year of

287
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:27,019
death, that's just this long in light of eternity.

288
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:32,579
It's just a vapor, as James says, that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away.

289
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:37,339
And we think about developing this eternal perspective, Paul says this in 2 Corinthians

290
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:42,019
chapter number 4, we're familiar with this declaration.

291
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:47,239
He tells us, it's interesting, you think about Paul and all of the things that he encountered

292
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:52,239
and all of the opposition in which he faced as he sought to serve the Lord, and he talks

293
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:59,799
about these things and he refers to them this way in 2 Corinthians 4 and verse number 17.

294
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:04,899
He says, for our light affliction, which is but for a moment.

295
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:10,699
Every time I read verse 17 of 2 Corinthians 4, I wonder how Paul has the perspective that

296
00:22:10,699 --> 00:22:16,399
he has, because when you read the life of Paul, if I were going to describe it, I wouldn't

297
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:18,319
describe it as a light affliction.

298
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:20,519
I'm just being honest.

299
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:25,039
And especially if I was writing about my own problems, I wouldn't write it as a light affliction.

300
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,079
But he's writing on the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, and he believes this,

301
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,079
no doubt.

302
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:32,639
He's seeking to communicate truth to these that he's ministering to.

303
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:37,019
And he says, but which is, which is but for a moment.

304
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:45,399
You know, it seems like when Paul saw God saved, his troubles started.

305
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:50,559
And he goes on the missionary journey, and the troubles follow him.

306
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:56,639
And he's kicked out, and he's beaten, and he's stoned, and he's shipwrecked, and he

307
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:59,079
talks about all these things that he encountered.

308
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:03,319
And it just seems like just issue after issue.

309
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:07,999
And Paul says it's a light affliction, and it's just for a moment.

310
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:08,999
Notice why.

311
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:22,039
It says, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we look

312
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:27,399
not at the things which are seen, but of the things which are not seen.

313
00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:34,239
For the things which are not seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.

314
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:43,599
Oh, that God would help us to develop a proper view, an eternal perspective, a proper view

315
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:49,559
of who God is, a proper view of who we are, but then that eternal perspective that we're

316
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:57,759
not just so constrained to this life, but we're constantly aware of eternity.

317
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:59,599
You've heard me say it before.

318
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,879
There's so many today, and I understand it.

319
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:09,039
There's so many today that are focused on retirement planning, and it's something that

320
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:14,279
we deal with in our society, and it's something that we hear from HR folks, and so on and

321
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:15,279
so forth.

322
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,879
And there are folks that, listen, there are organizations that exist today just for the

323
00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:21,479
purpose of retirement planning.

324
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:29,039
And if we're not careful, even as the people of God, we will spend more time and more focus

325
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,639
on retirement planning than we will on eternity planning.

326
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:42,159
And the reality is that retirement is not certain, but eternity is.

327
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,399
The person that purchased and owned this piece of property that's adjacent to our property,

328
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:51,359
they bought that property in 1978 for, like, $6,500.

329
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:58,599
Man, we should have bought it, amen?

330
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:05,279
Let's retire and build a house on that property.

331
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,919
You guys see a house out there?

332
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:08,759
There's no house.

333
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,239
You know why?

334
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:11,759
She never retired.

335
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:13,439
She died.

336
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:18,719
I don't know her, never met her, but she died.

337
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:19,719
She never retired.

338
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:25,359
But that was the purpose of buying the piece of property.

339
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:31,399
There are people today, listen, I think it's important to be prudent, to think about the

340
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:32,399
future.

341
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:39,639
There are biblical truths that we must look to and understand that, but we must not get

342
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:41,879
out of balance.

343
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:45,239
We must maintain that eternal perspective.

344
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:48,959
Number four, this strategic plan.

345
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:53,959
I'm going to develop a proper view of who God is, a proper view of myself, an eternal

346
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:54,959
perspective.

347
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:59,839
I would say this, we must regularly remind ourselves of the goal.

348
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:01,279
What's our purpose?

349
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:06,319
When I worked at Sikorsky, we had regular reminders of what our goal was.

350
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:07,799
We had weekly meetings.

351
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:08,999
We had monthly meetings.

352
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:13,959
We understood what our stated objectives were and what it was that we're trying to accomplish,

353
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:19,119
and they were always before us, and we had something that we called ACE, Achieving Competitive

354
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,119
Excellence.

355
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:23,079
Some of you are familiar with Six Sigma.

356
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:27,799
It's something that's in the corporate world, and it's very similar to this thing that we

357
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:32,799
had at Sikorsky, Achieving Competitive Excellence, and so we would have these goals regularly

358
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,919
before us, and we'd have the metrics.

359
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:36,919
How are we doing with reaching our goals?

360
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:38,959
What are the metrics telling us?

361
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:45,519
I believe that as a child of God, if my stated purpose is to finish my course with joy, if

362
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,919
I want to finish with no regrets, I better be reminding myself of what my goal is, what

363
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:50,919
my purpose is.

364
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:51,919
Why?

365
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:59,119
Because if I'm not careful, I can get distracted from what my purpose is, and I begin to regularly

366
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,119
remind myself.

367
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,119
Think about what Paul says.

368
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,439
Let's look at a couple of verses in 1 Corinthians 9.

369
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:10,599
Notice what Paul says here in 1 Corinthians 9.

370
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:14,159
He understood the responsibility that had been given to him.

371
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,079
In fact, in verse 16 of 1 Corinthians 9, he shares that responsibility.

372
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,079
He says,

373
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:23,359
For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of.

374
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:27,599
For necessity is laid upon me, yea, woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel.

375
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:28,599
Look at verse 23.

376
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:33,919
And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.

377
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,319
Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize?

378
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:40,399
So run that ye may obtain.

379
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:45,919
And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things.

380
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:55,599
Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible.

381
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:00,959
We're going to stand before Jesus Christ one day, absolutely.

382
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:04,079
Every single person upon this earth will stand before Jesus Christ one day.

383
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:08,479
Now, I'm thankful as a saved person that the second death has no power over me, and I will

384
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:13,679
not stand at the great white throne judgment, but I'll stand at the bema seat of Christ.

385
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,519
And if you're saved this morning, so will you.

386
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:20,319
And Paul is saying, we do it, listen, they're running to win.

387
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:23,939
By the way, that's how I grew up, you play to win.

388
00:28:23,939 --> 00:28:28,899
No participation trophies, just play to win.

389
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:39,199
They do it to obtain a corruptible crown, a wreath of evergreen, but we, an incorruptible.

390
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:40,199
You know what we're going to do with those crowns?

391
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:46,479
We're not going to walk around in glory and say, look at these crowns I have.

392
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:52,199
You read Revelation, we're going to cast them at the throne.

393
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:54,519
Amen?

394
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:57,399
Notice what he says in the book of Philippians, turn there if you will, Philippians chapter

395
00:28:57,399 --> 00:28:58,399
number three.

396
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:05,279
I want you to see that Paul, as he's said in Acts chapter number 20 to these leaders

397
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,599
of the church at Ephesus, I have this desire, none of these things move me, neither count

398
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:11,399
I my life dear unto myself.

399
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:16,440
He says, but I might finish my course with joy.

400
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,279
If I'm going to do that, if that's my stated purpose, I must have a strategic plan.

401
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,719
And now he's writing to the believers in Philippi and he's reminding as he's writing them, I

402
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:30,319
believe it also serves as a reminder to himself as to what his stated purpose is.

403
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:34,479
Notice in verse number 12, the Bible says, not as though I had already attained, either

404
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:38,179
were already perfect, but I follow after.

405
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:44,459
With that, I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.

406
00:29:44,459 --> 00:29:50,179
Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting those

407
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:55,179
things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press

408
00:29:55,179 --> 00:30:01,139
toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

409
00:30:01,139 --> 00:30:02,099
Wow.

410
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:08,699
A powerful reminder, not only a challenge to the believers at Philippi, but a reminder

411
00:30:08,699 --> 00:30:11,659
for himself.

412
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:18,659
In 2 Timothy 2, I read verse 2 already, where Paul is instructing Timothy to this truth,

413
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:20,839
this pattern of discipleship.

414
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:26,219
He then tells Timothy that he's a good soldier, that he's to endure hardness as a good soldier

415
00:30:26,219 --> 00:30:28,899
of Jesus Christ.

416
00:30:28,899 --> 00:30:33,299
Notice what he says, no man that woreth, in 2 Timothy 2 and verse number 4, entangleth

417
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:37,459
himself with the affairs of this life, and then notice the statement, that he may please

418
00:30:37,459 --> 00:30:39,859
him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

419
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:41,899
I want to please him.

420
00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:51,179
You know what happens in life is sometimes we get so busy trying to please other people.

421
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:57,459
If we just set out our goal to please Jesus, the reality is that if somebody else isn't

422
00:30:57,459 --> 00:31:01,779
pleased with our life but Jesus is, that's okay.

423
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:06,099
I'd much rather Jesus be pleased with my life than someone else be pleased with my life,

424
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:09,419
and I certainly don't want you to be pleased with my life and Jesus not to be pleased with

425
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:10,419
my life.

426
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:11,419
Amen?

427
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:17,659
And so we find that I believe that as Paul is used of God to write these challenges to

428
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:22,659
these believers, they also serve as a reminder to himself.

429
00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:28,979
Number five, simple, keep your eyes on Jesus.

430
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:36,339
Hebrews 12, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.

431
00:31:36,339 --> 00:31:43,259
You know, it helps us when we keep our eyes on Jesus to avoid distractions.

432
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:46,419
How many of you know there are a lot of distractions in the world today?

433
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:49,859
How many of you ever drive on the highway and you see some distracted drivers?

434
00:31:49,859 --> 00:31:50,859
Yeah?

435
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:55,699
I had this guy the other day, Holly was with me, she's down in the nursery.

436
00:31:55,699 --> 00:31:58,019
This guy was all over the road, man.

437
00:31:58,019 --> 00:31:59,219
You know why he was all over the road?

438
00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:04,499
Because he was doing this right here.

439
00:32:04,499 --> 00:32:05,939
Driving me crazy.

440
00:32:05,939 --> 00:32:09,099
So I got up next to him and I blew my horn, pow, startled that guy.

441
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:12,339
I wish I had one of those, brrr, that'd be awesome.

442
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:14,299
I'd probably go to jail, man.

443
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,699
I'm not even joking.

444
00:32:16,699 --> 00:32:20,579
I'd try to get my truck outfitted with one of them bad boys, that'd be great.

445
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:23,379
But I got up next to that guy and I blew the horn, why?

446
00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:27,219
I really wasn't mad at him, he just needed to put his phone down.

447
00:32:27,219 --> 00:32:29,819
Stop being distracted, right?

448
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:33,419
Distracted drivers are dangerous.

449
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,419
You know what?

450
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:40,819
Distractions are dangerous for us, for finishing our goal, reaching that stated purpose, that

451
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:44,739
I might finish with joy, that I might finish with no regrets.

452
00:32:44,739 --> 00:32:49,059
All of a sudden there are distractions in life and I find myself over here doing this

453
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:54,419
and it has nothing to do with what my stated purpose was.

454
00:32:54,419 --> 00:33:00,099
How many of you ever told your child to clean their room?

455
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:04,739
And then all of a sudden you go in there and they're playing with some kind of toy.

456
00:33:04,739 --> 00:33:05,739
What did I tell you to do?

457
00:33:05,739 --> 00:33:09,699
What was the purpose of you being sent to your room?

458
00:33:09,699 --> 00:33:10,699
To clean your room.

459
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:11,699
Pierre's smiling.

460
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:16,179
He got two boys, amen?

461
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:17,179
Ari came in here.

462
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,019
This is just a side note, it'll only take a minute.

463
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:20,019
I'm going to chase the rabbit.

464
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:22,299
I'm going to kill him and I'm going to get back to the message.

465
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:29,659
Ari came in here Friday night for the rehearsal and he had a gun, this dart gun, not a really

466
00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:30,659
dart gun, what's it called?

467
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:32,859
A Nerf gun, a Nerf gun.

468
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:37,899
And he had a wristband with all kinds of extra Nerf bullets, it was cool.

469
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:45,299
And so I went to Ari and I said, listen, tomorrow at the wedding when Evan tries to kiss Juliana,

470
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,779
you just unload on him.

471
00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:48,779
Just unload.

472
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:52,059
And Pierre and Kimberly are like, what are you doing?

473
00:33:52,059 --> 00:33:55,699
I'm like, it'd be awesome, man.

474
00:33:55,699 --> 00:34:00,579
And so Ari comes in here yesterday for the wedding and I'm like, where's your gun?

475
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:05,179
Pierre and Kimberly are like, right?

476
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:06,179
I can just see it.

477
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:11,859
Ari's like, pastor said so, right?

478
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:18,939
Distractions, distractions, listen, distractions abound.

479
00:34:18,939 --> 00:34:19,939
I think about Peter.

480
00:34:19,939 --> 00:34:23,499
He said, I go fishing.

481
00:34:23,499 --> 00:34:29,459
Jesus showed up, John 21 if you want to read it.

482
00:34:29,459 --> 00:34:35,059
John says, it's Jesus because Jesus says, do you have any fish?

483
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:36,699
Did you catch anything?

484
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,259
Caught nothing.

485
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:44,819
And Jesus gives them instruction, they get a great, great harvest of fish.

486
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:45,819
John says, it's Jesus.

487
00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:51,339
And Peter, he gets out there and he gets to the Lord.

488
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:57,019
And Jesus, after they have some food, just begins to speak to Peter, Peter, do you love

489
00:34:57,019 --> 00:34:58,019
me?

490
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:01,019
Peter, do you love me?

491
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:04,019
Peter, do you love me?

492
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:05,739
You know what Peter says?

493
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:07,859
What about John?

494
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:10,219
What's he going to do?

495
00:35:10,219 --> 00:35:16,539
It's not about John because Jesus said to Peter, follow me.

496
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:19,659
Jesus said, follow me.

497
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:24,219
And Jesus says, if I will that he lives until I come, what does that matter to you?

498
00:35:24,219 --> 00:35:25,219
Right?

499
00:35:25,219 --> 00:35:27,739
Then they all said, John's not going to die.

500
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:30,339
That's not what Jesus said.

501
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:38,619
But listen, we can be so easily distracted in life.

502
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:43,219
And so if I have a stated purpose, I must develop a strategic plan.

503
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:47,459
In closing, number three, a spectacular proclamation.

504
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:54,099
We read it already by way of introduction, but turn to 2 Timothy chapter number four.

505
00:35:54,099 --> 00:35:59,379
Let me say this, Paul was not perfect and neither are you, neither am I.

506
00:35:59,379 --> 00:36:02,659
Paul's not perfect, only Jesus is perfect.

507
00:36:02,659 --> 00:36:06,899
However, Paul had a stated purpose for his life.

508
00:36:06,899 --> 00:36:10,539
He had developed a strategic plan for his life.

509
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:15,159
And then he was able to come to the end of his life and make this spectacular proclamation

510
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:19,179
that we read in 2 Timothy 4 in verses six and seven.

511
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:24,619
He says, for I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand.

512
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:27,019
I have fought a good fight.

513
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:28,939
I have finished my course.

514
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:30,299
I have kept the faith.

515
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:36,819
Notice in verse eight, henceforth, there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.

516
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,699
That's not pride.

517
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:41,859
He's not being prideful in saying that.

518
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:45,959
Which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day, and not to me only, but

519
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:51,419
unto all them also that love His appearing.

520
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:54,499
That's a spectacular proclamation.

521
00:36:54,499 --> 00:37:00,659
You can read books that have been written about deathbed confessions.

522
00:37:00,659 --> 00:37:04,659
You can interact with people that have lived life and they get near the end of their life

523
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:09,499
and their life is full of regrets.

524
00:37:09,499 --> 00:37:14,299
Sometimes you hear people say, I wish I would have, right?

525
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:15,539
I wish I would have done this.

526
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:16,619
I wish I would have done that.

527
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:17,619
I wish I would have...

528
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:23,819
But you come to that point where you're just moments from eternity and there's nothing

529
00:37:23,819 --> 00:37:26,539
you can do about it at that point.

530
00:37:26,539 --> 00:37:30,979
In a certain sense, it's too late.

531
00:37:30,979 --> 00:37:37,139
And so if I want to get from Acts 20 and verse number 24 to 2 Timothy chapter 4, verses six

532
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:44,179
through eight, it's the middle of that strategic plan that is so critical.

533
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:49,859
I understand that none of us are perfect, but I understand this morning that as I look

534
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:56,819
at the truth of God's Word, that I want to get to the place where I can have this spectacular

535
00:37:56,819 --> 00:38:05,779
proclamation that God has enabled me to finish what He's called me to do, that He's enabled

536
00:38:05,779 --> 00:38:14,859
me to finish my course with joy, that I've kept the faith, that I finished strong, that

537
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:19,499
I finished by pleasing the one for whom I live.

538
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:27,499
To develop that strategic plan, developing that proper view of God and self and eternity

539
00:38:27,499 --> 00:38:38,019
and reminding myself and keeping my eyes on Jesus this morning, finish with no regrets.

540
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:40,579
You say, well, the finish line is far away.

541
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:46,440
If you think that way, it's unlikely that you will finish with no regrets because the

542
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,319
reality is that the finish line may be closer than you think it is.

543
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:53,500
It may be closer than you think it is.

544
00:38:53,500 --> 00:39:00,359
With God's help and by God's grace, we can have that same testimony that Paul has and

545
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:05,479
we can have that spectacular proclamation that I finished.

546
00:39:05,479 --> 00:39:08,959
I did what God called me to do.

547
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:13,719
I kept the faith and I'm going to receive a crown.

548
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:21,319
Again, not pridefully speaking, just understanding what God has said in His Word.

549
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:23,440
Finish with no regrets, let us pray.

550
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,039
Father, how we love You.

551
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:28,539
How we thank You for loving us.

552
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:30,479
We thank You for Your precious Word.

553
00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:37,399
God, I pray this morning that You've used Your Word to help someone.

554
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:46,919
The reality this morning is that none of us know exactly where we are in our race,

555
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:51,539
how many days we actually have left upon this earth.

556
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:57,639
Not only is our life a vapor, but Your return is imminent.

557
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:02,159
God, I pray that You'd help us this morning to have this same.

558
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:09,119
stated purpose of Paul. God, would you help us to develop a strategic plan in

559
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,359
our lives that we may be able to make the same type of declaration, this

560
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:20,519
spectacular proclamation of Paul. Help us, Lord. There's one that's present that's

561
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:24,999
not sure of heaven. They've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal

562
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:29,159
Savior. God, I pray that today the Holy Spirit of God would convict them of

563
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:33,479
their sin of Christ's righteousness and of judgment to come. I pray that before

564
00:40:33,479 --> 00:40:40,679
they would leave this place that they would get their salvation settled. I pray

565
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:51,299
for every child of God. Would you help us, Lord, to develop this proper view, to have

566
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:57,879
this strategic plan that we might finish with no regrets. As we have a few moments

567
00:40:57,879 --> 00:41:04,019
of invitation, I pray, God, that you'd move and work as only you can. Help us to

568
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:09,659
take this time to do business with you, that we would truly allow you to have

569
00:41:09,659 --> 00:41:15,179
your way in our lives, that we'd leave here different than we arrived, that we'd

570
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:19,339
be doers of the Word and not hearers only. We'll give you the glory for what

571
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:21,819
you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with us?
