1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,639
Wednesday of this calendar year, January 3rd, 2024,

2
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,880
was the very first message on this theme of walk worthy.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,880
And here we are this evening on June the 26th,

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,439
and this is lesson number 22.

5
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:18,000
As we have studied, we've kind of made our way through

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,159
1 Thessalonians chapter five,

7
00:00:20,159 --> 00:00:23,120
and now 2 Thessalonians chapter number three.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,719
And we have been able to be helped

9
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:27,719
just as the church in Thessalonica

10
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:29,860
would have been helped through this instruction.

11
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,780
We too have been helped.

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,740
How many of you ever played the game Simon Says?

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,139
Come on, everyone's played the game Simon Says, right?

14
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:40,599
And what do you do?

15
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:43,259
Well, you do whatever Simon Says, right?

16
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:45,060
So Simon Says, pat your head,

17
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,779
and everyone's patting their head, right?

18
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:49,540
And if someone didn't know that you were playing Simon Says

19
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,540
and they had a video recording,

20
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,459
they think everyone looked like they're crazy,

21
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:55,259
all the different things that they're doing.

22
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:57,500
And we do it with the kids often

23
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,979
during vacation Bible school.

24
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:01,500
It's really kind of a nice game to fill some time

25
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,180
when you're trying to get some other kids in

26
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,660
and some of the classes are going long

27
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,660
or whatever's happening

28
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,379
and trying to gather everyone together.

29
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:09,419
And whoever's there, you begin playing Simon Says.

30
00:01:09,419 --> 00:01:11,900
And I like to talk fast as it is,

31
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,900
and so that helps a lot with Simon Says

32
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,220
because you can just really get going

33
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,019
with all of your commands and all those sorts of things.

34
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:19,919
And all of a sudden you say, touch your head,

35
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:21,180
and you didn't say Simon Says,

36
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,620
and half the kids touched their head.

37
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,819
And what happens?

38
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,660
Well, they're out, right?

39
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,180
Is that how it worked when you played?

40
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,500
I know everyone's a winner today,

41
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,660
but listen, that's not how it works, amen?

42
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,540
And if you touch your head and Simon didn't say to do it,

43
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,699
you sit down, right?

44
00:01:35,699 --> 00:01:37,059
That's what happens.

45
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:39,379
And eventually there's someone,

46
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:42,059
the idea of the game is that you play it long enough

47
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:43,260
that there's a winner.

48
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:47,260
Well, we understand that little game

49
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,300
that we play with kids

50
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,819
and all of us at some point in our life

51
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:51,019
have played that game.

52
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:54,580
Maybe you've even had the opportunity to be Simon.

53
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,980
And that's kind of a fun opportunity.

54
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,220
You get to give all the commands

55
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,260
and tell everyone else what to do.

56
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:03,300
And the reality is that it is an understood thing

57
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:08,059
that instruction is provided with the expectation

58
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:11,500
that it will be followed or applied.

59
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,660
Is that valid?

60
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,100
We understand it with Simon Says, a little tiny game,

61
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,940
but I'm talking now,

62
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,940
let's look at the biblical truth of instruction.

63
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,699
We can apply it as we will this evening,

64
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:24,520
spiritual instruction, but in any arena in life,

65
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,639
if someone is providing instruction,

66
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:30,759
the expectation of the instructor

67
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:35,259
is that that instruction is going to be received and applied.

68
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:38,839
Otherwise they feel like they're wasting their time.

69
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:43,839
And we find that unfortunately far too often

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,919
biblical instruction has been rejected

71
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,000
instead of being received.

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,039
We find that it's been ignored instead of being implemented.

73
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,440
Listen to these verses, if you will, with me,

74
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,559
and I'll read two verses from the Old Testament.

75
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:00,440
We're not gonna turn there, but listen,

76
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,759
in Psalm 81, in verse number 11, the psalmist says this,

77
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:08,279
God, of course, is giving the indictment

78
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,360
against the nation of Israel.

79
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,279
He says, but my people, listen to this,

80
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:15,800
would not hearken to my voice,

81
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,199
and Israel would none of me.

82
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,080
Listen, it wasn't that God didn't give the instruction.

83
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,279
It wasn't even that they didn't know the instruction.

84
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:30,279
It was that they would not hearken to my voice.

85
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,520
In 2 Chronicles 24, in verse 19, the Bible says this,

86
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,320
yet he sent prophets, plural, to them.

87
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,600
Now I like, listen, every word of God is pure.

88
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,320
He didn't just send one prophet to them.

89
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,919
He sent prophets to them.

90
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,919
And it says to bring them again unto the Lord.

91
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:52,720
Why was God doing that?

92
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,960
Why did he send prophets?

93
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,399
Well, because he wanted them to be restored.

94
00:03:56,399 --> 00:04:00,320
He wanted to, listen, our God is full of grace and mercy,

95
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,759
and he is a forgiving God.

96
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,679
And so he sends the prophets

97
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,960
so that they would preach a message

98
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,279
so that they would bring his people again unto the Lord,

99
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:13,199
and they testified against them.

100
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,720
That's the prophets.

101
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,320
They testified against them, Israel.

102
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,959
But it says at the end of the verse,

103
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,880
but they would not give ear.

104
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,720
They would not give ear.

105
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,600
Now those are two sad indictments.

106
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,440
We could look at a score of other examples this evening.

107
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,799
There are so many references in God's word

108
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:40,000
where God faithfully provided instruction,

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,920
and yet his people ignored it instead of implementing it.

110
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,320
And that's a sad, sad thing.

111
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,320
And this evening, as we come to the end

112
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,519
of 2 Thessalonians 3,

113
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,399
and we look at this portion of scripture,

114
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:58,239
we find that Paul concludes this section of this book,

115
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:02,559
he specifically addresses how to deal with those,

116
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,359
according to verse number 14,

117
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:09,359
who obey not our word by this epistle.

118
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:11,880
I wanna give you a message this evening,

119
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,040
teach a lesson that I have titled this,

120
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,000
restoration versus excommunication.

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,720
Restoration versus excommunication.

122
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,359
And I think as we get through the message this evening,

123
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,320
I hope that you'll understand

124
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,760
why it is that I chose that title.

125
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,079
In verse number 14, the Bible says this,

126
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:38,079
and if any man obey not our word by this epistle,

127
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:43,119
note that man and have no company with him

128
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,799
that he may be ashamed.

129
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:52,799
Verse 15, yet count him not as an enemy,

130
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:57,000
but admonish him as a brother.

131
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,399
This evening, as we look at these two verses of scripture,

132
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,119
and we entertain this thought

133
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:05,079
of restoration versus excommunication,

134
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:08,160
we find that yes, there is a truth in God's word

135
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,600
with regard to biblical church discipline.

136
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,399
And as we make it through the text of scripture this evening

137
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,279
and provide you with thoughts tonight,

138
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:19,200
I want you to understand that the reality

139
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,559
is that any time we deal with a subject matter such as this

140
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:26,679
and deal with the broader subject of church discipline,

141
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:28,519
that I believe this evening

142
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:32,279
that the goal is always restoration.

143
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,920
The goal is never excommunication,

144
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,399
the goal is always restoration.

145
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,600
Now the reality is that restoration

146
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,679
is dependent on the offender,

147
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:45,720
on how they respond to the admonition,

148
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,040
how they respond to the correction to the instruction

149
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,480
on whether that restoration is possible.

150
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,359
But we as the people of God,

151
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:56,799
we that are not the offenders in the particular matter,

152
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:59,559
we must be understanding of the fact

153
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:01,959
that the goal is restoration.

154
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:04,239
By the way, I believe this evening

155
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:09,079
that the purpose reveals to us the very heart of God.

156
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:12,480
God's heart is a heart of forgiveness and grace

157
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,399
and mercy and restoration, that's God's heart.

158
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:18,959
And so we find that no doubt he would apply

159
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,959
and give the church instruction with regard to offenders

160
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,760
that would reveal his heart.

161
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,200
And so as we look at the text of scripture,

162
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,000
number one this evening, if you're taking notes,

163
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,320
the instruction to the believers.

164
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,920
So we find that throughout the text of scripture,

165
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,279
the apostle Paul started in verse number six

166
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,679
as we have studied for a number of weeks now here

167
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:42,700
in 2 Thessalonians chapter number three,

168
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,459
with regard to the command that he's giving

169
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:46,440
to the brethren.

170
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,040
He finished up as we studied last week in verse 13,

171
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,000
but ye brethren be not weary in well doing.

172
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,399
Listen, there were some people that were busybodies,

173
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,600
there were some people that were disobedient,

174
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,119
there were people as we look in this passage of scripture

175
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:04,480
that were walking disorderly.

176
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,399
And so what does Paul say in verse 13?

177
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,480
Well, to those that are doing right,

178
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,320
don't get weary as you're doing right, don't faint.

179
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,519
And we look last week at some tips

180
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,679
on how we can avoid growing weary.

181
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:21,760
He then immediately goes back to really the focus

182
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,200
of the section and that's dealing with those

183
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,679
that were not doing right,

184
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:29,220
those that were walking disorderly.

185
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,940
But he first is, he continues to address the believers

186
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,659
and I want you to note the instruction.

187
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,739
He says two things that they're to do.

188
00:08:36,739 --> 00:08:39,460
And if any man obey not our word by this epistle,

189
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,460
note, it says number one, note that man, note that man.

190
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,460
And so I would say the instruction to the believers,

191
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,700
the first aspect that is given is that the individual

192
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,719
must be identified.

193
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:53,940
You must identify the individual.

194
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,539
Now, as we look again at the passage of scripture

195
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:59,020
and we've said this as we've studied through this letter,

196
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,299
that these believers in Thessalonica,

197
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:03,940
this is a church that's made up of people

198
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,299
just like our church is made up of people.

199
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:08,419
Now, this book of 2 Thessalonians

200
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:10,859
was not written to us specifically.

201
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:14,900
But we do understand that by way of preservation,

202
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,859
that the truth that God has in this book

203
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:21,179
is still very much applicable to every church,

204
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:22,840
including our church.

205
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,539
But we find that that church in Thessalonica,

206
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:28,299
they had people that were walking disorderly.

207
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:30,619
They had people that were busybodies

208
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:32,940
and Paul's writing it directly to them.

209
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,340
And it's almost one of those things

210
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,859
that you start looking around and be like,

211
00:09:35,859 --> 00:09:38,179
am I one of those people that he's talking about?

212
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:39,979
Like, we know they're here, like,

213
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,440
because he's writing to them.

214
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,140
They're the original recipients.

215
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,380
And so we find that Paul, as he's speaking to the believers

216
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,340
and tells them not to grow weary in well-doing,

217
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,020
he then tells them how to handle

218
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,059
these that are walking disorderly.

219
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:59,739
And he says that they must be identified.

220
00:09:59,739 --> 00:10:04,739
He says, note that man.

221
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:06,739
It doesn't end there.

222
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:10,139
The second piece of instruction is this,

223
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:14,739
and have no company with him.

224
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,319
Now, you might look at that and say,

225
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:19,619
well, that's kind of extreme.

226
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,659
It's Bible.

227
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:23,559
It's Bible.

228
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:28,059
And we find that there is a time

229
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:31,099
that separation is important, that we understand.

230
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:33,819
Remember back in verse number six,

231
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:35,539
he said, now we command you, brethren,

232
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:37,059
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

233
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:40,379
that you withdraw yourselves from every brother

234
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:43,819
that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition

235
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:46,819
which he received of us.

236
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:49,339
And so now again, he mentioned in verse six

237
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:50,959
to withdraw yourself, and now he says,

238
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,699
have no company with him.

239
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:55,899
Now, this is a very important thing that we understand.

240
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:57,859
Now, in today's environment here

241
00:10:57,859 --> 00:11:00,179
in the United States of America,

242
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:03,099
it's a lot different culturally than what it was

243
00:11:03,099 --> 00:11:05,819
in Thessalonica in the first century.

244
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:08,339
There are still places around the globe

245
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:11,099
that culturally, they align more

246
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:13,619
with what the Thessalonians were dealing with

247
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:14,959
than what we deal with.

248
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,179
What do I mean by that?

249
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:20,499
Well, many times, especially in the first century,

250
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:23,739
but even still today around the world in many cultures,

251
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:26,819
if you become a follower of Jesus Christ,

252
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:30,339
you are excommunicated from the community.

253
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:33,459
You have no more opportunity to do business

254
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,819
as you had been doing business,

255
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:40,119
and many times even, listen, there are families today

256
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:43,319
that we have of missionaries that they have told us

257
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:46,699
that someone came to Christ, and when they trusted Christ

258
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:50,119
and decided that they were going to boldly be a follower

259
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:54,559
of Jesus Christ, that their family had a funeral service.

260
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,399
They just acknowledged them no longer.

261
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,019
It's been said of those that would be in a situation

262
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:06,439
of being in a business and how they would gain

263
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:09,039
their livelihood, that if you became a Christian

264
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:11,239
and you were a baker, well, all of a sudden,

265
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:14,099
people would stop buying your goods.

266
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:16,919
Why, because they're not gonna give you money

267
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:20,679
for your family because you're a follower of Jesus Christ.

268
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,879
Not only would people stop buying your goods,

269
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,759
but the people on the other end that were providing you

270
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,919
with raw materials, the flour, et cetera,

271
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:31,959
they would no longer provide you with those raw materials.

272
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,959
Why, so that you can't even produce your product.

273
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:39,279
Now, we don't deal with that in America.

274
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,799
Have any of you dealt with that in America?

275
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:46,799
The reality is in America, for many of the Christians

276
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,399
in America, you can live and survive

277
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,759
without your church family.

278
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:55,759
I would say you can't thrive without your church family,

279
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,919
but you can live and survive.

280
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:00,119
You can't thrive, though.

281
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:04,279
In this culture, this situation that would take place

282
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:08,519
in Thessalonica, when it says have no company with him,

283
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,079
well, now all of a sudden, that individual is no longer

284
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,919
accepted by those that he once was accepted by.

285
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:18,639
Why, because he's identified as a Christian.

286
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,359
But now he's not living as a Christian,

287
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:23,879
and so he does not find himself being able

288
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:27,759
to be in fellowship with the Christians.

289
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,359
That's a major problem.

290
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:33,559
A square peg in a round hole.

291
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,919
Do you understand what I'm saying?

292
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:40,959
And so we find that here, as God is providing

293
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,219
this instruction, when God is saying have no company

294
00:13:44,219 --> 00:13:47,239
with him, we understand it doesn't end there.

295
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:49,539
We're gonna continue to look at the passage of Scripture

296
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:52,539
so that we can understand and find how God's heart

297
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:55,179
is revealed to us in this portion of Scripture,

298
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:57,979
but we find that the instruction to the believers

299
00:13:57,979 --> 00:14:00,699
is important instruction for us to understand.

300
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:03,779
Listen, how does it make sense that if we look

301
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:06,459
at the passage of Scripture, and we say, okay,

302
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:08,859
let's just identify this person here,

303
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:12,579
or these people here, they are walking disorderly.

304
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:16,419
Now, what would constitute the charge

305
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:19,059
for us to say they're walking disorderly?

306
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,739
Well, there's been instruction given

307
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:25,000
that they haven't followed, is that fair?

308
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,019
So therefore, we say they're disorderly, right?

309
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:30,419
Why are they disorderly?

310
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:32,220
Well, because there was instruction provided

311
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:37,220
that's not followed, and then I am gonna not follow

312
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:40,220
the instruction that's given to me

313
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:42,220
on how to deal with the disorderly.

314
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:46,259
Do you follow what I'm saying this evening?

315
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:48,660
So all of a sudden, I look at a situation,

316
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,940
and I say, okay, this person did not obey the instruction,

317
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,979
they're walking disorderly, we know it,

318
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:59,679
they're a busybody, and then God says to those

319
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:02,539
that are not, he says, here's how you deal with them,

320
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:04,500
and we say, no, we don't wanna do that.

321
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,440
Which camp do we find ourselves in?

322
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,899
We then become disorderly.

323
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:15,199
Maybe not in the same exact way,

324
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,059
but we're not following the instruction.

325
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:18,599
Are you tracking this evening?

326
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,279
And when we look at this portion of Scripture,

327
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,079
we understand the heart of God.

328
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,979
Notice number two, we know in the first portion

329
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:31,799
of verse number 14, the instruction to the believers,

330
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:34,720
in verse number 14, that last phrase, number two,

331
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:38,519
if you're taking notes, the impact on the offenders.

332
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:43,519
Notice what it says, that he may be ashamed.

333
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,359
That he may be ashamed.

334
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:51,479
See, there's something about this behavior,

335
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:55,160
there's something about this action of those true believers

336
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,220
that are seeking to do right, following the instruction

337
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,199
of the Lord, and following the path that God has set forth,

338
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:05,720
that's going to have an impact on those offenders.

339
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,299
Now, the reality might be that some of the offenders

340
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:10,599
might say, who cares, I don't need you anyway.

341
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,440
But I think about a true follower of Jesus Christ,

342
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,679
who now, because of their behavior,

343
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,119
has had this situation where other followers

344
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:29,720
of Jesus Christ are going to have no company with them

345
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,039
because of their behavior, how does that affect you?

346
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,739
It says that they, that he, may be ashamed.

347
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:43,119
So we talk about shame, we talk about embarrassment,

348
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:46,239
we can look at the, in our culture,

349
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:50,440
we think more in the idea of guilty versus innocent.

350
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:54,039
But I want you to think about someone that's ashamed.

351
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,319
If you know why you're ashamed,

352
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,759
your behavior's going to change.

353
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,599
Why?

354
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:04,519
So that you're no longer ashamed.

355
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:06,119
Does that make sense?

356
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:09,579
And so we find here that in the text of Scripture,

357
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:14,279
that God helps us understand why is it that God is saying

358
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:18,319
to the believers, identify them, mark that man,

359
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,199
and also have no company with him,

360
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,239
that you are going to have and take this approach.

361
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:26,079
Why?

362
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,239
That he may be ashamed.

363
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:32,119
See, he didn't listen to the first admonition,

364
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,440
he didn't listen to the first warning,

365
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,119
he blew through the stop sign,

366
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:39,919
he continued to behave in a disorderly way,

367
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,119
and so the end step is that, okay,

368
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,639
we're gonna have to withdraw ourselves,

369
00:17:43,639 --> 00:17:45,799
we're gonna have to have no company with you,

370
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,359
and that is going to have an impact.

371
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,319
Are you tracking?

372
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:54,239
I keep asking you because you look like

373
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,919
you're not tracking, all right?

374
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,959
This isn't necessarily an easy passage of Scripture, why?

375
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,160
Because we don't want to deal with it.

376
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,440
You know why we don't want to deal with it?

377
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,720
Because we're emotional.

378
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,239
But I like him, I like Armando.

379
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:12,399
I like going to his house, he makes good food.

380
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:14,199
And we have a campfire together,

381
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:16,119
and so I'm going to ignore,

382
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:19,679
and I'm not saying he's a troublemaker

383
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,599
or he's in that camp of walking disorderly,

384
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:25,399
but he's walking disorderly, and I say, but I like him.

385
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:30,519
And I'm still gonna, listen, we get emotions involved

386
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,320
and then we're not obedient.

387
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:38,239
The text of Scripture implies

388
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:41,559
that Armando's already been given warning,

389
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:44,080
he's already been given instruction,

390
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,279
but he continues to disobey,

391
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,479
he continues to disregard the instruction,

392
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:53,799
so then God says, okay, believers,

393
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,399
mark him and have no company with him

394
00:18:57,399 --> 00:19:00,520
so that he might be ashamed,

395
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,000
thus changing his behavior,

396
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,679
thus enjoying fellowship once again,

397
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:10,440
not only with the believers,

398
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,839
but more importantly, with the Lord, amen?

399
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,760
But see, what happens is we wanna come to this position

400
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,479
of, well, you know, well, you know,

401
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:21,799
they're a really nice person,

402
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:25,399
and so we gotta look at what the Bible says.

403
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:28,719
Notice the instruction, the impact.

404
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:31,679
Number three, in verse number 15,

405
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,159
I want you to note the intended purpose.

406
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:35,559
Note the intended purpose,

407
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:37,359
and this is where we get the idea

408
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,279
for the title of the message this evening.

409
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,000
The Bible says this in verse 15,

410
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,200
yet count him, who's him,

411
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,719
it's that one that's been noted or marked,

412
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,320
it's that one that we're having no company with,

413
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,000
it's that individual that is a busybody,

414
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,799
that individual that is walking disorderly,

415
00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:00,799
yet count him not as a busybody.

416
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:08,919
an enemy, but admonish him as a brother."

417
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:10,639
That's rich.

418
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:12,999
That's helpful.

419
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:19,039
Because in this text of Scripture, in this verse of Scripture, we see these two contrasting

420
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,759
words that are used, enemy and brother.

421
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:29,679
He says, count him not as an enemy, no, admonish him as a brother.

422
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,759
Now we understand that the Scripture says love your enemies, but I want you to understand

423
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:36,239
the use of the word here.

424
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:40,719
And I want you to understand in Philippians, when Paul is writing to the church at Philippi

425
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:46,199
and he says that there are those that are the enemies of the cross, okay, and as we

426
00:20:46,199 --> 00:20:51,079
look here at this text of Scripture, it's saying, listen, this one that's walking disorderly,

427
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:56,319
if he's truly saved by the grace of God, if he's a child of God, he's heaven bound, we

428
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,199
treat him, we admonish him as a brother.

429
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:09,159
We don't count him as an enemy, though we've had to love him, them, whoever it might be,

430
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:12,439
because love corrects.

431
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,619
What did the Bible tell us about Jesus?

432
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:20,999
It says, whom he loveth, he correcteth, he chasteneth, right?

433
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:21,999
Is that what it tells us?

434
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:24,679
Listen, you know what a birthmark of a believer is?

435
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:28,719
You go ahead and you start sinning, and if Jesus, the Lord doesn't deal with you, you

436
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:32,239
better wonder what's going on.

437
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:36,119
I'm being, listen, my dad disciplined me.

438
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:38,579
I could tell you stories.

439
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:41,079
He never disciplined the neighbor kid.

440
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,719
Why?

441
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:48,219
Because the neighbor kid wasn't his kid, wasn't his responsibility.

442
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:53,759
And so God disciplines his children, he loves, love is corrective.

443
00:21:53,799 --> 00:22:01,239
I've said this often, that love is best defined as being protective and not permissive.

444
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:05,539
In our society today, so many people want to say, well, love is love, and just let people

445
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:07,799
do what they want to do in the name of love, and so on and so forth.

446
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,819
They don't understand the word.

447
00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:14,979
No one carries that out in other arenas of life.

448
00:22:14,979 --> 00:22:21,639
You don't say, well, my kid, my child wants to go play on 66 at 7.30 in the morning, and

449
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:24,919
I'm going to let him do it because I love him.

450
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:30,039
No, you're not going to let him do it because you love him.

451
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:32,439
And this is love.

452
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:34,119
You say, it doesn't look like love.

453
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,219
It's hard.

454
00:22:37,219 --> 00:22:38,219
But it's love.

455
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:39,219
Why?

456
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:45,759
Because we're trying to cause that erring brother to be restored, that erring sister

457
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:48,199
to be restored.

458
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:56,239
And God, who is the creator, who knows the heart, see, we don't know the heart.

459
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:57,719
God knows the heart.

460
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:59,879
God said, this is the prescription.

461
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,599
This is what you do.

462
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:08,319
So we know, it says, that we count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.

463
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:10,479
That word admonish is an interesting word.

464
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:15,879
It means to warn or to notify of a fault, but it also carries with it the idea of to

465
00:23:15,879 --> 00:23:20,999
reprove with mildness.

466
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,639
To reprove with mildness.

467
00:23:22,639 --> 00:23:29,319
Now, that's an interesting definition and understanding, this admonish him as a brother.

468
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:34,559
See, when we're going through this process, if we have to deal with this, listen, I am

469
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:40,039
the first to agree, this is not necessarily a desired path that a church or a pastor would

470
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:44,399
have to go down, but yet it's necessary at times.

471
00:23:44,399 --> 00:23:51,639
When we say that we admonish him as a brother, we give this rebuke or this reproving with

472
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,399
mildness.

473
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:56,479
It's interesting that we look at this word and we couple it.

474
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:58,579
Look over at Galatians 6, if you will.

475
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:03,639
There's a great sister passage here in Galatians chapter 6 that helps us even understand this

476
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:05,199
a step further.

477
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:20,819
Notice in Galatians 6, in verse number 1, the Bible says, brethren, if a man be overtaken

478
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:27,879
in a fault, I want you to note the next words, ye which are spiritual.

479
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:33,199
Now, it's always interesting to me that there are people, and we can say this in a whole

480
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:37,559
number of circumstances, there are people that say, oh, I love Jesus.

481
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:43,659
Okay, well, He gave us some proof, evidences.

482
00:24:43,659 --> 00:24:46,519
If you love me, keep my commandments.

483
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,519
If you love me, you're going to love your brethren.

484
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:51,879
I mean, you just start looking at what the Bible says and people can run around and say,

485
00:24:51,879 --> 00:24:56,239
I love Jesus, but if they're disobeying His word, you have to say, hold on, the evidence

486
00:24:56,239 --> 00:25:04,000
does not prove the claim, right?

487
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,279
There are people that say, I'm filled with the Spirit of God.

488
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,599
You know what Ephesians 5, 18 and 19 and 20 tell us?

489
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:16,159
It shows us what the evidence of being filled with the Spirit of God is.

490
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,919
And so anyone can say, I'm filled with the Spirit of God, but there's evidence in verse

491
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,039
19 and 20, and we say, okay, what is the evidence, okay?

492
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:30,159
And if that evidence is there and it supports the claim, here, we can look at that from

493
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:36,599
the state points, the perspective of someone saying, I'm spiritual, well, He says, ye that

494
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:51,199
are spiritual, ye which are spiritual, restore such and one in the spirit of meekness, considering

495
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:58,559
thyself, lest thou also be tempted.

496
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:05,879
He says, if a man be overtaken in a fault, He does not give the details with regard to

497
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:08,279
what that is, the specifics of it.

498
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:14,239
He's making it generally a general term because it's a variety of things that could take place

499
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:19,559
that a man is overtaken in a fault, but He then gives the direction, the instruction,

500
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:27,039
to ye which are spiritual, and He gives this charge to those that are spiritual.

501
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:34,359
He says, restore such and one in the spirit of meekness.

502
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:40,599
I've had situations over the years where I've received phone calls from other places of

503
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:46,440
ministry and various scenarios would be played out, and the reality is that more times than

504
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:53,679
I'd like to even remember that those that have been overtaken in a fault did not have

505
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,399
someone spiritual come and try to restore them.

506
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:08,559
It's like they were kicking them when they were down, criticizing them.

507
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:15,000
But He says, restore such and one, and He says in the spirit of meekness, and then He

508
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:24,399
tells us this, considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.

509
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:29,720
I said this way back in the study of 1 Thessalonians chapter 5.

510
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:34,159
I said this as we began looking at that portion of Scripture where the Bible says that we're

511
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:41,159
to comfort and be patient in verse 14, support the weak, and I said this, you may be the

512
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,919
one doing the comforting this week, but you might be the one needing to be comforted next

513
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,099
week.

514
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:54,079
Someone said this, the only time we should look down at a brother that's been overcome

515
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,799
in a fault is when we're helping him up.

516
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:05,039
But oftentimes we look down at them because we're criticizing them and we're not restoring

517
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,039
them.

518
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:12,359
I want to conclude this evening by looking at Psalm 23 because I said this at the beginning

519
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,720
of the message and I'm going to say it again now.

520
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,859
I believe that the purpose, as we know in this third point this evening, we note the

521
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:27,199
intended purpose to not count them as an enemy but to admonish them as a brother.

522
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:28,199
Why?

523
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:32,459
Because the real purpose is restoration.

524
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:36,940
The real purpose here is to bring that one back into the fold.

525
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,940
Why is it that God, as I read those verses of Scripture from 2 Chronicles and from the

526
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,779
Psalms where God says He sent His prophets, why?

527
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:49,339
Because He wants them to return.

528
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:57,580
And so this purpose reveals the heart of God, that God is a restorer.

529
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:02,080
One of the kids, I think it was Natalie, said this on Sunday night when she gave her testimony.

530
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,159
She said that she learned some things about Jonah and one of the things that she learned

531
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,880
is that God is a God of second chances.

532
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,919
How many of you are thankful that God is a God of second and third and fourth and twenty-seventh

533
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:17,399
and you just keep on naming how many chances God is a God of?

534
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:19,039
Amen?

535
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:23,140
But let somebody offend us and it's like, hey, one and done, man.

536
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,039
You crossed it.

537
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,039
Seriously.

538
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,039
Look at Psalm 23.

539
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,039
We know it.

540
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:31,640
We could quote it tonight.

541
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,599
The Lord is my shepherd.

542
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:35,719
I shall not want.

543
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:37,799
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.

544
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,479
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

545
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:42,320
But here's what I want you to look at in verse 3.

546
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,359
He restoreth my soul.

547
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:51,039
Listen, our God is a God of restoring.

548
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,599
What a joy.

549
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:59,799
Because when I got saved and when you got saved and from whenever that was until today,

550
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:00,799
all right?

551
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:07,399
For me, it's like 26, almost 27 years.

552
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:09,659
For each of us, it's a different amount of time.

553
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:15,759
But from that point until now, there's been some times I needed to be restored, and there's

554
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:18,559
been some times you've needed to be restored.

555
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:24,079
And so, when we look at the passage of Scripture in 2 Thessalonians 3 verses 14 and 15, we

556
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:30,639
must understand this difference between restoration and excommunication.

557
00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:35,599
Unfortunately, there are some that are quick to excommunicate.

558
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:38,159
Just excommunicate.

559
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,519
But truly, what is the purpose of church discipline?

560
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:46,239
Truly, what is the purpose of noting that man and having no company with him, that he

561
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:52,439
might be ashamed and that that shame might change his behavior so that he could be restored?

562
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:58,879
No, if that individual refuses to change their behavior and continues to walk in disobedience

563
00:30:58,879 --> 00:31:03,799
and continues to be disorderly, well, then we continue to have no company with them.

564
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:08,199
We continue to identify, to mark that individual and have no company with them.

565
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,199
Why?

566
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:14,959
Because they're not following the direction that's been given, and we better be following

567
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:19,799
the direction that's being given, or we're in the same camp as they are.

568
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:28,679
And so, this evening, I hope that we understand tonight the heart of God, and as we seek

569
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:37,239
to walk worthy and please God, as His children, we are to have the mind of Christ.

570
00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:43,399
He said this in Philippians 2, let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.

571
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:45,079
We're to have the mind of the Lord.

572
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:48,439
We're to be like Christ.

573
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:55,919
And our God is a God who restoreth my soul.

574
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:03,639
Paul says to those in the region of Galatia, restore such in one in the spirit of meekness,

575
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:07,939
considering your own self, lest ye also be tempted.

576
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:13,199
You know, it's interesting in 1 Corinthians 10, God is giving a truth there with regard

577
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:18,759
to His wonderful promise of providing a way of escape in verse 13, but it says in verse

578
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:24,679
12, wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.

579
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:29,519
Take heed lest he fall, in 1 Corinthians 10 and verse 12.

580
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:37,959
This evening, if we're truly spiritual, we're going to work to restore such in one in the

581
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:41,199
spirit of meekness.

582
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:43,419
Communication versus excommunication.

583
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,419
Let's pray.

584
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:45,419
Father, we love You.

585
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:46,419
We thank You for loving us.

586
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:48,399
We thank You for the passage of Scripture.

587
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,879
We thank You for the truth of Your Word.

588
00:32:49,879 --> 00:32:55,799
We thank You for these two sections of these two books that we've been able to study now

589
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:57,439
for these last six months.

590
00:32:57,439 --> 00:33:01,839
And Lord, I've been helped, and I hope that our folks have been helped.

591
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:07,839
And Lord, help us to walk worthy, to please You, help us to live our lives in obedience

592
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:14,679
to Your Word, understanding the principle that we started out with tonight, that instruction

593
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:21,839
is provided to be followed, to be applied.

594
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:29,259
Help us, Lord, not to reject instruction, but help us to receive instruction.

595
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:35,559
Help us, Lord, not to ignore instruction, but to implement instruction in our lives.

596
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:38,039
We might be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

597
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:40,359
I pray, God, that You'd bless our time of prayer.

598
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:45,839
We thank You for the privilege that You've given to us to gather and to pray corporately.

599
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:48,959
And I pray, Lord, that You'd move and work as only You can.

600
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:49,959
We'll thank You for it.

601
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:52,119
In Christ's name we pray, amen.
