1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,599
down to the last verse of that passage of scripture and it says this God is our

2
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:11,840
God and all that they just sang about in that wonderful to know him I mean we

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,420
don't just sing about him and just think man it's it'd be wonderful if we knew

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:23,360
him no we can know him and this God is our God what a blessing thank you for

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,239
that this morning I trust that you were blessed as I was Colossians chapter

6
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:32,400
number four Colossians chapter number four and we sang a couple of hymns this

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,840
morning that fit so wonderfully with the message that we'll be dealing with this

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:44,000
morning who is on the Lord's side amen what a great song and we are on the Lord's

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,040
side amen and what a blessing and then onward Christian soldiers right as a as

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:56,479
a mighty army we are in the army of God we've been enlisted and what a blessing

11
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,240
to be enlisted in the fight for good and right and it's a fight amen we're in

12
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,400
the battle and we understand it but when we look at this passage of scripture

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,480
this morning in Colossians 4 verses 7 through 11 if you've noticed already on

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,080
the back of the bulletin the title for the message is my fellow workers and we

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,720
find that I would say this by way of introduction this morning it is an

16
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,360
absolute privilege and joy to serve the Lord Jesus Christ we understand this

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,680
morning that we have been saved by his amazing grace and then he calls us to

18
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:39,720
the to the harvest field he calls us he equips us for his service and it's by

19
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:48,440
his grace and what a blessing to serve the Lord God Almighty we are reminded in

20
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:56,440
1st Corinthians 3 and verse number 9 we are laborers together with God the

21
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,199
church in Corinth had divisions right they had schisms and all kinds of

22
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:04,639
problems I'm of Paul I'm of Apollos I'm of Cephas I'm of Christ I mean all of

23
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:08,559
this stuff and Paul says who then is Paul and who is Cephas I mean we're just

24
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:14,440
laborers and then to understand that that Paul is nothing and and and no one

25
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,940
else is anything it's some that water some that plant but God gives the

26
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:25,160
increase and then he says in verse number 9 we are laborers together with

27
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,360
God in 2nd Corinthians 6 and verse number 1 he reminds them that we are

28
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,839
workers together with him and we're reminded in Ephesians chapter number 2

29
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:38,839
as we read verses 8 and 9 and are so grateful for my grace for you saved

30
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:43,199
through faith it's the gift of God not of works lest any man should boast but

31
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,479
reminded in verse number 10 of Ephesians 2 that we are his workmanship

32
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:53,320
created in Christ Jesus and it is absolute privilege to serve the Lord

33
00:02:53,320 --> 00:03:00,080
Jesus Christ I am thankful that we don't have to serve by ourselves amen we serve

34
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,960
the Lord together not only are we laboring together with God are we workers

35
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,600
together with him as 2nd Corinthians 6 says but we find that even as we look at

36
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,360
this passage this morning in Colossians 4 he says in verse number 7 he uses the

37
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,119
word fellow servant he uses the word in verse number 11 fellow worker I am

38
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:27,559
thankful for this truth of serving the Lord together verse number 11 says in

39
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:32,960
Jesus which is called justice who are of the circumcision these only notice what

40
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:39,520
he says are my fellow workers under the kingdom of God which have been a comfort

41
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:45,479
unto me he says these are my fellow workers and as he mentions the names and

42
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:48,240
the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God that are given to us here and he

43
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,839
calls them my fellow workers we understand the work in which he's

44
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:55,720
speaking of is the work of God for he says that these only are my fellow

45
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,960
workers unto the kingdom of God and they have been a comfort unto me the word

46
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,679
fellow worker it means literally to be a companion in the work it's not a hard

47
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:09,639
word for us to understand a fellow worker a fellow servant that we're in

48
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:14,600
this together we're on the same team we're serving the Lord Jesus Christ he

49
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:21,279
is the captain of the host amen and we are marching forward as the body of

50
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:28,119
Christ you remember Elijah he kind of had that I'm the only one syndrome

51
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:34,679
didn't he I'm the only one God and what did God tell him I have 7,000 that have

52
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:41,440
not bowed the knee to bail Paul does not seem in the letters that God uses

53
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,600
Paul to write under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God we find that Paul

54
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:53,200
does not seem to ever really have that Elijah syndrome he is regularly speaking

55
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:59,519
about his fellow workers and his fellow servants he regularly is speaking and

56
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,320
sharing with us names of individuals who served alongside of him who

57
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,559
ministered to him who were in the work together with him and that is precious

58
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:17,320
to me because we are fellow workers and what it's not a I'm thankful it's not a

59
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,279
one-man show it wasn't all about Paul it's not all about the pastor of a local

60
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:25,640
church it's not all about me at Fellowship Baptist Church it's all about

61
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:32,760
Jesus Christ and how we as a body of believers as fellow workers serve the

62
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,440
King of Kings and Lord of Lords and when that is our focus there's no telling

63
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:44,399
what God can use us to do the reality is that far too often when you think about

64
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,519
works and whether it's religious works or some other type of work whether it's

65
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,160
in the sporting arena or in the corporate world there are times in which

66
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:59,880
people are concerned about their own self their own name their own reputation

67
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,359
to be exalted to be known and unfortunately at times the whole can

68
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:13,880
suffer right I often heard as I played sports growing up there's no I in team

69
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:20,679
what were they saying it's a team many have said you're only as strong as your

70
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:25,160
weakest link you've heard those phraseologies but I say this morning

71
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:31,760
that there's no telling what God could do if as the fellow workers were only

72
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,959
concerned about him receiving the glory it's not about me it's not about you I

73
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:44,279
must decrease he must increase who is on not somebody's side humanly speaking but

74
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:50,440
who is on the Lord's side amen we are the army of the Lord Jesus Christ as we

75
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,040
look at the passage this morning I want you to notice if you're taking notes

76
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,720
number one the recognition of fellow workers the recognition of fellow

77
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,519
workers now understand that Proverbs 27 in verse number two says let another man

78
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:08,359
praise thee and not thine own mouth a stranger and not thine own lips and we

79
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:11,200
find here that the Apostle Paul under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of

80
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,920
God is going to name a number of fellow workers fellow servants and we find that

81
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:22,200
he's not seeking to separate them from the the work that God is doing in and

82
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,720
through them but he's simply sharing testifying with the believers in Colossae

83
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,119
of the reputation the testimony if you will of these individuals it's good to

84
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,279
have a good testimony you understand that these individuals are not speaking

85
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:43,040
of themselves they're not trying to to boast of themselves no Paul is speaking

86
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,760
of these individuals and he's recognizing these that he's referred to

87
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,720
as fellow servants and fellow laborers or workers as we begin in verse number

88
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,839
seven the Bible says this all my state shall tick a kiss declare unto you who

89
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:01,559
is a beloved brother and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord

90
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:05,200
I want you to notice as we go through the passage of Scripture how these

91
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,399
fellow workers are described we find the first one in verse number seven tick a

92
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,160
kiss and we find that the description that is given of this individual is

93
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,279
that he is a beloved brother so we find that immediately one of the

94
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,920
distinguishing characteristics of this man that Paul first reveals and begins

95
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:31,239
to recognize is that he is a brother in Christ he is a saved man he has trusted

96
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:36,760
the Lord Jesus Christ as his personal Savior and he is a beloved brother

97
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:42,799
notice the Bible says and faithful minister what a blessing to think about

98
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:48,840
faithfulness what a blessing to think about the the truth that our God is

99
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,760
faithful that we sing great is thy faithfulness we read Scriptures all

100
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,239
throughout the Word of God with regard to the faithfulness of God and he is

101
00:08:58,359 --> 00:09:07,919
faithful he says that we as his servants that it is required in stewards that a

102
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:12,559
man be found faithful in first Corinthians 4 and verse number 2 you

103
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,960
think about the book of Proverbs and the the reference to faithfulness and a

104
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:22,280
faithful individual a faithful man who can find putting confidence in an

105
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:27,799
unfaithful man the Bible says is like a broken tooth or a foot out of joint

106
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:33,400
but you think about the the faithfulness of an individual somebody that's

107
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,159
dependable that's trustworthy someone that you can rely upon someone that you

108
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:43,200
can have that confidence that they have demonstrated this this this character

109
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,400
trait of being faithful you can depend upon them we find that the text of

110
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,599
Scripture continues and says not only a beloved brother a faithful minister but

111
00:09:54,599 --> 00:10:02,200
it says this and fellow servant in the Lord he was serving God

112
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,280
He's a fellow servant.

113
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,180
He was doing what God had commissioned him to do.

114
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,220
He wasn't seeking to do what Paul had been commissioned by God to do.

115
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,880
He was simply in his own lane, so to speak, doing what God had called him to do.

116
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,780
And as we understand that God equips each of us as individuals and we're co-laborers,

117
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:32,620
that we are fellow helpers and fellow workers and we are working together, serving God as

118
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:38,580
a local church, we understand that God equips and gifts each one of us in a particular fashion

119
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:45,020
and we use that gift as good stewards of the manifold grace of God, according to 1 Peter

120
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,780
4 and verse number 10, to the glory of God.

121
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,860
It's not about someone else trying to do what someone else is doing.

122
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:59,420
I think I want to do that thing and I think I want to do this thing and I think I want to be over there.

123
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,140
That position seems to have a little bit more limelight than this position over here.

124
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,300
No, no, no, it's not about that, right?

125
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,900
We are laborers together with God.

126
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,340
It is for God's honor and for God's glory.

127
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:16,020
And we say we come together with the single purpose of exalting and magnifying the Lord

128
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,100
Jesus Christ and serving Him.

129
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:27,860
We find that this man, beloved brother, faithful minister, fellow servant, he also is the man

130
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:33,020
that in the book of Ephesians in chapter number 6 is entrusted with that letter to take back

131
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:38,580
to the church at Ephesus and there in Ephesians 6 in verse number 12, he is described in similar

132
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,720
verse number 21, excuse me, in similar fashion where the Bible says, but that you also may

133
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,140
know my affairs and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the

134
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:53,380
Lord shall make known to you all things.

135
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,500
I think Paul was thankful for Tychicus.

136
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:03,780
He was thankful to have a fellow worker, a helper, a fellow servant.

137
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,700
Notice as we continue to read here, the Bible comes to verse number 8, whom I have sent

138
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,380
unto you for the same purpose that he might know your estate and comfort your hearts.

139
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,780
We'll get back to that in just a moment.

140
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:18,120
Notice the second one that is mentioned in verse number 9 with Onesimus.

141
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,280
Notice how this man is described.

142
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:26,880
He is described as a faithful and beloved brother, but I want you to notice the next

143
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
phrase.

144
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,300
It says, who is one of you?

145
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,400
We know some things about Onesimus because of what we read in the book of Philemon.

146
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:40,060
The book of Philemon is given to us as Paul is writing to Philemon and he's telling him

147
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,960
about this man, Onesimus, who is what?

148
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:50,840
He is a runaway slave, and as such, he had a death warrant on his life.

149
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,960
The reality is that many times in the particular custom in the day and age in which they were

150
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,320
living, that if a slave would be a runaway slave and be captured by some other slave

151
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,600
owner, they would be put to death simply so that others would recognize the severity of

152
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,160
the decision to try to run away.

153
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,280
They would make them an example.

154
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:19,880
But we find that this man, Onesimus, when he runs away, he finds Paul.

155
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,880
And Paul leads them to Christ.

156
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,760
And now Paul describes Onesimus, who is one of you, he describes him as being a faithful

157
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,240
and beloved brother.

158
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,760
Isn't that wonderful?

159
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,920
We won't have time this morning to look at the book of Philemon.

160
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,480
It's just a single chapter.

161
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,800
It's a very quick read, but you read through the book of Philemon, perhaps this afternoon,

162
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,960
and have the opportunity to learn more about Onesimus and all that took place, and God

163
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:54,520
using Paul to make really a petition to Philemon with regard to his interaction with this one

164
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,320
who now is a brother.

165
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,040
What a blessing.

166
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,520
We continue reading in verse number 9, he says, who is one of you, they shall make known

167
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,020
unto you all things which are done here.

168
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:12,060
Verse number 10, Aristarchus, the Bible says here, he is my fellow prisoner, and he saluteth

169
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,060
you.

170
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:18,180
This man is mentioned back in Ephesus as you look at Acts chapter number 19.

171
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:23,820
And as he's there, you find that when all of the uproar in the city and they're crying

172
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,900
out great is Diana and all that's going on there.

173
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,180
And remember, Paul has to be hustled out of the arena.

174
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,160
We find that this man is there with him.

175
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,980
We find that he traveled with Paul.

176
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,880
We find that in Acts chapter number 27, this man is getting on the ship with Paul as he

177
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:46,260
would endure that great difficulty in that shipwreck that is detailed to us in Acts 27.

178
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,340
And now the Bible calls him a fellow prisoner.

179
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,860
We don't know much about the reason for his imprisonment.

180
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,580
We're not sure if he was in prison because of his service to God in like fashion as the

181
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:03,940
Apostle Paul, because of his boldness to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, or perhaps

182
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:10,940
he was a fellow prisoner, not because he had been convicted and put sentenced into prison,

183
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:16,900
but because he voluntarily chose to become a prisoner so that he could be with Paul.

184
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:24,500
You say, who would do that, a servant?

185
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,500
There were several, and it was common during this particular time in which individuals

186
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:36,460
could give up their own rights to be put into a prison cell with another prisoner so that

187
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,700
they could accompany them, so that they could companionship, so that they could have some

188
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,260
level of interaction.

189
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:51,020
We don't know for sure the cause of his imprisonment, why he is referred to as being my fellow prisoner,

190
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,500
but no doubt, whether it was that he was convicted and sentenced to prison, or else

191
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:01,300
that he chose that at times he would spend with Paul in prison so that perhaps he could

192
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:07,940
be taught from Paul, so that at times he could give truth and encourage one another.

193
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,820
Iron sharpeneth iron, amen?

194
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:18,960
And we find that in so doing, in making their allegiance, if I could use that terminology,

195
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,920
we understand first and foremost their allegiance is to Christ, but when you make your allegiance

196
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,240
to Paul, who is a man who is condemned to death, who's in prison, you're really putting

197
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,279
yourself in a difficult situation.

198
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,279
But it wasn't about them.

199
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,580
It was about the Lord.

200
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:40,080
We find that we come to verse number 10 as we continue reading, and we find the Bible

201
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,080
says,

202
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,000
And mark a sister's son to Barnabas, touching whom you received commandments.

203
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,960
If he come unto you, notice what he says, receive him.

204
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:54,080
Now this individual, Marcus, who is given here, we understand him as being Mark, John

205
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,279
Mark, and it's interesting if you were to understand he says here, if he come unto you,

206
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,279
receive him.

207
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:05,279
Now this is the same Mark, John Mark, that in Acts chapter number 13, during the first

208
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,160
missionary journey, deserted the team.

209
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
He was the one that left.

210
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,680
You can read it in Acts 13 and verse number 13.

211
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,480
And it was so challenging and so difficult for the Apostle Paul when he dealt with that

212
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,120
particular situation, that his own, really, as we look at it this particular time in his

213
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,720
life, probably the closest person to him relationally would be Barnabas.

214
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:36,559
And yet the strife, the contention was so great between Paul and Barnabas over this

215
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:44,960
one Mark, because he had deserted them previously, that they separate.

216
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,160
It's given to us in Acts 15 in verse 37, it says,

217
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,720
And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark, but Paul thought

218
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,559
it not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with

219
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,120
them to the work.

220
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:06,520
And the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder, one from the other,

221
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,120
and so Barnabas took Mark and sailed unto Cyprus, and Paul chose Silas and departed,

222
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,320
being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.

223
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:24,320
What I see as I read the name Marcus in Colossians 4 and verse number 10, I'm reminded of forgiveness.

224
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,640
I'm reminded of how Paul, though there had been this situation in Acts 13 during this

225
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,480
first missionary journey, and though it had been such a great contention that ways were

226
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,799
parted and Paul and Barnabas separated, that at the end of Paul's life in 2 Timothy 4

227
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:45,559
and verse number 11, when speaking of Mark, he says,

228
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:52,880
Bring him with thee, for he is profitable to me for the ministry.

229
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,760
You know what he tells the believers at Colossae?

230
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,760
Receive him.

231
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,760
Receive him.

232
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,520
Isn't that a blessing?

233
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,000
And we find the last of these named in the text that we're going to deal with.

234
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,799
There are some others that are named as we move forward and finish up the book of Colossians

235
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,359
over the next few weeks, and we'll look at those in particular.

236
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:16,720
But notice, for the sake of this message this morning, we end with verse number 11.

237
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
The Bible says,

238
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,400
And Jesus, which is called Justice, who are of the circumcision, again the identification

239
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,119
there that this man was Jewish, he says,

240
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:35,160
These only are my fellow workers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.

241
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,559
These men were faithful, as I mentioned a moment ago.

242
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:44,280
And what a blessing to the Apostle Paul to speak about these fellow servants, these my

243
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,880
fellow workers, as he refers to them in verse number 11.

244
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:54,280
And as he gives, I believe there in verse number 11, some insight as to the ministry

245
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:00,440
that these individuals had, that they have been a comfort unto me.

246
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,280
They've been a comfort unto me.

247
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,700
someone that you know that has been a comfort unto you,

248
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,820
that God, we understand the Holy Spirit,

249
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,900
one of his ministries, one of the names of the Holy Spirit

250
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,620
is that he's the comforter.

251
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,140
And I'm thankful that he comforts us, and he does.

252
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,740
I'm thankful that our God, according to 2 Corinthians 1,

253
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,820
is the God of all comfort, but we find that the reality

254
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,420
is that God will use his people,

255
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,460
one in the life of another, to help bring comfort.

256
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,320
And that's a blessing, it's a treasure.

257
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,980
We find this morning the recognition

258
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,200
of these fellow workers, again, it's let another man

259
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,440
praise thee and not thine own mouth,

260
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,600
a stranger and not thine own lips.

261
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,840
It's not that we're trying to lift these people up

262
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,280
above what they should be, for we know that they're simply

263
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,960
servants and ministers, but I want you to understand

264
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,720
this morning that as we look at the life of Paul,

265
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,100
he does not carry that Elijah syndrome with him.

266
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,240
He understands that God has brought other people,

267
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,140
and these are my fellow workers.

268
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,880
These are people that have enabled the work to progress.

269
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,400
Remember what he said to the believers in Philippi

270
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,560
in the fourth chapter, he tells them that they were

271
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,560
the only ones that communicated with him

272
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,000
with regard to giving.

273
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,360
He says, not because I desire a gift, but I desire fruit

274
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,300
that may abound to your account.

275
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,840
An understanding that we're serving God together,

276
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
my fellow workers.

277
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,840
Notice not only, number one, the recognition,

278
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,920
but notice, number two, the role of these fellow workers.

279
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,480
Notice what their role was.

280
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,640
They had a responsibility, according to verse number seven

281
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,560
and eight, that they were going to report on Paul's state

282
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,720
or Paul's condition.

283
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,720
Notice it says, all my state shall Tychicus declare

284
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,680
unto you.

285
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,580
We read that in the book of Ephesians as well,

286
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,800
that this would be the responsibility of this individual

287
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,020
to the church at Ephesus as well.

288
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,320
And we find that here, as we begin to think about

289
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,580
the state or the condition of Paul,

290
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,300
we understand that he is in a Roman prison.

291
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,200
We understand that this book is one of those

292
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,620
that we would include in being the prison epistles.

293
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,420
And as Paul is writing from a Roman prison,

294
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,680
we find that one of the things that he's going to do

295
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,560
is he's going to send this one with a letter.

296
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,480
Tychicus, he's gonna have this letter of the book

297
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,920
of Colossians to the church at Colossae,

298
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,340
but he's also going to declare the state of Paul

299
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,200
to these individuals.

300
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,760
You know one of the benefits of that?

301
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,000
Is they can pray for him.

302
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,060
They can pray for him.

303
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,780
We had mentioned as we looked at the beginning portions

304
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,040
of chapter number four, how that Paul gives the admonition

305
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,360
to continue in prayer, and we find that he mentions

306
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,040
that pray for me also in verse number three

307
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,440
about that door of utterance,

308
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,320
that he would speak the mystery of Christ,

309
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,040
and we understand the specifics of verses three and four

310
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,380
with regard to the importance of prayer,

311
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,680
but we find that as the state of Paul

312
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,560
would be given the condition,

313
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,320
what he was facing and dealing with,

314
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,400
that we understand that the people would be able to pray.

315
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,080
Why is it that we put prayer letters summarized

316
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,320
on the back of our Wednesday evening prayer bulletin?

317
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,200
Why is it that Michael takes time to receive

318
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,960
a prayer letter that I give him,

319
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,240
and he reads it and he understands

320
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,840
and seeks to summarize it to present here

321
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,360
on a Sunday morning, why?

322
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,440
So that we can pray for these individuals.

323
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,520
So that we know their state,

324
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,100
so that we know what's going on.

325
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,760
We know how that we can pray.

326
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,900
Notice not only would they report on the condition,

327
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,540
the state of Paul, but we notice in verse number eight

328
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,520
that they too were to gather a report from the field.

329
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,460
The Bible says, whom I have sent unto you,

330
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,420
verse eight, for the same purpose,

331
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:02,900
that he might know your estate and comfort your hearts.

332
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,700
Let's look at the first part of verse number eight,

333
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,260
that he would know your estate,

334
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,900
that he would gather this report from the field.

335
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,780
Why is it that Paul, remember,

336
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,960
Paul had not ministered in Colossae.

337
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,120
He didn't know these individuals personally.

338
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,520
He only understood of their faith in Christ

339
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,080
and their hardships in which they endured

340
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,840
through the testimony of Epaphras,

341
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,480
according to chapter number one.

342
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,760
But it's interesting that in chapter number two,

343
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,160
Paul begins by sharing with the believers in Colossae

344
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,720
that he has this great conflict for them.

345
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,560
What was the source of this great conflict?

346
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,860
There were false teachers that had crept in

347
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,100
and Paul was concerned about them.

348
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,220
You understand that Paul mentions as he's writing

349
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,100
to the church in Corinth about all of these difficulties

350
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,820
and hardships that he'd endured

351
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,200
and all of those things that are from without,

352
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,040
but he concludes that passage of scripture

353
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,780
and says, not only the things that are without,

354
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,720
but that which cometh upon me daily,

355
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,800
the care of all the churches.

356
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,980
Paul was interested in knowing how the believers

357
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,300
at Colossae were doing.

358
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,160
He wanted to know their estate.

359
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,360
He wanted to know how they were faring

360
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,140
with all of the adversity and opposition

361
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,640
and the way in which the false teachers work.

362
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,080
You understand that false teachers,

363
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,000
they creep in unawares, according to what Jude tells us,

364
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,500
and as they creep in, they seek to pit people against people.

365
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,500
They seek to separate and divide a congregation, a church,

366
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,120
so that they can have victory,

367
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,580
because all of a sudden, the fighting becomes internal.

368
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,580
We lose our focus.

369
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,560
We lose our purpose.

370
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,820
We no longer are seeking to honor

371
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,500
and glorify the Lord Jesus Christ.

372
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,460
We're more concerned about what's going on here,

373
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,220
and we've become distracted.

374
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,920
The enemy has become victorious,

375
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,660
and we find here that Paul is concerned.

376
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,300
Do you remember when he writes to the church

377
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,420
in Thessalonica in 1 Thessalonians,

378
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:04,660
he says to them, listen, when I could no longer forbear,

379
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,020
I sent Timotheus unto you to know of your estate,

380
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,760
to know how you fare.

381
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,440
He had the privilege of ministering

382
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,520
amongst the believers in Thessalonica

383
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,720
for a very short period of time.

384
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,200
The reason why his time was cut short there in Thessalonica

385
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,240
was because those that were in previous cities

386
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,040
where he had labored had come to Thessalonica as well

387
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,840
and caused all kinds of difficulties,

388
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,940
and Paul is ushered out.

389
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,840
But we find that Paul has a care,

390
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,400
and he desires that, as I mentioned,

391
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,220
he has this great conflict for the church at Colossae,

392
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,980
and therefore, he wants to know their estate,

393
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,060
he wants to know how things are going.

394
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,700
You understand their line and modes of communication

395
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,860
are greatly different than what ours are today.

396
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,540
I had the privilege to FaceTime

397
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,740
with one of our missionaries yesterday morning,

398
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,900
who's in a ridiculously remote part of the world,

399
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,740
and we're FaceTiming one with the other.

400
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,660
And I had an opportunity to hear about his estate,

401
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,240
what's going on in the ministry, how God is working,

402
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,660
and what's taking place.

403
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,300
It was a blessing.

404
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,040
Paul didn't have that technology,

405
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,720
but his heart was burdened for the people in Colossae.

406
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,740
We find that he tells us of their responsibility

407
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,500
or of their role, not only to give a report

408
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,740
and to receive a report,

409
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,940
but we find that he also says at the end of verse number eight

410
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,080
and comfort your hearts.

411
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,420
We've already mentioned that at the end of verse number 11

412
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,100
that when Paul speaks of these, my fellow workers,

413
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,980
he speaks of how they were a comfort unto him.

414
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,640
And now these individuals that are named here

415
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,200
in this portion of scripture

416
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,880
are being sent back to the city of Colossae

417
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,500
with the letter that we now hold in our Bibles

418
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,840
and refer to as the Book of Colossians,

419
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,480
back to this people.

420
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,580
And as they are bringing this back,

421
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,680
we understand that one of the responsibilities

422
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,040
or roles that they had was to provide comfort

423
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,720
for these believers, to comfort their hearts.

424
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,680
It literally carries with it the idea to be at one side,

425
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:13,680
to console, to encourage, to strengthen.

426
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,300
Believers that are dealing with the outside opposition,

427
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:22,060
the adversity seeking to bring all of the false teaching

428
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,480
that they would try to bring in,

429
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,920
no doubt that they needed to have someone come

430
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,040
and comfort them.

431
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,540
What a blessing.

432
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,820
You think about the provision of God

433
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,180
and how God uses people.

434
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:42,140
We find not only were they to speak of the state of Paul

435
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,300
and to report back to Paul with their estate

436
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,860
and to comfort their hearts,

437
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,620
but I want you to notice in verse number nine,

438
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,500
it says this, at the end of the passage

439
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,340
or at the end of the verse,

440
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,860
it says, they shall make known unto you.

441
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,180
Notice what it says here.

442
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,220
All things which are done here.

443
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,780
All things which are done here.

444
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,580
See, though Paul was in prison,

445
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,660
though he was bound, as he tells Timothy,

446
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,260
the word of God is not bound.

447
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,860
And though he was in prison

448
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,660
and though from a human perspective,

449
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,140
he could look at his lot

450
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,940
and he could look at his circumstances and say,

451
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,300
woe is me, I've been forgotten.

452
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,100
I've been left aside.

453
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,820
I have been in this terrible set

454
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,780
of circumstances and situation.

455
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,360
But no, he says to the believers in Philippi,

456
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,260
I want you to know in verse 12 of chapter one

457
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,980
that the things that happened unto me

458
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,700
have happened for the furtherance of the gospel.

459
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,940
We've mentioned already that Onesimus had been saved

460
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,240
during the time of Paul's being in prison.

461
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,380
We understand that not only here

462
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,780
that he speaks of Onesimus,

463
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,020
but in Philemon in verse number 10,

464
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,900
it says, I beseech thee for my son Onesimus,

465
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:53,900
whom I have begotten in my bonds.

466
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,740
You know how he closes the book of Philippians

467
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,580
in chapter four in verse number 22.

468
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,540
He says, all the saints salute you.

469
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:10,740
you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household."

470
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,300
How'd those people get saved?

471
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:18,060
Because God allowed Paul to be imprisoned.

472
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:25,300
And Paul wasn't, woe is me, he wasn't in this living underneath of the circumstances and

473
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:30,020
I just can't whatever, no, no, he's singing and he's praising God and he's ministering

474
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,380
and people are being saved.

475
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,940
It's amazing.

476
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:39,580
And Paul says, they're going to tell you about my state and they're going to find out about

477
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:45,980
your state and they're going to comfort you but they're also going to make known unto

478
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,780
you all things which are done here.

479
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,420
I think that was a time of rejoicing.

480
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,780
I think that was an exciting time.

481
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:58,340
I'm of the persuasion this morning that there were some prison guards, some Roman prison

482
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:06,220
guards that would regularly seek to get out of duty of being chained to Paul.

483
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,700
I don't want to be responsible for guarding Paul, why?

484
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,260
Because all he does is preach the word of God to me.

485
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,300
And then I think there were others that desired to be assigned to Paul.

486
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,300
Why?

487
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,580
Because they had been saved.

488
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:22,580
And now if I have the assignment of being with him for however many hours, then he can

489
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:26,100
instruct me and he can teach me and we can rejoice and fellowship.

490
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,460
I mean, it's exciting.

491
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,100
Understanding that God is sovereign.

492
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,420
God rules and God reigns.

493
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:42,340
Remember the truth of Romans 8.28 that we so often seek to share with one another when

494
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:47,660
we're dealing with burdens and trials and tribulations.

495
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:53,700
It begins this way, and we know.

496
00:31:53,700 --> 00:32:02,620
We don't think, we don't hope, we know that all things work together for good.

497
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,060
I don't see it.

498
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,420
I don't know how.

499
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:11,060
You can look at Joseph's life and say, how's that going to work out?

500
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:14,740
Paul in prison, how's that going to work out?

501
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,540
Go over and over and over.

502
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,020
How's this going to work?

503
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,380
We trust God and we see God work.

504
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:30,860
And here, these believers in Colossae received a report of all the things that were done

505
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,780
there during this time.

506
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,140
Notice with me quickly as we finish this morning.

507
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:41,520
It's not necessarily in our text of Scripture, but I want you to for just a few moments consider

508
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,660
the reward for the fellow workers.

509
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,380
As you read through the New Testament, you will discover that the Word of God reveals

510
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,860
to us that there are five specific crowns that are mentioned.

511
00:32:53,860 --> 00:33:01,500
You think about the recognition of these fellow workers, you think about the role of these

512
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,900
fellow workers, but then I want you to think about the reward.

513
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:10,500
And understand this morning that when we think about the reward that is mentioned, the crowns

514
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:15,220
that are revealed to us in the Scriptures, we understand that God has given us these

515
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:19,420
truths and these truths ought to impact us.

516
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:24,520
We begin in 1 Corinthians 9 and verse number 25, and I need to go quickly.

517
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,700
And so we have a number of passages to turn to.

518
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:31,680
So if you would be quick on turning to those passages or I'll read them to you.

519
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:37,380
But in 1 Corinthians 9 and verse number 25 is the first of the five that I will mention

520
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,100
to you here this morning.

521
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:44,820
It says this, and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things.

522
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:57,860
Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible, isn't that precious?

523
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:02,620
That corruptible crown that they would receive, you think about the Olympic Games and today

524
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:07,780
they receive medals, but then they would receive these wreaths that they put around them to

525
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:13,460
recognize their achievement, their superior sportsmanship and what have you.

526
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:21,080
But that was just a wreath that in time would just corrupt, it would just die.

527
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:31,500
And here he says, listen, they do it to obtain, seeking to receive a corruptible crown, but

528
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,540
we an incorruptible crown.

529
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:38,580
This first of these crowns that I'll mention to you this morning is really for the victorious

530
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:45,620
believer, the one who learns to yield to Christ, that understands not me, but Christ living

531
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,620
through me.

532
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,980
It's not about what I can do, but it's about what He can do through me, amen?

533
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,580
And it's that yielding.

534
00:34:52,580 --> 00:35:01,100
The second crown in 1 Thessalonians 2 and verse number 19, I want you to note here that

535
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:08,140
the second crown that is mentioned is a crown of rejoicing, a crown of rejoicing.

536
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:13,420
The people in Thessalonica were a people that were dear to the heart of Paul as he had the

537
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,360
opportunity to minister to them.

538
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:21,380
And he says this in verse number 19 of 1 Thessalonians 2, for what is our hope or joy or crown of

539
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,380
rejoicing?

540
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,380
Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming?

541
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,800
For ye are our glory and joy.

542
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,640
I believe that as we look at this phraseology, this mention of this crown of rejoicing, that

543
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,340
this would be for the individual that was a faithful witness.

544
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:42,240
Some have referred to this as being the soul winner's crown, but we understand this morning

545
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,760
that my job and my duty is not to win somebody to Christ.

546
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,680
My job and my duty is to declare the gospel.

547
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:54,480
And as I declare the gospel, it is a humongous blessing when God gives me the opportunity

548
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,000
to lead somebody to Christ.

549
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,840
And what a joy to be used of God to see someone else trust Christ as their Savior.

550
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,840
Wow!

551
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,560
It's a crown of rejoicing for the faithful witness.

552
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:16,600
James 1 in verse number 12, James 1 in verse number 12, here the crown that is referenced

553
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:21,480
is the crown of life, the crown of life.

554
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,480
James 1 in verse number 12, it says, blessed is the man that endureth temptation, for when

555
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:32,480
he has tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them

556
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,520
that love him.

557
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,080
This crown of life is, again, as you think about a faithful believer, but one that has

558
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,800
endured trials, difficulties.

559
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,440
We've all endured trials, have we not?

560
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,440
Sometimes we don't know the trials that our brothers and sisters have gone through.

561
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,880
We just don't know because they've not voiced them, they've not shared them.

562
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,120
And we don't know the hardship and the difficulty that someone else has dealt with, and we may

563
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,520
think because we don't know specifically what someone else has dealt with or is dealing

564
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,040
with that I'm the only one.

565
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,200
We can get that syndrome.

566
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:15,960
But the reality is that when you think about the Lord Jesus Christ calming the sea when

567
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:21,120
His disciples were out there on the stormy sea, in the passage of Scripture the Bible

568
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,520
says that there were other little ships.

569
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,280
They weren't the only ship on the sea that night.

570
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,000
Amen?

571
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,240
And sometimes people are more open with what their problems and trials and difficulties

572
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,200
are and other times people are not as open.

573
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,700
But we find that here there's the enduring of trials that when He has tried, He shall

574
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:48,800
receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love Him.

575
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,920
Chapter 4, the crown of righteousness.

576
00:37:51,920 --> 00:38:02,240
In 2 Timothy chapter number 4, in verse number 8, Paul of course in this passage of Scripture

577
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:10,040
understanding his departure was at hand, and he speaks to us of this crown of righteousness.

578
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,560
The Bible says this in 2 Timothy 4 and verse number 8, henceforth there is laid up for

579
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,840
me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that

580
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,840
day.

581
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:29,000
And notice this phrase, and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing.

582
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,960
Do you love His appearing?

583
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,100
Are you awaiting anxiously?

584
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,880
Even so come, Lord Jesus, amen?

585
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,400
I'm not looking for the undertaker, I'm looking for the upper taker.

586
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,080
He will not tarry.

587
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:46,560
He is coming, He's coming again, and we must be diligent about the work that God has given

588
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,880
us, and we must serve Him faithfully.

589
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,320
But those that love His appearing, Paul says, listen, it's not just for me that I'm going

590
00:38:53,320 --> 00:39:00,060
to get this crown of rejoicing, but he says that for all them also that love His appearing.

591
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:08,360
The final crown that I see here is in the book of 1 Peter chapter number 5.

592
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:16,840
And this crown, I will say, is a crown that is reserved for someone that is a pastor,

593
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,360
that would be a faithful pastor.

594
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,720
Here in the text of Scripture, in verse number 1, the Bible says, the elders which are among

595
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:28,800
you I exhort, whom also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker

596
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,760
of the glory that shall be revealed, feed the flock of God which is among you, taking

597
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,840
the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly, not for filthy lucre, but

598
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:45,320
of a ready mind, neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being in samples to the

599
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,320
flock.

600
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:53,640
And notice this, and when the chief shepherd shall appear, because he shall appear, ye,

601
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,440
he's speaking to the pastors, to the elders that he's speaking to, ye shall receive a

602
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,320
crown of glory that fadeth not away.

603
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:08,160
In 1 Corinthians 9 and verse number 24, Paul finishes that verse of Scripture by saying,

604
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,660
so run that ye may obtain.

605
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,940
So run that ye may obtain.

606
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:21,200
When I think about these fellow workers that Paul mentions, when I think about as a body

607
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:29,060
of believers, as this local assembly, as fellow workers, as fellow servants, that we recognize,

608
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:36,860
we understand that God has given us a job, a purpose, a ministry, and as we roll up the

609
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:42,540
sleeves and as we engage in the work and as we are fellow workers for the common cause

610
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:47,600
of exalting and magnifying the Lord Jesus Christ and we understand what our role is,

611
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,500
we understand that there's a reward.

612
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,060
And so run that ye may obtain.

613
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:57,020
But understand this morning that you do not obtain so that we, for all of eternity, could

614
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:02,300
look at you and say, look at how wonderful you are and look at the crowns that you have

615
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,060
and look at all that you possess.

616
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,060
No.

617
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:09,280
Turn over to Revelation 4 as we close.

618
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,420
As we close this morning, we understand this reward.

619
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,420
And what a blessing.

620
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:20,220
Listen, we understand this morning that I am what I am, Paul said, by the grace of God.

621
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:24,100
And we are to be good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

622
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:28,760
And I mentioned by way of introduction, it is a privilege to serve the Lord Jesus Christ.

623
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:34,660
We are saved by His amazing grace and then He calls us and He equips us to serve Him

624
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,500
by His grace.

625
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,980
And we are to be good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

626
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:44,260
And as we are and we stay in our lane, so to speak, and we do what God's called us to

627
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:50,820
do and we serve Him and Him only for His honor and for His glory, there are these crowns

628
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:57,420
that can be received so run that you may obtain, but not so that you can be recognized.

629
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:02,780
For in Revelation 4, in verse number 10, the Bible says, the four and twenty elders fall

630
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:07,640
down before Him that sat on the throne and worship Him that liveth forever and ever.

631
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:16,380
Notice what it says, and cast their crowns before the throne saying, Thou art worthy,

632
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:23,060
O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power.

633
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:31,220
For Thou hast created all things and for Thy pleasure they are and were created.

634
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,300
What crown are you going to have?

635
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:40,700
What crown am I going to have to cast at the throne of God?

636
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:45,140
Because not about us, it's not about us.

637
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,500
It's about Him.

638
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,700
Paul says, these are my fellow workers.

639
00:42:50,700 --> 00:43:02,540
There's some people that are God-placed and God-equipped to serve God with me, beside

640
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:05,620
me as a companion in the work.

641
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,620
What a blessing.

642
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:10,700
I am so thankful for fellow workers.

643
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:18,260
I am thankful for the privilege and honor that we have to serve the Lord God Almighty.

644
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:23,060
It is an absolute joy, an absolute privilege.

645
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:30,780
So run that you may obtain, so then we may cast them before the throne.

646
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,780
Let's pray.

647
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,620
Father, we love You.

648
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,020
We thank You for loving us.

649
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:40,140
We thank You for the privilege that You've given us to gather here this morning.

650
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:48,380
We thank You for the testimony that we've heard of these fellow workers.

651
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:57,860
And God, we thank You that we are laborers together with God.

652
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:04,980
Thank You for those that You've assembled here, for the privilege to serve alongside

653
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:08,900
these wonderful people.

654
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,900
It's a great joy, a great blessing.

655
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:18,420
God, I pray that You would help us to singularly keep our focus upon Thee, that we'd exalt

656
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:26,180
and magnify the Lord Jesus Christ in our lives, that we'd fulfill the role that You've given

657
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:36,580
us to fulfill, that God, we would see You do in and through us what only You can do.

658
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:42,500
I pray that we'd run so that we might obtain not a corruptible crown, but an incorruptible

659
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:50,780
crown, so that we might cast them at Your throne.

660
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:55,300
I pray that You'd move and work as only You can.

661
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:59,860
Would You help us to rejoice in the privilege that is ours to serve You?

662
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:07,100
Would You help us to determine to be faithful as we keep our eyes on our Savior?

663
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:10,820
Well, thank You for the work that You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

664
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,820
Would You stand with me?

665
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,940
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

666
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,540
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

667
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,780
As she does, the altar's open.

668
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,780
Maybe you just want to come and thank God for the privilege of serving Him.

669
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,020
What a privilege it is.

670
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,820
Maybe say, I'm not doing a whole lot of serving.

671
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,420
You want to come and ask God to help you to know where to get involved and how to be plugged

672
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:32,420
in.

673
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:38,260
Whatever it is that the Holy Spirit of God may have touched your heart with this morning,

674
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:41,420
I challenge you to respond as Kimberly plays, The Altar is Open.
