1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,940
Genesis chapter number 18, and I hope that you have enjoyed the study here through the

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,940
book of Genesis.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:12,640
It's been a lengthy study, but I believe that it's been encouraging and challenging.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,079
I've certainly enjoyed it.

5
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:20,000
And I do want to mention to you that I was reminded this afternoon by Ms. Brianna.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,120
She says, Daddy, when are you going to preach that message on dinosaurs?

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,340
And some of you might remember that I had mentioned when we were dealing with that portion

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,860
of scripture that I was going to preach a message on dinosaurs.

9
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,220
And then COVID came and kind of put us in all kinds of a twist.

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,259
And I left the series in the book of Genesis for a lengthy period of time and then resumed

11
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:42,740
back to it.

12
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,740
And quite honestly, I'm getting close to your age.

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,979
And so I just kind of forgot about the whole dinosaur study that we were going to do until

14
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:51,819
Brianna reminded me this afternoon.

15
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:54,060
And so we'll get that back on the schedule.

16
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,099
And sometime here in the next couple of Sunday evenings, we'll do that and trust it to be

17
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,099
a blessing to you.

18
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,619
Tonight, we'll be looking here at Genesis 18, verses 1 through 15.

19
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:05,139
A verse of scripture in our text is verse number 14.

20
00:01:05,139 --> 00:01:07,739
I'll just read that verse as we get into the study this evening.

21
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:12,139
It's a very familiar phrase in the first part of this verse of scripture.

22
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:15,220
In fact, it's the phrase that we'll use for the title this evening.

23
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,720
Is anything too hard for the Lord?

24
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,620
At the time appointed, I will return unto thee according to the time of life, and Sarah

25
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,580
shall have a son.

26
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:35,019
I'm sure that you've often heard, maybe you've even said, is anything too hard for the Lord?

27
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:36,580
What a great question.

28
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,819
And as we study through the portion of scripture this evening, I trust that we'd be encouraged

29
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:42,139
and strengthened.

30
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:48,500
We have the privilege as we look here in these first 15 verses of Genesis 18 to really read

31
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,019
about a meeting between the Lord God Almighty, two angels, and Abraham.

32
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:58,660
And as we begin to look at this passage of scripture, we know that the Bible tells us

33
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,260
in verse number two that there were three men that stood by him, but we're also aware

34
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:08,100
of the fact that in verse number 13, it says, and the Lord said unto Abraham.

35
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,500
And so one of the three was the Lord God Jehovah, the Lord God Almighty, that's there with these

36
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,500
other angels.

37
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:21,940
And we find that as Abraham would have this conversation and this encounter, if you will,

38
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,160
that we have the privilege of reading about this meeting.

39
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,259
It's interesting to note that not much time has passed between the conclusion of Genesis

40
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:34,500
17 and the record that we're looking at here this evening.

41
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:41,100
You'll recall with me there in Genesis chapter number 17, that in verse number one, the Bible

42
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,059
said that the Lord appeared.

43
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:48,259
And when Abraham was 90 years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abraham and said unto

44
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:49,259
him.

45
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:54,220
We made note that as you study through, you understand that at the end of Genesis 16,

46
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,699
Abraham is 86 years old.

47
00:02:55,699 --> 00:03:00,580
At the beginning of chapter 17, he's 99 years old, so there's a 13-year gap.

48
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,100
We also find that in chapter 17 in verse number 22 that it says, and he left off talking with

49
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,860
him, and God went up from Abraham.

50
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,779
And so God appeared in the beginning of the chapter, and then God ascends back, and we

51
00:03:12,779 --> 00:03:17,259
find that the Bible then records for us the circumcision that took place at the end of

52
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:23,619
chapter 17, and then we begin chapter number 18 in verse number one, and the Lord appeared

53
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:24,619
unto him.

54
00:03:24,619 --> 00:03:29,320
We, of course, are mindful of the ages that are given in chapter number 17, and then again

55
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,860
repeated in chapter number 18 with regard to Abraham and Sarah.

56
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:39,179
And therefore, we know we can conclude very just certainly, we can have certainty in our

57
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:45,539
conclusion that the timing is not much that has passed here between the two records.

58
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:50,339
Notice with me as we look here at verses one through eight of Genesis 18, if you're

59
00:03:50,339 --> 00:03:54,259
taking notes, the record of Abraham's ministry.

60
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:56,139
The record of Abraham's ministry.

61
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:59,520
I'm going to read these eight verses, and the Bible says this, and the Lord appeared

62
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:06,820
unto him in the plains of Mamre, and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day.

63
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,580
Let me pause here just for a moment, because this is a very typical thing to do in this

64
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,660
region of the world.

65
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:17,980
The Bible tells us, it helps us in verse number one to understand the timing in which this

66
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,059
appearance took place, this meeting, if you will, and we find that the Bible tells us

67
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:27,059
that it was in the heat of the day, and that he, Abraham, sat in the tent door.

68
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,540
This was a common practice.

69
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,880
It was not typical that someone would work or even travel in the heat of the day.

70
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,899
It was common that they would rest, they would have a respite from those things that they

71
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:41,420
were dealing with and attending to throughout the day.

72
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,380
I said to Brother Armando when he got here this evening, did you have a siesta this afternoon?

73
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,140
And he said, no, I was doing taxes.

74
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,859
Ah, man, what a bummer, right?

75
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:52,820
And then he says, Pastor Man, what about you?

76
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,820
Did you have a siesta?

77
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,339
No, I didn't have, I wasn't doing taxes, praise the Lord, but I didn't get a siesta either.

78
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:04,700
But we understand that concept, that idea, and here at the heat of the day, because of

79
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,339
this region of the world and all the things that were going on, he would be in the tent

80
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:14,540
getting some protection, if you will, some relief from the hot sun and all the things

81
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,540
that would take place.

82
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,179
And it was at that time, the Bible says that the Lord appeared unto him, notice verse 2,

83
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:28,660
and he, Abraham, lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him, and when

84
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:37,660
he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground.

85
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:43,540
Again, it would not have been a very common practice for individuals to travel or work

86
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,339
at this particular time.

87
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:50,619
And so Abraham's standing there and he looks out and he sees these three figures, these

88
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:55,779
three men, as the Bible says, and he rose up and he went with haste and he bowed himself

89
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:56,779
toward the ground.

90
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:01,820
It says in verse 3, and said, My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass

91
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,700
not away, I pray thee, from thy servant.

92
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,980
Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under

93
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:14,100
the tree, and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts.

94
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,420
After that ye shall pass on.

95
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,940
For therefore ye come to your servant.

96
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,640
And they said, So do as thou hast said.

97
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,660
And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures

98
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:33,459
of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.

99
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:38,059
And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf, tender and good, and gave it unto

100
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:41,299
a young man, and he hasted to dress it.

101
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:46,220
And he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them.

102
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,200
And he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.

103
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,019
As we would notice the record of Abraham's ministry here in these verses of Scripture,

104
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:59,859
I want to draw your attention to a couple of phrases that are given to us.

105
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:05,220
In verse number two, notice that the Bible says that he ran to meet them.

106
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,859
Notice if you will, in verse number six, again, we find the Bible says that Abraham hastened

107
00:07:10,859 --> 00:07:12,940
into the tent unto Sarah.

108
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,500
And look what he says to her, make ready quickly.

109
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,100
You see the haste, and you find that again in verse number seven, it says, and Abraham

110
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,700
ran unto the herd.

111
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,619
And we find there that it says this, that he hasted to dress it.

112
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:32,420
He gave it to a young man, and he hasted to dress it.

113
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:37,559
In verse number eight, he set it, that which was prepared this meal, before them, these

114
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:39,059
three that have been mentioned.

115
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:44,700
As we begin to think about the record of Abraham's ministry, I wonder this evening how we might

116
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:49,260
describe his service to the Lord and to these two angels.

117
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,980
We find that I would say this of Abraham when I look at these eight verses of Scripture,

118
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,660
and of course we know that Abraham had had conversation with God.

119
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,899
We understand that God has appeared to Abraham on previous occasions, thus Abraham would

120
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:08,579
bow himself toward the ground, and he would address him as saying, my Lord, in verse number

121
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:09,579
three.

122
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:13,820
I want you to consider with me that as we look at these eight verses that I would say

123
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,739
this with regard to the description of Abraham's service.

124
00:08:17,739 --> 00:08:21,019
Number one, he seized the opportunity.

125
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:22,940
He seized the opportunity.

126
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,059
I would say to you, even as God gives us the insight in verse number one with regard

127
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:32,820
to the timing of this meeting, that it was not perhaps from a human perspective the most

128
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:39,659
convenient time to engage in the work that Abraham is doing, right?

129
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,219
It's the heat of the day.

130
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,940
You're going to be running all over the place, and you're running to meet these folks.

131
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,440
You're running over here to the tent.

132
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,419
You're telling Sarah to bake this quickly, but bake bread in the middle of the day?

133
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:58,419
He runs over to get a calf, tender and good, and you find that he seizes the opportunity.

134
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:03,140
Even as we mentioned this morning with Solomon, he did not offer excuses when David had communicated

135
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,320
to him the plan and will of God.

136
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,900
And here we find that Abraham, when we think about the service that he offers and we think

137
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,140
about his ministry, how that he seized the opportunity, the text of Scripture would help

138
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,780
us to see the immediate action that Abraham took, that it was without delay, that as soon

139
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,940
as he saw them, in verse number two, he lift up his eyes and looked, and the Bible says,

140
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,299
and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door.

141
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:32,619
Has there ever been a ministry opportunity that you did not seize and you saw it going,

142
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:37,260
but maybe didn't see it coming, and you were like, man, I wish I would have seized that

143
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,260
opportunity?

144
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:46,059
Someone made this comment with regard to opportunities, often it's easier to see them going than coming.

145
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:50,859
You look back and you're like, oh man, that was a good opportunity, but the opportunity

146
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:53,900
has passed us by, perhaps.

147
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,280
Here we find that Abraham seized the opportunity.

148
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,859
You don't need to turn there, but I want to read to you a passage of Scripture from the

149
00:09:59,859 --> 00:09:59,859


150
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:04,299
of Galatians 6, verses 9 and 10.

151
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:06,059
Notice here what the Apostle Paul says

152
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:08,259
in Galatians 6 to these believers.

153
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:10,419
He says to them this in v. 9,

154
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:14,239
"...and let us not be weary in well-doing.

155
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,299
For in due season, we shall reap

156
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:19,259
if we faint not."

157
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:22,699
You know, it's possible for us to grow weary.

158
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:24,979
Is it really working?

159
00:10:24,979 --> 00:10:27,279
Some of you parents raising kids,

160
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,919
you say, man, are they listening?

161
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,179
Is it getting through?

162
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:31,979
Is it going to work?

163
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:33,499
Don't be weary in well-doing.

164
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,379
Some of you that have been sharing the Gospel.

165
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:36,619
You've been sharing Christ

166
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:37,979
and sharing the Word of God

167
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:40,299
with someone trying to teach them and help them.

168
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:41,739
You say, is it working?

169
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:42,979
God's Word is effective.

170
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:45,419
God's Word works.

171
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:46,699
We say this, it says,

172
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:48,999
"...in due season, we shall reap if we faint not."

173
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:50,339
Notice v. 10,

174
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:54,619
"...as we have therefore opportunity,

175
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:57,179
let us do good unto all men,

176
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:02,199
especially unto them who are of the household of faith."

177
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:05,359
As we have therefore opportunity,

178
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:06,939
let us do good unto all men,

179
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:11,939
especially unto them who are of the household of faith.

180
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:15,079
As I would begin to describe the ministry,

181
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:18,599
the service of Abraham here in Genesis 18,

182
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:19,839
in the first eight verses,

183
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,239
I would say, number one, that he sees the opportunity.

184
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
And we've mentioned this already,

185
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,639
he served with haste.

186
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,939
He served with haste.

187
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:30,979
We find that he included others.

188
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:33,079
It was D.L. Moody, I believe, that said,

189
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:34,799
I'd rather have ten men working

190
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:39,019
than do the work of ten men.

191
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:41,619
Not only is that a good practice

192
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:44,179
to preserve some of your own energy maybe

193
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:46,419
and be able to serve for a longer period of time,

194
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:48,319
but the reality is that we are to be

195
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:50,139
co-laborers with Christ

196
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:52,019
and we're supposed to encourage others

197
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:55,059
to serve and get involved in the ministry.

198
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:57,079
We find that here in the text of Scripture,

199
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:58,999
the Bible would tell us that he goes in

200
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:01,459
and he calls Sarah in v. 6

201
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:02,919
and says, make ready quickly

202
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,559
three measures of fine meal.

203
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,459
Knead it and make cakes upon the earth.

204
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,379
In v. 7, there's a young man,

205
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:10,219
an unnamed young man,

206
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:12,819
that is getting involved in the service

207
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:14,359
of this ministry,

208
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,159
of these things that are taking place.

209
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,479
I believe that he served with grace.

210
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:22,199
I believe that here as we look

211
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,619
at the passage of Scripture,

212
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:24,759
it's very interesting

213
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,119
that the Bible tells us that he says this

214
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:31,279
with regard to this thought of ministry

215
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,419
that he offered his best.

216
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:36,599
Someone said this, don't give God what's left,

217
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:39,019
give God what's right.

218
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:41,339
I think it's a cute little saying.

219
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,519
But the reality is that he deserves our best,

220
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,579
does he not?

221
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:47,419
And we find here in the text of Scripture,

222
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:49,699
notice the perspective of Abraham.

223
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:52,319
He says, let a little water

224
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:53,619
in v. 4.

225
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:54,899
In v. 5, he says,

226
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,259
I will fetch a morsel of bread.

227
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:00,039
It's almost as if he's presenting it

228
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:02,879
as if it's an insignificant offering,

229
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,919
but yet we find that the text of Scripture

230
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,359
tells us in v. 6

231
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:08,559
that when he goes and he speaks to Sarah,

232
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,819
he says this,

233
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:12,619
make ready quickly three measures,

234
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:16,759
notice, of fine meal.

235
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:19,779
Notice in v. 7 when he's going to get this,

236
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:22,019
he ran unto the herd and fetched a calf

237
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:25,499
tender and good.

238
00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:27,299
He wasn't going to go and offer something

239
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:30,419
that wasn't the best that he could offer.

240
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:32,339
And I think that's noteworthy.

241
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,579
I think that when we look at these eight verses

242
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:37,699
of Scripture and consider the ministry

243
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:41,579
of Abraham and his service here in this passage,

244
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,059
I believe there's some things

245
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:44,619
that we look at and we notice

246
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:46,939
and we describe with regard to his ministry,

247
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:49,099
and we say these are good things.

248
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:51,459
You know, it's interesting over in the book of Malachi,

249
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,979
if you want to turn there in Malachi,

250
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:56,259
you'll find just before Matthew,

251
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:59,099
and so go over to Malachi 1 if you will,

252
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:02,379
and notice here what the Bible is saying

253
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:04,819
with regard to the sacrifices

254
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:07,219
that these individuals were offering.

255
00:14:08,099 --> 00:14:12,859
The Bible tells us in 1 in v. 6,

256
00:14:12,859 --> 00:14:16,339
a son honoreth his father and a servant his master.

257
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:19,259
If then I be a father, where is mine honor?

258
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:21,539
And if I be a master, where is my fear?

259
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:23,579
Sayeth the Lord of hosts unto you,

260
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,539
O priest that despise my name.

261
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:28,179
And you say, wherein have we despised thy name?

262
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:31,419
Ye offered polluted bread upon mine altar.

263
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:33,219
And you say, wherein have we polluted thee?

264
00:14:33,219 --> 00:14:36,339
And that ye say, the table of the Lord is contemptible.

265
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:40,299
Verse 8, if ye offer the blind for sacrifice,

266
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:42,179
is it not evil?

267
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:45,579
And if you offer the lame and sick, is it not evil?

268
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:48,019
Notice what he says in verse number 8 at the end.

269
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:52,619
Offer it now unto thy governor.

270
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:55,459
Will he be pleased with thee?

271
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:58,059
Or accept thy person?

272
00:14:58,059 --> 00:14:59,500
Sayeth the Lord of hosts.

273
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,539
Now that's a probing question.

274
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:03,659
And he's putting it right to it.

275
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:05,379
Listen, you're bringing these offerings to me.

276
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:09,179
I'm the Lord God Almighty, the Lord of hosts,

277
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:11,299
and you're bringing these offerings to me,

278
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:13,779
but you wouldn't even take them to your governor.

279
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:16,539
That's not Abraham.

280
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,139
He says, I'm gonna bring my best.

281
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:23,459
Sir, I know it's the middle of the day, it's hot.

282
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,579
It's not the time when you normally would bake bread,

283
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:28,539
but I need you to bake some bread.

284
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:31,299
In verse number six,

285
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:34,659
knead it and make cakes upon the hearth.

286
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:38,579
Most of us, most of you, I know I haven't,

287
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:40,619
have not made bread in this fashion.

288
00:15:42,979 --> 00:15:44,059
He says, use some fine milk.

289
00:15:44,219 --> 00:15:45,739
Let's not use, but Abraham,

290
00:15:45,739 --> 00:15:47,819
we have some bread left over from yesterday.

291
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:48,819
That ain't gonna do.

292
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:52,819
There's no record that she said that,

293
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:55,299
but you understand what I'm saying.

294
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:57,500
His offering is vast.

295
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,299
I think it's noteworthy.

296
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:01,099
We notice in this text of Scripture

297
00:16:01,099 --> 00:16:02,979
the record of Abraham's ministry.

298
00:16:04,219 --> 00:16:06,979
I find that as we continue to look at this passage,

299
00:16:06,979 --> 00:16:09,859
there are really two reminders that are given to us.

300
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:12,899
In verses nine, really verses eight through 13,

301
00:16:12,979 --> 00:16:15,059
and then also it's mentioned in verse number 15,

302
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:18,139
we find the reminder of God's promise.

303
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:20,779
I'm so thankful for the promises of God.

304
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,579
This morning, one of the songs that we sang,

305
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:24,859
in fact, it was the first song that we sang this morning,

306
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,659
Standing on the Promises.

307
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:29,659
Often when we sing that song,

308
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:33,299
my mind will kind of go and think about

309
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:36,099
some of the promises in the Word of God.

310
00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:38,579
In fact, there are times in which, not often,

311
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:41,259
but occasionally, I've come to this pulpit

312
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:43,779
after we've finished singing that song,

313
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:46,459
and I've said, would you share a promise with me?

314
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:48,500
What's a promise from the Word of God

315
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,500
that would encourage you and strengthen you?

316
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,419
Oh, I'm so thankful for the promises of God.

317
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:55,699
And here, in verses nine through 13,

318
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:58,659
we find that Abraham is going to be reminded

319
00:16:58,659 --> 00:16:59,739
of God's promise.

320
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:02,099
Notice what the Bible says in verse number nine.

321
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:03,259
And they said unto him,

322
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:05,779
so they were eating there in verse number eight,

323
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:07,699
they finished up and they did eat,

324
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:10,539
and Abraham stood by them under the tree.

325
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:12,299
And they say unto him,

326
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,539
where is Sarah thy wife?

327
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:20,979
And he said, behold, in the tent.

328
00:17:20,979 --> 00:17:22,419
Notice verse number 10, he said,

329
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:26,500
I will certainly return unto thee

330
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,379
according to the time of life.

331
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:34,379
And lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.

332
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:39,139
Sarah heard it in the tent door,

333
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:41,699
which was behind him.

334
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:44,419
Would you consider this reminder here in verse number 10

335
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:47,219
and think about the words that are used.

336
00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:51,539
He says, I will certainly return unto thee.

337
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:52,739
I mean, he could have simply said,

338
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:53,779
I will return unto thee,

339
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:54,979
and that would have been good enough.

340
00:17:54,979 --> 00:17:57,059
But you think about the use of that word

341
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,099
and helping us understand, listen,

342
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:00,859
this is God that's speaking

343
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:04,139
and He's reminding Abraham of His promise.

344
00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:07,379
And He says, I will certainly return unto thee.

345
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:10,500
Again, we find that it says according to the time of life.

346
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,219
Remember, it was in chapter number 17.

347
00:18:13,219 --> 00:18:15,579
And then again here, repeated in chapter number 18,

348
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:19,179
then Abraham and Sarah finally get an actual time

349
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:21,139
with regard to the promise.

350
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:23,419
They'd waited for 24 years

351
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:26,339
from the time in which God had first given them the promise

352
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:29,339
with regard to a son, with regard to the seed.

353
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:32,380
And we find that now in chapter number 17,

354
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,459
we find that He said in verse number 21,

355
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:37,820
that Sarah, which Sarah shall bear unto thee

356
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,739
at this set time in the next year.

357
00:18:40,739 --> 00:18:42,539
They now had a definite time.

358
00:18:44,219 --> 00:18:47,019
And here in chapter number 18 in verse number 10,

359
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:48,899
I will certainly return unto thee

360
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:51,099
according to the time of life.

361
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:52,579
And lo, notice what it says,

362
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:57,339
Sarah thy wife shall have a son.

363
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:59,099
This is a definite promise of God.

364
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:03,700
A promise that had been repeated often.

365
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,700
A promise, no doubt, that had been challenging to accept.

366
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:10,979
Remember, it was Abraham that offered

367
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:15,739
the explanation to God in chapter number 15

368
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,739
when he said, behold, to me thou hast given no seed.

369
00:19:18,739 --> 00:19:21,140
And lo, one born in mine house is mine heir.

370
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,459
And God said, no, it's not gonna be that way.

371
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:26,899
And then it's in our passage that we studied last week

372
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:30,260
in chapter 17 that when God says

373
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,380
and repeats this promise that Abraham says,

374
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:35,579
oh, that Ishmael might live before thee.

375
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:39,380
Of course, we understand that this reminder

376
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,659
is given here in chapter number 18.

377
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:45,979
And he's speaking with these terms, these definite terms.

378
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:49,700
It's similar to how he had responded to Abraham

379
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,739
in chapter number 17 when Abraham pled with God

380
00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:54,339
that Ishmael might live before thee.

381
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:55,779
Remember, if you see there,

382
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:57,619
perhaps on the same page of your Bible

383
00:19:57,619 --> 00:19:59,899
in verse number 19 of chapter 17,

384
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:07,939
God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed.

385
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:13,339
He says here, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life.

386
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:20,379
I'm thankful that God would remind us of His promises, how precious that is.

387
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:25,339
You know, the reality is that there are times in which we sing songs, and as we sing songs

388
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:29,179
we are reminded of the very promises of God.

389
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:34,459
Sometimes it's a promise that we wouldn't say that we forgot, as in it was nowhere within

390
00:20:34,459 --> 00:20:41,259
our mind, but maybe a promise that we've just not simply been very aware of, not been in

391
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:47,059
the forefront of our mind, of our memory, and yet we sing that song and man, we're encouraged

392
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:50,459
by being reminded of the promise.

393
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:54,979
Maybe someone just makes a statement to you with regard to a promise that God has given

394
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:55,979
His Word.

395
00:20:55,979 --> 00:20:58,579
Maybe you're in the midst of preaching and teaching the Word of God, and you're reminded

396
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:00,379
of a promise of the Word of God.

397
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:05,619
Maybe in your own personal devotions as you're reading the Word of God, you read this morning

398
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:11,699
and you read a promise, and your heart was encouraged.

399
00:21:11,699 --> 00:21:15,939
See here, God's reminding Abraham of His promise.

400
00:21:15,939 --> 00:21:20,579
It's interesting that the question is asked in verse number 9, where is Sarah thy wife?

401
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:25,539
And in verse number 10, it tells us that Sarah heard it in the tent door.

402
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:29,139
She heard what was said to Abraham.

403
00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:34,099
Verse number 11 is given to us as a statement of fact, if you will, from human perspective.

404
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:37,579
It says, now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age, and it ceased to be

405
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:41,139
with Sarah after the manner of women.

406
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:46,619
Again, this would be from a human perspective with regard to their abilities, and it's a

407
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:50,979
statement of fact that is given to us of that perspective.

408
00:21:50,979 --> 00:21:58,059
I would say this, that we always have to keep in mind that God is able to do all things,

409
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:02,419
even as the question would be asked, and we've used it as our title this evening, is anything

410
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:05,419
too hard for the Lord?

411
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:09,379
But I want you to notice the response of Sarah here when this reminder of God's promise is

412
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:10,939
given to Abraham.

413
00:22:10,939 --> 00:22:16,979
In verse number 12, the Bible tells us about the response of Sarah, and it says this, therefore

414
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:22,059
Sarah laughed within herself.

415
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:23,979
She laughed within herself.

416
00:22:23,979 --> 00:22:30,259
This seems to be an expression in which it is not stating that she laughed outwardly,

417
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:34,379
that Abraham would have heard this, but it was an internal laughter.

418
00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:38,899
And we find, however, that the Lord knows about the laughter even though it was internal

419
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,939
because He knows all things.

420
00:22:40,939 --> 00:22:46,459
And here we find, the Bible says that she laughed within herself saying, after I am

421
00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:54,659
waxed old, shall I have pleasure, my Lord being old also?

422
00:22:54,659 --> 00:23:01,499
So we see her response, a response of laughter and of doubt with regard to this promise that

423
00:23:01,499 --> 00:23:06,259
has been restated, this promise that has been given.

424
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:11,679
As we think about the response of Sarah in verse number 12, we are mindful of the inquiry

425
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,339
of God in verse number 13.

426
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:27,219
The Bible says, and the Lord, the Lord said unto Abraham, wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying,

427
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:32,579
shall I of a surety bear a child which am old?

428
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:38,739
Has it ever occurred to you in verse number 13 that God knew that Sarah laughed, but God

429
00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:43,579
didn't ask Sarah why she laughed?

430
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:45,499
God asked Abraham why she laughed.

431
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:50,259
You ever wonder about that?

432
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:51,259
I don't know.

433
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:52,259
Ask her.

434
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:54,759
Maybe that's what you'd say.

435
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:58,579
I don't know what goes through their mind.

436
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:01,619
Some of y'all are about to get in trouble with agreeing with me, amen?

437
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:05,459
You understand what I'm saying?

438
00:24:05,459 --> 00:24:08,099
Be careful, be careful, amen?

439
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:10,619
But you understand what I'm saying?

440
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:11,619
You're asking me?

441
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:14,019
She's right there, man, call her out.

442
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,019
I don't know.

443
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:19,619
I didn't even know she laughed, right?

444
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:22,739
Because she laughed within herself.

445
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:28,379
Why is it that God asks Abraham?

446
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:33,859
I'm not going to be extremely dogmatic here, but this is my understanding as I've studied

447
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:37,299
the Scriptures, and let me preface it by saying this.

448
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:43,899
In Romans chapter number 4, the Bible tells us about Abraham, it tells us really a lot

449
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:48,099
about Abraham in the entire passage, but in verse number 18 of Romans 4, it says,

450
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:52,719
Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according

451
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:56,719
to that which was spoken, so shall thy seed be.

452
00:24:56,719 --> 00:25:01,159
And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about

453
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:04,799
a hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb.

454
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,799
He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving

455
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,159
glory to God.

456
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:18,079
And being fully persuaded that which he had promised, he was able also to perform.

457
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:25,599
I don't believe that these verses of Scripture describe Abraham his whole life.

458
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:32,639
I believe that these verses of Scripture describe Abraham after Genesis 17, verse 18.

459
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:37,799
Because in Genesis 17 and verse number 18, it was the second time in which Abraham responds

460
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:41,759
to the promise that God gives with an alternative.

461
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,719
The alternative that was given in chapter number 14, excuse me, in chapter number 15

462
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:50,319
is the one that was born in his house, is mine heir.

463
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:55,959
The alternative that is given in chapter number 17 in verse number 18 is Ishmael.

464
00:25:55,959 --> 00:26:03,239
But at that point, God graciously, once again, reconfirms for Abraham this that he is going

465
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:04,639
to do.

466
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:11,399
And we find that it was in verse number 19 of Genesis 17 that God said, Sarah thy wife

467
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:13,699
shall bear thee a son indeed.

468
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:18,699
Thou shalt call his name Isaac, and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting

469
00:26:18,699 --> 00:26:21,059
covenant with his seed after him.

470
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,339
And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee.

471
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:28,219
Behold, I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly.

472
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:31,499
Twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.

473
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:33,219
I preached on this last week.

474
00:26:33,219 --> 00:26:41,339
Verse 21, but my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee

475
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:46,219
at this set time in the next year.

476
00:26:46,219 --> 00:26:51,419
And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.

477
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:57,259
You remember Abraham's response in verse 23, in that self same day?

478
00:26:57,259 --> 00:27:02,619
He went and did what God had commanded him to do, that token of the covenant, the circumcision.

479
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:08,299
And I believe from this very moment that Abraham wavered not.

480
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:12,679
He no longer is going to offer an alternative to God with regard to the plan.

481
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:16,539
He hears as God says, I will do this.

482
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:21,419
Remember it was in chapter 17 and verse number 1 that God introduces himself to Abraham as

483
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:28,659
being El Shaddai, the Lord God Almighty, and he says, this is what I'm going to do.

484
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:34,379
Sarah does not seem, as you read chapter number 17, to be privy to the promise that is given

485
00:27:34,379 --> 00:27:38,179
to Abraham in this passage of Scripture that's being repeated.

486
00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:43,779
But we find here in chapter number 18 that she hears and she laughs.

487
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:48,539
And God says, Abraham, why did Sarah laugh?

488
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:51,679
You know why I think God asked Abraham and not Sarah?

489
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,979
Because Abraham was accountable as the leader of his home to communicate to his wife what

490
00:27:56,979 --> 00:28:00,699
God had promised.

491
00:28:00,699 --> 00:28:07,319
So all you guys that were, now it comes back at you, amen?

492
00:28:07,459 --> 00:28:13,519
God has designed the home, and he's designed structure in the home, and God communicated

493
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:21,319
this truth to Abraham, and Abraham responded, his actions, the circumcision at the end of

494
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:30,279
chapter number 17 revealed to us his belief, his faith, in what God said would happen.

495
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:36,119
Abraham can't make Sarah believe the promise, but it was his responsibility to communicate

496
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,119
the promise.

497
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:39,879
Abraham, why did Sarah laugh?

498
00:28:39,879 --> 00:28:45,399
Do you remember when God gave the truth in Luke chapter number 1 with regard to the birth

499
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:51,679
of John the Baptist, and as you look through the passage of Scripture, you find that Elizabeth

500
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:57,679
would now deliver, and of course, Zacharias was the one that was ministering in there

501
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,759
and doing the ministry that he had been called to do, and as he had received the vision and

502
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:07,039
told that they would have a son, that the angel said to him that his name shall be called

503
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,039
John.

504
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:12,279
But then Zacharias, he's kind of like, how am I sure that this is going to be?

505
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:19,239
And so he couldn't talk for the duration of the pregnancy until John was born, right?

506
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:23,639
I don't have time to read all of it, but that's kind of the way it happens there.

507
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:29,279
And so when John the Baptist is born, they want to know what's his name going to be.

508
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,279
What does Elizabeth say?

509
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,759
His name should be called John.

510
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:35,439
Is there opposition to that?

511
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:36,439
Yeah.

512
00:29:36,439 --> 00:29:38,439
It's not in the family name.

513
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:42,399
Where are you getting John from?

514
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:48,639
Somehow Zacharias had communicated to Elizabeth what God had given him as a promise and as

515
00:29:48,639 --> 00:29:51,639
what that son's name should be called.

516
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:54,319
And Zacharias was faithful to communicate that to his wife.

517
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:56,399
Obviously, he wasn't able to verbally communicate.

518
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,159
He had to write it down, whatever.

519
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,159
And then, of course, they call him in.

520
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:06,039
and what does he write down? His name shall be called John. See, this evening we

521
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:11,599
find that here in the text of Scripture that maybe it's not specifically the

522
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:17,919
laughter in which God is questioning, but Abraham's lack of fulfilling the

523
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:24,959
communication of God's promise to his wife. Hey Abraham, I've given you a

524
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:32,999
promise and you believed me. Why is Sarah laughing about this? I want you to

525
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:35,759
think about that perspective just for a moment and the seriousness of that

526
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:41,039
perspective and helping us to understand this evening the responsibility that God

527
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:48,079
has placed upon the the spiritual leader in the home. If you're married and you

528
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,799
have children, the husband is the spiritual leader of the home. That's not

529
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:55,559
to say that the wife is not important or some second-class citizen or any of

530
00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:01,079
that sort of thing, but it's a structure in which God has designed order in the

531
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:08,599
home. And by the way, when God's plan is worked out the way that it's supposed to

532
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:16,239
be, we can have God's blessing. We find here in the text of Scripture that God's

533
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:26,279
inquiry is to Abraham, not to Sarah. Abraham, wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying,

534
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:35,759
Shall I of a surety bear a child which am old? Didn't you tell her? Did you

535
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,879
communicate this with her? You understand what I'm saying? And this evening we find

536
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:45,679
that God is speaking to Abraham. We know that Sarah then denies it in verse 15,

537
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:52,799
Then Sarah denied, saying, I laugh not. Why did she say that? Well, it says that she

538
00:31:52,799 --> 00:32:01,919
was afraid. He said, Nay, but thou didst laugh. God knew that she laughed. You

539
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,679
can't hide anything from God. Sometimes we try. You might be able to hide

540
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,319
something from someone. Maybe you can hide something from your parents, young

541
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:17,439
people. Maybe you can hide some things from your parents. You might be able to hide

542
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:22,119
something from a spouse, from an employer, but you can't hide anything from God. He

543
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:26,199
knows all about it. You remember what happened with Adam and Eve when they

544
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:34,039
tried to hide? God knew where they were. They tried to hide. He that covereth his

545
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:41,879
transgression shall not prosper. You're not going to change that. That's just the way

546
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:50,279
it is. But he that confesseth and forsaketh, we're going to find mercy and grace. Amen?

547
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:53,639
And we have that forgiveness this Wednesday night as we continue through the passage in

548
00:32:53,639 --> 00:33:01,959
Luke 11 about the model prayer, if you will. Forgive us our sins. Oh, I'm so thankful

549
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:09,319
that we have a God who's ready to pardon, that He forgives. She tried to hide this.

550
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:20,519
She denied it. But God says, nay, but thou didst laugh. He knows. We notice here that

551
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:26,759
there's a reminder of the promise of God. Within that reminder, there's some response

552
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:32,959
and some inquiry. And I believe that as we look at the passage, we see that it's as if

553
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:39,839
Sarah believed the circumstances from a human perspective more than the promise. And she's

554
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:45,359
not understanding here. It's not been communicated, perhaps. And as we look at the passage,

555
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:53,759
we're reminded of God's grace, reminded of God's kindness and reminding and giving this promise.

556
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:58,719
But there's another reminder here. Not only do we recognize and consider, really, the record

557
00:33:58,719 --> 00:34:04,159
of Abraham's ministry, we see the reminder of God's promise, and then we see the reminder

558
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:16,239
of God's power. In verse number 14, God says, is anything too hard for the Lord?

559
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:27,919
I like it when God uses absolutes. God uses absolutes. Is anything too hard for the Lord?

560
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:33,119
Well, I got this one thing. No, the answer is no. Amen? The reality is that this is a

561
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:41,359
probing and proving question that really does not need to be answered by Abraham. Why?

562
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:46,799
Because I believe it is clearly understood what is being communicated.

563
00:34:46,799 --> 00:34:55,199
Remember, God has revealed who He is to Abraham. It was in Genesis 14 and verse 22 that He says

564
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:01,519
that He is the Most High God, El Elyon. It's in Genesis 17 and verse number 1 that God reveals

565
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:09,839
that He is the Lord God Almighty, El Shaddai. And as the Most High God, as the Lord God Almighty,

566
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:16,319
He says to Abraham, is anything too hard for the Lord? It doesn't even deserve an answer.

567
00:35:16,319 --> 00:35:25,119
Because what's being communicated to Abraham and to Sarah is that there is nothing too hard for God.

568
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:35,919
Nothing. Nothing is impossible with God. You say, well, I'm not sure of that.

569
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:46,319
I hope that the Word of God, as God tells us His Word gives us faith, that you would get into the

570
00:35:46,319 --> 00:35:52,479
Word of God, allow the Word of God to get into you, to grow your faith, to understand there's

571
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:59,999
nothing, there's not one thing that's too hard for God. He knows all about it and He's able to

572
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:07,999
overcome all of it. You say, well, I had this situation and God didn't do this or that.

573
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:14,959
It doesn't mean that He couldn't. It's that He had a purpose for it and through it.

574
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:21,359
If you've been here for any length of time, you've heard me say often this statement.

575
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:30,399
God is able to deliver you from everything, but sometimes He wants to develop you through something.

576
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:37,039
And if you'd be honest and I'd be honest, we'd rather be delivered from than developed through.

577
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:41,599
Because being delivered from is a whole lot easier than being developed through.

578
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:49,279
Right? But man, during those times of being developed and strengthened,

579
00:36:49,279 --> 00:36:52,959
learning who God is and what He's able to do.

580
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:56,879
Man, those are some of the most precious times in your walk with God.

581
00:36:56,879 --> 00:37:01,919
To see that He is faithful, that He is able.

582
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:11,519
Job 9, in verse number 4, Job is responding to one of his quote-unquote friends.

583
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:16,639
And Job says this at the first part of Job 9, in verse number 4, speaking of God.

584
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:23,119
He is wise in heart and mighty in strength.

585
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:31,039
No doubt within this single verse of Scripture, this really half a verse of Scripture,

586
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:35,519
the omniscience and omnipotence of God is in full view.

587
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:40,799
I'm so thankful that our God is wise in heart and mighty in strength.

588
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:45,119
A number of years ago, I taught from this passage of Scripture in Sunday school.

589
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:51,199
And I made this statement as I taught from that lesson.

590
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:55,119
Wouldn't it be a shame if He was only wise in heart?

591
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,359
He knew what had to be done, but didn't have the power to do it.

592
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,639
Or if He had the power, the might, but not the wisdom.

593
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:10,959
But our God is omniscient and omnipotent.

594
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,039
No doubt there are times in your life when you faced a dilemma, a difficulty,

595
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:18,319
and perhaps you just did not know what to do.

596
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:22,319
You felt that physically you had the strength to be able to accomplish the task,

597
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:23,599
but I don't know where to start.

598
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:24,559
I don't even know what to do.

599
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,879
And then other times, as some have shared with me as they've grown older and more mature,

600
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,719
the senior saints, if you will, have said,

601
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:39,679
I know how to do it, I just don't have the strength to do it anymore.

602
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:46,319
Our God is omniscient and omnipotent.

603
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:52,079
And here, God is going to remind Abraham and Sarah not only of the promise,

604
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,639
but of the power of God Almighty.

605
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:00,879
In Jeremiah chapter 32, we're out of time, but it's okay.

606
00:39:00,879 --> 00:39:01,839
Anyone in a hurry?

607
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,199
He wouldn't tell me anyway, I hope.

608
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:09,440
In Jeremiah 32, God tells Jeremiah to buy a field.

609
00:39:10,399 --> 00:39:15,679
After he's already told Jeremiah that the land is going to be taken captive by the Babylonians,

610
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:17,119
they've already sieged the city.

611
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,239
God says, buy the field.

612
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:26,479
As Jeremiah is dealing with this which is taking place,

613
00:39:26,479 --> 00:39:30,239
God gives him the promise of the remnant that would return.

614
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:32,479
And then Jeremiah prays.

615
00:39:32,479 --> 00:39:36,079
And in verse number 17 of Jeremiah 32, Jeremiah says,

616
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:43,119
Ah, Lord God, behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth

617
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:52,399
by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee.

618
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,079
Oh, I like the understanding of Jeremiah here in this passage.

619
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,000
I don't understand how it's going to happen.

620
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
happen.

621
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,559
I can see the Babylonians.

622
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:08,760
I know that you've told us, I mean, I've been preaching about this destruction that's coming.

623
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:15,880
But God, you've made the heavens and the earth by your great power, your stretched-out arm.

624
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:21,159
Remember, in Genesis 1, we read the record of creation.

625
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:24,120
God said, and it was so.

626
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,760
And He made the stars also.

627
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,360
Powerful statement of Scripture.

628
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:32,040
You can read in the accounts in the book of Psalms.

629
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,880
He commanded, and it was done.

630
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,880
The power of our God.

631
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,840
He's the creator of the universe.

632
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:44,799
By the way, His creation, apart from mankind, obeys Him.

633
00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:48,479
I've mentioned before, I'm sure that Jonah in his disobedience was certainly thankful

634
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:52,439
that the great fish obeyed God.

635
00:40:52,439 --> 00:40:54,639
Think about that for a little while.

636
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:57,680
That great fish would have swam the other way the way that Jonah went the other way.

637
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:04,440
Jonah would be not preaching anything about it, right?

638
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,599
But what did the great fish do?

639
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,080
He spewed them out when God spoke to them and told them to do it.

640
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,599
What did the wind and waves do?

641
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:11,599
They obeyed.

642
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,599
Peace.

643
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:13,599
Be still.

644
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:22,000
Luke 1.37, we're familiar, I mentioned a moment ago about that passage of Scripture with Zacharias

645
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:24,680
and a very simple verse of Scripture.

646
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:31,000
For with God, nothing shall be impossible.

647
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:42,639
Back in Genesis 18, when God reminds Abraham of His power after He reminds him of His promise,

648
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:46,400
He asks the question that does not deserve an answer.

649
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,120
Is anything too hard for the Lord?

650
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,620
And then He says this again.

651
00:41:51,620 --> 00:42:00,779
At the time appointed, I will return unto thee according to the time of life, and Sarah

652
00:42:00,779 --> 00:42:04,779
shall have a son.

653
00:42:04,779 --> 00:42:08,979
This evening we read about Abraham.

654
00:42:08,979 --> 00:42:12,619
I wonder about our ministry, our service to God.

655
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:19,179
As we read in those first eight verses, how is it perhaps this evening that you would

656
00:42:19,179 --> 00:42:22,419
describe your service to God?

657
00:42:22,419 --> 00:42:27,539
Would any of the statements that we've made about Abraham's service to God, his ministry,

658
00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:31,660
would any of those things be said of our service, of our ministry to God?

659
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:36,660
How would we describe our ministry to God?

660
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:41,020
As we continue through the Scriptures, through the passage, I wonder tonight, how many of

661
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:44,419
us need to be reminded of some of God's promises?

662
00:42:44,419 --> 00:42:47,380
How many of us need to be reminded of God's power?

663
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:51,339
Man, we serve the God, the Lord God omnipotent.

664
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:52,339
He reigns.

665
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:54,619
You say, pastor, you keep saying that.

666
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:56,660
Do you not see what's going on in the world?

667
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,820
God's in control.

668
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,419
I don't know.

669
00:43:00,419 --> 00:43:01,419
Trust me.

670
00:43:01,419 --> 00:43:04,259
Read this book more than you watch the news.

671
00:43:04,259 --> 00:43:09,580
Brother Kevin sent me a text this week and said, preacher, I think your ratio of one

672
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:10,820
to four needs to be upped.

673
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,660
It needs to be like one to eight.

674
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,860
I think that's what you said in the text.

675
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,860
You need to get in the Word of God.

676
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:20,339
As you get in the Word of God, you say, man, our God's able.

677
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:21,539
He's never failed.

678
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:23,419
He's never going to.

679
00:43:23,419 --> 00:43:24,699
He rules and he reigns.

680
00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:31,619
We might just need to be reminded this evening of the promises of God, of the power of God.

681
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:33,380
Think about that sweet promise.

682
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:38,259
I will come again.

683
00:43:38,259 --> 00:43:41,460
He says to Abraham, I'm going to come at the appointed time, and Sarah's going to have

684
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,460
a son.

685
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,539
You know that God's going to come at the appointed time for us?

686
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,220
He's going to take us to heaven.

687
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,020
The coming of the Lord draweth nigh.

688
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,020
He's not going to be late.

689
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,660
He's not going to be early either.

690
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,860
He's going to be right on time.

691
00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:02,139
Even so, come, Lord Jesus, is what John says at the end of the book of Revelation.

692
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,860
I'm so thankful for the many promises, and maybe that's not the promise you need to be

693
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,139
reminded of, but maybe there's some others.

694
00:44:08,139 --> 00:44:11,020
The power of God.

695
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,020
Let's pray.

696
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,360
Father, we love You.

697
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,760
We thank You for the privilege that You would give us to serve You.

698
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,880
I pray that as we would evaluate our service, our ministry to You, that we would be honest

699
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,679
in our evaluation.

700
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,880
Perhaps some of the same things that have been said about Abraham, that have been observed

701
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:34,959
in these first eight verses, perhaps would describe our ministry and service as well.

702
00:44:34,959 --> 00:44:38,839
Then we think about the reminders.

703
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:51,200
Oh, how we're so prone to forget, to maybe lose sight and perspective because of the

704
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,239
circumstances and adversities that we face.

705
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:57,019
We thank You for Your promises.

706
00:44:57,019 --> 00:44:59,040
We thank You for Your power.

707
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,119
It's my prayer that You'd help someone tonight.

708
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:06,200
Help many tonight.

709
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:12,640
Lord, I think about the songs that we sang, though the message this evening was not specifically

710
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,720
about salvation.

711
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,839
We sure did sing about it, rejoicing in it.

712
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:20,799
Maybe there's someone that needs to be saved.

713
00:45:20,799 --> 00:45:29,640
Lord, I pray that You'd move and work, that You'd be glorified in this time of invitation.

714
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,040
For it's in Christ's name we pray.
