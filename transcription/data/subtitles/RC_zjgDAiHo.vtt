00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
Genesis chapter number 18, and I hope that you have enjoyed the study here through the

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.940
book of Genesis.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.640
It's been a lengthy study, but I believe that it's been encouraging and challenging.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.079
I've certainly enjoyed it.

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:20.000
And I do want to mention to you that I was reminded this afternoon by Ms. Brianna.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.120
She says, Daddy, when are you going to preach that message on dinosaurs?

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.340
And some of you might remember that I had mentioned when we were dealing with that portion

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.860
of scripture that I was going to preach a message on dinosaurs.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.220
And then COVID came and kind of put us in all kinds of a twist.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.259
And I left the series in the book of Genesis for a lengthy period of time and then resumed

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:42.740
back to it.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.740
And quite honestly, I'm getting close to your age.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.979
And so I just kind of forgot about the whole dinosaur study that we were going to do until

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:51.819
Brianna reminded me this afternoon.

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:54.060
And so we'll get that back on the schedule.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.099
And sometime here in the next couple of Sunday evenings, we'll do that and trust it to be

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:59.099
a blessing to you.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.619
Tonight, we'll be looking here at Genesis 18, verses 1 through 15.

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:05.139
A verse of scripture in our text is verse number 14.

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:07.739
I'll just read that verse as we get into the study this evening.

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:12.139
It's a very familiar phrase in the first part of this verse of scripture.

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:15.220
In fact, it's the phrase that we'll use for the title this evening.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.720
Is anything too hard for the Lord?

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.620
At the time appointed, I will return unto thee according to the time of life, and Sarah

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.580
shall have a son.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:35.019
I'm sure that you've often heard, maybe you've even said, is anything too hard for the Lord?

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:36.580
What a great question.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.819
And as we study through the portion of scripture this evening, I trust that we'd be encouraged

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:42.139
and strengthened.

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:48.500
We have the privilege as we look here in these first 15 verses of Genesis 18 to really read

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.019
about a meeting between the Lord God Almighty, two angels, and Abraham.

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:58.660
And as we begin to look at this passage of scripture, we know that the Bible tells us

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.260
in verse number two that there were three men that stood by him, but we're also aware

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.100
of the fact that in verse number 13, it says, and the Lord said unto Abraham.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.500
And so one of the three was the Lord God Jehovah, the Lord God Almighty, that's there with these

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.500
other angels.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.940
And we find that as Abraham would have this conversation and this encounter, if you will,

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.160
that we have the privilege of reading about this meeting.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.259
It's interesting to note that not much time has passed between the conclusion of Genesis

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:34.500
17 and the record that we're looking at here this evening.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.100
You'll recall with me there in Genesis chapter number 17, that in verse number one, the Bible

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.059
said that the Lord appeared.

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:48.259
And when Abraham was 90 years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abraham and said unto

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:49.259
him.

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:54.220
We made note that as you study through, you understand that at the end of Genesis 16,

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.699
Abraham is 86 years old.

00:02:55.699 --> 00:03:00.580
At the beginning of chapter 17, he's 99 years old, so there's a 13-year gap.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.100
We also find that in chapter 17 in verse number 22 that it says, and he left off talking with

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.860
him, and God went up from Abraham.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.779
And so God appeared in the beginning of the chapter, and then God ascends back, and we

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:17.259
find that the Bible then records for us the circumcision that took place at the end of

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:23.619
chapter 17, and then we begin chapter number 18 in verse number one, and the Lord appeared

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:24.619
unto him.

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:29.320
We, of course, are mindful of the ages that are given in chapter number 17, and then again

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.860
repeated in chapter number 18 with regard to Abraham and Sarah.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.179
And therefore, we know we can conclude very just certainly, we can have certainty in our

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:45.539
conclusion that the timing is not much that has passed here between the two records.

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:50.339
Notice with me as we look here at verses one through eight of Genesis 18, if you're

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:54.259
taking notes, the record of Abraham's ministry.

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:56.139
The record of Abraham's ministry.

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.520
I'm going to read these eight verses, and the Bible says this, and the Lord appeared

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:06.820
unto him in the plains of Mamre, and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.580
Let me pause here just for a moment, because this is a very typical thing to do in this

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.660
region of the world.

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:17.980
The Bible tells us, it helps us in verse number one to understand the timing in which this

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.059
appearance took place, this meeting, if you will, and we find that the Bible tells us

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:27.059
that it was in the heat of the day, and that he, Abraham, sat in the tent door.

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:28.540
This was a common practice.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.880
It was not typical that someone would work or even travel in the heat of the day.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.899
It was common that they would rest, they would have a respite from those things that they

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:41.420
were dealing with and attending to throughout the day.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.380
I said to Brother Armando when he got here this evening, did you have a siesta this afternoon?

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.140
And he said, no, I was doing taxes.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.859
Ah, man, what a bummer, right?

00:04:50.859 --> 00:04:52.820
And then he says, Pastor Man, what about you?

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.820
Did you have a siesta?

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.339
No, I didn't have, I wasn't doing taxes, praise the Lord, but I didn't get a siesta either.

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:04.700
But we understand that concept, that idea, and here at the heat of the day, because of

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.339
this region of the world and all the things that were going on, he would be in the tent

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:14.540
getting some protection, if you will, some relief from the hot sun and all the things

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.540
that would take place.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.179
And it was at that time, the Bible says that the Lord appeared unto him, notice verse 2,

00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:28.660
and he, Abraham, lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him, and when

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:37.660
he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.540
Again, it would not have been a very common practice for individuals to travel or work

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.339
at this particular time.

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:50.619
And so Abraham's standing there and he looks out and he sees these three figures, these

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:55.779
three men, as the Bible says, and he rose up and he went with haste and he bowed himself

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:56.779
toward the ground.

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:01.820
It says in verse 3, and said, My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.700
not away, I pray thee, from thy servant.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.980
Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:14.100
the tree, and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.420
After that ye shall pass on.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.940
For therefore ye come to your servant.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.640
And they said, So do as thou hast said.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:28.660
And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.459
of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:38.059
And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf, tender and good, and gave it unto

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:41.299
a young man, and he hasted to dress it.

00:06:41.299 --> 00:06:46.220
And he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:51.200
And he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.019
As we would notice the record of Abraham's ministry here in these verses of Scripture,

00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:59.859
I want to draw your attention to a couple of phrases that are given to us.

00:06:59.859 --> 00:07:05.220
In verse number two, notice that the Bible says that he ran to meet them.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.859
Notice if you will, in verse number six, again, we find the Bible says that Abraham hastened

00:07:10.859 --> 00:07:12.940
into the tent unto Sarah.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.500
And look what he says to her, make ready quickly.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.100
You see the haste, and you find that again in verse number seven, it says, and Abraham

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.700
ran unto the herd.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.619
And we find there that it says this, that he hasted to dress it.

00:07:28.619 --> 00:07:32.420
He gave it to a young man, and he hasted to dress it.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:37.559
In verse number eight, he set it, that which was prepared this meal, before them, these

00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:39.059
three that have been mentioned.

00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:44.700
As we begin to think about the record of Abraham's ministry, I wonder this evening how we might

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:49.260
describe his service to the Lord and to these two angels.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.980
We find that I would say this of Abraham when I look at these eight verses of Scripture,

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.660
and of course we know that Abraham had had conversation with God.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:02.899
We understand that God has appeared to Abraham on previous occasions, thus Abraham would

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:08.579
bow himself toward the ground, and he would address him as saying, my Lord, in verse number

00:08:08.579 --> 00:08:09.579
three.

00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:13.820
I want you to consider with me that as we look at these eight verses that I would say

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.739
this with regard to the description of Abraham's service.

00:08:17.739 --> 00:08:21.019
Number one, he seized the opportunity.

00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:22.940
He seized the opportunity.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:27.059
I would say to you, even as God gives us the insight in verse number one with regard

00:08:27.059 --> 00:08:32.820
to the timing of this meeting, that it was not perhaps from a human perspective the most

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:39.659
convenient time to engage in the work that Abraham is doing, right?

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:41.219
It's the heat of the day.

00:08:41.219 --> 00:08:44.940
You're going to be running all over the place, and you're running to meet these folks.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.440
You're running over here to the tent.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:52.419
You're telling Sarah to bake this quickly, but bake bread in the middle of the day?

00:08:52.419 --> 00:08:58.419
He runs over to get a calf, tender and good, and you find that he seizes the opportunity.

00:08:58.419 --> 00:09:03.140
Even as we mentioned this morning with Solomon, he did not offer excuses when David had communicated

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.320
to him the plan and will of God.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.900
And here we find that Abraham, when we think about the service that he offers and we think

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.140
about his ministry, how that he seized the opportunity, the text of Scripture would help

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:18.780
us to see the immediate action that Abraham took, that it was without delay, that as soon

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.940
as he saw them, in verse number two, he lift up his eyes and looked, and the Bible says,

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:27.299
and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door.

00:09:27.299 --> 00:09:32.619
Has there ever been a ministry opportunity that you did not seize and you saw it going,

00:09:32.619 --> 00:09:37.260
but maybe didn't see it coming, and you were like, man, I wish I would have seized that

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.260
opportunity?

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:46.059
Someone made this comment with regard to opportunities, often it's easier to see them going than coming.

00:09:46.059 --> 00:09:50.859
You look back and you're like, oh man, that was a good opportunity, but the opportunity

00:09:50.859 --> 00:09:53.900
has passed us by, perhaps.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.280
Here we find that Abraham seized the opportunity.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.859
You don't need to turn there, but I want to read to you a passage of Scripture from the

00:09:59.859 --> 00:09:59.859


00:09:59.859 --> 00:10:04.299
of Galatians 6, verses 9 and 10.

00:10:04.299 --> 00:10:06.059
Notice here what the Apostle Paul says

00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:08.259
in Galatians 6 to these believers.

00:10:08.259 --> 00:10:10.419
He says to them this in v. 9,

00:10:10.419 --> 00:10:14.239
"...and let us not be weary in well-doing.

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:17.299
For in due season, we shall reap

00:10:17.299 --> 00:10:19.259
if we faint not."

00:10:19.259 --> 00:10:22.699
You know, it's possible for us to grow weary.

00:10:22.699 --> 00:10:24.979
Is it really working?

00:10:24.979 --> 00:10:27.279
Some of you parents raising kids,

00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:28.919
you say, man, are they listening?

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:30.179
Is it getting through?

00:10:30.179 --> 00:10:31.979
Is it going to work?

00:10:31.979 --> 00:10:33.499
Don't be weary in well-doing.

00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:35.379
Some of you that have been sharing the Gospel.

00:10:35.379 --> 00:10:36.619
You've been sharing Christ

00:10:36.619 --> 00:10:37.979
and sharing the Word of God

00:10:37.979 --> 00:10:40.299
with someone trying to teach them and help them.

00:10:40.299 --> 00:10:41.739
You say, is it working?

00:10:41.739 --> 00:10:42.979
God's Word is effective.

00:10:42.979 --> 00:10:45.419
God's Word works.

00:10:45.419 --> 00:10:46.699
We say this, it says,

00:10:46.699 --> 00:10:48.999
"...in due season, we shall reap if we faint not."

00:10:48.999 --> 00:10:50.339
Notice v. 10,

00:10:50.339 --> 00:10:54.619
"...as we have therefore opportunity,

00:10:54.619 --> 00:10:57.179
let us do good unto all men,

00:10:57.199 --> 00:11:02.199
especially unto them who are of the household of faith."

00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:05.359
As we have therefore opportunity,

00:11:05.359 --> 00:11:06.939
let us do good unto all men,

00:11:06.939 --> 00:11:11.939
especially unto them who are of the household of faith.

00:11:11.939 --> 00:11:15.079
As I would begin to describe the ministry,

00:11:15.079 --> 00:11:18.599
the service of Abraham here in Genesis 18,

00:11:18.599 --> 00:11:19.839
in the first eight verses,

00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:22.239
I would say, number one, that he sees the opportunity.

00:11:22.239 --> 00:11:23.519
And we've mentioned this already,

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:25.639
he served with haste.

00:11:25.639 --> 00:11:27.939
He served with haste.

00:11:27.939 --> 00:11:30.979
We find that he included others.

00:11:30.979 --> 00:11:33.079
It was D.L. Moody, I believe, that said,

00:11:33.079 --> 00:11:34.799
I'd rather have ten men working

00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:39.019
than do the work of ten men.

00:11:39.019 --> 00:11:41.619
Not only is that a good practice

00:11:41.619 --> 00:11:44.179
to preserve some of your own energy maybe

00:11:44.179 --> 00:11:46.419
and be able to serve for a longer period of time,

00:11:46.419 --> 00:11:48.319
but the reality is that we are to be

00:11:48.319 --> 00:11:50.139
co-laborers with Christ

00:11:50.139 --> 00:11:52.019
and we're supposed to encourage others

00:11:52.019 --> 00:11:55.059
to serve and get involved in the ministry.

00:11:55.059 --> 00:11:57.079
We find that here in the text of Scripture,

00:11:57.079 --> 00:11:58.999
the Bible would tell us that he goes in

00:11:58.999 --> 00:12:01.459
and he calls Sarah in v. 6

00:12:01.459 --> 00:12:02.919
and says, make ready quickly

00:12:02.919 --> 00:12:04.559
three measures of fine meal.

00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:06.459
Knead it and make cakes upon the earth.

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:08.379
In v. 7, there's a young man,

00:12:08.379 --> 00:12:10.219
an unnamed young man,

00:12:10.219 --> 00:12:12.819
that is getting involved in the service

00:12:12.819 --> 00:12:14.359
of this ministry,

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:17.159
of these things that are taking place.

00:12:17.159 --> 00:12:20.479
I believe that he served with grace.

00:12:20.479 --> 00:12:22.199
I believe that here as we look

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:23.619
at the passage of Scripture,

00:12:23.619 --> 00:12:24.759
it's very interesting

00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:28.119
that the Bible tells us that he says this

00:12:28.119 --> 00:12:31.279
with regard to this thought of ministry

00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:34.419
that he offered his best.

00:12:34.419 --> 00:12:36.599
Someone said this, don't give God what's left,

00:12:36.599 --> 00:12:39.019
give God what's right.

00:12:39.019 --> 00:12:41.339
I think it's a cute little saying.

00:12:41.339 --> 00:12:43.519
But the reality is that he deserves our best,

00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:45.579
does he not?

00:12:45.579 --> 00:12:47.419
And we find here in the text of Scripture,

00:12:47.419 --> 00:12:49.699
notice the perspective of Abraham.

00:12:49.699 --> 00:12:52.319
He says, let a little water

00:12:52.319 --> 00:12:53.619
in v. 4.

00:12:53.699 --> 00:12:54.899
In v. 5, he says,

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:58.259
I will fetch a morsel of bread.

00:12:58.259 --> 00:13:00.039
It's almost as if he's presenting it

00:13:00.039 --> 00:13:02.879
as if it's an insignificant offering,

00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:04.919
but yet we find that the text of Scripture

00:13:04.919 --> 00:13:06.359
tells us in v. 6

00:13:06.359 --> 00:13:08.559
that when he goes and he speaks to Sarah,

00:13:08.559 --> 00:13:09.819
he says this,

00:13:09.819 --> 00:13:12.619
make ready quickly three measures,

00:13:12.619 --> 00:13:16.759
notice, of fine meal.

00:13:16.759 --> 00:13:19.779
Notice in v. 7 when he's going to get this,

00:13:19.779 --> 00:13:22.019
he ran unto the herd and fetched a calf

00:13:22.179 --> 00:13:25.499
tender and good.

00:13:25.499 --> 00:13:27.299
He wasn't going to go and offer something

00:13:27.299 --> 00:13:30.419
that wasn't the best that he could offer.

00:13:30.419 --> 00:13:32.339
And I think that's noteworthy.

00:13:32.339 --> 00:13:34.579
I think that when we look at these eight verses

00:13:34.579 --> 00:13:37.699
of Scripture and consider the ministry

00:13:37.699 --> 00:13:41.579
of Abraham and his service here in this passage,

00:13:41.579 --> 00:13:43.059
I believe there's some things

00:13:43.059 --> 00:13:44.619
that we look at and we notice

00:13:44.619 --> 00:13:46.939
and we describe with regard to his ministry,

00:13:46.939 --> 00:13:49.099
and we say these are good things.

00:13:49.099 --> 00:13:51.459
You know, it's interesting over in the book of Malachi,

00:13:51.779 --> 00:13:53.979
if you want to turn there in Malachi,

00:13:53.979 --> 00:13:56.259
you'll find just before Matthew,

00:13:56.259 --> 00:13:59.099
and so go over to Malachi 1 if you will,

00:13:59.099 --> 00:14:02.379
and notice here what the Bible is saying

00:14:02.379 --> 00:14:04.819
with regard to the sacrifices

00:14:04.819 --> 00:14:07.219
that these individuals were offering.

00:14:08.099 --> 00:14:12.859
The Bible tells us in 1 in v. 6,

00:14:12.859 --> 00:14:16.339
a son honoreth his father and a servant his master.

00:14:16.339 --> 00:14:19.259
If then I be a father, where is mine honor?

00:14:19.299 --> 00:14:21.539
And if I be a master, where is my fear?

00:14:21.539 --> 00:14:23.579
Sayeth the Lord of hosts unto you,

00:14:23.579 --> 00:14:25.539
O priest that despise my name.

00:14:25.539 --> 00:14:28.179
And you say, wherein have we despised thy name?

00:14:28.179 --> 00:14:31.419
Ye offered polluted bread upon mine altar.

00:14:31.419 --> 00:14:33.219
And you say, wherein have we polluted thee?

00:14:33.219 --> 00:14:36.339
And that ye say, the table of the Lord is contemptible.

00:14:36.339 --> 00:14:40.299
Verse 8, if ye offer the blind for sacrifice,

00:14:40.299 --> 00:14:42.179
is it not evil?

00:14:42.179 --> 00:14:45.579
And if you offer the lame and sick, is it not evil?

00:14:45.579 --> 00:14:48.019
Notice what he says in verse number 8 at the end.

00:14:48.019 --> 00:14:52.619
Offer it now unto thy governor.

00:14:52.619 --> 00:14:55.459
Will he be pleased with thee?

00:14:55.459 --> 00:14:58.059
Or accept thy person?

00:14:58.059 --> 00:14:59.500
Sayeth the Lord of hosts.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.539
Now that's a probing question.

00:15:02.539 --> 00:15:03.659
And he's putting it right to it.

00:15:03.659 --> 00:15:05.379
Listen, you're bringing these offerings to me.

00:15:05.379 --> 00:15:09.179
I'm the Lord God Almighty, the Lord of hosts,

00:15:09.179 --> 00:15:11.299
and you're bringing these offerings to me,

00:15:11.299 --> 00:15:13.779
but you wouldn't even take them to your governor.

00:15:15.339 --> 00:15:16.539
That's not Abraham.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.139
He says, I'm gonna bring my best.

00:15:20.779 --> 00:15:23.459
Sir, I know it's the middle of the day, it's hot.

00:15:23.459 --> 00:15:25.579
It's not the time when you normally would bake bread,

00:15:25.579 --> 00:15:28.539
but I need you to bake some bread.

00:15:29.779 --> 00:15:31.299
In verse number six,

00:15:31.299 --> 00:15:34.659
knead it and make cakes upon the hearth.

00:15:34.659 --> 00:15:38.579
Most of us, most of you, I know I haven't,

00:15:38.579 --> 00:15:40.619
have not made bread in this fashion.

00:15:42.979 --> 00:15:44.059
He says, use some fine milk.

00:15:44.219 --> 00:15:45.739
Let's not use, but Abraham,

00:15:45.739 --> 00:15:47.819
we have some bread left over from yesterday.

00:15:47.819 --> 00:15:48.819
That ain't gonna do.

00:15:50.979 --> 00:15:52.819
There's no record that she said that,

00:15:52.819 --> 00:15:55.299
but you understand what I'm saying.

00:15:55.299 --> 00:15:57.500
His offering is vast.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.299
I think it's noteworthy.

00:15:59.299 --> 00:16:01.099
We notice in this text of Scripture

00:16:01.099 --> 00:16:02.979
the record of Abraham's ministry.

00:16:04.219 --> 00:16:06.979
I find that as we continue to look at this passage,

00:16:06.979 --> 00:16:09.859
there are really two reminders that are given to us.

00:16:09.859 --> 00:16:12.899
In verses nine, really verses eight through 13,

00:16:12.979 --> 00:16:15.059
and then also it's mentioned in verse number 15,

00:16:15.059 --> 00:16:18.139
we find the reminder of God's promise.

00:16:18.139 --> 00:16:20.779
I'm so thankful for the promises of God.

00:16:20.779 --> 00:16:22.579
This morning, one of the songs that we sang,

00:16:22.579 --> 00:16:24.859
in fact, it was the first song that we sang this morning,

00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:26.659
Standing on the Promises.

00:16:27.699 --> 00:16:29.659
Often when we sing that song,

00:16:29.659 --> 00:16:33.299
my mind will kind of go and think about

00:16:33.299 --> 00:16:36.099
some of the promises in the Word of God.

00:16:36.099 --> 00:16:38.579
In fact, there are times in which, not often,

00:16:38.579 --> 00:16:41.259
but occasionally, I've come to this pulpit

00:16:41.259 --> 00:16:43.779
after we've finished singing that song,

00:16:43.779 --> 00:16:46.459
and I've said, would you share a promise with me?

00:16:46.459 --> 00:16:48.500
What's a promise from the Word of God

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.500
that would encourage you and strengthen you?

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.419
Oh, I'm so thankful for the promises of God.

00:16:53.419 --> 00:16:55.699
And here, in verses nine through 13,

00:16:55.699 --> 00:16:58.659
we find that Abraham is going to be reminded

00:16:58.659 --> 00:16:59.739
of God's promise.

00:16:59.739 --> 00:17:02.099
Notice what the Bible says in verse number nine.

00:17:02.099 --> 00:17:03.259
And they said unto him,

00:17:03.259 --> 00:17:05.779
so they were eating there in verse number eight,

00:17:05.779 --> 00:17:07.699
they finished up and they did eat,

00:17:07.699 --> 00:17:10.539
and Abraham stood by them under the tree.

00:17:10.539 --> 00:17:12.299
And they say unto him,

00:17:12.299 --> 00:17:15.539
where is Sarah thy wife?

00:17:17.659 --> 00:17:20.979
And he said, behold, in the tent.

00:17:20.979 --> 00:17:22.419
Notice verse number 10, he said,

00:17:22.419 --> 00:17:26.500
I will certainly return unto thee

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.379
according to the time of life.

00:17:29.379 --> 00:17:34.379
And lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.

00:17:36.259 --> 00:17:39.139
Sarah heard it in the tent door,

00:17:39.139 --> 00:17:41.699
which was behind him.

00:17:41.699 --> 00:17:44.419
Would you consider this reminder here in verse number 10

00:17:44.419 --> 00:17:47.219
and think about the words that are used.

00:17:47.219 --> 00:17:51.539
He says, I will certainly return unto thee.

00:17:51.539 --> 00:17:52.739
I mean, he could have simply said,

00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:53.779
I will return unto thee,

00:17:53.779 --> 00:17:54.979
and that would have been good enough.

00:17:54.979 --> 00:17:57.059
But you think about the use of that word

00:17:57.059 --> 00:17:59.099
and helping us understand, listen,

00:17:59.099 --> 00:18:00.859
this is God that's speaking

00:18:00.859 --> 00:18:04.139
and He's reminding Abraham of His promise.

00:18:04.139 --> 00:18:07.379
And He says, I will certainly return unto thee.

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:10.500
Again, we find that it says according to the time of life.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.219
Remember, it was in chapter number 17.

00:18:13.219 --> 00:18:15.579
And then again here, repeated in chapter number 18,

00:18:15.579 --> 00:18:19.179
then Abraham and Sarah finally get an actual time

00:18:19.179 --> 00:18:21.139
with regard to the promise.

00:18:21.139 --> 00:18:23.419
They'd waited for 24 years

00:18:23.419 --> 00:18:26.339
from the time in which God had first given them the promise

00:18:26.339 --> 00:18:29.339
with regard to a son, with regard to the seed.

00:18:29.339 --> 00:18:32.380
And we find that now in chapter number 17,

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.459
we find that He said in verse number 21,

00:18:35.459 --> 00:18:37.820
that Sarah, which Sarah shall bear unto thee

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.739
at this set time in the next year.

00:18:40.739 --> 00:18:42.539
They now had a definite time.

00:18:44.219 --> 00:18:47.019
And here in chapter number 18 in verse number 10,

00:18:47.019 --> 00:18:48.899
I will certainly return unto thee

00:18:48.899 --> 00:18:51.099
according to the time of life.

00:18:51.099 --> 00:18:52.579
And lo, notice what it says,

00:18:52.579 --> 00:18:57.339
Sarah thy wife shall have a son.

00:18:57.339 --> 00:18:59.099
This is a definite promise of God.

00:19:00.099 --> 00:19:03.700
A promise that had been repeated often.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:08.700
A promise, no doubt, that had been challenging to accept.

00:19:08.979 --> 00:19:10.979
Remember, it was Abraham that offered

00:19:10.979 --> 00:19:15.739
the explanation to God in chapter number 15

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:18.739
when he said, behold, to me thou hast given no seed.

00:19:18.739 --> 00:19:21.140
And lo, one born in mine house is mine heir.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.459
And God said, no, it's not gonna be that way.

00:19:24.459 --> 00:19:26.899
And then it's in our passage that we studied last week

00:19:26.899 --> 00:19:30.260
in chapter 17 that when God says

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.380
and repeats this promise that Abraham says,

00:19:32.419 --> 00:19:35.579
oh, that Ishmael might live before thee.

00:19:37.179 --> 00:19:39.380
Of course, we understand that this reminder

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.659
is given here in chapter number 18.

00:19:41.659 --> 00:19:45.979
And he's speaking with these terms, these definite terms.

00:19:45.979 --> 00:19:49.700
It's similar to how he had responded to Abraham

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.739
in chapter number 17 when Abraham pled with God

00:19:52.739 --> 00:19:54.339
that Ishmael might live before thee.

00:19:54.339 --> 00:19:55.779
Remember, if you see there,

00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:57.619
perhaps on the same page of your Bible

00:19:57.619 --> 00:19:59.899
in verse number 19 of chapter 17,

00:19:59.899 --> 00:20:07.939
God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed.

00:20:07.939 --> 00:20:13.339
He says here, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life.

00:20:13.339 --> 00:20:20.379
I'm thankful that God would remind us of His promises, how precious that is.

00:20:20.379 --> 00:20:25.339
You know, the reality is that there are times in which we sing songs, and as we sing songs

00:20:25.339 --> 00:20:29.179
we are reminded of the very promises of God.

00:20:29.179 --> 00:20:34.459
Sometimes it's a promise that we wouldn't say that we forgot, as in it was nowhere within

00:20:34.459 --> 00:20:41.259
our mind, but maybe a promise that we've just not simply been very aware of, not been in

00:20:41.259 --> 00:20:47.059
the forefront of our mind, of our memory, and yet we sing that song and man, we're encouraged

00:20:47.059 --> 00:20:50.459
by being reminded of the promise.

00:20:50.459 --> 00:20:54.979
Maybe someone just makes a statement to you with regard to a promise that God has given

00:20:54.979 --> 00:20:55.979
His Word.

00:20:55.979 --> 00:20:58.579
Maybe you're in the midst of preaching and teaching the Word of God, and you're reminded

00:20:58.579 --> 00:21:00.379
of a promise of the Word of God.

00:21:00.379 --> 00:21:05.619
Maybe in your own personal devotions as you're reading the Word of God, you read this morning

00:21:05.619 --> 00:21:11.699
and you read a promise, and your heart was encouraged.

00:21:11.699 --> 00:21:15.939
See here, God's reminding Abraham of His promise.

00:21:15.939 --> 00:21:20.579
It's interesting that the question is asked in verse number 9, where is Sarah thy wife?

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:25.539
And in verse number 10, it tells us that Sarah heard it in the tent door.

00:21:25.539 --> 00:21:29.139
She heard what was said to Abraham.

00:21:29.139 --> 00:21:34.099
Verse number 11 is given to us as a statement of fact, if you will, from human perspective.

00:21:34.099 --> 00:21:37.579
It says, now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age, and it ceased to be

00:21:37.579 --> 00:21:41.139
with Sarah after the manner of women.

00:21:41.139 --> 00:21:46.619
Again, this would be from a human perspective with regard to their abilities, and it's a

00:21:46.619 --> 00:21:50.979
statement of fact that is given to us of that perspective.

00:21:50.979 --> 00:21:58.059
I would say this, that we always have to keep in mind that God is able to do all things,

00:21:58.059 --> 00:22:02.419
even as the question would be asked, and we've used it as our title this evening, is anything

00:22:02.419 --> 00:22:05.419
too hard for the Lord?

00:22:05.419 --> 00:22:09.379
But I want you to notice the response of Sarah here when this reminder of God's promise is

00:22:09.379 --> 00:22:10.939
given to Abraham.

00:22:10.939 --> 00:22:16.979
In verse number 12, the Bible tells us about the response of Sarah, and it says this, therefore

00:22:16.979 --> 00:22:22.059
Sarah laughed within herself.

00:22:22.059 --> 00:22:23.979
She laughed within herself.

00:22:23.979 --> 00:22:30.259
This seems to be an expression in which it is not stating that she laughed outwardly,

00:22:30.259 --> 00:22:34.379
that Abraham would have heard this, but it was an internal laughter.

00:22:34.379 --> 00:22:38.899
And we find, however, that the Lord knows about the laughter even though it was internal

00:22:38.899 --> 00:22:40.939
because He knows all things.

00:22:40.939 --> 00:22:46.459
And here we find, the Bible says that she laughed within herself saying, after I am

00:22:46.459 --> 00:22:54.659
waxed old, shall I have pleasure, my Lord being old also?

00:22:54.659 --> 00:23:01.499
So we see her response, a response of laughter and of doubt with regard to this promise that

00:23:01.499 --> 00:23:06.259
has been restated, this promise that has been given.

00:23:06.259 --> 00:23:11.679
As we think about the response of Sarah in verse number 12, we are mindful of the inquiry

00:23:11.679 --> 00:23:14.339
of God in verse number 13.

00:23:14.339 --> 00:23:27.219
The Bible says, and the Lord, the Lord said unto Abraham, wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying,

00:23:27.219 --> 00:23:32.579
shall I of a surety bear a child which am old?

00:23:32.579 --> 00:23:38.739
Has it ever occurred to you in verse number 13 that God knew that Sarah laughed, but God

00:23:38.739 --> 00:23:43.579
didn't ask Sarah why she laughed?

00:23:43.579 --> 00:23:45.499
God asked Abraham why she laughed.

00:23:45.499 --> 00:23:50.259
You ever wonder about that?

00:23:50.259 --> 00:23:51.259
I don't know.

00:23:51.259 --> 00:23:52.259
Ask her.

00:23:52.259 --> 00:23:54.759
Maybe that's what you'd say.

00:23:54.759 --> 00:23:58.579
I don't know what goes through their mind.

00:23:58.579 --> 00:24:01.619
Some of y'all are about to get in trouble with agreeing with me, amen?

00:24:01.619 --> 00:24:05.459
You understand what I'm saying?

00:24:05.459 --> 00:24:08.099
Be careful, be careful, amen?

00:24:08.099 --> 00:24:10.619
But you understand what I'm saying?

00:24:10.619 --> 00:24:11.619
You're asking me?

00:24:11.619 --> 00:24:14.019
She's right there, man, call her out.

00:24:14.019 --> 00:24:15.019
I don't know.

00:24:15.019 --> 00:24:19.619
I didn't even know she laughed, right?

00:24:19.619 --> 00:24:22.739
Because she laughed within herself.

00:24:22.739 --> 00:24:28.379
Why is it that God asks Abraham?

00:24:28.379 --> 00:24:33.859
I'm not going to be extremely dogmatic here, but this is my understanding as I've studied

00:24:33.859 --> 00:24:37.299
the Scriptures, and let me preface it by saying this.

00:24:37.299 --> 00:24:43.899
In Romans chapter number 4, the Bible tells us about Abraham, it tells us really a lot

00:24:43.899 --> 00:24:48.099
about Abraham in the entire passage, but in verse number 18 of Romans 4, it says,

00:24:48.099 --> 00:24:52.719
Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according

00:24:52.719 --> 00:24:56.719
to that which was spoken, so shall thy seed be.

00:24:56.719 --> 00:25:01.159
And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about

00:25:01.159 --> 00:25:04.799
a hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb.

00:25:04.799 --> 00:25:09.799
He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving

00:25:09.799 --> 00:25:11.159
glory to God.

00:25:11.159 --> 00:25:18.079
And being fully persuaded that which he had promised, he was able also to perform.

00:25:18.079 --> 00:25:25.599
I don't believe that these verses of Scripture describe Abraham his whole life.

00:25:25.599 --> 00:25:32.639
I believe that these verses of Scripture describe Abraham after Genesis 17, verse 18.

00:25:32.639 --> 00:25:37.799
Because in Genesis 17 and verse number 18, it was the second time in which Abraham responds

00:25:37.799 --> 00:25:41.759
to the promise that God gives with an alternative.

00:25:41.759 --> 00:25:46.719
The alternative that was given in chapter number 14, excuse me, in chapter number 15

00:25:46.719 --> 00:25:50.319
is the one that was born in his house, is mine heir.

00:25:50.319 --> 00:25:55.959
The alternative that is given in chapter number 17 in verse number 18 is Ishmael.

00:25:55.959 --> 00:26:03.239
But at that point, God graciously, once again, reconfirms for Abraham this that he is going

00:26:03.239 --> 00:26:04.639
to do.

00:26:04.639 --> 00:26:11.399
And we find that it was in verse number 19 of Genesis 17 that God said, Sarah thy wife

00:26:11.399 --> 00:26:13.699
shall bear thee a son indeed.

00:26:13.699 --> 00:26:18.699
Thou shalt call his name Isaac, and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting

00:26:18.699 --> 00:26:21.059
covenant with his seed after him.

00:26:21.059 --> 00:26:23.339
And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee.

00:26:23.339 --> 00:26:28.219
Behold, I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly.

00:26:28.219 --> 00:26:31.499
Twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.

00:26:31.499 --> 00:26:33.219
I preached on this last week.

00:26:33.219 --> 00:26:41.339
Verse 21, but my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee

00:26:41.339 --> 00:26:46.219
at this set time in the next year.

00:26:46.219 --> 00:26:51.419
And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.

00:26:51.419 --> 00:26:57.259
You remember Abraham's response in verse 23, in that self same day?

00:26:57.259 --> 00:27:02.619
He went and did what God had commanded him to do, that token of the covenant, the circumcision.

00:27:02.619 --> 00:27:08.299
And I believe from this very moment that Abraham wavered not.

00:27:08.299 --> 00:27:12.679
He no longer is going to offer an alternative to God with regard to the plan.

00:27:12.679 --> 00:27:16.539
He hears as God says, I will do this.

00:27:16.539 --> 00:27:21.419
Remember it was in chapter 17 and verse number 1 that God introduces himself to Abraham as

00:27:21.419 --> 00:27:28.659
being El Shaddai, the Lord God Almighty, and he says, this is what I'm going to do.

00:27:28.659 --> 00:27:34.379
Sarah does not seem, as you read chapter number 17, to be privy to the promise that is given

00:27:34.379 --> 00:27:38.179
to Abraham in this passage of Scripture that's being repeated.

00:27:38.179 --> 00:27:43.779
But we find here in chapter number 18 that she hears and she laughs.

00:27:43.779 --> 00:27:48.539
And God says, Abraham, why did Sarah laugh?

00:27:48.539 --> 00:27:51.679
You know why I think God asked Abraham and not Sarah?

00:27:51.679 --> 00:27:56.979
Because Abraham was accountable as the leader of his home to communicate to his wife what

00:27:56.979 --> 00:28:00.699
God had promised.

00:28:00.699 --> 00:28:07.319
So all you guys that were, now it comes back at you, amen?

00:28:07.459 --> 00:28:13.519
God has designed the home, and he's designed structure in the home, and God communicated

00:28:13.519 --> 00:28:21.319
this truth to Abraham, and Abraham responded, his actions, the circumcision at the end of

00:28:21.319 --> 00:28:30.279
chapter number 17 revealed to us his belief, his faith, in what God said would happen.

00:28:30.279 --> 00:28:36.119
Abraham can't make Sarah believe the promise, but it was his responsibility to communicate

00:28:36.119 --> 00:28:37.119
the promise.

00:28:37.119 --> 00:28:39.879
Abraham, why did Sarah laugh?

00:28:39.879 --> 00:28:45.399
Do you remember when God gave the truth in Luke chapter number 1 with regard to the birth

00:28:45.399 --> 00:28:51.679
of John the Baptist, and as you look through the passage of Scripture, you find that Elizabeth

00:28:51.679 --> 00:28:57.679
would now deliver, and of course, Zacharias was the one that was ministering in there

00:28:57.679 --> 00:29:01.759
and doing the ministry that he had been called to do, and as he had received the vision and

00:29:01.759 --> 00:29:07.039
told that they would have a son, that the angel said to him that his name shall be called

00:29:07.039 --> 00:29:08.039
John.

00:29:08.039 --> 00:29:12.279
But then Zacharias, he's kind of like, how am I sure that this is going to be?

00:29:12.279 --> 00:29:19.239
And so he couldn't talk for the duration of the pregnancy until John was born, right?

00:29:19.239 --> 00:29:23.639
I don't have time to read all of it, but that's kind of the way it happens there.

00:29:23.639 --> 00:29:29.279
And so when John the Baptist is born, they want to know what's his name going to be.

00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:30.279
What does Elizabeth say?

00:29:31.039 --> 00:29:33.759
His name should be called John.

00:29:33.759 --> 00:29:35.439
Is there opposition to that?

00:29:35.439 --> 00:29:36.439
Yeah.

00:29:36.439 --> 00:29:38.439
It's not in the family name.

00:29:38.439 --> 00:29:42.399
Where are you getting John from?

00:29:42.399 --> 00:29:48.639
Somehow Zacharias had communicated to Elizabeth what God had given him as a promise and as

00:29:48.639 --> 00:29:51.639
what that son's name should be called.

00:29:51.639 --> 00:29:54.319
And Zacharias was faithful to communicate that to his wife.

00:29:54.319 --> 00:29:56.399
Obviously, he wasn't able to verbally communicate.

00:29:56.399 --> 00:29:58.159
He had to write it down, whatever.

00:29:58.159 --> 00:30:00.159
And then, of course, they call him in.

00:30:00.159 --> 00:30:06.039
and what does he write down? His name shall be called John. See, this evening we

00:30:06.039 --> 00:30:11.599
find that here in the text of Scripture that maybe it's not specifically the

00:30:11.599 --> 00:30:17.919
laughter in which God is questioning, but Abraham's lack of fulfilling the

00:30:17.919 --> 00:30:24.959
communication of God's promise to his wife. Hey Abraham, I've given you a

00:30:24.959 --> 00:30:32.999
promise and you believed me. Why is Sarah laughing about this? I want you to

00:30:32.999 --> 00:30:35.759
think about that perspective just for a moment and the seriousness of that

00:30:35.759 --> 00:30:41.039
perspective and helping us to understand this evening the responsibility that God

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:48.079
has placed upon the the spiritual leader in the home. If you're married and you

00:30:48.079 --> 00:30:51.799
have children, the husband is the spiritual leader of the home. That's not

00:30:51.799 --> 00:30:55.559
to say that the wife is not important or some second-class citizen or any of

00:30:55.559 --> 00:31:01.079
that sort of thing, but it's a structure in which God has designed order in the

00:31:01.079 --> 00:31:08.599
home. And by the way, when God's plan is worked out the way that it's supposed to

00:31:08.599 --> 00:31:16.239
be, we can have God's blessing. We find here in the text of Scripture that God's

00:31:16.279 --> 00:31:26.279
inquiry is to Abraham, not to Sarah. Abraham, wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying,

00:31:26.279 --> 00:31:35.759
Shall I of a surety bear a child which am old? Didn't you tell her? Did you

00:31:35.759 --> 00:31:40.879
communicate this with her? You understand what I'm saying? And this evening we find

00:31:40.879 --> 00:31:45.679
that God is speaking to Abraham. We know that Sarah then denies it in verse 15,

00:31:46.559 --> 00:31:52.799
Then Sarah denied, saying, I laugh not. Why did she say that? Well, it says that she

00:31:52.799 --> 00:32:01.919
was afraid. He said, Nay, but thou didst laugh. God knew that she laughed. You

00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:07.679
can't hide anything from God. Sometimes we try. You might be able to hide

00:32:07.679 --> 00:32:12.319
something from someone. Maybe you can hide something from your parents, young

00:32:12.359 --> 00:32:17.439
people. Maybe you can hide some things from your parents. You might be able to hide

00:32:17.439 --> 00:32:22.119
something from a spouse, from an employer, but you can't hide anything from God. He

00:32:22.119 --> 00:32:26.199
knows all about it. You remember what happened with Adam and Eve when they

00:32:26.199 --> 00:32:34.039
tried to hide? God knew where they were. They tried to hide. He that covereth his

00:32:34.039 --> 00:32:41.879
transgression shall not prosper. You're not going to change that. That's just the way

00:32:41.879 --> 00:32:50.279
it is. But he that confesseth and forsaketh, we're going to find mercy and grace. Amen?

00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:53.639
And we have that forgiveness this Wednesday night as we continue through the passage in

00:32:53.639 --> 00:33:01.959
Luke 11 about the model prayer, if you will. Forgive us our sins. Oh, I'm so thankful

00:33:01.959 --> 00:33:09.319
that we have a God who's ready to pardon, that He forgives. She tried to hide this.

00:33:09.319 --> 00:33:20.519
She denied it. But God says, nay, but thou didst laugh. He knows. We notice here that

00:33:20.519 --> 00:33:26.759
there's a reminder of the promise of God. Within that reminder, there's some response

00:33:26.759 --> 00:33:32.959
and some inquiry. And I believe that as we look at the passage, we see that it's as if

00:33:33.039 --> 00:33:39.839
Sarah believed the circumstances from a human perspective more than the promise. And she's

00:33:39.839 --> 00:33:45.359
not understanding here. It's not been communicated, perhaps. And as we look at the passage,

00:33:45.359 --> 00:33:53.759
we're reminded of God's grace, reminded of God's kindness and reminding and giving this promise.

00:33:53.759 --> 00:33:58.719
But there's another reminder here. Not only do we recognize and consider, really, the record

00:33:58.719 --> 00:34:04.159
of Abraham's ministry, we see the reminder of God's promise, and then we see the reminder

00:34:04.159 --> 00:34:16.239
of God's power. In verse number 14, God says, is anything too hard for the Lord?

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:27.919
I like it when God uses absolutes. God uses absolutes. Is anything too hard for the Lord?

00:34:27.919 --> 00:34:33.119
Well, I got this one thing. No, the answer is no. Amen? The reality is that this is a

00:34:33.119 --> 00:34:41.359
probing and proving question that really does not need to be answered by Abraham. Why?

00:34:41.359 --> 00:34:46.799
Because I believe it is clearly understood what is being communicated.

00:34:46.799 --> 00:34:55.199
Remember, God has revealed who He is to Abraham. It was in Genesis 14 and verse 22 that He says

00:34:55.199 --> 00:35:01.519
that He is the Most High God, El Elyon. It's in Genesis 17 and verse number 1 that God reveals

00:35:01.519 --> 00:35:09.839
that He is the Lord God Almighty, El Shaddai. And as the Most High God, as the Lord God Almighty,

00:35:09.839 --> 00:35:16.319
He says to Abraham, is anything too hard for the Lord? It doesn't even deserve an answer.

00:35:16.319 --> 00:35:25.119
Because what's being communicated to Abraham and to Sarah is that there is nothing too hard for God.

00:35:25.599 --> 00:35:35.919
Nothing. Nothing is impossible with God. You say, well, I'm not sure of that.

00:35:37.839 --> 00:35:46.319
I hope that the Word of God, as God tells us His Word gives us faith, that you would get into the

00:35:46.319 --> 00:35:52.479
Word of God, allow the Word of God to get into you, to grow your faith, to understand there's

00:35:52.479 --> 00:35:59.999
nothing, there's not one thing that's too hard for God. He knows all about it and He's able to

00:35:59.999 --> 00:36:07.999
overcome all of it. You say, well, I had this situation and God didn't do this or that.

00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:14.959
It doesn't mean that He couldn't. It's that He had a purpose for it and through it.

00:36:14.959 --> 00:36:21.359
If you've been here for any length of time, you've heard me say often this statement.

00:36:21.359 --> 00:36:30.399
God is able to deliver you from everything, but sometimes He wants to develop you through something.

00:36:30.399 --> 00:36:37.039
And if you'd be honest and I'd be honest, we'd rather be delivered from than developed through.

00:36:37.039 --> 00:36:41.599
Because being delivered from is a whole lot easier than being developed through.

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:49.279
Right? But man, during those times of being developed and strengthened,

00:36:49.279 --> 00:36:52.959
learning who God is and what He's able to do.

00:36:52.959 --> 00:36:56.879
Man, those are some of the most precious times in your walk with God.

00:36:56.879 --> 00:37:01.919
To see that He is faithful, that He is able.

00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:11.519
Job 9, in verse number 4, Job is responding to one of his quote-unquote friends.

00:37:11.519 --> 00:37:16.639
And Job says this at the first part of Job 9, in verse number 4, speaking of God.

00:37:16.639 --> 00:37:23.119
He is wise in heart and mighty in strength.

00:37:23.119 --> 00:37:31.039
No doubt within this single verse of Scripture, this really half a verse of Scripture,

00:37:31.039 --> 00:37:35.519
the omniscience and omnipotence of God is in full view.

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:40.799
I'm so thankful that our God is wise in heart and mighty in strength.

00:37:40.799 --> 00:37:45.119
A number of years ago, I taught from this passage of Scripture in Sunday school.

00:37:45.119 --> 00:37:51.199
And I made this statement as I taught from that lesson.

00:37:51.199 --> 00:37:55.119
Wouldn't it be a shame if He was only wise in heart?

00:37:55.119 --> 00:37:59.359
He knew what had to be done, but didn't have the power to do it.

00:37:59.359 --> 00:38:04.639
Or if He had the power, the might, but not the wisdom.

00:38:04.639 --> 00:38:10.959
But our God is omniscient and omnipotent.

00:38:11.039 --> 00:38:15.039
No doubt there are times in your life when you faced a dilemma, a difficulty,

00:38:15.039 --> 00:38:18.319
and perhaps you just did not know what to do.

00:38:18.319 --> 00:38:22.319
You felt that physically you had the strength to be able to accomplish the task,

00:38:22.319 --> 00:38:23.599
but I don't know where to start.

00:38:23.599 --> 00:38:24.559
I don't even know what to do.

00:38:27.359 --> 00:38:32.879
And then other times, as some have shared with me as they've grown older and more mature,

00:38:33.839 --> 00:38:36.719
the senior saints, if you will, have said,

00:38:36.799 --> 00:38:39.679
I know how to do it, I just don't have the strength to do it anymore.

00:38:41.359 --> 00:38:46.319
Our God is omniscient and omnipotent.

00:38:46.959 --> 00:38:52.079
And here, God is going to remind Abraham and Sarah not only of the promise,

00:38:52.079 --> 00:38:54.639
but of the power of God Almighty.

00:38:55.359 --> 00:39:00.879
In Jeremiah chapter 32, we're out of time, but it's okay.

00:39:00.879 --> 00:39:01.839
Anyone in a hurry?

00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:03.199
He wouldn't tell me anyway, I hope.

00:39:03.199 --> 00:39:09.440
In Jeremiah 32, God tells Jeremiah to buy a field.

00:39:10.399 --> 00:39:15.679
After he's already told Jeremiah that the land is going to be taken captive by the Babylonians,

00:39:15.679 --> 00:39:17.119
they've already sieged the city.

00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:20.239
God says, buy the field.

00:39:22.879 --> 00:39:26.479
As Jeremiah is dealing with this which is taking place,

00:39:26.479 --> 00:39:30.239
God gives him the promise of the remnant that would return.

00:39:31.199 --> 00:39:32.479
And then Jeremiah prays.

00:39:32.479 --> 00:39:36.079
And in verse number 17 of Jeremiah 32, Jeremiah says,

00:39:36.079 --> 00:39:43.119
Ah, Lord God, behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth

00:39:43.919 --> 00:39:52.399
by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.079
Oh, I like the understanding of Jeremiah here in this passage.

00:39:58.079 --> 00:40:00.000
I don't understand how it's going to happen.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000
happen.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.559
I can see the Babylonians.

00:40:03.559 --> 00:40:08.760
I know that you've told us, I mean, I've been preaching about this destruction that's coming.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:15.880
But God, you've made the heavens and the earth by your great power, your stretched-out arm.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:21.159
Remember, in Genesis 1, we read the record of creation.

00:40:21.159 --> 00:40:24.120
God said, and it was so.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.760
And He made the stars also.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.360
Powerful statement of Scripture.

00:40:29.239 --> 00:40:32.040
You can read in the accounts in the book of Psalms.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.880
He commanded, and it was done.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.880
The power of our God.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:38.840
He's the creator of the universe.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:44.799
By the way, His creation, apart from mankind, obeys Him.

00:40:44.799 --> 00:40:48.479
I've mentioned before, I'm sure that Jonah in his disobedience was certainly thankful

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:52.439
that the great fish obeyed God.

00:40:52.439 --> 00:40:54.639
Think about that for a little while.

00:40:54.639 --> 00:40:57.680
That great fish would have swam the other way the way that Jonah went the other way.

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:04.440
Jonah would be not preaching anything about it, right?

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.599
But what did the great fish do?

00:41:05.599 --> 00:41:09.080
He spewed them out when God spoke to them and told them to do it.

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.599
What did the wind and waves do?

00:41:10.599 --> 00:41:11.599
They obeyed.

00:41:11.599 --> 00:41:12.599
Peace.

00:41:12.599 --> 00:41:13.599
Be still.

00:41:13.599 --> 00:41:22.000
Luke 1.37, we're familiar, I mentioned a moment ago about that passage of Scripture with Zacharias

00:41:22.239 --> 00:41:24.680
and a very simple verse of Scripture.

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:31.000
For with God, nothing shall be impossible.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:42.639
Back in Genesis 18, when God reminds Abraham of His power after He reminds him of His promise,

00:41:42.639 --> 00:41:46.400
He asks the question that does not deserve an answer.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.120
Is anything too hard for the Lord?

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.620
And then He says this again.

00:41:51.620 --> 00:42:00.779
At the time appointed, I will return unto thee according to the time of life, and Sarah

00:42:00.779 --> 00:42:04.779
shall have a son.

00:42:04.779 --> 00:42:08.979
This evening we read about Abraham.

00:42:08.979 --> 00:42:12.619
I wonder about our ministry, our service to God.

00:42:12.619 --> 00:42:19.179
As we read in those first eight verses, how is it perhaps this evening that you would

00:42:19.179 --> 00:42:22.419
describe your service to God?

00:42:22.419 --> 00:42:27.539
Would any of the statements that we've made about Abraham's service to God, his ministry,

00:42:27.539 --> 00:42:31.660
would any of those things be said of our service, of our ministry to God?

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:36.660
How would we describe our ministry to God?

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:41.020
As we continue through the Scriptures, through the passage, I wonder tonight, how many of

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:44.419
us need to be reminded of some of God's promises?

00:42:44.419 --> 00:42:47.380
How many of us need to be reminded of God's power?

00:42:48.179 --> 00:42:51.339
Man, we serve the God, the Lord God omnipotent.

00:42:51.339 --> 00:42:52.339
He reigns.

00:42:52.339 --> 00:42:54.619
You say, pastor, you keep saying that.

00:42:54.619 --> 00:42:56.660
Do you not see what's going on in the world?

00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:58.820
God's in control.

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.419
I don't know.

00:43:00.419 --> 00:43:01.419
Trust me.

00:43:01.419 --> 00:43:04.259
Read this book more than you watch the news.

00:43:04.259 --> 00:43:09.580
Brother Kevin sent me a text this week and said, preacher, I think your ratio of one

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:10.820
to four needs to be upped.

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:12.660
It needs to be like one to eight.

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:15.860
I think that's what you said in the text.

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:16.860
You need to get in the Word of God.

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:20.339
As you get in the Word of God, you say, man, our God's able.

00:43:20.339 --> 00:43:21.539
He's never failed.

00:43:21.539 --> 00:43:23.419
He's never going to.

00:43:23.419 --> 00:43:24.699
He rules and he reigns.

00:43:24.699 --> 00:43:31.619
We might just need to be reminded this evening of the promises of God, of the power of God.

00:43:31.619 --> 00:43:33.380
Think about that sweet promise.

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:38.259
I will come again.

00:43:38.259 --> 00:43:41.460
He says to Abraham, I'm going to come at the appointed time, and Sarah's going to have

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:42.460
a son.

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:45.539
You know that God's going to come at the appointed time for us?

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:47.220
He's going to take us to heaven.

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:50.020
The coming of the Lord draweth nigh.

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:51.020
He's not going to be late.

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:52.660
He's not going to be early either.

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:55.860
He's going to be right on time.

00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:02.139
Even so, come, Lord Jesus, is what John says at the end of the book of Revelation.

00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:05.860
I'm so thankful for the many promises, and maybe that's not the promise you need to be

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:08.139
reminded of, but maybe there's some others.

00:44:08.139 --> 00:44:11.020
The power of God.

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:12.020
Let's pray.

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.360
Father, we love You.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.760
We thank You for the privilege that You would give us to serve You.

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:20.880
I pray that as we would evaluate our service, our ministry to You, that we would be honest

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.679
in our evaluation.

00:44:23.679 --> 00:44:27.880
Perhaps some of the same things that have been said about Abraham, that have been observed

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:34.959
in these first eight verses, perhaps would describe our ministry and service as well.

00:44:34.959 --> 00:44:38.839
Then we think about the reminders.

00:44:38.839 --> 00:44:51.200
Oh, how we're so prone to forget, to maybe lose sight and perspective because of the

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:55.239
circumstances and adversities that we face.

00:44:55.239 --> 00:44:57.019
We thank You for Your promises.

00:44:57.019 --> 00:44:59.040
We thank You for Your power.

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:04.119
It's my prayer that You'd help someone tonight.

00:45:04.119 --> 00:45:06.200
Help many tonight.

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:12.640
Lord, I think about the songs that we sang, though the message this evening was not specifically

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:14.720
about salvation.

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:18.839
We sure did sing about it, rejoicing in it.

00:45:18.839 --> 00:45:20.799
Maybe there's someone that needs to be saved.

00:45:20.799 --> 00:45:29.640
Lord, I pray that You'd move and work, that You'd be glorified in this time of invitation.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:31.040
For it's in Christ's name we pray.
