1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,279
and we have an opportunity this morning

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:03,839
as we look at this portion of scripture

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,039
to be reminded of what Christ did for us

4
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:09,600
so that we could be heaven bound, amen?

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,039
And I'm so thankful that heaven is my home.

6
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:14,720
If you do not know with certainty this morning,

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,079
with 100% confidence that if you were to die today,

8
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:19,600
that heaven is your home,

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,840
I hope that you would not leave here this morning

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,120
without having that settled,

11
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,159
that you can know for sure that heaven is your home.

12
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:28,680
We're knocking doors last week

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,760
and I talked to a younger fella and he said,

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,479
you know, I don't know for sure,

15
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:35,799
but I'm trying to figure it out.

16
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:38,680
And he was searching, I shared some scripture with him.

17
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,759
He said, you know, I just don't know

18
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:43,479
that you can really know.

19
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:46,639
And I said, well, I'm thankful that the Bible tells us

20
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:50,439
that we can know that we know that we know

21
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:53,200
that heaven is our home, amen?

22
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,959
And what a blessing that is,

23
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:57,240
able to share some scripture, plant some seed.

24
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:59,159
Remember, God gives the increase.

25
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,639
We have the responsibility of sowing the seed

26
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:02,959
and what a blessing.

27
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:03,799
And so this morning,

28
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:05,239
as we look at this portion of scripture,

29
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,760
we'll get there in just a moment in Matthew 27,

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,959
but I wanna remind you that back in Genesis chapter 22

31
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,559
in verse number 18, God gave a promise to Abraham.

32
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:16,239
And here's the promise that he says,

33
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:21,239
in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed

34
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,919
because thou hast obeyed my voice.

35
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,639
We find that the apostle Paul references this promise

36
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:34,680
that God gave to Abraham in Genesis 22 in verse 18.

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,040
He references that promise in Galatians three

38
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,199
and verse number 16.

39
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:41,599
And here's what he says.

40
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,919
He says this, he says that it's the seed,

41
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:48,639
not seeds plural, but the seed.

42
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:53,360
And he makes this great statement that seed is Christ.

43
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,400
We find that a few verses earlier in Galatians three

44
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:59,000
and verse number 13, the Bible says,

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law

46
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:09,399
being made a curse for us, for it is written,

47
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:13,399
cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree.

48
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,600
We read in Hebrews nine, verses 16 and 17,

49
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,759
for where a testament is,

50
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,759
there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.

51
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:33,639
For a testament is a force after men are dead.

52
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:36,639
Otherwise it is of no strength at all

53
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,639
while the testator liveth.

54
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,600
I referenced those verses of scripture this morning

55
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,160
in Genesis and Galatians and Hebrews

56
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,600
as really a way of introduction to our text in Matthew 27.

57
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,960
See the seed of Abraham that would bring a blessing

58
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,679
to all nations is Jesus Christ.

59
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:57,839
We find that the means by which this blessing

60
00:02:57,839 --> 00:03:00,899
would be made available to all human beings

61
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:04,800
would be through the death, his death

62
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,419
on the cross of Calvary.

63
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,320
We understand that his subsequent glorious resurrection,

64
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,360
and we'll focus on that next week,

65
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,960
is evidence that his death was sufficient payment

66
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,820
for the sin of the world.

67
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,559
See, it was absolutely necessary

68
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:23,960
that Jesus go to a cruel cross.

69
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,600
It was prophesied, in fact, in Genesis three

70
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,419
in verse number 15 is the very first reference

71
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:30,960
that you find in all of the Bible

72
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,199
that's a prophecy that one day

73
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,279
Messiah would come and he would die.

74
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:40,279
We find that Peter, he mentions that Jesus is

75
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:43,160
the Lamb of God that was slain

76
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,320
before the foundation of the world.

77
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,360
Jesus said during his earthly ministry,

78
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,639
I'm come to seek and to save that which was lost.

79
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,759
And he came seeking sinners

80
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:55,139
and he was coming to save sinners.

81
00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:00,139
We sing often, it's been normally a Christmas type of a song

82
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,679
that the choir might sing, but born to die.

83
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:07,440
Yes, Jesus, he was born to die

84
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,479
and he had to go to that cruel cross

85
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:12,199
so that mankind could be redeemed.

86
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:14,119
See, so often as we have an opportunity

87
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:17,040
to give the gospel, so often as we have the opportunity

88
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,559
to be a representative, an ambassador

89
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,920
for the Lord Jesus Christ,

90
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,959
we often mention something like this,

91
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,079
that the Lord offers a free gift

92
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,480
of eternal life salvation.

93
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,399
The Bible says that the wage of sin is death,

94
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,600
but the gift of God is eternal life

95
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,839
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

96
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,959
The gift of God is free to the recipient

97
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,119
because it was paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ.

98
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:45,980
And as we look at the text of scripture this morning,

99
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:50,440
we are reminded of all that Jesus endured

100
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,880
so that you and I could go to heaven,

101
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,119
so that we could understand this morning

102
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:57,600
that heaven is our home.

103
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,279
See, we're all sinners, all mankind have sinned.

104
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:03,000
The Bible says there's none righteous, no, not one.

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,880
And we come to a passage of scripture

106
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,720
and we can read of the crucifixion.

107
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,119
I've titled the message this morning from Matthew 27,

108
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:13,399
they crucified him.

109
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,200
Notice in verse number 35,

110
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,920
we'll read all of the text as we get through it.

111
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,160
Actually, let's just begin reading in verse 27.

112
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,559
The Bible says, then the soldiers of the governor

113
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,920
took Jesus into the common hall

114
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,920
and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.

115
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,399
And they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe.

116
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,720
When they had plotted a crown of thorns,

117
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,480
they put it upon his head.

118
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,679
And a reed in his right hand.

119
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:44,239
And they bowed the knee before him and mocked him,

120
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:47,519
saying, hail, king of the Jews.

121
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,239
And they spit upon him and took the reed

122
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:53,079
and smote him on the head.

123
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,079
And after that, they had mocked him.

124
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,160
They took the robe off from him

125
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,519
and put his own raiment on him

126
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,640
and led him away to crucify him.

127
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,040
And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene,

128
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,640
Simon by name.

129
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,559
Him they compelled to bear his cross.

130
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:14,200
When they were come unto a place called Golgotha,

131
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,720
that is to say a place of a skull,

132
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,239
they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall.

133
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:22,959
And when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.

134
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,279
And notice verse 35, and they crucified him.

135
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,320
And parted his garments, casting lots

136
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,760
that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the prophet.

137
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,920
They parted my garments among them.

138
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,119
And upon my vesture did they cast lots.

139
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:41,640
And sitting down, they watched him there.

140
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,079
And set up over his head his accusation written,

141
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:48,119
this is Jesus, the king of the Jews.

142
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:50,959
Then were there two thieves crucified with him,

143
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,239
one on the right hand and another on the left.

144
00:06:55,239 --> 00:07:00,239
They that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads.

145
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,839
And saying, thou that destroyest the temple

146
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:09,839
and buildest it in three days, save thyself.

147
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,679
If thou be the son of God, come down from the cross.

148
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:16,559
I'm thankful that he is the son of God

149
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:19,359
and I'm thankful that he stayed on the cross.

150
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:20,200
Amen.

151
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:24,880
Likewise also, the chief priests mocking him

152
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,119
with the scribes and elders said, he saved others.

153
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,160
Himself he cannot save.

154
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,000
If he be the king of Israel,

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,799
let him now come down from the cross

156
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:38,119
and we will believe him.

157
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:40,200
He trusted in God, let him deliver him now

158
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,480
if he will have him.

159
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,880
For he said, I am the son of God.

160
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,440
The thieves also which were crucified with him

161
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,160
cast the same in his teeth.

162
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,160
And it says in verse 45, now from the sixth hour,

163
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,880
there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.

164
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,799
About the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice saying,

165
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,440
Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani, that is to say,

166
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,239
my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

167
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:07,359
Some of them stood there.

168
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:09,399
When they heard that, they said,

169
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,119
this man calleth for Elias.

170
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:13,480
And straightway, one of them ran and took a sponge

171
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,760
and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed

172
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,420
and gave him to drink.

173
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,279
The rest said, let be, let us see whether Elias

174
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,399
will come to save him.

175
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:25,679
Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice,

176
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:29,320
yielded up the ghost.

177
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,559
We see in verse number 50 that the Bible says

178
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:33,919
that Jesus cried with a loud voice.

179
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,479
If you look at the Gospel of John,

180
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:36,719
we won't turn there at this point,

181
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,239
but in 19 and verse 30, we know that that cry was this,

182
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:42,559
it is finished.

183
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,640
It is finished.

184
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,080
I'm thankful this morning that as we look at this portion

185
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,760
of Scripture and honestly, what a heart-wrenching passage

186
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,159
of Scripture to read when we consider all that our God,

187
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,679
all that he suffered so that we could go to heaven,

188
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,200
so that we could be redeemed.

189
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,119
See, redemption is only through the blood of Christ.

190
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:06,760
Forgiveness of sins is only through the blood of Christ.

191
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,159
And as we look at this passage of Scripture,

192
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:11,679
I want you to consider four thoughts this morning.

193
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,260
Number one, if you're taking notes,

194
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,200
the death of Christ was a violent death.

195
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,159
The death of Christ was a violent death.

196
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,380
Why do we bring that up?

197
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,760
Why is it that we would discuss this morning

198
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,080
the violence that surrounded the death of Christ?

199
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,200
Because it's important for us to understand

200
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,320
that our Savior suffered greatly

201
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,479
so that we could be redeemed.

202
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:36,340
Even before the passage of Scripture

203
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,880
that I've read for you this morning,

204
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,280
beginning in verse 27 of chapter 27

205
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,200
and reading down through verse number 50,

206
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,799
we find that there were trials

207
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,640
that led to the crucifixion.

208
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,599
Jesus stood before the high priest.

209
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:50,119
He stood before the Sanhedrin.

210
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:52,080
He stood before Pilate.

211
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,599
In each of those circumstances,

212
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:57,359
we find that he endured some measure of cruelty.

213
00:09:57,359 --> 00:10:00,039
And we find that at the end of his time.

214
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:05,419
there before Pilate that the Bible says that they scourged him, literally the idea is to

215
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:07,759
whip severely.

216
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,079
We find that as we enter into the text of Scripture that we've read this morning, beginning

217
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:18,059
in verse 27, that we see the violence with regard to the death of our Savior on the cross

218
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:19,219
of Talvary.

219
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:24,959
It begins in verse 29 by telling us about a crown of thorns.

220
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,779
We understand that as we look at this passage of Scripture in verse 29 and how they were

221
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:35,619
mocking him and even to consider the ridicule that would be evidence there through their

222
00:10:35,619 --> 00:10:41,659
mocking but the pain that was inflicted with this crown of thorns that was, the Bible tells

223
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:46,619
us they made it and they plaited it upon his head.

224
00:10:46,619 --> 00:10:53,359
No doubt as they did so the thorns would pierce into the flesh and the blood would begin to

225
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:59,059
stream down the face and we begin to see how that they were mocking him and they were bowing

226
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:04,399
before him and they were saying, hail, king of the Jews.

227
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:11,199
We find in verse number 30 that the Bible tells us that they spit upon him.

228
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:14,239
It's hard for me to even comprehend.

229
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:18,699
I believe it's probably one of the lowest things you could ever do to a human being

230
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:22,159
is to spit in their face.

231
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,319
It's absolutely disrespectful.

232
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:30,419
It's literally the worst thing I can think of, just humiliating someone to spit in their

233
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:39,879
face and here Jesus, the Son of God, God in flesh, to pay for the sins of these people

234
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:46,939
that are crucifying him, to pay for our sins, they place that crown upon his head.

235
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,219
They spit in his face.

236
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:54,639
According to verse number 30, the Bible says that they smoke him on the head.

237
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:02,059
The word smite, it literally means to strike with fierceness, but also with passion.

238
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:06,719
Now we understand as we look at the whole of the story of the account that God gives

239
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:12,219
us here in the gospel records and we don't have time to read all of it in one service,

240
00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:18,859
but we understand the passion by which the Jews cried out, crucify him, crucify him,

241
00:12:18,859 --> 00:12:21,339
and now as Pilate delivered him.

242
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:28,799
When they begin this, the Bible says that they smoke him on the head to strike, not

243
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,799
only with fierceness or force, but with passion.

244
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:43,439
The anger that was evidenced, the Bible tells us, it summarizes in verse 35 and says, they

245
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:46,199
crucified him.

246
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:53,359
You could do a study through just historical means and study the craft, if you will.

247
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:59,899
It's a bad word to use, but it's the best word that I know to use with regard to crucifixion.

248
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:08,119
It was really a craft or an art that they tried to master, to inflict as much pain on

249
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:11,279
an individual as humanly possible.

250
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:17,799
They wanted the death of one that was to be crucified to be as slow and as agonizing

251
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:20,499
and as painful as possible.

252
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:25,479
They did not want to just have the individual that was being crucified die quickly, no,

253
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:27,439
they wanted it to prolong.

254
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:32,839
In fact, many times crucifixion, those that would be crucified, they would spend a couple

255
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:39,959
of days on the cross as they were suffering in torment and agony.

256
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:44,959
And as we find with the two thieves that are crucified with Christ because of the timing

257
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:51,079
of the crucifixion of the Lord, we find that their legs were broken.

258
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:55,599
Eventually that would happen if someone, if they wanted to expedite the process of the

259
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:58,999
individual dying, they would, they would break their legs.

260
00:13:58,999 --> 00:13:59,999
Why?

261
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:05,719
Because then they could no longer hold themselves up and they would die of asphyxiation.

262
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:14,119
We find that Jesus, he did not have his legs broken, in fact that's a fulfillment of prophecy.

263
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:19,159
We find that as we look at this passage of scripture again, I'm thankful that I don't

264
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:24,319
have to pay for my own sin, I'm thankful that Jesus paid for it.

265
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:29,119
But we must understand this morning that the death of Christ was a violent death.

266
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:36,319
He was violent as he hung upon that cross, all that they sought to inflict upon him.

267
00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:41,759
And even as I read the text of scripture where they said, if you are who you say you are,

268
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:47,119
come down, you said that destroy this temple and that you would build it in three days

269
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:53,519
and we know that he was referring to his resurrection and thank God for the resurrection.

270
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,119
We find that they said he saved others, but himself he cannot save.

271
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:04,599
It was not a matter of cannot, it was a matter of he would not.

272
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:07,559
He would not come off that cross, why?

273
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:14,559
Because he had, you and I, and all of human history in mind, that this was what was necessary

274
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,959
in order for the sin of the human race to be paid for.

275
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,239
It was a violent death, number two.

276
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:26,879
Bear with me, not only that it was a violent death, but the death of Christ was a voluntary

277
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:27,879
death.

278
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:29,359
It was a voluntary death.

279
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:33,359
I'm thankful that Jesus willingly went to the cross of Calvary.

280
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:39,719
I'm thankful that Jesus, the God in flesh, that when he came to this earth, he knew that

281
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:43,759
he was born for a purpose and that he would go to that cross of Calvary.

282
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,879
If you study the gospel of John, you'll read repeatedly through that gospel this phrase

283
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:50,879
with regard to the hour.

284
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,879
And referencing to the hour in which Jesus would go to the cross and pay for the sin

285
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:01,079
of mankind, eventually it starts in John chapter number two that the hour has not yet come.

286
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:08,559
And we find in John 17 that the hour is now come, and Jesus would go to that cruel cross.

287
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,599
I want you to notice that it's a voluntary death in Matthew 26.

288
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:17,199
Notice in verse 26 through 28, right there, just a page or two prior to the text that

289
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,879
we're looking at this morning.

290
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:24,759
Notice what the Bible says, and this is referenced with regard to often as we'd refer to it as

291
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:25,999
the Last Supper.

292
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:30,399
We reference this passage of Scripture when we observe the Lord's Supper, and notice

293
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,839
in Matthew 26 and verse 26, the Bible says, and as they were eating, Jesus took bread

294
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:45,559
and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said, take ye, this is my

295
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,559
body.

296
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:52,559
He took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying, drink ye all of it, for this

297
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:57,719
is my blood of the New Testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins.

298
00:16:57,719 --> 00:17:04,279
And so we find that in these verses of Scripture, the Bible speaks about how he gave thanks

299
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:05,879
when they had this Lord's Supper.

300
00:17:05,879 --> 00:17:11,959
The bread representing his body that would be beaten and broken and torn.

301
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:15,839
The juice representing his blood that would be shed.

302
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,119
And he gave thanks.

303
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,119
It was a voluntary death.

304
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:23,799
We read already in chapter 26, look if you will, in verse number 47, look down, it says,

305
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:30,679
and while he yet spake, this is after the time in the garden, and the Bible says he

306
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:36,359
yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came and with him a great multitude with swords

307
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:39,759
and staves from the chief priests and elders of the people.

308
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:44,959
Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying, whomsoever I shall kiss, the same

309
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:48,839
is he, hold him fast.

310
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:55,239
And forthwith, he came to Jesus and said, Hail, Master, and kissed him.

311
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:57,959
Notice what Jesus says in verse 50.

312
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:07,359
Jesus said unto him, Friend, friend, the one who betrayed him with a kiss, friend, wherefore

313
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:08,359
art thou come?

314
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,439
Of course, Jesus knew why he came.

315
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:13,279
Jesus knew all that was going on.

316
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:16,479
Then came they and laid hands on Jesus and took him.

317
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:21,079
And behold, one of them, which were with Jesus, stretched out his hand and drew his sword

318
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:25,119
and struck a servant of the high priest and smote off his ear.

319
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,119
That's Peter.

320
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:30,839
Some of you say, I could see myself in Peter.

321
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:36,599
But notice what Jesus says in verse 52, he says, put up again thy sword into his place,

322
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:40,959
for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.

323
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:42,739
Notice what he says.

324
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:49,739
In verse 53, thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently

325
00:18:49,739 --> 00:18:54,219
give me more than twelve legions of angels?

326
00:18:54,219 --> 00:19:02,940
But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?

327
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:08,559
That same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, are you come out as against a thief with swords

328
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,979
and staves for to take me?

329
00:19:09,979 --> 00:19:14,619
I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and you laid no hold on me.

330
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:19,179
But all this was done that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.

331
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:24,539
Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.

332
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:29,899
Jesus said, Peter, no, no, no, I have to go to the cross.

333
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:35,419
Remember for much time now, Jesus had been teaching his disciples that he was going to

334
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:39,599
go to Jerusalem and he was going to be slain.

335
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:42,519
He tells them he's going to rise again, he's going to be crucified, he's going to rise

336
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:43,519
again.

337
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,839
And as he gave that instruction, remember Peter in Matthew 16, he says, oh, no, no.

338
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,839
And Jesus says, get thee behind me, Satan.

339
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:54,279
See because Jesus knew he had to go to the cross, it was a voluntary death.

340
00:19:54,279 --> 00:20:00,079
He says, Peter, don't you know that I could pray and I could have twelve legions of angels?

341
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:07,919
angels. But then he asked this question in verse 54, but how then shall the scriptures

342
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:16,279
be fulfilled? That thus it must be. In John chapter 10, we're told about the Lord being

343
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:21,959
our shepherd. In this particular passage in John chapter 10, we're told that he's our

344
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:26,679
good shepherd. And the Bible tells us of the good shepherd in John chapter number 10 that

345
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:31,759
one of the characteristics of Jesus being the good shepherd is that he layeth down his

346
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:38,319
life for the sheep. We find that in John chapter number 10 and verse number 11, he says, I

347
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:47,319
am the good shepherd. The good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. In verse 17, the Bible

348
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:52,359
says, therefore, doth my father love me because I laid down my life. Notice that I might take

349
00:20:52,359 --> 00:21:02,199
it again. Then notice these words in John 10 and verse 18, no man taketh it, my life,

350
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:12,159
from me, but I lay it down of myself. The death of the Lord Jesus Christ was a violent

351
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,679
death, but I want you to understand it was a voluntary death. He willingly went to the

352
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:24,639
cross of Calvary. He willingly endured all that he did. Why? Because he loved us. Because

353
00:21:24,639 --> 00:21:29,879
he loved us. It was voluntary. He laid down his life. In verse 18, it says, I have power

354
00:21:29,879 --> 00:21:34,999
to lay it down and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of

355
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:41,359
my father. And we find that here as Jesus, he says, I'm the good shepherd, but I laid

356
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:45,839
down my life. We're not going to look at the verses, but in Galatians 1, maybe you want

357
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:51,279
to reference it, Paul says in Galatians 1, in verse number 4, again in Galatians 2,

358
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:59,519
in verse number 20, he uses this phraseology that he gave himself. He gave himself. Someone

359
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,439
told me, I remember one of the first people I ever witnessed to after I got saved. I remember

360
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:07,199
I got saved when I was 17, entering into my senior year of high school, went to public

361
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:11,799
school my whole life, and I'm going to that public high school in Southern California,

362
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:16,639
just a, just a wicked place, all kinds of immorality and what have you. And I go there

363
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:22,319
and I, I mean, I had no friends whatsoever. It was my first year there. My dad got transferred

364
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:27,439
to a new duty station. We ended up in Southern California, end up going to a high school

365
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:32,439
that has more students than the town that I lived in in Nevada had. I mean, it was a,

366
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:37,919
it was culture shock, but then I got saved by the grace of God just before school started.

367
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,079
When I entered into school as a Christian, and I remember in our teen Sunday school class

368
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:49,039
after I got saved, the, the instruction of how we are to be witnesses and we're to be

369
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:54,559
light. And even in the public school, I remember the, the teacher of that teen Sunday school

370
00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:00,599
class challenging us to be lights in that place. And I remember the first person, I

371
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:03,999
can't remember what their name is, but I remember the first person I ever tried to witness to

372
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:09,439
after I got saved there in Southern California at Fallbrook High School. And I remember that

373
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:16,439
young man saying to me, Jesus didn't die for me. They took Jesus and they killed him. And

374
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:20,519
I didn't know a whole lot about the Bible, but I knew a few verses and I was able to

375
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:27,319
show him and tell him about some verses where the Bible says that, that he gave himself.

376
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:34,319
That no man taketh it from me, but I lay it down. See, his death was voluntary. It

377
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:42,759
was violent. It was voluntary. In Hebrews chapter 12, it's a passage of scripture that

378
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:49,519
I often reference. In fact, for a number of years, it was one of the verses of scripture

379
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:55,679
that I often would sign after my name in an email or a letter or if I were to sign something,

380
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:01,239
I would use Hebrews 12, 1 and 2, precious verses of scripture. At some point in the

381
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:08,239
last 10 or 12 years, God fixed my attention upon 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 15 and that

382
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:15,319
now is the verse that I always sign my name with. But in Hebrews 12 and verses 1 and 2,

383
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:21,759
the Bible says this, wherefore seeing we also are encompassed about with so great a cloud

384
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:26,319
of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us

385
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:33,079
and let us run with patience the race that is set before us. Look at verse 2, looking

386
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:39,879
unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith and then notice these words, who for

387
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:46,879
the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame and is set down

388
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:54,879
at the right hand of the throne of God. For the joy that was set before him, he endured

389
00:24:57,999 --> 00:25:04,319
the cross. See, it was voluntary. The Bible tells us in 1 Peter that he left us an example

390
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,399
that we should follow his steps, but if you look in the text of scripture in 1 Peter chapter

391
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:13,399
number 2, it tells us that the example that he left us is that when he was reviled, he

392
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:20,199
reviled not again. When he suffered, he threatened not. He willingly laid down his life for his

393
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:26,279
sheep. It was a violent death. It was a voluntary death. Number 3 this morning, if you're keeping

394
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:31,399
notes, the death of Christ was a vicarious death. It was a vicarious death. What does

395
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:36,359
that word mean? Well, it means that it was substitutionary. He took my place. We talk

396
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:41,199
about the vicarious atonement. We talk about the substitutionary atonement and I'm thankful

397
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:45,879
this morning that as we look at the scriptures that we understand, even if you look in the

398
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:51,739
gospel records that there was a man that was in prison that Pilate had this discussion

399
00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:58,239
with those that brought Jesus before him during the hearing, during the trial and this man

400
00:25:58,239 --> 00:26:05,239
Pilate was going to release one and he offers to release Barabbas. Barabbas, I believe because

401
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:11,839
of his own sin, because of his doings, he was guilty of death and he was going to be

402
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:17,879
crucified. In fact, I believe that along with those other two thieves, it was Barabbas that

403
00:26:17,879 --> 00:26:24,879
would have hung upon that cross. But word comes and Barabbas is set free and Jesus instead

404
00:26:25,879 --> 00:26:32,879
is crucified. In a very real way, we could say that that cross was intended for Barabbas

405
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:41,799
but we understand this morning that that cross was intended for each of us. It was our cross.

406
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:48,799
It was each of us that were guilty, that were guilty of sin. I've said often from the pulpit

407
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:56,239
that the reason that we, as we look at scripture, the reason that we understand the significance

408
00:26:56,239 --> 00:27:03,239
of the death of Christ and his glorious resurrection is that we're guilty. We're guilty and we're

409
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:11,199
in need of a savior, a substitute. The vicarious death, he took my place, he took your place

410
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:17,239
on the cross of Calvary. 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 20 says this, that he made him

411
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:24,239
to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in

412
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:32,799
him. He took your place. What an awesome truth of scripture. I want you to look at 2 Peter,

413
00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:39,999
excuse me, 1 Peter in chapter number 3. I just quoted 2 Corinthians 5.20 but I want

414
00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:46,999
you to look at 1 Peter chapter 3. As we understand this morning, that Jesus was crucified and

415
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:53,039
the fact that we are guilty sinners, so often when I talk to people I'll ask them, you have

416
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:59,199
to understand that you're lost before you ever realize that you need a savior. Amen?

417
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:04,279
If you don't know that you're lost, if you don't know that you're in judgment because

418
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:09,959
of your sin, then you never recognize your need for a savior. We find, the Bible says

419
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:15,799
all have sin. We're all condemned. He that believeth not, John chapter 3, is condemned

420
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:21,999
already. That's what the Bible tells us. And we find that as we look at the scriptures

421
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:28,599
and we understand that as we talk to people, we say, are you a sinner? Very few times I've

422
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:34,199
had anyone tell me, no, I'm not a sinner. Often I'll have somebody say something like

423
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:41,199
this, well I'm not that bad. How do you determine that? I mean, what is your criteria by you

424
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:47,759
determining that you're really not that bad? And often, well I've never murdered anyone.

425
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,999
Well that's a good thing. I'm glad that you've not murdered anyone. Amen? But the reality

426
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:59,679
is that we've all sinned. Sometimes we look at sin and we try to categorize sin and say,

427
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,679
well this one's worse than this one and so on and so forth, but sin is sin and we're

428
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,639
guilty. In fact, people try to do that with lying. They talk about little white lies.

429
00:29:08,639 --> 00:29:13,759
Did you ever hear that phraseology? A lie is a lie. By the way, Revelation says all

430
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:19,359
liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone. So we understand

431
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:24,399
this morning that we're guilty. But I want you to see in 1 Peter 3 and verse number 18,

432
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:31,639
the Bible says this, for Christ also hath once suffered for sins. But you understand

433
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:36,479
that he's not a sinner. He never sinned. He's perfect. He's God. In fact, if you were to

434
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:41,239
cross-reference to Hebrews 9 and Hebrews 10, you'll understand that in those passages

435
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:49,079
of Scripture, it's referring to the offering that Christ made once for sin forever. We

436
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:53,119
find that there's a contrast that is made, how in the high priest would enter into the

437
00:29:53,119 --> 00:30:00,119
holy of holies, and he would first make an atonement for his own sin, then for the sin

438
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:05,199
the sin of the people. We read that in Hebrews 9 and 10. You can read in the Old Testament

439
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:08,799
and that's the pattern. Why? Because the high priest, though he was in that office,

440
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:16,119
he himself was still a sinner. But Jesus, our great high priest, God in flesh, never

441
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:21,859
sinned. He's perfect. He's just. He, when he made an offering for sin, did not need

442
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:28,399
to make an offering for his own sin. He had no sin. He made an offering for the sin of

443
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:34,719
the world. He took upon us, upon himself, our sins. He took upon himself the sin of

444
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:42,599
the world. The Bible says here that he suffered for sins, the just for the unjust. Then notice

445
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:51,759
this phrase that he might bring us to God. Literally reconciliation. We were at enmity

446
00:30:51,759 --> 00:31:00,199
with God. But he provides this way of reconciliation. The Bible says being put to death in the flesh,

447
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:08,319
but quickened by the Spirit, the resurrection. And this morning when we think about, we understand

448
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:14,119
the death of Christ, it was a violent death, it was a voluntary death, it was a vicarious

449
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:19,279
death. Could I say this this morning, number four? The death of Christ was a victorious

450
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:25,759
death. It was a victorious death. I'm thankful for the victory, yes, at the garden with the

451
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:34,519
resurrection and we understand that his death, the death of Christ, does not end the account.

452
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:41,039
Oh, they buried him in a borrowed tomb and three days later he rose conquering sin, death

453
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:46,139
and the grave. But I want you to consider with me, I mentioned earlier that John 19,

454
00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:50,859
so turn over there if you will, in John 19 and I want you to see what Jesus says here

455
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:57,139
in this passage of scripture, the record of this, the crucifixion of Christ given by John

456
00:31:57,139 --> 00:32:03,939
here. In John chapter 19, you could begin in verse 17 and read throughout this account

457
00:32:03,939 --> 00:32:08,699
here that is given with regard to the crucifixion. We're going to jump right in the midst of

458
00:32:08,699 --> 00:32:17,459
it. In verse number 28, the Bible says, after this Jesus, knowing that all things were now

459
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:23,499
accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith I, thirst. Now there was said a vessel

460
00:32:23,499 --> 00:32:28,179
full of vinegar and they filled a sponge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it

461
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:34,819
to his mouth. We read of that in Matthew 27 and verse 48. We mentioned that in Matthew

462
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:42,139
27, the Bible says that he cried. We mentioned it does not tell us exactly. It says in Jesus

463
00:32:42,139 --> 00:32:46,459
when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. In verse 50, but now

464
00:32:46,459 --> 00:32:51,819
look in verse 30 here of John 19, it says when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar,

465
00:32:51,819 --> 00:33:02,179
he said, it is finished. Aren't those three precious words? It is finished. And he bowed

466
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:12,779
his head and gave up the ghost. He died. He died a real death. There are some false teachers

467
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:17,539
that teach that he didn't really die and he didn't really rise and all those types of

468
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:24,659
things but we see that he died. In fact, the evidence is given in the next few verses,

469
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:29,139
the Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, verse 31, the body should not remain upon

470
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:33,819
the cross on the Sabbath day. For that Sabbath day was a high day, the salt pilot, that their

471
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:37,899
legs might be broken and that they might be taken away. Remember I mentioned that earlier

472
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:44,659
that to expedite the process because they had made it a crucifixion to be such a long

473
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:51,819
drawn out process of great pain and inflict as much pain as possible. But if they needed

474
00:33:51,819 --> 00:33:56,459
to expedite the process, they would break the legs and we see that in verse 31. Verse

475
00:33:56,459 --> 00:34:01,139
32, then came the soldiers and break the legs of the first and of the other which was

476
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:08,979
crucified with him. But, notice verse 33, when they came to Jesus and saw that he was

477
00:34:08,979 --> 00:34:15,059
dead already. They break not his legs. You can look over at Psalm 34 and verse 20, we

478
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:19,179
won't take the time to do that. But one of the soldiers, verse 34, with a spear pierced

479
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:23,939
his side and forthwith came there out blood and water and he that saw it bare a record

480
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:29,699
and his record is true and he knoweth that he sayeth, and he knoweth that he sayeth true

481
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:33,699
that ye might believe for these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled.

482
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:39,099
A bone of him shall not be broken and again another scripture saith they shall look on

483
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:45,059
him whom they pierced. It's amazing when you study the prophecies that are fulfilled during

484
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:50,379
the crucifixion and you read of the prophecies, understand that those that are carrying out

485
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:55,139
this crucifixion, they were not aware of the prophecies and saying, okay let's do this

486
00:34:55,139 --> 00:35:00,899
so that we can fulfill this. No, they were crucifying him but Jesus, God, gave us those

487
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:07,459
prophecies centuries earlier so that we could understand the fulfillment that he was making

488
00:35:07,459 --> 00:35:18,019
when he went to that cross. But we find that he says, it is finished. What a great proclamation

489
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:24,619
of victory. It is finished. I mentioned by way of introduction this morning that there

490
00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:30,939
was a promise today as we sit here in 2024, the promise that was given to Abraham in Genesis

491
00:35:30,939 --> 00:35:38,299
22, 18 is 4,000 years ago roughly that that promise was given and we sit here and as we

492
00:35:38,299 --> 00:35:42,779
look at the passages of scripture that we've looked at this morning, the time of the Lord

493
00:35:42,779 --> 00:35:50,619
Jesus Christ was 2,000, 2,100 years after that promise was given to Abraham and we find

494
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:59,539
that how was it that God could say to Abraham that in thy seed shall the nations, shall

495
00:35:59,539 --> 00:36:05,139
all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice and Paul makes it

496
00:36:05,139 --> 00:36:12,339
clear that he said seed, not seeds and that the seed is Christ and how is it that Christ

497
00:36:12,939 --> 00:36:19,419
would bring that blessing that was made available through his death on the cross of Calvary.

498
00:36:19,419 --> 00:36:24,779
His subsequent resurrection that we'll look at next week where he rose in victory conquering

499
00:36:24,779 --> 00:36:29,979
sin death in the grave. But I want to remind you of two passages. First turn over to Hebrews

500
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:51,839
2 if you will. Hebrews chapter number 2 we'll look at a verse of scripture here. In Hebrews

501
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:56,459
chapter number 2 look if you will at verse number 14 the Bible says for as much then

502
00:36:56,459 --> 00:37:02,859
as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part

503
00:37:02,859 --> 00:37:11,899
of the same. Notice what the Bible says at the end of verse number 14 that through death

504
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:22,299
he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil. Through death. It

505
00:37:22,299 --> 00:37:27,699
was a victorious death. I mean it was a violent death. We've read in the passage of scripture

506
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:33,859
in Matthew 27 the violence that surrounded the death of our savior of Christ. We understand

507
00:37:33,859 --> 00:37:38,179
it was a voluntary death that he went willingly to the cross. It was vicarious. He took my

508
00:37:38,179 --> 00:37:43,979
place. He suffered and bled and died for me and for you and for all of humankind. We find

509
00:37:43,979 --> 00:37:52,979
however it's a victorious death. You know the sin of mankind could not be paid for simply

510
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:59,339
through the birth of Christ. No that's not sufficient. We don't read in Hebrews 2 that

511
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:06,859
through his birth he, no through his death. Yes we read of the glorious resurrection and

512
00:38:06,859 --> 00:38:11,739
again I mentioned that the resurrection is evidence that his death was sufficient payment

513
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:16,019
for the sin of mankind. But we look here and it says in Hebrews 2 remember the book

514
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:22,779
of Hebrews is all about Jesus and it's all about how Jesus is better, how he's superior.

515
00:38:22,779 --> 00:38:28,419
And notice if you will in the first chapter in Hebrews chapter 1 and verse number 3. Notice

516
00:38:28,419 --> 00:38:32,139
what the Bible says and perhaps I should have read this verse before the one in Hebrews

517
00:38:32,139 --> 00:38:38,039
2. But the Bible says of Jesus who being the brightness of his glory and the express image

518
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:44,899
of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself

519
00:38:44,899 --> 00:38:53,119
purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high. We find that we go

520
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:59,059
through the portion of Hebrews 1 and 2 and we read how Christ is superior and how he's

521
00:38:59,059 --> 00:39:04,459
better and he's greater. And we come to chapter 2 and we read this truth that through the

522
00:39:04,459 --> 00:39:12,419
death of Christ he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil.

523
00:39:12,419 --> 00:39:31,259
First John chapter 3. Look there if you will in first John chapter number 3. In first John

524
00:39:31,259 --> 00:39:35,059
chapter 3 in verse number 8 the Bible says he that committed the sins of the devil for

525
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:40,339
the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the son of God was manifested

526
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:48,539
that he might destroy the works of the devil. There are many people today if you look back

527
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:56,299
at Hebrews 2 and it tells us how Jesus through his death that he had the opportunity to destroy

528
00:39:56,299 --> 00:40:00,139
him that had the power of death, that is the devil. But I want you to understand.

529
00:40:00,139 --> 00:40:06,139
understand the impact, if you will, the application for us in verse number 15, and deliver them

530
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:12,579
who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.

531
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:20,299
There are a lot of people that are afraid of death, afraid of death, the uncertainty

532
00:40:20,299 --> 00:40:23,379
of death, what happens.

533
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:28,339
You know, there are some brave people, quote-unquote, that will give you a good talk and they'll

534
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:32,779
say, I'm not afraid to die, and I don't believe in anything, and I'm my own judge, and all

535
00:40:32,779 --> 00:40:35,379
these times, I've had people tell me all kinds of crazy stuff.

536
00:40:35,379 --> 00:40:42,859
Well, I'll tell you what, when you come face-to-face with death, it's a fearful thing, if you don't

537
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:48,019
know the Lord Jesus Christ, the one who conquered death.

538
00:40:48,019 --> 00:40:52,419
We find that He conquered sin, death, and the grave, yes, His death on the cross, His

539
00:40:52,419 --> 00:40:57,219
subsequent resurrection, and we look this morning at this text of Scripture during this

540
00:40:57,299 --> 00:41:01,859
time of year as we will be celebrating the resurrection, listen, there's no resurrection

541
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:05,179
without a death.

542
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:09,139
The resurrection is the cornerstone of our faith, but there's no resurrection without

543
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:10,559
a death.

544
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:13,939
There's no death without a birth, I mean, all of it is necessary, amen?

545
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:17,979
You can't just take one piece of it, all of it is necessary, and we find it as we come

546
00:41:17,979 --> 00:41:24,619
to the Scriptures and we open the Word of God, and we have this great truth of how Jesus,

547
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:28,979
God in flesh, died for us.

548
00:41:28,979 --> 00:41:36,779
He died for humanity, and we find that He died for humanity because He loved His creation.

549
00:41:36,779 --> 00:41:43,979
He's the Creator, and He loved, for God so loved the world.

550
00:41:43,979 --> 00:41:50,819
But God commendeth His love toward us, and that while we're yet sinners, Christ died

551
00:41:50,819 --> 00:41:55,179
for us.

552
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:59,619
Two takeaways this morning, number one, I hope that as we look at a passage of Scripture

553
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:04,699
like Matthew 27, as we consider the other verses of Scripture this morning, I hope that

554
00:42:04,699 --> 00:42:09,219
you would not be guilty of neglecting so great salvation.

555
00:42:09,219 --> 00:42:15,939
I hope this morning that you would rejoice regularly in your salvation, that you would

556
00:42:15,939 --> 00:42:23,819
be aware regularly in your daily life of what Christ did so that you could go to heaven.

557
00:42:23,819 --> 00:42:29,259
I hope that you understand, I mean, every day of your life, how blessed you are to have

558
00:42:29,259 --> 00:42:34,459
been given the truth of the Gospel, to be saved by the blood of Christ.

559
00:42:34,459 --> 00:42:39,339
But I hope this morning not only would we rejoice in these wonderful truths, but I hope

560
00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:44,619
that we'd be challenged to share this wonderful truth with those that we come into contact

561
00:42:44,619 --> 00:42:46,059
with.

562
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:54,439
You know, there are countless people in our community that have no idea why Jesus died.

563
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:59,979
Many that don't even believe in Jesus, I understand that, but even as you begin to

564
00:42:59,979 --> 00:43:08,859
have a conversation with them about Jesus, why did He die?

565
00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:11,859
You're left with blank stares.

566
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:17,499
You're left with sometimes answers that are not biblical.

567
00:43:17,499 --> 00:43:18,619
They do not understand.

568
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:25,859
They do not have the truth that we hold dear today, and so that gives us a responsibility.

569
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:27,539
It gives us an opportunity.

570
00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:31,539
I guarantee you this week, as you go throughout your week, that you're going to come in contact

571
00:43:31,539 --> 00:43:33,619
with someone.

572
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:38,099
Unless you sit at home all week and do nothing, you're going to come in contact with someone

573
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:42,699
that needs to know the truth that we dealt with today.

574
00:43:42,699 --> 00:43:47,499
That God, listen, this time of year, I know it's been overly commercialized and the Easter

575
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,779
Bunny and all that nonsense.

576
00:43:49,779 --> 00:43:53,779
I understand, it's crazy.

577
00:43:53,779 --> 00:43:58,539
It's distracting from the truth.

578
00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:01,179
The truth is that we serve a risen Savior.

579
00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:04,819
The truth is the resurrection only happens because He died.

580
00:44:04,819 --> 00:44:09,099
And we must recognize this morning, it was a violent death.

581
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:12,899
I'm thankful to have free salvation.

582
00:44:12,899 --> 00:44:14,259
Some people say, I'm trying to work for it.

583
00:44:14,259 --> 00:44:15,259
You can't work for it.

584
00:44:15,259 --> 00:44:17,299
It's already been paid for.

585
00:44:17,299 --> 00:44:20,379
You know how crazy it is if somebody was trying to give you a gift?

586
00:44:20,379 --> 00:44:24,179
I mean, they try to give you a gift and you say, well, I'll take it, but I'll work for

587
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:25,179
it.

588
00:44:25,179 --> 00:44:28,659
No, no, no, it's not a gift anymore.

589
00:44:28,659 --> 00:44:29,659
Amen?

590
00:44:29,659 --> 00:44:32,739
And Jesus said, I have a gift for you.

591
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:39,419
The gift of God's eternal life is a violent death, is a voluntary death, vicarious death,

592
00:44:39,419 --> 00:44:41,339
a victorious death.

593
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:49,339
And we sing the victory, we shout the victory, and we proclaim a glorious message to a lost

594
00:44:49,339 --> 00:44:54,379
and dying world that Jesus saves, Jesus saves.

595
00:44:54,379 --> 00:44:59,979
First Timothy, Paul said this, this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that

596
00:45:00,219 --> 00:45:03,979
Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.

597
00:45:03,979 --> 00:45:06,899
He says, of whom I am chief.

598
00:45:06,899 --> 00:45:08,699
How did he accomplish that?

599
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:13,019
Through the death on the cross, his subsequent resurrection.

600
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:20,699
I hope this morning that you recognize and appreciate greatly your salvation.

601
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:25,499
You recognize what Christ did so that you could be saved.

602
00:45:25,499 --> 00:45:32,779
But I hope also that God would stir us up and give us a passion to tell somebody about

603
00:45:32,779 --> 00:45:33,859
Jesus.

604
00:45:33,859 --> 00:45:36,899
We sing today about Jesus coming back.

605
00:45:36,899 --> 00:45:41,059
If you're looking at things in the world, I mean, listen, it seems like Jesus is coming

606
00:45:41,059 --> 00:45:42,059
back soon.

607
00:45:42,059 --> 00:45:46,339
I don't know, no man knoweth the hour, but I want to be busy about doing the work of

608
00:45:46,339 --> 00:45:47,339
God.

609
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:52,179
Oh, I'll tell them later at a more convenient time.

610
00:45:52,179 --> 00:45:54,899
You may not have another opportunity.

611
00:45:54,899 --> 00:45:58,059
You may not have a more convenient time.

612
00:45:58,059 --> 00:46:00,619
We must redeem the time that God has given us.

613
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:06,179
They crucified him, but he gave up his life for us.

614
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:07,179
Let's pray.

615
00:46:07,179 --> 00:46:08,179
Father, we love you.

616
00:46:08,179 --> 00:46:09,179
We thank you for loving us.

617
00:46:09,179 --> 00:46:10,859
We thank you for your word.

618
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:15,579
We thank you for your substitutionary death on the cross of Calvary.

619
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:21,499
I thank you that you took my place, you took our place.

620
00:46:21,499 --> 00:46:24,779
God, it's such a blessing to know that heaven is our home.

621
00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:29,819
God, if there's one present that's not sure of heaven, they've never been saved.

622
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:33,379
They've never understood these truths that we looked at this morning.

623
00:46:33,379 --> 00:46:37,659
Maybe they're trying to get to heaven on their own by some good works or some other ideas.

624
00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:43,779
Lord, I pray that you would help them this morning to understand the truth of your word.

625
00:46:43,779 --> 00:46:49,079
They would understand that they're a sinner in need of the only Savior, the Lord Jesus

626
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:52,639
Christ, that he bled and died to take their place.

627
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:56,719
He was buried and he rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

628
00:46:56,719 --> 00:47:02,399
God, I pray that you would help us to have a passion to reach the lost.

629
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:13,999
Lord, give us a desire to obey, to be willing to go out and tell others.

630
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:20,559
Lord, give us opportunities, give us divine appointments, and I pray that you would help

631
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,759
us, Lord, to be faithful.

632
00:47:22,759 --> 00:47:25,799
Help us to pray even as the disciples prayed in the book of Acts.

633
00:47:25,799 --> 00:47:32,759
God, give us boldness, that we may open our mouth with boldness, that we might speak as

634
00:47:32,759 --> 00:47:34,959
we ought to speak.

635
00:47:34,959 --> 00:47:38,999
I pray that you'd work and move in the hearts and lives of those that are gathered through

636
00:47:38,999 --> 00:47:41,119
this time of invitation.

637
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,479
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

638
00:47:42,479 --> 00:47:45,359
You just stand with me, heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

639
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,759
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano as we have a time of invitation, give you

640
00:47:48,759 --> 00:47:50,159
an opportunity to respond.

641
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:53,039
If you're not sure of heaven, we'll take a Bible and show you how you can know for sure

642
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:54,039
that heaven's your home.

643
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:57,479
Maybe you just need to come to the Old Fashioned Altar and pray this morning as Kimberly plays

644
00:47:57,479 --> 00:47:58,479
The Altar is Open.
