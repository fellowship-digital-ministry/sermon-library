WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.279
and we have an opportunity this morning

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:03.839
as we look at this portion of scripture

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:07.039
to be reminded of what Christ did for us

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:09.600
so that we could be heaven bound, amen?

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.039
And I'm so thankful that heaven is my home.

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:14.720
If you do not know with certainty this morning,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.079
with 100% confidence that if you were to die today,

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:19.600
that heaven is your home,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.840
I hope that you would not leave here this morning

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.120
without having that settled,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.159
that you can know for sure that heaven is your home.

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:28.680
We're knocking doors last week

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.760
and I talked to a younger fella and he said,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.479
you know, I don't know for sure,

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:35.799
but I'm trying to figure it out.

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:38.680
And he was searching, I shared some scripture with him.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.759
He said, you know, I just don't know

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:43.479
that you can really know.

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:46.639
And I said, well, I'm thankful that the Bible tells us

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:50.439
that we can know that we know that we know

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:53.200
that heaven is our home, amen?

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.959
And what a blessing that is,

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:57.240
able to share some scripture, plant some seed.

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:59.159
Remember, God gives the increase.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.639
We have the responsibility of sowing the seed

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:02.959
and what a blessing.

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:03.799
And so this morning,

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:05.239
as we look at this portion of scripture,

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.760
we'll get there in just a moment in Matthew 27,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.959
but I wanna remind you that back in Genesis chapter 22

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:14.559
in verse number 18, God gave a promise to Abraham.

00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:16.239
And here's the promise that he says,

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:21.239
in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.919
because thou hast obeyed my voice.

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:30.639
We find that the apostle Paul references this promise

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:34.680
that God gave to Abraham in Genesis 22 in verse 18.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.040
He references that promise in Galatians three

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.199
and verse number 16.

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:41.599
And here's what he says.

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:44.919
He says this, he says that it's the seed,

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:48.639
not seeds plural, but the seed.

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:53.360
And he makes this great statement that seed is Christ.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.400
We find that a few verses earlier in Galatians three

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:59.000
and verse number 13, the Bible says,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:09.399
being made a curse for us, for it is written,

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.399
cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.600
We read in Hebrews nine, verses 16 and 17,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.759
for where a testament is,

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:26.759
there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:33.639
For a testament is a force after men are dead.

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.639
Otherwise it is of no strength at all

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.639
while the testator liveth.

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:42.600
I referenced those verses of scripture this morning

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.160
in Genesis and Galatians and Hebrews

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.600
as really a way of introduction to our text in Matthew 27.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.960
See the seed of Abraham that would bring a blessing

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.679
to all nations is Jesus Christ.

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.839
We find that the means by which this blessing

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:00.899
would be made available to all human beings

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:04.800
would be through the death, his death

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.419
on the cross of Calvary.

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.320
We understand that his subsequent glorious resurrection,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.360
and we'll focus on that next week,

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.960
is evidence that his death was sufficient payment

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.820
for the sin of the world.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.559
See, it was absolutely necessary

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:23.960
that Jesus go to a cruel cross.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.600
It was prophesied, in fact, in Genesis three

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.419
in verse number 15 is the very first reference

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:30.960
that you find in all of the Bible

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.199
that's a prophecy that one day

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:35.279
Messiah would come and he would die.

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:40.279
We find that Peter, he mentions that Jesus is

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:43.160
the Lamb of God that was slain

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.320
before the foundation of the world.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.360
Jesus said during his earthly ministry,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.639
I'm come to seek and to save that which was lost.

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.759
And he came seeking sinners

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:55.139
and he was coming to save sinners.

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:00.139
We sing often, it's been normally a Christmas type of a song

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.679
that the choir might sing, but born to die.

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:07.440
Yes, Jesus, he was born to die

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.479
and he had to go to that cruel cross

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:12.199
so that mankind could be redeemed.

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:14.119
See, so often as we have an opportunity

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:17.040
to give the gospel, so often as we have the opportunity

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.559
to be a representative, an ambassador

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:20.920
for the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.959
we often mention something like this,

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:26.079
that the Lord offers a free gift

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:28.480
of eternal life salvation.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.399
The Bible says that the wage of sin is death,

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:33.600
but the gift of God is eternal life

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.839
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:38.959
The gift of God is free to the recipient

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:43.119
because it was paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ.

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:45.980
And as we look at the text of scripture this morning,

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.440
we are reminded of all that Jesus endured

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.880
so that you and I could go to heaven,

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.119
so that we could understand this morning

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:57.600
that heaven is our home.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.279
See, we're all sinners, all mankind have sinned.

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:03.000
The Bible says there's none righteous, no, not one.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.880
And we come to a passage of scripture

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.720
and we can read of the crucifixion.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.119
I've titled the message this morning from Matthew 27,

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:13.399
they crucified him.

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:15.200
Notice in verse number 35,

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.920
we'll read all of the text as we get through it.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.160
Actually, let's just begin reading in verse 27.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.559
The Bible says, then the soldiers of the governor

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:24.920
took Jesus into the common hall

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.920
and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.399
And they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe.

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:35.720
When they had plotted a crown of thorns,

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.480
they put it upon his head.

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:40.679
And a reed in his right hand.

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:44.239
And they bowed the knee before him and mocked him,

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:47.519
saying, hail, king of the Jews.

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:50.239
And they spit upon him and took the reed

00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:53.079
and smote him on the head.

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:55.079
And after that, they had mocked him.

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:57.160
They took the robe off from him

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.519
and put his own raiment on him

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:03.640
and led him away to crucify him.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.040
And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene,

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.640
Simon by name.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.559
Him they compelled to bear his cross.

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:14.200
When they were come unto a place called Golgotha,

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.720
that is to say a place of a skull,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.239
they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall.

00:06:19.239 --> 00:06:22.959
And when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:26.279
And notice verse 35, and they crucified him.

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:28.320
And parted his garments, casting lots

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.760
that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the prophet.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.920
They parted my garments among them.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.119
And upon my vesture did they cast lots.

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:41.640
And sitting down, they watched him there.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.079
And set up over his head his accusation written,

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:48.119
this is Jesus, the king of the Jews.

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:50.959
Then were there two thieves crucified with him,

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:55.239
one on the right hand and another on the left.

00:06:55.239 --> 00:07:00.239
They that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.839
And saying, thou that destroyest the temple

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:09.839
and buildest it in three days, save thyself.

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:14.679
If thou be the son of God, come down from the cross.

00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:16.559
I'm thankful that he is the son of God

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:19.359
and I'm thankful that he stayed on the cross.

00:07:19.359 --> 00:07:20.200
Amen.

00:07:21.239 --> 00:07:24.880
Likewise also, the chief priests mocking him

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.119
with the scribes and elders said, he saved others.

00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:32.160
Himself he cannot save.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.000
If he be the king of Israel,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.799
let him now come down from the cross

00:07:35.799 --> 00:07:38.119
and we will believe him.

00:07:38.119 --> 00:07:40.200
He trusted in God, let him deliver him now

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.480
if he will have him.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.880
For he said, I am the son of God.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.440
The thieves also which were crucified with him

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.160
cast the same in his teeth.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.160
And it says in verse 45, now from the sixth hour,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.880
there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.799
About the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice saying,

00:07:58.079 --> 00:08:01.440
Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani, that is to say,

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.239
my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

00:08:05.239 --> 00:08:07.359
Some of them stood there.

00:08:07.359 --> 00:08:09.399
When they heard that, they said,

00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:11.119
this man calleth for Elias.

00:08:11.119 --> 00:08:13.480
And straightway, one of them ran and took a sponge

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.760
and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.420
and gave him to drink.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.279
The rest said, let be, let us see whether Elias

00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:21.399
will come to save him.

00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:25.679
Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice,

00:08:25.679 --> 00:08:29.320
yielded up the ghost.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.559
We see in verse number 50 that the Bible says

00:08:31.559 --> 00:08:33.919
that Jesus cried with a loud voice.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:35.479
If you look at the Gospel of John,

00:08:35.479 --> 00:08:36.719
we won't turn there at this point,

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:40.239
but in 19 and verse 30, we know that that cry was this,

00:08:40.239 --> 00:08:42.559
it is finished.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.640
It is finished.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.080
I'm thankful this morning that as we look at this portion

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.760
of Scripture and honestly, what a heart-wrenching passage

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.159
of Scripture to read when we consider all that our God,

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:58.679
all that he suffered so that we could go to heaven,

00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:00.200
so that we could be redeemed.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.119
See, redemption is only through the blood of Christ.

00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:06.760
Forgiveness of sins is only through the blood of Christ.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.159
And as we look at this passage of Scripture,

00:09:09.159 --> 00:09:11.679
I want you to consider four thoughts this morning.

00:09:11.679 --> 00:09:13.260
Number one, if you're taking notes,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.200
the death of Christ was a violent death.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.159
The death of Christ was a violent death.

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:20.380
Why do we bring that up?

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.760
Why is it that we would discuss this morning

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.080
the violence that surrounded the death of Christ?

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.200
Because it's important for us to understand

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.320
that our Savior suffered greatly

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.479
so that we could be redeemed.

00:09:34.479 --> 00:09:36.340
Even before the passage of Scripture

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.880
that I've read for you this morning,

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.280
beginning in verse 27 of chapter 27

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.200
and reading down through verse number 50,

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.799
we find that there were trials

00:09:43.799 --> 00:09:45.640
that led to the crucifixion.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.599
Jesus stood before the high priest.

00:09:47.599 --> 00:09:50.119
He stood before the Sanhedrin.

00:09:50.119 --> 00:09:52.080
He stood before Pilate.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.599
In each of those circumstances,

00:09:53.599 --> 00:09:57.359
we find that he endured some measure of cruelty.

00:09:57.359 --> 00:10:00.039
And we find that at the end of his time.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:05.419
there before Pilate that the Bible says that they scourged him, literally the idea is to

00:10:05.419 --> 00:10:07.759
whip severely.

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:12.079
We find that as we enter into the text of Scripture that we've read this morning, beginning

00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:18.059
in verse 27, that we see the violence with regard to the death of our Savior on the cross

00:10:18.059 --> 00:10:19.219
of Talvary.

00:10:19.219 --> 00:10:24.959
It begins in verse 29 by telling us about a crown of thorns.

00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:29.779
We understand that as we look at this passage of Scripture in verse 29 and how they were

00:10:29.779 --> 00:10:35.619
mocking him and even to consider the ridicule that would be evidence there through their

00:10:35.619 --> 00:10:41.659
mocking but the pain that was inflicted with this crown of thorns that was, the Bible tells

00:10:41.659 --> 00:10:46.619
us they made it and they plaited it upon his head.

00:10:46.619 --> 00:10:53.359
No doubt as they did so the thorns would pierce into the flesh and the blood would begin to

00:10:53.359 --> 00:10:59.059
stream down the face and we begin to see how that they were mocking him and they were bowing

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:04.399
before him and they were saying, hail, king of the Jews.

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:11.199
We find in verse number 30 that the Bible tells us that they spit upon him.

00:11:11.199 --> 00:11:14.239
It's hard for me to even comprehend.

00:11:14.239 --> 00:11:18.699
I believe it's probably one of the lowest things you could ever do to a human being

00:11:18.699 --> 00:11:22.159
is to spit in their face.

00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:25.319
It's absolutely disrespectful.

00:11:25.319 --> 00:11:30.419
It's literally the worst thing I can think of, just humiliating someone to spit in their

00:11:30.419 --> 00:11:39.879
face and here Jesus, the Son of God, God in flesh, to pay for the sins of these people

00:11:39.879 --> 00:11:46.939
that are crucifying him, to pay for our sins, they place that crown upon his head.

00:11:46.939 --> 00:11:49.219
They spit in his face.

00:11:49.219 --> 00:11:54.639
According to verse number 30, the Bible says that they smoke him on the head.

00:11:54.639 --> 00:12:02.059
The word smite, it literally means to strike with fierceness, but also with passion.

00:12:02.059 --> 00:12:06.719
Now we understand as we look at the whole of the story of the account that God gives

00:12:06.719 --> 00:12:12.219
us here in the gospel records and we don't have time to read all of it in one service,

00:12:12.219 --> 00:12:18.859
but we understand the passion by which the Jews cried out, crucify him, crucify him,

00:12:18.859 --> 00:12:21.339
and now as Pilate delivered him.

00:12:21.339 --> 00:12:28.799
When they begin this, the Bible says that they smoke him on the head to strike, not

00:12:28.799 --> 00:12:34.799
only with fierceness or force, but with passion.

00:12:34.799 --> 00:12:43.439
The anger that was evidenced, the Bible tells us, it summarizes in verse 35 and says, they

00:12:43.439 --> 00:12:46.199
crucified him.

00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:53.359
You could do a study through just historical means and study the craft, if you will.

00:12:53.359 --> 00:12:59.899
It's a bad word to use, but it's the best word that I know to use with regard to crucifixion.

00:12:59.899 --> 00:13:08.119
It was really a craft or an art that they tried to master, to inflict as much pain on

00:13:08.119 --> 00:13:11.279
an individual as humanly possible.

00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:17.799
They wanted the death of one that was to be crucified to be as slow and as agonizing

00:13:17.799 --> 00:13:20.499
and as painful as possible.

00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:25.479
They did not want to just have the individual that was being crucified die quickly, no,

00:13:25.479 --> 00:13:27.439
they wanted it to prolong.

00:13:27.439 --> 00:13:32.839
In fact, many times crucifixion, those that would be crucified, they would spend a couple

00:13:32.839 --> 00:13:39.959
of days on the cross as they were suffering in torment and agony.

00:13:39.959 --> 00:13:44.959
And as we find with the two thieves that are crucified with Christ because of the timing

00:13:44.959 --> 00:13:51.079
of the crucifixion of the Lord, we find that their legs were broken.

00:13:51.079 --> 00:13:55.599
Eventually that would happen if someone, if they wanted to expedite the process of the

00:13:55.599 --> 00:13:58.999
individual dying, they would, they would break their legs.

00:13:58.999 --> 00:13:59.999
Why?

00:13:59.999 --> 00:14:05.719
Because then they could no longer hold themselves up and they would die of asphyxiation.

00:14:05.719 --> 00:14:14.119
We find that Jesus, he did not have his legs broken, in fact that's a fulfillment of prophecy.

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:19.159
We find that as we look at this passage of scripture again, I'm thankful that I don't

00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:24.319
have to pay for my own sin, I'm thankful that Jesus paid for it.

00:14:24.319 --> 00:14:29.119
But we must understand this morning that the death of Christ was a violent death.

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:36.319
He was violent as he hung upon that cross, all that they sought to inflict upon him.

00:14:36.319 --> 00:14:41.759
And even as I read the text of scripture where they said, if you are who you say you are,

00:14:41.759 --> 00:14:47.119
come down, you said that destroy this temple and that you would build it in three days

00:14:47.119 --> 00:14:53.519
and we know that he was referring to his resurrection and thank God for the resurrection.

00:14:53.519 --> 00:14:59.119
We find that they said he saved others, but himself he cannot save.

00:14:59.119 --> 00:15:04.599
It was not a matter of cannot, it was a matter of he would not.

00:15:04.599 --> 00:15:07.559
He would not come off that cross, why?

00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:14.559
Because he had, you and I, and all of human history in mind, that this was what was necessary

00:15:14.559 --> 00:15:18.959
in order for the sin of the human race to be paid for.

00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:22.239
It was a violent death, number two.

00:15:22.239 --> 00:15:26.879
Bear with me, not only that it was a violent death, but the death of Christ was a voluntary

00:15:26.879 --> 00:15:27.879
death.

00:15:27.879 --> 00:15:29.359
It was a voluntary death.

00:15:29.359 --> 00:15:33.359
I'm thankful that Jesus willingly went to the cross of Calvary.

00:15:33.359 --> 00:15:39.719
I'm thankful that Jesus, the God in flesh, that when he came to this earth, he knew that

00:15:39.719 --> 00:15:43.759
he was born for a purpose and that he would go to that cross of Calvary.

00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:48.879
If you study the gospel of John, you'll read repeatedly through that gospel this phrase

00:15:48.879 --> 00:15:50.879
with regard to the hour.

00:15:50.879 --> 00:15:55.879
And referencing to the hour in which Jesus would go to the cross and pay for the sin

00:15:55.879 --> 00:16:01.079
of mankind, eventually it starts in John chapter number two that the hour has not yet come.

00:16:01.079 --> 00:16:08.559
And we find in John 17 that the hour is now come, and Jesus would go to that cruel cross.

00:16:08.559 --> 00:16:12.599
I want you to notice that it's a voluntary death in Matthew 26.

00:16:12.599 --> 00:16:17.199
Notice in verse 26 through 28, right there, just a page or two prior to the text that

00:16:17.199 --> 00:16:18.879
we're looking at this morning.

00:16:18.879 --> 00:16:24.759
Notice what the Bible says, and this is referenced with regard to often as we'd refer to it as

00:16:24.759 --> 00:16:25.999
the Last Supper.

00:16:25.999 --> 00:16:30.399
We reference this passage of Scripture when we observe the Lord's Supper, and notice

00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:36.839
in Matthew 26 and verse 26, the Bible says, and as they were eating, Jesus took bread

00:16:36.839 --> 00:16:45.559
and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said, take ye, this is my

00:16:45.559 --> 00:16:46.559
body.

00:16:47.479 --> 00:16:52.559
He took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying, drink ye all of it, for this

00:16:52.559 --> 00:16:57.719
is my blood of the New Testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins.

00:16:57.719 --> 00:17:04.279
And so we find that in these verses of Scripture, the Bible speaks about how he gave thanks

00:17:04.279 --> 00:17:05.879
when they had this Lord's Supper.

00:17:05.879 --> 00:17:11.959
The bread representing his body that would be beaten and broken and torn.

00:17:11.959 --> 00:17:15.839
The juice representing his blood that would be shed.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.119
And he gave thanks.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:18.119
It was a voluntary death.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:23.799
We read already in chapter 26, look if you will, in verse number 47, look down, it says,

00:17:23.799 --> 00:17:30.679
and while he yet spake, this is after the time in the garden, and the Bible says he

00:17:30.679 --> 00:17:36.359
yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came and with him a great multitude with swords

00:17:36.359 --> 00:17:39.759
and staves from the chief priests and elders of the people.

00:17:39.759 --> 00:17:44.959
Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying, whomsoever I shall kiss, the same

00:17:45.079 --> 00:17:48.839
is he, hold him fast.

00:17:48.839 --> 00:17:55.239
And forthwith, he came to Jesus and said, Hail, Master, and kissed him.

00:17:55.239 --> 00:17:57.959
Notice what Jesus says in verse 50.

00:17:57.959 --> 00:18:07.359
Jesus said unto him, Friend, friend, the one who betrayed him with a kiss, friend, wherefore

00:18:07.359 --> 00:18:08.359
art thou come?

00:18:08.359 --> 00:18:10.439
Of course, Jesus knew why he came.

00:18:10.439 --> 00:18:13.279
Jesus knew all that was going on.

00:18:13.279 --> 00:18:16.479
Then came they and laid hands on Jesus and took him.

00:18:16.479 --> 00:18:21.079
And behold, one of them, which were with Jesus, stretched out his hand and drew his sword

00:18:21.079 --> 00:18:25.119
and struck a servant of the high priest and smote off his ear.

00:18:25.119 --> 00:18:26.119
That's Peter.

00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:30.839
Some of you say, I could see myself in Peter.

00:18:30.839 --> 00:18:36.599
But notice what Jesus says in verse 52, he says, put up again thy sword into his place,

00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:40.959
for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.

00:18:40.959 --> 00:18:42.739
Notice what he says.

00:18:42.739 --> 00:18:49.739
In verse 53, thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently

00:18:49.739 --> 00:18:54.219
give me more than twelve legions of angels?

00:18:54.219 --> 00:19:02.940
But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:08.559
That same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, are you come out as against a thief with swords

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:09.979
and staves for to take me?

00:19:09.979 --> 00:19:14.619
I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and you laid no hold on me.

00:19:14.619 --> 00:19:19.179
But all this was done that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.

00:19:19.179 --> 00:19:24.539
Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.

00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:29.899
Jesus said, Peter, no, no, no, I have to go to the cross.

00:19:29.899 --> 00:19:35.419
Remember for much time now, Jesus had been teaching his disciples that he was going to

00:19:35.419 --> 00:19:39.599
go to Jerusalem and he was going to be slain.

00:19:39.599 --> 00:19:42.519
He tells them he's going to rise again, he's going to be crucified, he's going to rise

00:19:42.519 --> 00:19:43.519
again.

00:19:43.519 --> 00:19:47.839
And as he gave that instruction, remember Peter in Matthew 16, he says, oh, no, no.

00:19:47.839 --> 00:19:50.839
And Jesus says, get thee behind me, Satan.

00:19:50.839 --> 00:19:54.279
See because Jesus knew he had to go to the cross, it was a voluntary death.

00:19:54.279 --> 00:20:00.079
He says, Peter, don't you know that I could pray and I could have twelve legions of angels?

00:20:00.079 --> 00:20:07.919
angels. But then he asked this question in verse 54, but how then shall the scriptures

00:20:07.919 --> 00:20:16.279
be fulfilled? That thus it must be. In John chapter 10, we're told about the Lord being

00:20:16.279 --> 00:20:21.959
our shepherd. In this particular passage in John chapter 10, we're told that he's our

00:20:21.959 --> 00:20:26.679
good shepherd. And the Bible tells us of the good shepherd in John chapter number 10 that

00:20:26.679 --> 00:20:31.759
one of the characteristics of Jesus being the good shepherd is that he layeth down his

00:20:31.759 --> 00:20:38.319
life for the sheep. We find that in John chapter number 10 and verse number 11, he says, I

00:20:38.319 --> 00:20:47.319
am the good shepherd. The good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. In verse 17, the Bible

00:20:47.319 --> 00:20:52.359
says, therefore, doth my father love me because I laid down my life. Notice that I might take

00:20:52.359 --> 00:21:02.199
it again. Then notice these words in John 10 and verse 18, no man taketh it, my life,

00:21:02.199 --> 00:21:12.159
from me, but I lay it down of myself. The death of the Lord Jesus Christ was a violent

00:21:12.159 --> 00:21:16.679
death, but I want you to understand it was a voluntary death. He willingly went to the

00:21:16.679 --> 00:21:24.639
cross of Calvary. He willingly endured all that he did. Why? Because he loved us. Because

00:21:24.639 --> 00:21:29.879
he loved us. It was voluntary. He laid down his life. In verse 18, it says, I have power

00:21:29.879 --> 00:21:34.999
to lay it down and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of

00:21:34.999 --> 00:21:41.359
my father. And we find that here as Jesus, he says, I'm the good shepherd, but I laid

00:21:41.359 --> 00:21:45.839
down my life. We're not going to look at the verses, but in Galatians 1, maybe you want

00:21:45.839 --> 00:21:51.279
to reference it, Paul says in Galatians 1, in verse number 4, again in Galatians 2,

00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:59.519
in verse number 20, he uses this phraseology that he gave himself. He gave himself. Someone

00:21:59.519 --> 00:22:03.439
told me, I remember one of the first people I ever witnessed to after I got saved. I remember

00:22:03.439 --> 00:22:07.199
I got saved when I was 17, entering into my senior year of high school, went to public

00:22:07.199 --> 00:22:11.799
school my whole life, and I'm going to that public high school in Southern California,

00:22:11.799 --> 00:22:16.639
just a, just a wicked place, all kinds of immorality and what have you. And I go there

00:22:16.639 --> 00:22:22.319
and I, I mean, I had no friends whatsoever. It was my first year there. My dad got transferred

00:22:22.319 --> 00:22:27.439
to a new duty station. We ended up in Southern California, end up going to a high school

00:22:27.439 --> 00:22:32.439
that has more students than the town that I lived in in Nevada had. I mean, it was a,

00:22:32.439 --> 00:22:37.919
it was culture shock, but then I got saved by the grace of God just before school started.

00:22:37.919 --> 00:22:43.079
When I entered into school as a Christian, and I remember in our teen Sunday school class

00:22:43.079 --> 00:22:49.039
after I got saved, the, the instruction of how we are to be witnesses and we're to be

00:22:49.039 --> 00:22:54.559
light. And even in the public school, I remember the, the teacher of that teen Sunday school

00:22:54.559 --> 00:23:00.599
class challenging us to be lights in that place. And I remember the first person, I

00:23:00.599 --> 00:23:03.999
can't remember what their name is, but I remember the first person I ever tried to witness to

00:23:04.039 --> 00:23:09.439
after I got saved there in Southern California at Fallbrook High School. And I remember that

00:23:09.439 --> 00:23:16.439
young man saying to me, Jesus didn't die for me. They took Jesus and they killed him. And

00:23:16.519 --> 00:23:20.519
I didn't know a whole lot about the Bible, but I knew a few verses and I was able to

00:23:20.519 --> 00:23:27.319
show him and tell him about some verses where the Bible says that, that he gave himself.

00:23:27.319 --> 00:23:34.319
That no man taketh it from me, but I lay it down. See, his death was voluntary. It

00:23:35.759 --> 00:23:42.759
was violent. It was voluntary. In Hebrews chapter 12, it's a passage of scripture that

00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:49.519
I often reference. In fact, for a number of years, it was one of the verses of scripture

00:23:49.519 --> 00:23:55.679
that I often would sign after my name in an email or a letter or if I were to sign something,

00:23:55.679 --> 00:24:01.239
I would use Hebrews 12, 1 and 2, precious verses of scripture. At some point in the

00:24:01.239 --> 00:24:08.239
last 10 or 12 years, God fixed my attention upon 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 15 and that

00:24:08.799 --> 00:24:15.319
now is the verse that I always sign my name with. But in Hebrews 12 and verses 1 and 2,

00:24:15.319 --> 00:24:21.759
the Bible says this, wherefore seeing we also are encompassed about with so great a cloud

00:24:21.759 --> 00:24:26.319
of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us

00:24:26.319 --> 00:24:33.079
and let us run with patience the race that is set before us. Look at verse 2, looking

00:24:33.079 --> 00:24:39.879
unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith and then notice these words, who for

00:24:39.879 --> 00:24:46.879
the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame and is set down

00:24:47.879 --> 00:24:54.879
at the right hand of the throne of God. For the joy that was set before him, he endured

00:24:57.999 --> 00:25:04.319
the cross. See, it was voluntary. The Bible tells us in 1 Peter that he left us an example

00:25:04.319 --> 00:25:08.399
that we should follow his steps, but if you look in the text of scripture in 1 Peter chapter

00:25:08.399 --> 00:25:13.399
number 2, it tells us that the example that he left us is that when he was reviled, he

00:25:13.439 --> 00:25:20.199
reviled not again. When he suffered, he threatened not. He willingly laid down his life for his

00:25:20.199 --> 00:25:26.279
sheep. It was a violent death. It was a voluntary death. Number 3 this morning, if you're keeping

00:25:26.279 --> 00:25:31.399
notes, the death of Christ was a vicarious death. It was a vicarious death. What does

00:25:31.399 --> 00:25:36.359
that word mean? Well, it means that it was substitutionary. He took my place. We talk

00:25:36.359 --> 00:25:41.199
about the vicarious atonement. We talk about the substitutionary atonement and I'm thankful

00:25:41.199 --> 00:25:45.879
this morning that as we look at the scriptures that we understand, even if you look in the

00:25:45.879 --> 00:25:51.739
gospel records that there was a man that was in prison that Pilate had this discussion

00:25:51.739 --> 00:25:58.239
with those that brought Jesus before him during the hearing, during the trial and this man

00:25:58.239 --> 00:26:05.239
Pilate was going to release one and he offers to release Barabbas. Barabbas, I believe because

00:26:05.559 --> 00:26:11.839
of his own sin, because of his doings, he was guilty of death and he was going to be

00:26:11.839 --> 00:26:17.879
crucified. In fact, I believe that along with those other two thieves, it was Barabbas that

00:26:17.879 --> 00:26:24.879
would have hung upon that cross. But word comes and Barabbas is set free and Jesus instead

00:26:25.879 --> 00:26:32.879
is crucified. In a very real way, we could say that that cross was intended for Barabbas

00:26:35.579 --> 00:26:41.799
but we understand this morning that that cross was intended for each of us. It was our cross.

00:26:41.799 --> 00:26:48.799
It was each of us that were guilty, that were guilty of sin. I've said often from the pulpit

00:26:49.479 --> 00:26:56.239
that the reason that we, as we look at scripture, the reason that we understand the significance

00:26:56.239 --> 00:27:03.239
of the death of Christ and his glorious resurrection is that we're guilty. We're guilty and we're

00:27:04.359 --> 00:27:11.199
in need of a savior, a substitute. The vicarious death, he took my place, he took your place

00:27:11.199 --> 00:27:17.239
on the cross of Calvary. 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 20 says this, that he made him

00:27:17.239 --> 00:27:24.239
to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in

00:27:25.799 --> 00:27:32.799
him. He took your place. What an awesome truth of scripture. I want you to look at 2 Peter,

00:27:33.879 --> 00:27:39.999
excuse me, 1 Peter in chapter number 3. I just quoted 2 Corinthians 5.20 but I want

00:27:39.999 --> 00:27:46.999
you to look at 1 Peter chapter 3. As we understand this morning, that Jesus was crucified and

00:27:47.559 --> 00:27:53.039
the fact that we are guilty sinners, so often when I talk to people I'll ask them, you have

00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:59.199
to understand that you're lost before you ever realize that you need a savior. Amen?

00:27:59.199 --> 00:28:04.279
If you don't know that you're lost, if you don't know that you're in judgment because

00:28:04.279 --> 00:28:09.959
of your sin, then you never recognize your need for a savior. We find, the Bible says

00:28:09.959 --> 00:28:15.799
all have sin. We're all condemned. He that believeth not, John chapter 3, is condemned

00:28:15.799 --> 00:28:21.999
already. That's what the Bible tells us. And we find that as we look at the scriptures

00:28:21.999 --> 00:28:28.599
and we understand that as we talk to people, we say, are you a sinner? Very few times I've

00:28:28.599 --> 00:28:34.199
had anyone tell me, no, I'm not a sinner. Often I'll have somebody say something like

00:28:34.199 --> 00:28:41.199
this, well I'm not that bad. How do you determine that? I mean, what is your criteria by you

00:28:42.199 --> 00:28:47.759
determining that you're really not that bad? And often, well I've never murdered anyone.

00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:52.999
Well that's a good thing. I'm glad that you've not murdered anyone. Amen? But the reality

00:28:52.999 --> 00:28:59.679
is that we've all sinned. Sometimes we look at sin and we try to categorize sin and say,

00:28:59.679 --> 00:29:03.679
well this one's worse than this one and so on and so forth, but sin is sin and we're

00:29:03.679 --> 00:29:08.639
guilty. In fact, people try to do that with lying. They talk about little white lies.

00:29:08.639 --> 00:29:13.759
Did you ever hear that phraseology? A lie is a lie. By the way, Revelation says all

00:29:13.759 --> 00:29:19.359
liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone. So we understand

00:29:19.359 --> 00:29:24.399
this morning that we're guilty. But I want you to see in 1 Peter 3 and verse number 18,

00:29:24.399 --> 00:29:31.639
the Bible says this, for Christ also hath once suffered for sins. But you understand

00:29:31.639 --> 00:29:36.479
that he's not a sinner. He never sinned. He's perfect. He's God. In fact, if you were to

00:29:36.479 --> 00:29:41.239
cross-reference to Hebrews 9 and Hebrews 10, you'll understand that in those passages

00:29:41.239 --> 00:29:49.079
of Scripture, it's referring to the offering that Christ made once for sin forever. We

00:29:49.079 --> 00:29:53.119
find that there's a contrast that is made, how in the high priest would enter into the

00:29:53.119 --> 00:30:00.119
holy of holies, and he would first make an atonement for his own sin, then for the sin

00:30:00.119 --> 00:30:05.199
the sin of the people. We read that in Hebrews 9 and 10. You can read in the Old Testament

00:30:05.199 --> 00:30:08.799
and that's the pattern. Why? Because the high priest, though he was in that office,

00:30:08.799 --> 00:30:16.119
he himself was still a sinner. But Jesus, our great high priest, God in flesh, never

00:30:16.119 --> 00:30:21.859
sinned. He's perfect. He's just. He, when he made an offering for sin, did not need

00:30:21.859 --> 00:30:28.399
to make an offering for his own sin. He had no sin. He made an offering for the sin of

00:30:28.399 --> 00:30:34.719
the world. He took upon us, upon himself, our sins. He took upon himself the sin of

00:30:34.719 --> 00:30:42.599
the world. The Bible says here that he suffered for sins, the just for the unjust. Then notice

00:30:42.599 --> 00:30:51.759
this phrase that he might bring us to God. Literally reconciliation. We were at enmity

00:30:51.759 --> 00:31:00.199
with God. But he provides this way of reconciliation. The Bible says being put to death in the flesh,

00:31:00.199 --> 00:31:08.319
but quickened by the Spirit, the resurrection. And this morning when we think about, we understand

00:31:08.319 --> 00:31:14.119
the death of Christ, it was a violent death, it was a voluntary death, it was a vicarious

00:31:14.119 --> 00:31:19.279
death. Could I say this this morning, number four? The death of Christ was a victorious

00:31:19.279 --> 00:31:25.759
death. It was a victorious death. I'm thankful for the victory, yes, at the garden with the

00:31:25.759 --> 00:31:34.519
resurrection and we understand that his death, the death of Christ, does not end the account.

00:31:34.519 --> 00:31:41.039
Oh, they buried him in a borrowed tomb and three days later he rose conquering sin, death

00:31:41.039 --> 00:31:46.139
and the grave. But I want you to consider with me, I mentioned earlier that John 19,

00:31:46.139 --> 00:31:50.859
so turn over there if you will, in John 19 and I want you to see what Jesus says here

00:31:50.859 --> 00:31:57.139
in this passage of scripture, the record of this, the crucifixion of Christ given by John

00:31:57.139 --> 00:32:03.939
here. In John chapter 19, you could begin in verse 17 and read throughout this account

00:32:03.939 --> 00:32:08.699
here that is given with regard to the crucifixion. We're going to jump right in the midst of

00:32:08.699 --> 00:32:17.459
it. In verse number 28, the Bible says, after this Jesus, knowing that all things were now

00:32:17.459 --> 00:32:23.499
accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith I, thirst. Now there was said a vessel

00:32:23.499 --> 00:32:28.179
full of vinegar and they filled a sponge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it

00:32:28.179 --> 00:32:34.819
to his mouth. We read of that in Matthew 27 and verse 48. We mentioned that in Matthew

00:32:34.819 --> 00:32:42.139
27, the Bible says that he cried. We mentioned it does not tell us exactly. It says in Jesus

00:32:42.139 --> 00:32:46.459
when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. In verse 50, but now

00:32:46.459 --> 00:32:51.819
look in verse 30 here of John 19, it says when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar,

00:32:51.819 --> 00:33:02.179
he said, it is finished. Aren't those three precious words? It is finished. And he bowed

00:33:02.179 --> 00:33:12.779
his head and gave up the ghost. He died. He died a real death. There are some false teachers

00:33:12.779 --> 00:33:17.539
that teach that he didn't really die and he didn't really rise and all those types of

00:33:17.539 --> 00:33:24.659
things but we see that he died. In fact, the evidence is given in the next few verses,

00:33:24.659 --> 00:33:29.139
the Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, verse 31, the body should not remain upon

00:33:29.139 --> 00:33:33.819
the cross on the Sabbath day. For that Sabbath day was a high day, the salt pilot, that their

00:33:33.819 --> 00:33:37.899
legs might be broken and that they might be taken away. Remember I mentioned that earlier

00:33:37.899 --> 00:33:44.659
that to expedite the process because they had made it a crucifixion to be such a long

00:33:44.659 --> 00:33:51.819
drawn out process of great pain and inflict as much pain as possible. But if they needed

00:33:51.819 --> 00:33:56.459
to expedite the process, they would break the legs and we see that in verse 31. Verse

00:33:56.459 --> 00:34:01.139
32, then came the soldiers and break the legs of the first and of the other which was

00:34:01.139 --> 00:34:08.979
crucified with him. But, notice verse 33, when they came to Jesus and saw that he was

00:34:08.979 --> 00:34:15.059
dead already. They break not his legs. You can look over at Psalm 34 and verse 20, we

00:34:15.059 --> 00:34:19.179
won't take the time to do that. But one of the soldiers, verse 34, with a spear pierced

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:23.939
his side and forthwith came there out blood and water and he that saw it bare a record

00:34:23.939 --> 00:34:29.699
and his record is true and he knoweth that he sayeth, and he knoweth that he sayeth true

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:33.699
that ye might believe for these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled.

00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:39.099
A bone of him shall not be broken and again another scripture saith they shall look on

00:34:39.099 --> 00:34:45.059
him whom they pierced. It's amazing when you study the prophecies that are fulfilled during

00:34:45.059 --> 00:34:50.379
the crucifixion and you read of the prophecies, understand that those that are carrying out

00:34:50.379 --> 00:34:55.139
this crucifixion, they were not aware of the prophecies and saying, okay let's do this

00:34:55.139 --> 00:35:00.899
so that we can fulfill this. No, they were crucifying him but Jesus, God, gave us those

00:35:00.899 --> 00:35:07.459
prophecies centuries earlier so that we could understand the fulfillment that he was making

00:35:07.459 --> 00:35:18.019
when he went to that cross. But we find that he says, it is finished. What a great proclamation

00:35:18.019 --> 00:35:24.619
of victory. It is finished. I mentioned by way of introduction this morning that there

00:35:24.619 --> 00:35:30.939
was a promise today as we sit here in 2024, the promise that was given to Abraham in Genesis

00:35:30.939 --> 00:35:38.299
22, 18 is 4,000 years ago roughly that that promise was given and we sit here and as we

00:35:38.299 --> 00:35:42.779
look at the passages of scripture that we've looked at this morning, the time of the Lord

00:35:42.779 --> 00:35:50.619
Jesus Christ was 2,000, 2,100 years after that promise was given to Abraham and we find

00:35:50.619 --> 00:35:59.539
that how was it that God could say to Abraham that in thy seed shall the nations, shall

00:35:59.539 --> 00:36:05.139
all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice and Paul makes it

00:36:05.139 --> 00:36:12.339
clear that he said seed, not seeds and that the seed is Christ and how is it that Christ

00:36:12.939 --> 00:36:19.419
would bring that blessing that was made available through his death on the cross of Calvary.

00:36:19.419 --> 00:36:24.779
His subsequent resurrection that we'll look at next week where he rose in victory conquering

00:36:24.779 --> 00:36:29.979
sin death in the grave. But I want to remind you of two passages. First turn over to Hebrews

00:36:29.979 --> 00:36:51.839
2 if you will. Hebrews chapter number 2 we'll look at a verse of scripture here. In Hebrews

00:36:51.839 --> 00:36:56.459
chapter number 2 look if you will at verse number 14 the Bible says for as much then

00:36:56.459 --> 00:37:02.859
as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part

00:37:02.859 --> 00:37:11.899
of the same. Notice what the Bible says at the end of verse number 14 that through death

00:37:11.899 --> 00:37:22.299
he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil. Through death. It

00:37:22.299 --> 00:37:27.699
was a victorious death. I mean it was a violent death. We've read in the passage of scripture

00:37:27.699 --> 00:37:33.859
in Matthew 27 the violence that surrounded the death of our savior of Christ. We understand

00:37:33.859 --> 00:37:38.179
it was a voluntary death that he went willingly to the cross. It was vicarious. He took my

00:37:38.179 --> 00:37:43.979
place. He suffered and bled and died for me and for you and for all of humankind. We find

00:37:43.979 --> 00:37:52.979
however it's a victorious death. You know the sin of mankind could not be paid for simply

00:37:52.979 --> 00:37:59.339
through the birth of Christ. No that's not sufficient. We don't read in Hebrews 2 that

00:37:59.339 --> 00:38:06.859
through his birth he, no through his death. Yes we read of the glorious resurrection and

00:38:06.859 --> 00:38:11.739
again I mentioned that the resurrection is evidence that his death was sufficient payment

00:38:11.739 --> 00:38:16.019
for the sin of mankind. But we look here and it says in Hebrews 2 remember the book

00:38:16.019 --> 00:38:22.779
of Hebrews is all about Jesus and it's all about how Jesus is better, how he's superior.

00:38:22.779 --> 00:38:28.419
And notice if you will in the first chapter in Hebrews chapter 1 and verse number 3. Notice

00:38:28.419 --> 00:38:32.139
what the Bible says and perhaps I should have read this verse before the one in Hebrews

00:38:32.139 --> 00:38:38.039
2. But the Bible says of Jesus who being the brightness of his glory and the express image

00:38:38.039 --> 00:38:44.899
of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself

00:38:44.899 --> 00:38:53.119
purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high. We find that we go

00:38:53.119 --> 00:38:59.059
through the portion of Hebrews 1 and 2 and we read how Christ is superior and how he's

00:38:59.059 --> 00:39:04.459
better and he's greater. And we come to chapter 2 and we read this truth that through the

00:39:04.459 --> 00:39:12.419
death of Christ he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil.

00:39:12.419 --> 00:39:31.259
First John chapter 3. Look there if you will in first John chapter number 3. In first John

00:39:31.259 --> 00:39:35.059
chapter 3 in verse number 8 the Bible says he that committed the sins of the devil for

00:39:35.059 --> 00:39:40.339
the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the son of God was manifested

00:39:40.339 --> 00:39:48.539
that he might destroy the works of the devil. There are many people today if you look back

00:39:48.539 --> 00:39:56.299
at Hebrews 2 and it tells us how Jesus through his death that he had the opportunity to destroy

00:39:56.299 --> 00:40:00.139
him that had the power of death, that is the devil. But I want you to understand.

00:40:00.139 --> 00:40:06.139
understand the impact, if you will, the application for us in verse number 15, and deliver them

00:40:06.139 --> 00:40:12.579
who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.

00:40:12.579 --> 00:40:20.299
There are a lot of people that are afraid of death, afraid of death, the uncertainty

00:40:20.299 --> 00:40:23.379
of death, what happens.

00:40:23.379 --> 00:40:28.339
You know, there are some brave people, quote-unquote, that will give you a good talk and they'll

00:40:28.339 --> 00:40:32.779
say, I'm not afraid to die, and I don't believe in anything, and I'm my own judge, and all

00:40:32.779 --> 00:40:35.379
these times, I've had people tell me all kinds of crazy stuff.

00:40:35.379 --> 00:40:42.859
Well, I'll tell you what, when you come face-to-face with death, it's a fearful thing, if you don't

00:40:42.859 --> 00:40:48.019
know the Lord Jesus Christ, the one who conquered death.

00:40:48.019 --> 00:40:52.419
We find that He conquered sin, death, and the grave, yes, His death on the cross, His

00:40:52.419 --> 00:40:57.219
subsequent resurrection, and we look this morning at this text of Scripture during this

00:40:57.299 --> 00:41:01.859
time of year as we will be celebrating the resurrection, listen, there's no resurrection

00:41:01.859 --> 00:41:05.179
without a death.

00:41:05.179 --> 00:41:09.139
The resurrection is the cornerstone of our faith, but there's no resurrection without

00:41:09.139 --> 00:41:10.559
a death.

00:41:10.559 --> 00:41:13.939
There's no death without a birth, I mean, all of it is necessary, amen?

00:41:13.939 --> 00:41:17.979
You can't just take one piece of it, all of it is necessary, and we find it as we come

00:41:17.979 --> 00:41:24.619
to the Scriptures and we open the Word of God, and we have this great truth of how Jesus,

00:41:24.619 --> 00:41:28.979
God in flesh, died for us.

00:41:28.979 --> 00:41:36.779
He died for humanity, and we find that He died for humanity because He loved His creation.

00:41:36.779 --> 00:41:43.979
He's the Creator, and He loved, for God so loved the world.

00:41:43.979 --> 00:41:50.819
But God commendeth His love toward us, and that while we're yet sinners, Christ died

00:41:50.819 --> 00:41:55.179
for us.

00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:59.619
Two takeaways this morning, number one, I hope that as we look at a passage of Scripture

00:41:59.619 --> 00:42:04.699
like Matthew 27, as we consider the other verses of Scripture this morning, I hope that

00:42:04.699 --> 00:42:09.219
you would not be guilty of neglecting so great salvation.

00:42:09.219 --> 00:42:15.939
I hope this morning that you would rejoice regularly in your salvation, that you would

00:42:15.939 --> 00:42:23.819
be aware regularly in your daily life of what Christ did so that you could go to heaven.

00:42:23.819 --> 00:42:29.259
I hope that you understand, I mean, every day of your life, how blessed you are to have

00:42:29.259 --> 00:42:34.459
been given the truth of the Gospel, to be saved by the blood of Christ.

00:42:34.459 --> 00:42:39.339
But I hope this morning not only would we rejoice in these wonderful truths, but I hope

00:42:39.339 --> 00:42:44.619
that we'd be challenged to share this wonderful truth with those that we come into contact

00:42:44.619 --> 00:42:46.059
with.

00:42:46.059 --> 00:42:54.439
You know, there are countless people in our community that have no idea why Jesus died.

00:42:54.439 --> 00:42:59.979
Many that don't even believe in Jesus, I understand that, but even as you begin to

00:42:59.979 --> 00:43:08.859
have a conversation with them about Jesus, why did He die?

00:43:08.859 --> 00:43:11.859
You're left with blank stares.

00:43:11.859 --> 00:43:17.499
You're left with sometimes answers that are not biblical.

00:43:17.499 --> 00:43:18.619
They do not understand.

00:43:18.619 --> 00:43:25.859
They do not have the truth that we hold dear today, and so that gives us a responsibility.

00:43:25.859 --> 00:43:27.539
It gives us an opportunity.

00:43:27.539 --> 00:43:31.539
I guarantee you this week, as you go throughout your week, that you're going to come in contact

00:43:31.539 --> 00:43:33.619
with someone.

00:43:33.619 --> 00:43:38.099
Unless you sit at home all week and do nothing, you're going to come in contact with someone

00:43:39.099 --> 00:43:42.699
that needs to know the truth that we dealt with today.

00:43:42.699 --> 00:43:47.499
That God, listen, this time of year, I know it's been overly commercialized and the Easter

00:43:47.499 --> 00:43:49.779
Bunny and all that nonsense.

00:43:49.779 --> 00:43:53.779
I understand, it's crazy.

00:43:53.779 --> 00:43:58.539
It's distracting from the truth.

00:43:58.539 --> 00:44:01.179
The truth is that we serve a risen Savior.

00:44:01.179 --> 00:44:04.819
The truth is the resurrection only happens because He died.

00:44:04.819 --> 00:44:09.099
And we must recognize this morning, it was a violent death.

00:44:09.099 --> 00:44:12.899
I'm thankful to have free salvation.

00:44:12.899 --> 00:44:14.259
Some people say, I'm trying to work for it.

00:44:14.259 --> 00:44:15.259
You can't work for it.

00:44:15.259 --> 00:44:17.299
It's already been paid for.

00:44:17.299 --> 00:44:20.379
You know how crazy it is if somebody was trying to give you a gift?

00:44:20.379 --> 00:44:24.179
I mean, they try to give you a gift and you say, well, I'll take it, but I'll work for

00:44:24.179 --> 00:44:25.179
it.

00:44:25.179 --> 00:44:28.659
No, no, no, it's not a gift anymore.

00:44:28.659 --> 00:44:29.659
Amen?

00:44:29.659 --> 00:44:32.739
And Jesus said, I have a gift for you.

00:44:32.739 --> 00:44:39.419
The gift of God's eternal life is a violent death, is a voluntary death, vicarious death,

00:44:39.419 --> 00:44:41.339
a victorious death.

00:44:41.339 --> 00:44:49.339
And we sing the victory, we shout the victory, and we proclaim a glorious message to a lost

00:44:49.339 --> 00:44:54.379
and dying world that Jesus saves, Jesus saves.

00:44:54.379 --> 00:44:59.979
First Timothy, Paul said this, this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that

00:45:00.219 --> 00:45:03.979
Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.

00:45:03.979 --> 00:45:06.899
He says, of whom I am chief.

00:45:06.899 --> 00:45:08.699
How did he accomplish that?

00:45:08.699 --> 00:45:13.019
Through the death on the cross, his subsequent resurrection.

00:45:13.019 --> 00:45:20.699
I hope this morning that you recognize and appreciate greatly your salvation.

00:45:20.699 --> 00:45:25.499
You recognize what Christ did so that you could be saved.

00:45:25.499 --> 00:45:32.779
But I hope also that God would stir us up and give us a passion to tell somebody about

00:45:32.779 --> 00:45:33.859
Jesus.

00:45:33.859 --> 00:45:36.899
We sing today about Jesus coming back.

00:45:36.899 --> 00:45:41.059
If you're looking at things in the world, I mean, listen, it seems like Jesus is coming

00:45:41.059 --> 00:45:42.059
back soon.

00:45:42.059 --> 00:45:46.339
I don't know, no man knoweth the hour, but I want to be busy about doing the work of

00:45:46.339 --> 00:45:47.339
God.

00:45:47.339 --> 00:45:52.179
Oh, I'll tell them later at a more convenient time.

00:45:52.179 --> 00:45:54.899
You may not have another opportunity.

00:45:54.899 --> 00:45:58.059
You may not have a more convenient time.

00:45:58.059 --> 00:46:00.619
We must redeem the time that God has given us.

00:46:00.619 --> 00:46:06.179
They crucified him, but he gave up his life for us.

00:46:06.179 --> 00:46:07.179
Let's pray.

00:46:07.179 --> 00:46:08.179
Father, we love you.

00:46:08.179 --> 00:46:09.179
We thank you for loving us.

00:46:09.179 --> 00:46:10.859
We thank you for your word.

00:46:10.859 --> 00:46:15.579
We thank you for your substitutionary death on the cross of Calvary.

00:46:15.579 --> 00:46:21.499
I thank you that you took my place, you took our place.

00:46:21.499 --> 00:46:24.779
God, it's such a blessing to know that heaven is our home.

00:46:24.779 --> 00:46:29.819
God, if there's one present that's not sure of heaven, they've never been saved.

00:46:29.819 --> 00:46:33.379
They've never understood these truths that we looked at this morning.

00:46:33.379 --> 00:46:37.659
Maybe they're trying to get to heaven on their own by some good works or some other ideas.

00:46:37.659 --> 00:46:43.779
Lord, I pray that you would help them this morning to understand the truth of your word.

00:46:43.779 --> 00:46:49.079
They would understand that they're a sinner in need of the only Savior, the Lord Jesus

00:46:49.079 --> 00:46:52.639
Christ, that he bled and died to take their place.

00:46:52.639 --> 00:46:56.719
He was buried and he rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:46:56.719 --> 00:47:02.399
God, I pray that you would help us to have a passion to reach the lost.

00:47:02.399 --> 00:47:13.999
Lord, give us a desire to obey, to be willing to go out and tell others.

00:47:14.519 --> 00:47:20.559
Lord, give us opportunities, give us divine appointments, and I pray that you would help

00:47:20.559 --> 00:47:22.759
us, Lord, to be faithful.

00:47:22.759 --> 00:47:25.799
Help us to pray even as the disciples prayed in the book of Acts.

00:47:25.799 --> 00:47:32.759
God, give us boldness, that we may open our mouth with boldness, that we might speak as

00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:34.959
we ought to speak.

00:47:34.959 --> 00:47:38.999
I pray that you'd work and move in the hearts and lives of those that are gathered through

00:47:38.999 --> 00:47:41.119
this time of invitation.

00:47:41.119 --> 00:47:42.479
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:47:42.479 --> 00:47:45.359
You just stand with me, heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:47:45.359 --> 00:47:48.759
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano as we have a time of invitation, give you

00:47:48.759 --> 00:47:50.159
an opportunity to respond.

00:47:50.159 --> 00:47:53.039
If you're not sure of heaven, we'll take a Bible and show you how you can know for sure

00:47:53.039 --> 00:47:54.039
that heaven's your home.

00:47:54.039 --> 00:47:57.479
Maybe you just need to come to the Old Fashioned Altar and pray this morning as Kimberly plays

00:47:57.479 --> 00:47:58.479
The Altar is Open.
