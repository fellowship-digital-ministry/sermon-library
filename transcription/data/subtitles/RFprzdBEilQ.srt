1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
exhorting one another."

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,440
Notice this phrase,

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:10,399
"...and so much the more as ye see the day approaching."

4
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:15,479
I've often said from this pulpit that we're living in the last days.

5
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:18,799
In fact, I have preached on the rapture of the church many times,

6
00:00:18,799 --> 00:00:22,680
and I believe that it is the next event on God's prophetic calendar.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,239
We've said this often, that the rapture of the church is imminent.

8
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:29,120
I believe that as we understand the biblical truth

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,920
with regard to the return of Christ being imminent,

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,000
the rapture being imminent,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,259
that it should have a profound, powerful impact on every child of God.

12
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:45,080
It should cause us to understand that, as I've said many times from this pulpit,

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,000
that today could be the day.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,639
And we understand that as we look at our society,

15
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:51,200
as we look at the Word of God,

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,119
that certainly God has given us the ability to see the day approaching.

17
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:59,919
He tells us in this verse of Scripture some things that we do

18
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:02,279
because we see the day approaching.

19
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:05,839
Number one is we should not forsake the assembling of ourselves together.

20
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:08,760
We need more church, not less church, amen?

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,080
And the church is God's idea.

22
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,599
It's not man's idea.

23
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,800
It's God's idea.

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,279
It's God's plan.

25
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:19,440
It's God's organism for this era of human history.

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,559
We find that he says that we're not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together.

27
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:25,599
He says, as the manner of some is,

28
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,040
he says this, that we're to exhort one another.

29
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,839
And what an opportunity that we have to exhort,

30
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:34,120
to encourage one another, the believers, the brethren.

31
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,199
We understand, I believe Mark has said it before,

32
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:39,199
that sometimes someone might say,

33
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,480
well, I don't need to go to church,

34
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,199
but maybe somebody else needs you to be at church.

35
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:45,959
And the reality is that as we come,

36
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,879
we come with that anticipation,

37
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:50,599
with that expectation that God's going to work.

38
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,199
God's going to move.

39
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,680
God's gonna show me something.

40
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,879
He's gonna reveal himself to me.

41
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:58,279
I don't wanna be like Thomas that wasn't there

42
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:01,040
in the room when Jesus appeared, amen?

43
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,959
And the reality is that I believe this morning

44
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:07,720
that even a casual observer will notice

45
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,559
that there are many global events that are taking place

46
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:16,559
that enable us to see the day approaching.

47
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,039
Now, we understand that the study of prophecy

48
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,399
is fascinating.

49
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:23,520
The study of prophecy is exciting.

50
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,360
And I'm thankful that God has given us

51
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,639
prophetic passages of scripture.

52
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,080
In fact, much of God's word contains prophetic passages.

53
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,320
And you begin to read of prophecy,

54
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,440
and you understand that we are to be the students

55
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,479
of the word of God.

56
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,199
And as students of the scripture,

57
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,119
we understand that prophecy is part

58
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:44,039
of the whole of God's word.

59
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,720
And so we're to study prophecy,

60
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,559
but we're understanding this morning

61
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:50,399
that as God has given us prophecy,

62
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:53,360
that he's recorded certain things in his word,

63
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,119
that he's not recorded those things

64
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:57,080
so that we could set a date.

65
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,119
He's not recorded those things so that we could say,

66
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:03,279
here's the day and time of when the rapture will take place.

67
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:06,039
For we know ourselves that the scriptures tell us

68
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,320
that no man knoweth the hour.

69
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,759
In fact, when Jesus is answering the disciples,

70
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,520
they inquire of him with regard to the kingdom

71
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,639
in Acts chapter number one, prior to his ascension.

72
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,639
He says this in verse number seven,

73
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:23,320
it is not for you to know the times or the seasons

74
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,199
which the father hath put in his own power.

75
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,320
Yet we find as we study the scriptures

76
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,240
that God has given us revelation.

77
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,440
He's given us prophecy that enables us

78
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,240
to see the day approaching.

79
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:42,839
Recurring question that seems to be a talking point

80
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:44,479
of the day in which we're living

81
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,600
is with regard to Ezekiel's prophecy in Ezekiel 38 and 39.

82
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,160
It'd be kind of the study by which we're going to look at

83
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,639
this morning, so if you turn back to the book of Ezekiel

84
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,160
and look in Ezekiel 38 and 39,

85
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,759
I've heard many times in the last several weeks,

86
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,279
the last month, with regard to Russia's invasion of Ukraine,

87
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:08,000
this question, is it Gog and Magog?

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,199
And some of you have probably heard that.

89
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,759
There are many videos that have been posted.

90
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,519
In fact, even those that are not Bible believers

91
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,720
have written articles in newspapers

92
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,399
with regard to what's going on over there

93
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,880
in that part of the world

94
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,720
and whether or not this is Gog and Magog.

95
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,519
Let me say this, bottom line up front,

96
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,359
no, it's not Gog and Magog.

97
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:33,000
And we know that very confidently

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,160
that this is not Gog and Magog.

99
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,160
But I do believe that as you study

100
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,600
the passage of scripture here in the book of Ezekiel,

101
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,279
that this current crisis is not Gog and Magog.

102
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,799
I believe that there are characteristics

103
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:51,320
of this particular situation that can lead to

104
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,399
the event that is prophesied by Ezekiel

105
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,359
here in Ezekiel 38 and 39.

106
00:04:57,359 --> 00:05:00,399
Before we dive right into this passage of scripture,

107
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,040
let me just give you a very quick kind of outline,

108
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,779
if you will, of the latter part of the book of Ezekiel,

109
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:10,160
because I believe it helps us to understand

110
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,760
some of the timing in what's taking place.

111
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,359
In Ezekiel chapters 35 and 36,

112
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:17,000
what you're reading of the prophecies

113
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,959
in those chapters of Ezekiel

114
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,119
are really dealing with the regathering of Israel.

115
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:26,019
Now, since 1948, we've seen a measure of that happening.

116
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:29,399
I believe it's going to continue to increase exponentially.

117
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:32,359
You're going to continue to see this regathering.

118
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:34,559
In Ezekiel chapter number 37,

119
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:37,000
you read of the valley of dry bones

120
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,040
and you read of the nation of Israel

121
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,119
really being revived and reunited

122
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:44,079
there in Ezekiel chapter 37.

123
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:46,739
And then you have chapters 38 and 39

124
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:49,359
that deal with Gog and Magog.

125
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:51,880
And then in chapter number 40 of the book of Ezekiel,

126
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,600
through the end of the book, chapter number 48,

127
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,600
you deal with millennial prophecies with regard to Israel.

128
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,440
And so as we begin to understand and unfold

129
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,679
this latter portion of the book of Ezekiel,

130
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:06,519
it really kind of helps us with some of the timeline

131
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,480
and some of what's taking place.

132
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,279
Let me make one other note with regard to prophecy.

133
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:16,100
Sometimes, in fact, I would say often,

134
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,600
God gives us prophecy not so that we could set a date,

135
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,279
but rather when that prophecy is fulfilled

136
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:27,100
that we can acknowledge that he's God.

137
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,000
When you see the fulfillment of prophecy

138
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,040
and you begin to see he is who he says he is,

139
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,399
he is God and he is eternal

140
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:40,519
and he's prophesied these things and they've come to pass.

141
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:43,399
Now, we understand this morning that every prophecy

142
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,799
that you look at in the scriptures

143
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:48,519
concerning the first coming of Christ has been fulfilled.

144
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:51,760
And we understand that that gives us great confidence

145
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,440
and understanding that every prophecy with regard

146
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,579
to his second coming will be fulfilled

147
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:58,640
exactly as it's been given.

148
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,239
We find that the word of God, that our God, he is faithful

149
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:04,540
and God's word is trustworthy.

150
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,980
And I think about even the crucifixion

151
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,179
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

152
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:10,519
It's interesting and probably in a couple of weeks,

153
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,019
I'll preach a message from the book of,

154
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:13,660
probably the book of Matthew.

155
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,500
But the reality is that when you consider the crucifixion

156
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,260
of the Lord Jesus Christ, you'll read many times

157
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,619
where the Bible says that the scriptures were fulfilled.

158
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:25,679
You understand that those Roman soldiers

159
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,339
were not doing what they were doing

160
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:30,820
in order to fulfill scripture.

161
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,739
In reality, what's happening is the events are unfolding

162
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:39,100
and as they unfold, it's fulfilling prophecy.

163
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,820
And it's helping us to see that just as God had prophesied,

164
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,299
these things are coming to pass.

165
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,220
And so as we consider the subject this morning,

166
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,100
as you see the day approaching and we answer the question

167
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,619
that has been asked by so many,

168
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:54,459
that's become so prevalent in our day today

169
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:58,279
with regard to Ezekiel's prophecy in Ezekiel 38 and 39,

170
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,440
turn to that passage

171
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,359
and let's look at the prophecy recorded.

172
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:02,899
If you're taking notes this morning,

173
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,019
number one, the prophecy recorded.

174
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:07,220
Look in verse number one of Ezekiel 38.

175
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,059
The Bible says this,

176
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:10,440
and the word of the Lord came unto me saying,

177
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,480
son of man, that's the name,

178
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,519
the term that is given to Ezekiel.

179
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,579
He's referred to that throughout the entirety of the book.

180
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:21,119
Notice what it says, set thy face against Gog,

181
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:25,239
the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshach and Tubal,

182
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:28,200
and prophesy against him.

183
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,760
And say, thus saith the Lord God,

184
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,520
behold, I am against thee, O Gog,

185
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,520
the chief prince of Meshach and Tubal.

186
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,679
Notice verse number four,

187
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,880
and I will turn thee back and put hooks into thy jaws,

188
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,280
and I will bring thee forth and all thine army,

189
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,400
horses and horsemen, and all them,

190
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,479
clothed with all sorts of armor,

191
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:50,640
even a great company with bucklers and shields,

192
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,719
all of them handling swords,

193
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:55,840
Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya,

194
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,520
with them, all of them with shield and helmet,

195
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,280
Gomer and all his bands,

196
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,880
the house of Togarmah of the north quarters,

197
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,559
and all his bands, and many people with thee.

198
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,239
As we look at these first six verses

199
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:10,559
of Ezekiel chapter number 38,

200
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,799
we consider the prophecy that's recorded.

201
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,919
We see, first of all, the players.

202
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,880
First of all, you see the phrase Gog.

203
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,760
You understand that Gog is not a place, rather a person.

204
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,359
You find that Gog is really the ruler of the people,

205
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:26,799
because it says here against Gog, the land of Gog,

206
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,039
the chief prince of Meshach and Tubal

207
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,039
in verse number two of Ezekiel 38.

208
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,280
So we find that Gog being the ruler of the people,

209
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,039
and Magog that is mentioned there in verse number two.

210
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:41,440
Now, Magog is the land of the Scythians.

211
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,359
Let me say this.

212
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:44,880
Both historians and theologians

213
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,200
for really a long period of time

214
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,440
have agreed that this is Russia.

215
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,559
That is a common agreement amongst theologians

216
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:58,479
and historians that the land of Magog is Russia,

217
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:00,080
as we'd refer to it today.

218
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,840
It's interesting, for it tells us in verse number six, notice what it says, of the house

219
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,360
of Togarmah, of the north quarters.

220
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,560
Skip down, if you will, to verse number 15, and notice what the Bible says there.

221
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,920
And thou shalt come from thy place, notice what it says, out of the north parts, thou

222
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,240
and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty

223
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,800
army.

224
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,500
And so we find that it speaks of the north quarters in verse number six, it speaks in

225
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,280
verse number 15 of coming from thy place out of the north parts.

226
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:43,740
It's interesting to note from a geographic perspective that Moscow is almost due north

227
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,620
of Jerusalem by 662 miles.

228
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,120
It's not exactly due north, but it's really close.

229
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,540
And you see, of course, if you look at a map, you see that Russia obviously is that land

230
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,260
that is occupied that is to the north.

231
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,900
Notice as we continue to look at the passage of Scripture, the players that are given to

232
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,900
us.

233
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,220
In verse number three, it speaks of Meshach and Tubal.

234
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,340
Notice in verse number four, it speaks of Persia.

235
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:12,900
It says this, excuse me, in verse number five, the first mention there is Persia.

236
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,440
Now that's interesting because that's the land of Iran.

237
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,860
And if you're familiar with history, you'd understand that in 1935, up until 1935, it

238
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,660
was referred to as Persia.

239
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,440
And in 1935, in fact, in March of 1935, they changed from Persia to Iran.

240
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,520
And then there was some big skirmish about it and some just, it was not super popular

241
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,520
or what have you.

242
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:43,580
And so in 1959, they decided that Persia and Iran could be used interchangeably.

243
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,820
And that's the land that's being spoken of there.

244
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:51,500
Notice he speaks also of Ethiopia in verse number five and Libya with them in verse number

245
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,060
seven, excuse me, in verse number six, he speaks of Gomer.

246
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,020
This is the seventh that's mentioned here.

247
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:03,540
We believe, as you look at many historians and theologians, that this is referring to

248
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,380
the region of Turkey and Ukraine.

249
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:11,260
And you would find that he also speaks about the house of Tagarmah there in verse number

250
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,260
six.

251
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,260
Again, this would really be the southeast section of Turkey near Syria, possibly even

252
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,260
including the region of Syria.

253
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,300
And so you begin to understand the players that are mentioned with regard to what's taking

254
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,300
place.

255
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,420
But I want you to understand something very important in verse number four.

256
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,500
God is speaking, right?

257
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,460
He's saying to Ezekiel, prophesy against him.

258
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:37,540
He says in verse number three, thus saith the Lord God, but look in verse number four,

259
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,100
the Bible says, I will turn thee back and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring

260
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,100
thee forth.

261
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,860
I want you to understand this morning that God is always in control.

262
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,860
God is in control.

263
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:56,460
Does Gog, the prince, the ruler of the people, does this coalition that's mentioned here,

264
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,700
all of these players, do they have evil intent themselves?

265
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,700
Sure they do.

266
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,700
The Bible tells us in verse number 12 that their purpose is to take a spoil.

267
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,420
They look at an opportunity and they want to take a spoil, but we must always recognize

268
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,860
that God Almighty rules in the affairs of mankind.

269
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,800
He is on his throne.

270
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,400
There is nothing happening today that has surprised God.

271
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,320
There are times in which we live in this society, we live in this world, we live in time, and

272
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,480
we can think at times that, man, it's all falling apart, and there's all this chaos

273
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,560
and confusion, and I just don't know, and we might wring our hands, but God never wrings

274
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,040
his hands.

275
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,280
God is in control.

276
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,040
And that should cause us to rejoice greatly.

277
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,440
That should cause us to have a peace that passeth all understanding.

278
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,960
That should cause us to have great hope and great expectation that our God is on the throne.

279
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
Amen?

280
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,720
And we find that that's revealed to us even as we look at the prophecy recorded dealing

281
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
with the players.

282
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,400
Now, I want you to consider with me the timing.

283
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,560
I said to you at the beginning of the message that I do not believe this is Gog and Magog.

284
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,320
Number one, they're going against Ukraine right now, and the prophecy of Gog and Magog

285
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:11,080
is against Israel, and so that's a very easy identifier as to why it's not.

286
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,120
But again, I believe that Ukraine is part of that whole thing as you look at all the

287
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,120
players that are mentioned, and certainly could be leading to that time in which we

288
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,680
see the fulfillment of Gog and Magog.

289
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,280
Let me say this when we consider the timing.

290
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
Look in verse number seven.

291
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,560
It says, Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company, that are

292
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,240
assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.

293
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,000
Notice in verse number eight, it speaks to us about the timing.

294
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,920
And after many days thou shalt be visited, notice this, in the latter years thou shalt

295
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:48,280
come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered out of many people

296
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,480
against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste.

297
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,660
It says this, but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely

298
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,840
all of them.

299
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:03,280
And so in verse number eight, he specifically mentions in the latter years thou shalt come

300
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,720
into the land that is brought back from the sword.

301
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:11,800
Notice if you will, skip down here into verse number 16, and here we'll see again some insight

302
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,680
with regard to the timing.

303
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,160
It says in verse number 16, And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel as a cloud

304
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,160
to cover the land.

305
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
We see that earlier.

306
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,200
We'll look at that again.

307
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,840
It says this, It shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that

308
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:34,120
the heathen may know me when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.

309
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,680
And so we see that in verse number eight, he mentions latter years.

310
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,640
In verse number 16, he mentions latter days.

311
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:46,000
But God gives us more insight into the passage of Scripture with regard to the timing, and

312
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,280
that's found, continue reading verse number nine, it says, Thou shalt ascend and come

313
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:55,440
like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou and all thy bands, and

314
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,360
many people with thee, again the size of the army, and them descending upon Israel.

315
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,240
Thus saith the Lord God in verse number 10, It shall also come to pass, that at the same

316
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:10,200
time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an evil thought.

317
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,640
And here's what thou shalt say, I will go up to a land, notice what it says, of unwalled

318
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
villages.

319
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,280
Now, what do we know about walls?

320
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,360
In biblical times, it was a sign of security, of safety.

321
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,240
You would have walled cities.

322
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,960
Remember when the children of Israel went into the land of promise and the 12 spies

323
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
were sent?

324
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,480
Well, what was it that that evil report came with?

325
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,800
Not only that there were giants in the land, but the cities, they were walled, right?

326
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,680
A defense mechanism that was so common.

327
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,640
And notice what it says, up to the land of unwalled villages, I will go with them that,

328
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:52,240
notice what it says, that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without

329
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,000
walls and having neither bars nor gates.

330
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,240
It said at the end of verse number eight, and they shall dwell safely, all of them.

331
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,400
You see the reference in verse number 11, many references with regard to the level of

332
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,440
safety in which is perceived.

333
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:11,400
And then you find also in verse number 14, it says, therefore, son of man, prophesy and

334
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,440
say unto God, thus saith the Lord God.

335
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:20,200
And that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou not know it.

336
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,520
And thou shalt come from thy place of the north parts, thou and many people with thee,

337
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,840
all of them riding upon horses, a great company and a mighty army.

338
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,560
And so we see about this safety.

339
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,160
Let me say this about Israel today.

340
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:39,800
Israel is one of the most heightened, secure, militarily ready to respond nation upon the

341
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,520
face of the earth.

342
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,840
There is no belief that they are dwelling safely in Israel.

343
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,840
It's just not there.

344
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,800
But as we look at this passage of Scripture and we begin to unfold and to consider what

345
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,440
happens, and we begin to look at prophecy and compare Scripture with Scripture, again,

346
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,080
to be able to see the timing of what's taking place, we note something very important that

347
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,720
Daniel tells us.

348
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,040
Turn over, if you will, keep yourself here in the book of Ezekiel and turn to Daniel

349
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,800
chapter number 9.

350
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:16,400
Daniel chapter number 9 is the end of the chapter, deals with the 70-week prophecy of

351
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Daniel.

352
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,600
We've mentioned that in the past.

353
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,240
We're familiar with some of the detail of that.

354
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,640
And I want you to look in this passage of Scripture, we're just going to look at verse

355
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,920
number 27 for sake of time here, but I want you to look at what God tells us is going

356
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
to happen.

357
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:36,880
It says this in verse number 27, speaking of the antichrist, it says, and he shall confirm

358
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,480
the covenant with many for one week.

359
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,360
In the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for

360
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,679
the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation

361
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,360
and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.

362
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,920
And we think about this truth with regard to verse number 27 and this peace treaty that

363
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:02,160
we've often referred to it as, and understanding what happens at the very beginning of the

364
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,679
tribulation.

365
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,520
The very beginning of the tribulation, there's going to be this peace treaty that is made,

366
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,080
that is going to be agreed upon.

367
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,320
We could go into all sorts of details as to what's included in peace treaties that we've

368
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:21,679
seen take place even in recent years and decades of our land, of our globe today amongst

369
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,520
many nations with regard to concessions and so on and so forth.

370
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,840
But we find that there's going to be this peace treaty that will take place between

371
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,900
Israel and the antichrist at the beginning of the tribulation.

372
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:42,200
Is it not obvious as we look at the passage of scripture here that as Gog leads Magog

373
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:48,119
and this great people, the players that are mentioned in the first six verses of Ezekiel

374
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:52,880
38, that the timing, it will be in the latter years, in the latter days, it will be at the

375
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,799
time in which Israel is having this perceived safety.

376
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,080
Now we understand that at…

377
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,120
the three and a half year mark of the tribulation.

378
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,280
It's a seven year period of time.

379
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,040
And during that three and a half year mark,

380
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,480
there's something that changes.

381
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,060
And what changes is that peace treaty is broken.

382
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,560
He sets himself as being God.

383
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,600
According to 2 Thessalonians chapter number two,

384
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,240
you read of the abomination of desolation

385
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,720
and you read all of that prophecy

386
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,080
and understand that happened.

387
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,280
So as we consider the passage of scripture,

388
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,800
we think about the players and we think about the timing.

389
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,960
We would very much be able to say with great certainty

390
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,800
that today what we're observing is not Gog and Magog.

391
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,720
Could it be that it's leading?

392
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,360
Absolutely.

393
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,320
It could be leading to Gog and Magog.

394
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,360
It's interesting as you know,

395
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,340
as you continue through the prophecy

396
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,200
and you begin to see what happens,

397
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,680
again, read with me.

398
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,960
In verse number 12, we noted about the spoil

399
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,920
that they would take a prey to turn thine hand

400
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,380
upon the desolate places that are now inhabited,

401
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,720
upon the people that are gathered out of the nations.

402
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,840
Remember, that was the previous chapters

403
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,720
of the book of Ezekiel dealing with that,

404
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,680
which have gotten cattle and goods

405
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,240
that dwell in the midst of the land,

406
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,800
Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish,

407
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,000
which with all the young lions thereof

408
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,200
shall say unto thee,

409
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,780
art thou come to take a spoil?

410
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,760
Hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey

411
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,480
to carry away silver and gold,

412
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,000
to take away cattle and goods,

413
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,760
to take a great spoil?

414
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,120
He says, therefore, son of man,

415
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,560
prophesy and say unto Gog,

416
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,000
thus saith the Lord God,

417
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,960
in that day when my people of Israel dwell safely

418
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,920
that thou shalt thou not know it.

419
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,520
And thou shalt come from thy place

420
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,240
out of the north parts now,

421
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,280
and many people with thee,

422
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,840
all of them riding upon horses,

423
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,880
a great company and a mighty army.

424
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,480
Well, let me pause there just for a moment

425
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,200
and put in a little parenthesis comment, if I will.

426
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,360
There are many people that criticize the use

427
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,760
of the way in which Ezekiel prophesied

428
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,640
the army coming in upon horses.

429
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,360
And they, oh, you know,

430
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,640
he just didn't know what the modern warfare units

431
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,060
and things that they were using.

432
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,420
Listen, I believe he knew what a horse was.

433
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,720
Amen.

434
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,240
It's one thing to not be able to describe a tank

435
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,920
or a helicopter or so on and so forth,

436
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,160
but I'm not gonna describe a tank

437
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,060
or a helicopter as a horse.

438
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,840
And really, we begin to see what happens

439
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,560
when the tribulation period begins

440
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,560
and the seals open up and the destruction upon earth,

441
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,640
it is very possible that the warfare

442
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,880
that will be used exactly as we see the prophecies

443
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,520
that are given here of horses.

444
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,560
You know, it's absolutely amazing.

445
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,520
You know that two of the top 10 places in the world

446
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,720
that have horses are Russia and Libya,

447
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,980
excuse me, Ethiopia.

448
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,040
Between those two places, three and a half million horses.

449
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,400
China themselves have six million.

450
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,600
That's a lot of horses.

451
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,120
But the reality is that, listen,

452
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,320
as we look at the scriptures,

453
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,880
we begin to see these things

454
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,580
and we see the prophecy that's recorded for us.

455
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,800
But as we begin to make further insight into this passage,

456
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,720
I want you to see not only the prophecy recorded,

457
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,880
but I want you to see number two, the purpose revealed.

458
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,100
God intervenes miraculously.

459
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,280
Remember, God is on his throne.

460
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,920
God has a purpose.

461
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,200
Notice in verse number 16 of Ezekiel 38,

462
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,040
it says, and thou shalt come up against my people of Israel

463
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,660
as a cloud to cover the land.

464
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,260
It shall be in the latter days.

465
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,920
Notice what it says, and I will bring thee against my land

466
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,640
that the heathen may know me

467
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,160
when I shall be sanctified in thee,

468
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,680
O Gog, before their eyes.

469
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,040
Notice verse number 17.

470
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,880
Thus saith the Lord God, art thou he of whom I have spoken

471
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,160
in old time by my servants, the prophets of Israel,

472
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,360
which prophesied in those days many years

473
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,000
that I would bring thee against them.

474
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,720
And it shall come to pass at the same time

475
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,320
when Gog shall come against the land of Israel,

476
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,680
saith the Lord God, that my fury shall come up in my face.

477
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,120
For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath

478
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,200
have I spoken.

479
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,400
Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking

480
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,120
in the land of Israel, so that the fishes of the sea

481
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,160
and the fowls of the heaven and the beasts of the field

482
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,600
and all creeping things that creep upon the earth

483
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,720
and all the men that are upon the face of the earth

484
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,640
shall shake at my presence.

485
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,040
And the mountains shall be thrown down

486
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,960
and the steep places shall fall

487
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,400
and every wall shall fall to the ground.

488
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,120
That is God intervening.

489
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,360
It says in verse 21, and I will call for a sword

490
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,880
against him throughout all my mountains,

491
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,000
saith the Lord God.

492
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,880
Every man's sword shall be against his brother.

493
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,480
You remember reading the book of Joshua

494
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,000
when God intervened miraculously and all of a sudden

495
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,520
the enemy's fighting each other.

496
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,240
No longer are they fighting the nation of Israel.

497
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,200
They're fighting one another

498
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,800
because of all the chaos and catastrophe.

499
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,280
This great earthquake that is spoken of here

500
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,800
in verses 19 through 21, really 19 and 20,

501
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,440
it's going to result in this chaos in verse number 21

502
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,520
that he says that every man's sword

503
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,520
shall be against his brother.

504
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,960
Verse 22, I will plead against him

505
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,880
with pestilence and with blood.

506
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,160
I will rain upon him and upon his bands

507
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,080
and upon the many people that are with him

508
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,240
in overflowing rain and great hailstones,

509
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,680
fire and brimstone.

510
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,560
Do we have times in God's word

511
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,040
when this has happened before?

512
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,360
Absolutely.

513
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,160
God worked in the life of Joshua

514
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,000
as the children of Israel inhabited the land

515
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,680
as they go in to conquer.

516
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,720
Listen, there were more defeated

517
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,320
of the inhabitants of the land

518
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,720
through divine intervention than there were

519
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,560
by Joshua and the army of God.

520
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,120
We find that God will intervene

521
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,440
and notice what it says in verse number 23.

522
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,680
This is so key when we understand the purpose.

523
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,520
Yes, God intervenes miraculously.

524
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,380
Yes, there is complete victory,

525
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,140
but notice what the Bible says in verse number 23.

526
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:51,140
Thus will I magnify myself

527
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,380
and sanctify myself.

528
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,460
And look at what it says.

529
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,340
I will be known in the eyes of many nations

530
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:03,340
and they shall know that I am the Lord.

531
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,140
The purpose that is given to us.

532
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,420
It continues in verse 39,

533
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:10,020
really some more details with regard

534
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,500
to the complete victory.

535
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,820
In the first several verses,

536
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,300
therefore thou son of man prophesy against Gog

537
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,420
and say, thus saith the Lord God,

538
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,780
behold, I am against thee, O Gog,

539
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,980
the chief prince of Meshach and Tubal.

540
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,420
And I will turn thee back

541
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,620
and leave but the sixth part of thee

542
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,960
and will cause thee to come up from the north parts.

543
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,940
We see that again.

544
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,340
And will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel

545
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,780
and I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand

546
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,940
and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.

547
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,420
Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel,

548
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,060
thou and all thy bands

549
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,500
and the people that is with thee,

550
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,820
I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort

551
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,260
and to the beast of the field to be devoured.

552
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,980
Now, let me say this.

553
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,340
We consider the purpose that's being revealed to us

554
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,080
in this passage of scripture

555
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,080
with regard to this prophecy and all that takes place.

556
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,540
We mentioned about the prophecy itself and the timing.

557
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:05,840
And it's very interesting because as God gives us detail,

558
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,080
we mentioned already that it's in the latter years,

559
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,980
in the latter days,

560
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,380
we said already that it's at a time of perceived safety

561
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,840
on the part of Israel.

562
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,140
But I want you to notice what God tells us

563
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,140
is going to happen as a result of this complete victory.

564
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,700
It tells us in verse number nine, it says,

565
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,900
and they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth

566
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,900
and shall set on fire and burn the weapons,

567
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,740
both the shields and the bucklers,

568
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,100
the bows and the arrows and the hand staves and the spears

569
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,020
and they shall burn them with fire seven years.

570
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,500
Skip down to verse number 12.

571
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,260
It says this, in seven months shall the house of Israel

572
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:49,760
be bearing of them that they may cleanse the land.

573
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,300
The victory will be so complete

574
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,580
that it's going to take seven months

575
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,260
to bury all of the dead.

576
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,080
But the Bible tells us again,

577
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,100
it actually continues in verse number 10,

578
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,060
so that they shall take no wood out of the field,

579
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,500
neither cut down any out of the forest,

580
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,580
for they shall burn the weapons with fire

581
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,380
and they shall spoil those that spoiled them

582
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,500
and rob those that robbed them,

583
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,300
saith the Lord God for how long?

584
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,820
According to verse number nine,

585
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,020
they shall burn them with fire seven years.

586
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,260
So we're going to try to figure out the timing.

587
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,320
There is a reference in Revelation chapter number 20

588
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,340
about Gog and Magog.

589
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,500
I believe that's at the end of the millennium.

590
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,420
That is different than this Gog and Magog.

591
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,980
Because at the end of the millennium,

592
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,619
there's not going to be seven months

593
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:36,940
to clean up the dead bodies

594
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,780
and they're not going to be seven years

595
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,780
to burn the weapons.

596
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,140
Amen?

597
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,660
And so therefore, this Gog and Magog

598
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,500
that is being referred to in Ezekiel's prophecy

599
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,880
is not the same that John writes about

600
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,820
in Revelation chapter number 20.

601
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,940
Remember in Revelation chapter number 20,

602
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,119
there's the millennium, right?

603
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:58,540
That Satan is bound for a thousand years,

604
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,660
the millennial reign of Christ.

605
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,660
We rule and we reign with him.

606
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,380
And then the Bible tells us that Satan will be loosed

607
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:09,140
for a little season in Revelation chapter number 20.

608
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,559
When he's loosed for a little season,

609
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:14,540
that's when John speaks about the Gog and Magog

610
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,900
in Revelation chapter number 20.

611
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,500
That again, seems to be a very different situation

612
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,540
than what Ezekiel is dealing with here

613
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,860
in Ezekiel 38 and 39.

614
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,420
In fact, as you look at the carnage

615
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,820
and the calling for the fowls

616
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,739
in the beginning of chapter number 39,

617
00:29:31,739 --> 00:29:33,420
it really has some similarities

618
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,580
to the battle of Armageddon

619
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,980
that is recorded at the end of the tribulation

620
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,460
before the millennial reign there in Revelation 19.

621
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,540
So when you think about this Gog and Magog

622
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,460
and you think about the timing, we can't pinpoint it.

623
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,580
Remember that God didn't give us prophecy

624
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,940
so that we can set dates.

625
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,500
He gave us prophecy so that we could know

626
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,299
that he's in control.

627
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:56,920
And we know that when it comes to pass,

628
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,799
we can see that he is who he says he is.

629
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:02,159
And as we look at the prophecy that's recorded

630
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,319
and we can sit around and we can discuss all of the details

631
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:06,799
with regard to the players,

632
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,639
and no, I don't think this references

633
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:11,559
with regard to this land,

634
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,959
I think it's this people, and so on and so forth,

635
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:16,359
and we begin to have those discussions,

636
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:19,039
we can't miss the bigger point

637
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,679
of what God is giving us in this prophecy.

638
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,959
And I believe it's in what this purpose is

639
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:28,639
that is being revealed to us here in Ezekiel 39,

640
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:30,839
and that is ultimately this,

641
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:32,999
that God is making himself known.

642
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:36,739
God is making himself known.

643
00:30:36,739 --> 00:30:39,439
Number one, he is making himself known to the heathen.

644
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:43,879
When you see the word heathen in the scriptures,

645
00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:47,479
you're referring to Gentiles, those that are not Israel.

646
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,839
So he's making himself known to the heathen.

647
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:53,879
In verse number 16 of Ezekiel 38, notice what it says.

648
00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:56,499
It says this, it shall be in the latter days,

649
00:30:56,499 --> 00:30:57,759
pick it up right in the middle of the verse,

650
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:00,319
and I will bring thee against my land.

651
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,399
Notice what it says, that the heathen may know me.

652
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,999
Notice again in verse number 23,

653
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:10,159
thus will I magnify myself and sanctify myself,

654
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,679
and I will be known in the eyes of many nations,

655
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,239
and they shall know that I am the Lord.

656
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:20,619
We see in chapter 39 in verse number six,

657
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:23,999
notice what it says, and I will send a fire on Magog.

658
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:27,439
By the way, that's back to the land

659
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:31,159
where he dealt with the group of people

660
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:34,779
that had come down, the many people that came

661
00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:36,839
and attacked Israel, and he shook the mountains,

662
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:39,079
and he dealt with them, but then he says,

663
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:42,279
I will send a fire on Magog, back in Russia,

664
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:43,679
in that land of Magog.

665
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,319
It says, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles.

666
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:49,439
And notice what it says, and they shall know

667
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:51,439
that I am the Lord.

668
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:56,439
Notice one more time, in verse number 21 of Ezekiel 39,

669
00:31:56,959 --> 00:32:00,199
it says, and I will set my glory among the heathen,

670
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:02,519
and all the heathen shall see my judgment

671
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:04,959
that I have executed, and my hand

672
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:07,619
that I have laid upon them.

673
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:11,619
He said, I will set my glory among the heathen.

674
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:16,079
We find that the ultimate purpose, if you will,

675
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:17,719
that is revealed to us here,

676
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:20,919
is that God is making himself known.

677
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:23,079
He's making himself known, first of all, to the heathen,

678
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:25,059
but secondly, to the house of Israel.

679
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:30,099
Listen, Israel, we dealt with in 1 John,

680
00:32:30,099 --> 00:32:32,019
a few weeks ago, about when John says,

681
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:33,579
you've heard that there's an antichrist,

682
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:35,379
there's many antichrists, right?

683
00:32:35,379 --> 00:32:39,459
And they're looking, they've rejected the Lord Jesus Christ,

684
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:41,099
they're looking for a Messiah,

685
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:44,699
and during that tribulation period,

686
00:32:44,699 --> 00:32:48,219
we find the trouble, Jacob's trouble, right?

687
00:32:48,219 --> 00:32:52,179
We find that God is dealing with Israel specifically,

688
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:54,419
and he's revealing to them, once again,

689
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:57,219
who he is, and that he is their Messiah.

690
00:32:57,219 --> 00:33:00,099
Notice in verse number seven of Ezekiel 39,

691
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:01,339
he said in verse number six,

692
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:04,339
that the nations would know that I am the Lord,

693
00:33:04,339 --> 00:33:05,659
but look in verse number seven,

694
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:08,299
so will I make my holy name known

695
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:10,759
in the midst of my people Israel,

696
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:14,219
and I will not let them pollute my holy name anymore.

697
00:33:14,219 --> 00:33:16,019
And the heathen shall know that I am the Lord,

698
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:17,019
the Holy One in Israel.

699
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:19,239
Skip down, if you would, to verse 22.

700
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:23,619
It says this, so the house of Israel shall know

701
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:25,779
that I am the Lord their God,

702
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:29,839
notice this phrase, from that day and forward.

703
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:31,899
Verse 23, and the heathen shall know

704
00:33:31,899 --> 00:33:34,859
that the house of Israel went into captivity,

705
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:36,659
why, for their iniquity,

706
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:38,459
because they trespassed against me,

707
00:33:38,459 --> 00:33:40,539
therefore hid I my face from them,

708
00:33:40,539 --> 00:33:42,559
and gave them into the hand of their enemies,

709
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,579
so fell they all by the sword,

710
00:33:45,579 --> 00:33:46,979
according to their uncleanness,

711
00:33:46,979 --> 00:33:48,799
and according to their transgressions,

712
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,539
have I done unto them, and hid my face from them,

713
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:54,179
therefore thus saith the Lord God,

714
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:57,159
now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob,

715
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:00,219
and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel,

716
00:34:00,219 --> 00:34:02,219
and will be jealous for my holy name,

717
00:34:02,219 --> 00:34:04,739
after that they have borne their shame,

718
00:34:04,739 --> 00:34:06,219
and all their trespasses,

719
00:34:06,219 --> 00:34:09,019
whereby they have trespassed against me,

720
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:11,259
when they dwelt safely in their land,

721
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:12,619
and none made them afraid,

722
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:14,919
when I have brought them again from the people,

723
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,159
and gathered them out of their enemies' lands,

724
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:20,419
and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations.

725
00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:25,379
Then shall they know that I am the Lord their God,

726
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:27,619
which caused them to be led into captivity

727
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:28,819
among the heathen,

728
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:30,899
but I have gathered them unto their own land,

729
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:34,139
and have left none of them anymore there,

730
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,859
neither will I hide my face anymore from them,

731
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:40,459
for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel,

732
00:34:40,459 --> 00:34:43,539
saith the Lord God.

733
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:44,459
So what's the purpose?

734
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:48,019
Ultimately, God is making himself known

735
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:51,379
to the heathen and to the house of Israel.

736
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:54,659
But I wanna remind you of something very important.

737
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,500
We think about prophecy,

738
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,619
we think about the study of prophecy,

739
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:01,019
and by the way,

740
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:03,379
it's important for us to see the day approaching,

741
00:35:03,379 --> 00:35:05,419
it's important for us to understand

742
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:07,259
the times in which we're living in,

743
00:35:07,259 --> 00:35:11,419
but we must understand that as God has given us prophecy,

744
00:35:11,419 --> 00:35:14,259
as God has unfolded these things for us,

745
00:35:14,259 --> 00:35:16,179
it's not so that we could set a time,

746
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,179
it's not so that we could set a date,

747
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:21,019
and it's not that we just get enamored with prophecy

748
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:22,259
and it's all we deal with,

749
00:35:22,259 --> 00:35:25,940
but it's that we remember that he who knows all things

750
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:30,940
has given us a plan of the ages and what's going to happen,

751
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:33,579
but we must be mindful of what our purpose is.

752
00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:36,859
What our purpose is.

753
00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:38,299
See, the purpose is revealed,

754
00:35:38,299 --> 00:35:39,619
but I want you to think about this

755
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:42,059
as we make application this morning.

756
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:44,739
What's our purpose right now?

757
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:46,459
You know what our purpose is right now?

758
00:35:46,459 --> 00:35:47,539
To make him known.

759
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,299
What's God's purpose in Ezekiel 38 and 39

760
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:53,739
through all of this situation?

761
00:35:53,739 --> 00:35:55,619
To make himself known.

762
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:58,619
The heathen are gonna know that I am the Lord,

763
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:01,299
the house of Israel is gonna know that I'm the Lord,

764
00:36:01,299 --> 00:36:02,139
but you know what?

765
00:36:02,139 --> 00:36:05,099
We have the responsibility today

766
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:10,099
as the people of God to make Christ known,

767
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:13,179
and what a great privilege is ours.

768
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:16,299
What a sad thing it would be that we'd sit in rooms

769
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,379
and study prophecy for just the purpose

770
00:36:18,379 --> 00:36:20,579
of increasing knowledge and just for the purpose

771
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,179
of understanding and debating with great theologians

772
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:27,339
and trying to set times and so on and so forth,

773
00:36:27,339 --> 00:36:29,899
but never fully understanding the purpose

774
00:36:29,899 --> 00:36:32,459
that God has given us for having these things

775
00:36:32,459 --> 00:36:34,259
even revealed to us in his word,

776
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:36,779
and today we have responsibility.

777
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:39,419
Today we have responsibility.

778
00:36:39,419 --> 00:36:41,479
You know, as we make Christ known today

779
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:43,479
that we can make a difference in somebody's life

780
00:36:43,479 --> 00:36:45,919
as to what happens with them at the rapture?

781
00:36:48,399 --> 00:36:50,599
Whether they live through the tribulation?

782
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:54,679
Guess what?

783
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,959
When the rapture of the church happens,

784
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:57,159
I'm not gonna have an opportunity

785
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:58,599
to make Christ known anymore.

786
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,599
Amen?

787
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,759
We find that in the scriptures,

788
00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:06,279
think about what Paul said as he goes to Athens

789
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:09,399
and he sees a city that is wholly given to idolatry.

790
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,119
He's moved, his spirit is stirred within him

791
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:16,079
because he sees this city that is wholly given to idolatry,

792
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,959
and he sees this city that's wholly given to idolatry,

793
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:21,039
and he goes through and he begins to preach

794
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:22,440
there on Mars Hill, and he says,

795
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,359
listen, you're all too superstitious.

796
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:28,119
As I walked through, I saw this altar,

797
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:30,599
and it was to the unknown God.

798
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:35,599
And here's what Paul says, him declare I unto you.

799
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:37,279
You know what Paul was doing?

800
00:37:37,279 --> 00:37:39,559
He was making Christ known.

801
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:42,639
He was to those people that were in darkness,

802
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:44,239
to those people that were superstitious,

803
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:47,119
to those people that were polytheistic,

804
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,159
those people that sat around to hear something new

805
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:51,879
and to share something new,

806
00:37:51,879 --> 00:37:54,440
Paul comes and he says, let me reveal to you,

807
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,279
let me make known to you the Lord Jesus Christ.

808
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:02,119
And this morning, that continues to be our purpose.

809
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,879
I'm thankful for prophecy.

810
00:38:04,879 --> 00:38:06,839
I'm thankful that God has told us

811
00:38:07,399 --> 00:38:08,679
that we can see the day approaching.

812
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:10,959
But let me say, as I said by way of introduction

813
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:14,079
this morning, that the study of prophecy

814
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,079
should have both a profound and a powerful impact

815
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,839
upon every child of God.

816
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,919
When I understand, as I see the day approaching,

817
00:38:22,919 --> 00:38:25,119
as I see the things that are unfolding

818
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,679
in our society today, it ought to motivate me

819
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:31,239
to want to tell somebody about Jesus, amen?

820
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:34,440
It ought to motivate me to want to make Christ known.

821
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,039
Matthew chapter 28, we're very familiar with it.

822
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:44,479
Jesus says in verse 18, all power is given unto me

823
00:38:44,479 --> 00:38:45,919
in heaven and earth.

824
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:48,799
He then says, go.

825
00:38:49,919 --> 00:38:51,559
He gives them the responsibility.

826
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:54,959
We often refer to this as the first reference

827
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:57,479
of the great commission in Matthew 28

828
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:59,080
in verses 18 through 20.

829
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,679
And we find that he says to them in verse 19,

830
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:04,519
go ye therefore and teach all nations,

831
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:06,200
baptizing them in the name of the Father

832
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:08,159
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,

833
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:10,119
teaching them to observe all things

834
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:11,959
whatsoever I have commanded you.

835
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:13,880
And lo, I am with you always,

836
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,399
notice, even unto the end of the world, amen.

837
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:24,119
God's final command before his ascension

838
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:29,119
continues to this day to be our greatest responsibility.

839
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:32,880
To make Christ known.

840
00:39:33,959 --> 00:39:35,599
You know that we live in the midst of a people

841
00:39:35,919 --> 00:39:38,200
that do not know who the Lord Jesus Christ is.

842
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:42,559
You go around our society today,

843
00:39:45,919 --> 00:39:50,919
people have all sorts of wrong ideas about who God is.

844
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:57,200
He can be whoever you want him to be, some would say.

845
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,039
I'm sorry, that's just not correct.

846
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:04,279
Amen?

847
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:10,899
Romans chapter 1 teaches us what man does to try to define God when they don't want

848
00:40:10,899 --> 00:40:15,959
to be accountable to the God who's revealed Himself to us in Scripture.

849
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:21,059
Let me remind you, not only here in Matthew 28, but I think of Acts 1.

850
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:24,679
Remember it was in that passage before the ascension of Christ when the disciples inquired

851
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:28,619
of the times of the kingdom and Jesus said, it's not for you to know the times or the

852
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:31,799
seasons which the Father hath put His own power, in verse number 7.

853
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:35,119
But then in verse number 8, He says, but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost

854
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,879
has come upon you, and you shall be witnesses unto Me, both in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria,

855
00:40:38,879 --> 00:40:41,559
and the uttermost part of the earth.

856
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:44,159
You know what Jesus is saying to the disciples?

857
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:50,879
Listen, we don't need to get so sidetracked with what the signs and the times and what

858
00:40:50,879 --> 00:40:52,719
the time of the setting up the kingdom.

859
00:40:52,759 --> 00:40:55,739
We have responsibility.

860
00:40:55,739 --> 00:41:03,479
We have privilege to go and share this wonderful truth and make Christ known.

861
00:41:03,479 --> 00:41:09,999
Romans 1, we're familiar when Paul says, I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.

862
00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:13,879
You know, before he says, I am not ashamed in verse number 16, he speaks about being

863
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:16,119
a debtor.

864
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:21,039
You think about that idea of being indebted to give someone truth that's been entrusted

865
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,439
to you.

866
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:27,599
You think about the responsibility of sharing that truth that's been given.

867
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,399
He says, I am indebted, I am debtor.

868
00:41:30,399 --> 00:41:31,399
He says, I am ready.

869
00:41:31,399 --> 00:41:35,599
I wonder this morning, how many of us are ready to go preach the gospel?

870
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:41,759
I mean, we're looking for the opportunities, we're seeking the opportunities, and then

871
00:41:41,759 --> 00:41:42,759
we're seizing the opportunities.

872
00:41:42,759 --> 00:41:45,319
We want to make Christ known.

873
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:46,319
Why?

874
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,959
Well, because we see the day approaching.

875
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:55,239
You know, what's interesting is you think about Ezekiel's prophecy, and you think about

876
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:56,719
the content of the book.

877
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:01,999
You know, it's interesting that on two occasions, in Ezekiel 3 and again in Ezekiel 33, you

878
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:03,239
know what God tells Ezekiel?

879
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:07,119
He set him to be a watchman.

880
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,919
He set him to be a watchman.

881
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:16,599
The responsibility of a watchman was to sound a warning.

882
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:24,759
And God in no uncertain terms says to Ezekiel, if the watchman fulfills his responsibility

883
00:42:24,759 --> 00:42:32,799
to give a warning, he's not responsible for the actions of the individuals.

884
00:42:32,799 --> 00:42:41,919
However, if the watchman fails to give the warning, then all of a sudden, I'm going to

885
00:42:41,919 --> 00:42:46,479
require their blood on you.

886
00:42:46,479 --> 00:42:48,959
Think about that.

887
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:53,959
I think about the Apostle Paul in Acts 20, making that statement that, I'm free from

888
00:42:53,959 --> 00:42:56,199
the blood of all men.

889
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:59,799
I know theologians debate that, no, he's not talking about Ezekiel.

890
00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:04,319
Listen, Paul knew the Old Testament better than any of us.

891
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,559
He was learned in the Scriptures.

892
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:08,879
He was taught by Gamaliel.

893
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:13,839
He was a Pharisee of the Pharisees, and then he got saved.

894
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,719
He knew the Old Testament.

895
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,399
We understand some of the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, but I believe with all

896
00:43:19,399 --> 00:43:23,639
my heart that Paul, when those words were said to those leaders of the church in Ephesus

897
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:29,879
in Acts 20, that he absolutely had Ezekiel 3 and 33 on his mind.

898
00:43:29,879 --> 00:43:35,679
And I just wondered this morning, prophecy has its place, and I'm thankful for prophecy,

899
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:39,599
and I'm thankful that we can see the day approaching.

900
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,199
But how does it impact us?

901
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:51,039
We see the purpose of the prophecy in Ezekiel 38 and 39, it's to make himself known.

902
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:54,879
But that's exactly what our purpose is today.

903
00:43:54,879 --> 00:43:58,279
Our purpose, the reason that He's left us here.

904
00:43:58,279 --> 00:44:03,519
Listen, I know we've said before, it'd have been wonderful, perhaps, if God and His sovereignty

905
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:08,599
had determined that at the moment of salvation, we just immediately were transported to heaven.

906
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:14,439
On certain days, we say, man, that'd be wonderful.

907
00:44:14,439 --> 00:44:17,559
But He left us here to be His witnesses.

908
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:22,319
He left us here to make Him known.

909
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,679
Our theme for our missions conference this year, I'll give you a preview, it's from Mark

910
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:28,979
5.

911
00:44:28,979 --> 00:44:34,159
That maniac of Gadara, he wanted to go with Jesus.

912
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:38,599
And they, remember the people said, we want you to leave?

913
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:42,719
That man that had experienced the power of God wanted to go with Him.

914
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:45,079
And the Bible says that he suffered Him not.

915
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:46,559
He didn't allow Him to go with Him.

916
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:48,079
You know what He told him?

917
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:53,759
He said, go to thy friends and tell them how great things Christ hath done for you.

918
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:54,759
You know what the Bible tells us?

919
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:58,159
He went and He published in Decapolis.

920
00:44:58,159 --> 00:44:59,159
Go and tell.

921
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:00,719
That's the theme for our missions conference this year.

922
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:03,039
I'll be preaching a message on that in a month or so.

923
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:11,919
But I want you to think about the purpose for us today is to make Him known.

924
00:45:11,919 --> 00:45:14,199
It's not Gog and Magog.

925
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:17,999
It may be leading to Gog and Magog.

926
00:45:17,999 --> 00:45:22,439
Before that ever happens, I'm out of here.

927
00:45:22,439 --> 00:45:28,239
Because the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, the rapture will take place, and I'm out.

928
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:30,699
And then all those things are going to take place.

929
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:36,299
But until then, I'm to redeem the time, and I'm to make Christ known.

930
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:37,299
Let's pray.

931
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:40,299
Father, we love You.

932
00:45:40,299 --> 00:45:46,339
I pray that, Lord, You've used Your Word this morning to meet the needs of those that are

933
00:45:46,339 --> 00:45:48,019
gathered together.

934
00:45:48,019 --> 00:45:51,979
Lord, we thank You for Bible prophecy.

935
00:45:51,979 --> 00:45:59,459
I pray that it would have a profound, powerful impact on how we live our lives today, that

936
00:45:59,459 --> 00:46:05,659
we purpose to make You known as we see the day approaching.

937
00:46:05,659 --> 00:46:07,459
Time is short.

938
00:46:07,459 --> 00:46:10,579
The rapture is imminent.

939
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:18,419
And Lord, I pray that we'd leave this place with a renewed sense of urgency to make Christ

940
00:46:18,419 --> 00:46:19,419
known.

941
00:46:19,419 --> 00:46:28,379
If there's one that's not sure of heaven, oh God, I pray that today they'd get it settled.

942
00:46:28,379 --> 00:46:32,779
I pray that in these few moments of invitation that You'd move and work as only You can.

943
00:46:32,779 --> 00:46:37,699
God, that we thank You that You're the eternal God that's given us prophecy of all of these

944
00:46:37,699 --> 00:46:40,179
things that will take place.

945
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:50,739
God, that we'd allow our hearts to be convicted with regard to our responsibility today to

946
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:52,579
make You known.

947
00:46:52,579 --> 00:47:04,419
If we'd be honest today, there are some that live on the same street that we do, and yet

948
00:47:04,419 --> 00:47:08,059
they do not know You.

949
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:13,099
Some maybe because they've rejected, but some because we've simply not made You known.

950
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:21,619
God, help us this morning to be real, to allow You to move and work in our lives and to do

951
00:47:21,659 --> 00:47:27,299
a work that would change us.

952
00:47:27,299 --> 00:47:33,739
We sang, oh Lord, send a revival and let it begin in me.

953
00:47:33,739 --> 00:47:37,379
Do a work, we'll give You the honor and glory for it's in Christ's name we pray.

954
00:47:37,379 --> 00:47:38,819
Would You stand with me?

955
00:47:38,819 --> 00:47:40,619
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

956
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:44,419
I know the hour is late.

957
00:47:44,419 --> 00:47:46,059
Thank You for Your patience this morning.

958
00:47:46,059 --> 00:47:49,699
I believe it's important to have a time of invitation where we respond to the Word of

959
00:47:49,699 --> 00:47:50,959
God.

960
00:47:50,959 --> 00:47:54,399
The Holy Spirit has used His Word to speak to your heart this morning.

961
00:47:54,399 --> 00:47:56,439
Would you let Him have His way?

962
00:47:56,439 --> 00:47:58,079
Kimberly will play quietly on the piano.

963
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,159
As she does, the altar is open.

964
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:01,639
Let's do business with God this morning.
