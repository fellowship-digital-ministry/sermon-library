1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,519
As you know, we've been preaching through the book of Genesis.

2
00:00:03,519 --> 00:00:06,880
This is our 30th lesson, and in the last several weeks,

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,920
we have not been in the book of Genesis for our evening services.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,659
In fact, last Sunday evening, we had a special cyber praise

5
00:00:14,659 --> 00:00:17,360
and Thanksgiving and favorites, and it was a blessing.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,799
I thoroughly enjoyed it.

7
00:00:18,799 --> 00:00:21,700
And it was good to hear from our church family.

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,159
And you give testimony to the Lord.

9
00:00:24,159 --> 00:00:25,940
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so.

10
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,440
And we appreciate the opportunity to hear your testimonies

11
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:32,040
and to sing those wonderful praises unto the Lord.

12
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,080
And it's been a number of weeks, though, that we've not been

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,979
in the book of Genesis.

14
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:40,860
In fact, in our last lesson, I mentioned that our next lesson

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,020
in Genesis would be on dinosaurs.

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,799
And I know that a lot of people are looking forward to that.

17
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:51,200
And I just didn't want to do it through live stream basically only.

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,099
And so the dinosaur lesson will come at some point.

19
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:00,180
And we're going to continue moving through the passage of scripture

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,880
that is before us this evening.

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,480
And I will make sure that I do preach that message

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,639
and share those things with you.

23
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:08,680
I trust it to be a blessing for those of you

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,540
that have been with us through the process.

25
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,660
We dealt with an entire lesson on really the impacts of the flood

26
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,580
and all of those things.

27
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,559
And we looked at the Grand Canyon and many other canyons

28
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:24,660
and had a very interesting, informative message on that subject.

29
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,800
And then in our very last study, we dealt with the Ice Age

30
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,459
and what some would say with regard to the Ice Age.

31
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:36,260
But as we have a biblical worldview and we take what God has recorded for us

32
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,180
in Genesis six, seven and eight and begin to interpret things accordingly,

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,839
we find that what they and when I say they, I mean

34
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:49,080
most modern science would tell us with regard to the Ice Age.

35
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,019
We find that there is a biblical approach

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,980
that we can take to that subject.

37
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,180
This evening, as we come to Genesis chapter nine,

38
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,419
we find and I'll title the message these first seven verses.

39
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,760
I've simply given a title this evening, Life After the Flood.

40
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,800
You'll recall that in Genesis chapter eight, we had the opportunity

41
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,740
to have the record that God provided us with of the day

42
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,639
in which Noah and his family came off the ark.

43
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,240
Of course, we know that the animals, they also made an exit.

44
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:25,199
And it's interesting, as you find near the end of Genesis chapter

45
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,279
eight in the beginning of the chapter, we find that God mentions

46
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:33,339
that he would cause a wind to pass over the earth and the waters assuaged.

47
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:37,320
And it was a lengthy period of time before the earth was dry.

48
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,660
And we come to verse number 13 of Genesis eight.

49
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,020
And the Bible says it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year

50
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,619
in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up

51
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,179
from off the earth.

52
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:53,080
And Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked and behold,

53
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,520
the face of the ground was dry.

54
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,979
And then it says in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day

55
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:03,100
of the month, was the earth dried and God spake unto Noah saying,

56
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,320
Go forth of the ark.

57
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:10,600
That had to be a wonderful day when they got to get off of the ark.

58
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,300
And they had been on the ark for a lengthy period of time and over a year.

59
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,559
And we find that he says, now, my wife, my sons and my sons, wives with me.

60
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,919
And of course, the animals made an exit as well, as I mentioned a moment ago.

61
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,699
And it's interesting after they exit the ark, after they were there.

62
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:29,300
And of course, safety was in the ark.

63
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,440
That was the place of refuge.

64
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,500
And we find that they came off the ark.

65
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:38,740
The first matter of business was worship.

66
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,979
We find at the end of chapter eight and verses 20

67
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,039
and verse number 20, specifically,

68
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:50,779
that the Bible gives us the record that Noah builded an altar unto the Lord

69
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,339
and he offered burnt offerings on the altar.

70
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,240
And what a way that they would begin life

71
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,160
after they would exit that ark that they had spent that length of time on.

72
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:06,759
And we find that the first matter of business was worship.

73
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:10,059
And, oh, it's important that we worship our God.

74
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,419
He is worthy of our worship.

75
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,919
And we find that the word in its original form

76
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,519
in the English language as it was first translated,

77
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,459
we find that it was actually translated worth ship and someone that was worthy.

78
00:04:25,059 --> 00:04:30,559
And we find that our God is worthy and he is to be worshiped.

79
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:34,440
Now we find as we come to chapter number nine, that God would provide

80
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,279
some instruction with regard to living life after the flood.

81
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,140
We find that in chapter number nine, that the covenant that God will make

82
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,600
with Noah is recorded and really begins in verse number eight.

83
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,399
As we go through the remaining passage of Genesis nine,

84
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,940
we'll begin to study that on next Sunday.

85
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,739
That'll be the subject of our study.

86
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:57,040
But this evening, as we look at these first seven verses,

87
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,420
I want to preach a message that I've simply entitled Life After the Flood.

88
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,119
Notice in verse number one of Genesis nine, the Bible says,

89
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:09,119
and God bless Noah and his sons and said unto them,

90
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,079
be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth.

91
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,779
And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth

92
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,339
and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth

93
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:24,380
and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand.

94
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,920
Are they delivered?

95
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,119
Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you,

96
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,100
even as the green herb have I given all things, given you all things.

97
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,440
Verse four, but flesh with the life thereof,

98
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,059
which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat?

99
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:43,399
And surely your blood of your lives will I require

100
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:45,359
at the hand of every beast will I require it.

101
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:48,160
And at the hand of man, the hand of every man's brother,

102
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,019
will I require the life of man who so shed man's blood by him.

103
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:58,519
Shall his blood be shed from the image of God made he man

104
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:02,059
and you be fruitful and multiply,

105
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:07,700
bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply therein.

106
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:11,200
As we look at this passage of Scripture and begin to consider

107
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,500
the instruction that God would give for living life on earth after the flood,

108
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,959
we notice, first of all,

109
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,299
that God gives them instruction with regard to reproduction.

110
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:23,799
We find that here in the passage of Scripture in verse number one

111
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,339
and again in verse number seven,

112
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:28,459
that you read this instruction to Noah and to his sons

113
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,059
to be fruitful and multiply.

114
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,839
And we find that he tells them to replenish the earth in verse number one.

115
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,839
In verse number seven, to be fruitful and to multiply,

116
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:44,940
bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply therein.

117
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:47,980
And we find that God would provide this instruction.

118
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,399
You'll recall with me this evening

119
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,700
that it was only those that were within the ark that survived.

120
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,320
You remember that being in the ark was critical.

121
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,000
It was crucial for those that lived during that time.

122
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:02,399
In Genesis chapter number six,

123
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,019
if you turn back just a few pages in your Bibles and look at Genesis chapter number six,

124
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,700
you find that God is going to make the announcement,

125
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,540
the prophecy, if you will, with regard to that which he would bring to pass.

126
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:18,820
In verse number seven of Genesis six, the Bible says,

127
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:26,200
And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth,

128
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,839
both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air,

129
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:33,380
for it repented me that I have made them.

130
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,440
We find that the Bible tells us that Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.

131
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,480
We find that God began to give him instruction.

132
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,279
It's interesting in verse number 13 of Genesis chapter number six

133
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:49,200
that God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh has come before me,

134
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,899
for the earth is filled with violence through them.

135
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,040
And behold, I will destroy them with the earth.

136
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:03,339
And the very next statement in verse number 14 is make thee an ark of gopher wood.

137
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:08,720
And we find that it was the ark in which God would instruct Noah on building this ark

138
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,100
where they would find refuge and safety within the ark.

139
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,980
There was only one door, as we mentioned, as we studied that passage of scripture.

140
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,059
And it's recorded for us in verse number 16.

141
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:24,320
And we find that on the appointed day, when God was ready to send the rain.

142
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,899
And of course, we understand that the deep was opened up, broken up.

143
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,659
And we find that God gave the instruction in Genesis chapter number seven

144
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,659
for Noah and his family to get into the ark.

145
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:41,619
It tells us in verse number seven, and Noah went in and his sons and his wife

146
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:47,200
and his son's wives with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood.

147
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:53,619
And what a blessing that we understand that God then tells us in verse number 16,

148
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,140
And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him.

149
00:08:58,359 --> 00:09:01,219
And the Lord shut him in.

150
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:03,479
There was safety in the ark.

151
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:09,440
And we find that all of those that were without the ark, that they would be destroyed.

152
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,619
And that is given to us in chapter six.

153
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:17,919
We find this truth of Noah and his family being there in that place of safety in chapter number seven.

154
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:23,919
And the Bible tells us the fulfillment of this, which God said would come to pass

155
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:28,659
is recorded for us in verse number 22 of Genesis seven, when the Bible says,

156
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:36,380
all in whose nostrils was the breath of life of all that was in the dry land died.

157
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,539
That's a global flood.

158
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:40,659
We've spoken about that often.

159
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:45,159
You find that it says all in whose nostrils was the breath of life

160
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:49,299
of all that is in the dry land died.

161
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:57,099
And so we find that based upon the fact that all human life died during that flood,

162
00:09:57,099 --> 00:10:00,099
of course, the animals that were thought that were not on the ark.

163
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:06,259
ark, they died as well, except for those that were living within the waters. And

164
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:10,739
we find that here, as we come to the ninth chapter, after Noah and his family

165
00:10:10,739 --> 00:10:16,379
exit the ark, after they make offering to the Lord, that the Lord speaks to them

166
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:21,459
and God blessed them, and God said, be fruitful and multiply and replenish the

167
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:25,979
earth. The Bible tells us that He said to bring forth abundantly in the earth and

168
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:32,539
multiply therein. I believe that God, as He would instruct them to be fruitful

169
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:36,819
and multiply, as He told them there in verse number 7 about the abundance and

170
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:41,979
about the multiplication, I believe that God blessed and God allowed them to bear

171
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:46,939
fruit abundantly. There are some that would be critics, they would

172
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:52,379
criticize some of that which is given with regard to the descendants and

173
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:59,019
some of the timelines, and they would argue about the number of people upon

174
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:03,419
the earth, and there's no way that you could have that many people that quickly

175
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:08,379
and so on and so forth, but we find that God is the giver of life, and we find

176
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:13,099
that God blesses, and here I believe that God, as He told them to be fruitful and

177
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:18,499
multiply, and He spoke about those words abundance and multiply, it's interesting

178
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:22,099
as we take that truth and look at a verse of Scripture in the book of Psalms, if

179
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:27,739
you will, in Psalm 107, and I'll give you a moment to turn there, but really in

180
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:30,899
Psalm 107 there's a whole lot of things that are being dealt with here in this

181
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:36,659
Psalm, and giving thanks unto the Lord for His good, for He is good, His mercy

182
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:40,059
endureth forever. It's the passage of Scripture where we get that phrase, let the

183
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:44,699
redeemed of the Lord say so, as we quote the first portion of verse number 2, and

184
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:49,979
we look through and many things are dealt with, but there's an interesting

185
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:54,939
truth that is given to us in Psalm 107 in verse number 38, and I will not tell

186
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:58,699
you this evening that this is specifically in reference to Genesis 9,

187
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:04,539
it's not, it's just a principle that God would give us that I believe could also

188
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:09,219
be applied to what we see in Genesis 9, where the Bible says, He blesseth them

189
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:17,259
also, so that they are multiplied greatly, and suffereth not their cattle to

190
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:21,259
decrease. You know, it's interesting if you would look at the exponential growth

191
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:25,739
of the nation of Israel from the time in which Jacob and his sons entered into

192
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:29,819
the land of Egypt, in the time in which Joseph was in the place of authority

193
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:34,019
where he was, and then when you come to the end of his life and the new Pharaoh

194
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:38,299
that rises up, and you think about the fear of the new Pharaoh because of the

195
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:43,339
amount of people, of the children of Israel, he was fearful, and God was able

196
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:47,979
to bless and greatly multiply, and he gives them instruction with regard to

197
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:52,579
reproduction. We notice that he not only deals with the subject of reproduction

198
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:56,299
and multiplying and replenishing the earth, but then we find that he gives

199
00:12:56,299 --> 00:13:00,539
them instruction regarding their diet. I was joking with someone this afternoon,

200
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:05,699
and I said, it's an exciting passage of Scripture, for Noah and his family were

201
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:10,979
now permitted to eat meat, and that's a wonderful thing, amen? I like meat, and I

202
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:16,099
enjoy a salad every once in a while is okay, but I like meat. If you add chicken

203
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:20,219
to the salad, it makes the salad tolerable, you know? But here in verse

204
00:13:20,219 --> 00:13:24,179
number two, there was, before he gets to the dietary thing in verse three, notice

205
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:28,979
in verse number two, there was going to be a distinct difference between the

206
00:13:28,979 --> 00:13:34,219
life prior to coming on the ark and even the period of time in which they were on

207
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:39,619
the ark and then life after the ark with regard to the interaction between man

208
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:44,219
and beast. We find in verse number two that says, the fear of you and the dread

209
00:13:44,219 --> 00:13:49,619
of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air,

210
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:54,059
upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea, into your

211
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:58,419
hand are they delivered. And we could see the dominion there, the dominance, if you

212
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:03,019
will, and we can understand that there's a distinction between the human kind and

213
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:07,899
the animal kind, as God would give us that truth even in Genesis chapter number

214
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:11,619
one with regard to the creation. And we come here and we see there's this

215
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:17,499
distinct difference as to the interaction between man and beast. We

216
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:23,619
understand today that interaction, and we understand the way in which there are

217
00:14:23,619 --> 00:14:28,499
wild animals that are not safe for us to be around, and we could think about all

218
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:32,139
of the animals that were on the ark and all of those things that had taken place.

219
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:36,379
It's interesting, if you look to some of the passages in the Old Testament

220
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:41,899
prophets with regard to the prophecies of that which will take place during the

221
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:47,459
millennial reign of Christ, and how some of that will return to what it was prior

222
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:52,299
to this particular time that is mentioned in Genesis 9. This now

223
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:56,539
continues to be the case even through today, and we find that there is that

224
00:14:56,539 --> 00:15:01,499
distinct difference between the interaction of mankind and beast. We then

225
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:06,859
see in verse number three, the Bible says, every moving thing that liveth, notice

226
00:15:06,859 --> 00:15:13,099
this, shall be meat for you. And we find that here as we would discover that

227
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:18,379
there would now be a change in diet. He says this at the end of verse number

228
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:25,459
three, even as the green herb which I, excuse me, have I given you all things.

229
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:30,059
Now what is God referring to here in verse number three? He's speaking to Noah.

230
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:34,979
He's referring back to what he gave to Adam in the creation originally in

231
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:41,579
Genesis 1 in verse number 29. Notice what the Bible says there in the passage of

232
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:47,019
Scripture. He tells us, of course, in verse 27 about creating man in his own image.

233
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:51,659
And we come to verse 29, and God said, behold, I have given you every herb

234
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:56,019
bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in the

235
00:15:56,019 --> 00:16:01,819
world which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed, lotus, to you it shall be

236
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:07,819
for meat. And we find in verse 30, into every beast of the earth, every fowl of

237
00:16:07,819 --> 00:16:11,939
the air, into everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have

238
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:18,539
given every green herb for meat, and it was so. As we studied the passage of

239
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:23,019
Scripture in Genesis 1 and the record of creation, and we understood how God

240
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:28,019
created in order, and how he sustained his creation, and really the wisdom of

241
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:32,699
God that's on display in Genesis chapter number one. But we find here in Genesis

242
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:39,059
9, in verse number 3, is they would exit the ark, that this new life after the

243
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:47,939
flood would include a change in diet. We find that however this change would be,

244
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:52,259
that they were given a restriction according to verse number 4. It says, but

245
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:59,539
flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. And so

246
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:02,579
we find there's a restriction given, they're not to eat, they're not permitted

247
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:06,459
to eat it with the blood, according to verse number 4. We find that reference

248
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:10,899
about the life, the flesh with the life thereof, and the fact that the blood is

249
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:16,139
the life. And we'll see that this truth of the dietary changes that are mentioned

250
00:17:16,139 --> 00:17:21,739
in verses 3 and 4 of Genesis chapter number 9 are further developed in the

251
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:25,939
book of Leviticus. And we understand that under the Levitical law that there

252
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:30,419
were many dietary regulations that were given, and these things will be expounded

253
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:34,379
upon there in the book of Genesis. It's interesting as we would think about

254
00:17:34,379 --> 00:17:39,379
being New Testament believers, and we think about our place in the history of

255
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:44,979
mankind, and we'd understand that we're living in such a time in which we have

256
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:51,779
the opportunity to partake of those things that God has given us as far as

257
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:56,739
diet is concerned. There are some, however, that would teach in the last days, the

258
00:17:56,739 --> 00:18:01,459
false teachers, as Paul would deal with in 1 Timothy chapter 4, that would

259
00:18:01,459 --> 00:18:06,379
teach, they would command to abstain from meats. But the Bible says in verse number

260
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:13,179
3 of 1 Timothy 4, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them

261
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:18,139
which believe and know the truth, for every creature of God is good, and

262
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:23,499
nothing to be received if it is received with thanksgiving. And we understand that

263
00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:28,059
there are the dietary regulations for the nation of Israel that are given in

264
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:32,940
the book of Leviticus, and we find that as we look as New Testament believers,

265
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:38,539
that these truths that have been given to us as far as our diet, and the

266
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:41,500
fact that there would be some false teachers in the last days that would

267
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:47,019
give commandments with regard to abstaining from meats. By the way, it's an

268
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:53,179
interesting study to study some of the religious organizations that have some

269
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:59,179
of those restrictions and commandments, and how the Lord in His Word had given

270
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:04,019
prophecy concerning those things so that we could identify those that would be

271
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:08,179
false teachers. As we continue in Genesis chapter 9, and we look at the

272
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:13,059
instruction that is given, we find that He then, God, will give instruction to

273
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:18,019
Noah with regard to murder. It's interesting the instruction that God

274
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:22,099
gives. He gives them instruction about reproduction, He gives them instruction

275
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:26,579
about their diet, and then He gives them an instruction about murder. And really

276
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:29,779
as we think about this instruction that's given to them about murder, we

277
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:35,819
find that what God is doing is reminding them of the value of life. Why is life

278
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:41,219
valuable? Because God is the Creator. Because He is the giver and sustainer of

279
00:19:41,219 --> 00:19:46,699
life. See, when you remove God from the equation, you've devalued life. That's

280
00:19:46,699 --> 00:19:52,459
part of the problem in our society today. When we have devalued life, it's because

281
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:59,219
of this Darwinian mindset of evolution and what-have-you, and we therefore,

282
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:01,619
through

283
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:04,919
this false teaching and this false indoctrination

284
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:06,679
upon the new generation,

285
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:09,919
we find that this is devaluing life.

286
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,359
But God values life.

287
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:13,759
We find that as we look here

288
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:15,279
in these verses of Scripture,

289
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:17,319
that God will give specific commandment

290
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:19,379
with regard to the one that would be

291
00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:21,579
guilty of murder.

292
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:22,779
Notice in v. 5,

293
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:24,959
"...and surely, your blood of your lives

294
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,359
will I require at the hand of every beast

295
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,439
and at the hand of every man's brother

296
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:32,179
shall I require the life of man."

297
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:34,979
Notice in v. 6 that He gives expounded truth.

298
00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:38,079
"...whoso sheddeth man's blood,

299
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,399
by man shall his blood be shed."

300
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:43,239
Why?

301
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:47,859
"...for in the image of God made He man."

302
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:50,259
Remember in Genesis 1 and v. 27,

303
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:52,519
and really you could think about v. 26

304
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,559
along with it,

305
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:54,519
when God said,

306
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:57,139
let us make man in our image

307
00:20:57,139 --> 00:20:58,839
after our likeness

308
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:00,479
and let them have dominion

309
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:01,779
over the fish of the sea,

310
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:03,019
over the fowl of the air,

311
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:03,939
and over the cattle,

312
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:05,139
and over all the earth,

313
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,779
and over every creeping thing

314
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:08,219
that creepeth upon the earth.

315
00:21:08,219 --> 00:21:11,939
So, God created man in His own image.

316
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,059
In the image of God created He Him.

317
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:18,099
Male and female created He them.

318
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:20,799
We have been made in the image of God.

319
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,619
We find that that's the reminder

320
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:24,459
that God would give to Noah

321
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:26,339
when they would exit the ark

322
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:27,899
and after they would make offering

323
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:30,259
God's words to Noah,

324
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:33,759
the first level of instruction

325
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,919
that he would receive

326
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,959
after departing the ark

327
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:38,679
would include instruction

328
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:40,439
about the value of life.

329
00:21:40,439 --> 00:21:42,079
"...whoso sheddeth man's blood,

330
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:44,039
by man shall his blood be shed.

331
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:49,059
For in the image of God made He man."

332
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,979
By the way, I'm thankful that God is the Creator.

333
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:53,319
I'm thankful that God gives us

334
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,639
a record of creation.

335
00:21:55,639 --> 00:21:57,519
We understand and identify

336
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:58,939
the Lord as being the Creator.

337
00:21:58,939 --> 00:22:00,019
In fact, one of the verses

338
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:01,419
that we've quoted often

339
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:02,819
during these past several weeks

340
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:04,579
is there from Psalm 121

341
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:05,659
where the Bible talks about,

342
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:07,159
"...I would lift up My knives into the hills

343
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,279
from whence cometh My help.

344
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:10,220
My help cometh from the Lord

345
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,819
which made heaven and earth."

346
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:12,940
And what a joy to know

347
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,539
that He is the Creator.

348
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:15,659
That He's my Creator.

349
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:18,419
I'm thankful that He's my Redeemer as well.

350
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,979
But we find that according to Romans 1,

351
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:23,220
that the people,

352
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,979
they want to deny God as being the Creator.

353
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:29,720
And this difficulty that enters

354
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,679
into the thought process of man,

355
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,399
and as we've said multiple times,

356
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:36,360
how the first 11 chapters of the book of Genesis

357
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,399
are so foundational

358
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:41,839
because of the truth that is contained therein,

359
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:44,879
and how it impacts the whole of Scripture.

360
00:22:44,879 --> 00:22:47,319
We find that there's a concentrated effort

361
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:49,679
to attack the first nine chapters

362
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,879
of the book of Genesis

363
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:54,039
to undermine the authority of God's Word

364
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,599
to deny the fact that He is the Creator.

365
00:22:56,619 --> 00:22:58,659
But we find often repeated,

366
00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:00,019
not only in the book of Genesis,

367
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:02,419
but throughout the entirety of God's Word,

368
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:06,339
the reference and the recognition

369
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:09,019
that God is the Creator.

370
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:10,699
Now we understand,

371
00:23:10,699 --> 00:23:13,379
as He would speak about the value of life,

372
00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:17,099
we are given the grounds in this verse of Scripture

373
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:19,619
for capital punishment.

374
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:20,039
He said,

375
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:23,099
"...whoso sheddeth man's blood,

376
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:27,759
by man shall his blood be shed."

377
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:29,479
The grounds for capital punishment.

378
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:30,479
Notice, if you will,

379
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:31,599
if you turn to the New Testament,

380
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:33,099
Romans 13,

381
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:35,860
as God would give reference to the truth

382
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,080
with regard to human government.

383
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,839
And we're thankful that our God

384
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:41,839
rules in the affairs of man.

385
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,639
We're thankful as the truth of God's Word

386
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:46,399
tells us that the heart of the King

387
00:23:46,399 --> 00:23:48,759
is in the hand of the Lord.

388
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:50,239
And what a blessing that is.

389
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:52,539
Our God is in control.

390
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:55,080
He has established government.

391
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,959
We find in Romans 13,

392
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:58,619
notice in verses 3 and 4,

393
00:23:58,619 --> 00:23:59,459
the Bible says,

394
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:02,799
"...for rulers are not a terror to good works,

395
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,259
but to the evil.

396
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:06,879
Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power?

397
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,039
Do that which is good,

398
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,440
and thou shalt have praise of the same.

399
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,479
For He is the minister of God to thee for good.

400
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:15,580
But if thou do that which is evil,

401
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,519
be afraid.

402
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:18,440
For He beareth not the sword in vain,

403
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:20,279
for He is the minister of God,

404
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:24,399
a revenger to execute wrath upon Him

405
00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:27,760
that doeth evil."

406
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,559
We find that here in the Word of God

407
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,199
that there is the grounds,

408
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:37,199
the truth with regard to this truth

409
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:39,519
of capital punishment.

410
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,919
It's an interesting reference

411
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:43,959
in Ecclesiastes 8 and verse number 11

412
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:44,880
where the Bible says,

413
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,839
"...because sentence against an evil work

414
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,519
is not executed speedily,

415
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:52,880
therefore the heart of the sons of men

416
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,239
is fully set in them to do evil."

417
00:24:57,239 --> 00:24:58,799
Wow, what a powerful verse

418
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,399
in Ecclesiastes 8 and verse number 11.

419
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,839
We believe in proper process of justice

420
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:08,479
and the process in which that is to go through

421
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:12,179
and certainly determining the guilt of an individual.

422
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,839
But once that guilt is established,

423
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:16,320
the Bible would make it clear

424
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:18,440
that the execution of the sentence

425
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,479
should be done speedily.

426
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:23,959
We find that here in the Word of God,

427
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:27,639
this truth with regard to the value of life

428
00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:30,040
and the grounds for capital punishment.

429
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,160
Yes, we understand that further details

430
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,160
just as the case would be

431
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,479
with regard to the dietary changes

432
00:25:36,479 --> 00:25:39,000
that are mentioned in verses 3 and 4

433
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,079
that those things would be further expounded upon

434
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,440
on the book of Leviticus.

435
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,160
So also will this truth that we find here

436
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,079
given to Noah as he would exit the ark,

437
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:52,279
these things are further developed through the law.

438
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,720
Now I want you to consider with me

439
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,040
this fact that is given to us

440
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,959
that he speaks about capital punishment

441
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:00,239
and he speaks about murder.

442
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:01,959
Whoso sheddeth man's blood,

443
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:05,440
by man shall his blood be shed.

444
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,399
I want you to consider with me a few things.

445
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,519
Number one, go back to the book of Genesis,

446
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:12,600
excuse me, to the chapter just a couple before,

447
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,239
Genesis chapter number four,

448
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,519
and I want you to recall with me

449
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:18,600
what happened in the first family.

450
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,359
Of course, we know that God created Adam and Eve

451
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,359
and the Bible records for us in Genesis chapter number four

452
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:29,000
how that Eve, excuse me, Adam knew Eve his wife

453
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,839
and she conceived and bear Cain

454
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,959
and said, I've gotten a man from the Lord.

455
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:35,160
And she again bear his brother Abel.

456
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,839
The Bible begins to tell us about the time

457
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,239
in which they would bring an offering

458
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:41,919
and we've dealt with this several weeks ago.

459
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,679
And we find that we come here in Genesis four

460
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:46,000
to verse number eight.

461
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,399
The Bible says that Cain talked with Abel his brother

462
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,679
and it came to pass when they were in the field

463
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:55,679
that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him.

464
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,760
The first murder is recorded in the Word of God.

465
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,239
By the way, there are many murders

466
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:02,880
that are recorded in the Word of God.

467
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,160
And this is the first of those murders that is recorded

468
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,600
where Cain slew Abel.

469
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,199
We find that in the same chapter

470
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:11,559
that the Bible records for us

471
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:14,320
that Lamech also was guilty of murder

472
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,720
where he says in verse number 23 of Genesis four

473
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,359
and Lamech said unto his wives, Ada and Zillah,

474
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:22,799
hear my voice you wives of Lamech,

475
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,919
hearken unto my speech

476
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:27,760
for I have slain a man to my wounding

477
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,359
and a young man to my hurt.

478
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,199
We find that Cain slew Abel

479
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:35,880
that Lamech as well was guilty

480
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,839
of this heinous crime of murder.

481
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:42,160
We come to the sixth chapter of the book of Genesis

482
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,479
that which would lead to the destruction of mankind

483
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:47,639
and the flood that would come upon the earth.

484
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:50,040
And we find that God says this

485
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:55,000
about the man that his own creation, man that he created.

486
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,279
It says in verse number five,

487
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:59,720
God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth

488
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,359
and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart

489
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:04,399
was only evil continually.

490
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,600
Skip to verse 11 and the Bible says

491
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,119
that the earth also was corrupt before God

492
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:12,279
and the earth was filled with violence.

493
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:14,639
We find that reference again in verse number 13

494
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:16,079
right in the middle of the verse

495
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:18,760
where the Bible says the earth is filled

496
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,639
with violence through them.

497
00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:24,479
So we find that this thing of murder

498
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:28,199
was taking place all the way back with Cain and Abel

499
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:31,639
and then with Lamech and then prior to the flood

500
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:34,640
all of the violence and all of the wickedness

501
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,119
that was taking place.

502
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,239
And we come as we look at this instruction

503
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:42,440
that is now given to the family of Noah,

504
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,799
Noah and his sons, the three sons of Noah,

505
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,960
four of the eight people that get off of the ark,

506
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,719
Noah and his three sons.

507
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:54,080
The Bible says that God spake to them,

508
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,239
God blessed Noah and his sons and said unto them.

509
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:02,320
He instructed them with regard to reproduction,

510
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,960
with regard to diet and with regard to the value of life,

511
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,919
with regard to the subject of murder.

512
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:11,239
Now we understand that decisions have consequences

513
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:14,839
and the groundwork, the foundation if you will,

514
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:17,159
for capital punishment is given here.

515
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:22,159
Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.

516
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,279
I mentioned this morning about the cities of refuge

517
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,239
and I wanna make just a quick reference to that

518
00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:29,479
this evening in Numbers 35.

519
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:31,679
We won't deal with all of the additional details

520
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,200
that are given to us in the word of God

521
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:34,719
about the subject of murder,

522
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:39,719
but we find in Numbers chapter 35 in verses nine through 34

523
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:45,039
that God gives the instruction to Moses, excuse me,

524
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,760
with regard to these cities of refuge.

525
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,520
And it's interesting as we'd find

526
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,119
that which is given to us here

527
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:56,039
and the Bible speaks about when they would come

528
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:59,479
into the land, they established these cities of refuge

529
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:01,520
and this is given in Numbers 35.

530
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,359
We.

531
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:07,679
find the fulfillment after the children of Israel conquer the land, and after the

532
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,559
land is being divided, then in Joshua chapter number 20, the first nine verses

533
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:17,319
of that chapter, we find that God records for us the cities of refuge that are

534
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:21,599
established. But here in Numbers 35, in verse number 9, it says, the Lord spake

535
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:25,279
unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them,

536
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:30,679
When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan, then ye shall appoint

537
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:36,519
you cities to be cities of refuge for you. Notice that the slayer may flee

538
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:42,759
thither, which killeth any person, notice this phrase, at unawares. And they shall

539
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:47,439
be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer die not

540
00:30:47,439 --> 00:30:52,519
until he stand before the congregation in judgment. And of these cities which

541
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:56,979
ye shall give, six cities shall you have for refuge. Speaking about the cities of

542
00:30:56,979 --> 00:31:01,259
the Levites, and these specifically being the cities of refuge, he says in

543
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:06,339
verse 14, you shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall

544
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:12,539
ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge. These six

545
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:16,299
cities shall be a refuge both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger,

546
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:20,339
and for the sojourner among them, that everyone that killeth any person

547
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:25,019
unawares, you see that word again, it was mentioned in verse number 11, again now,

548
00:31:25,979 --> 00:31:30,539
that any person that would killeth any person unawares may flee

549
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:35,579
thither. And if he smite him with an instrument of iron so that he die, notice

550
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:43,619
this, he is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death. On the grounds of

551
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:48,139
that which we've read in Genesis chapter 9, when God gave this instruction to

552
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:53,739
Noah after they would depart the ark, in verse 17 of numbers 35, it says, and if he

553
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:59,899
smite him with the throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a

554
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:03,619
murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death. In other words, I take a

555
00:32:03,619 --> 00:32:06,939
stone, and my purpose in throwing the stone is so that I could hit you and

556
00:32:06,939 --> 00:32:13,739
kill you. And he says there, in this text of Scripture, that if he smite him with

557
00:32:13,739 --> 00:32:19,219
throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer. The murderer

558
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:24,699
shall surely be put to death. Verse 18, or if he smite him with an hand

559
00:32:24,699 --> 00:32:29,299
weapon or wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer. The murderer

560
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:33,939
shall surely be put to death. The revenger of blood himself shall slay the

561
00:32:33,939 --> 00:32:39,419
murderer. When he meeteth him, he shall slay him. But if he thrust him of hatred

562
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:44,019
or hurl at him by laying of weight, that he die, or an enmity smite him with his

563
00:32:44,019 --> 00:32:48,299
hand, that he die, he that smote him shall surely be put to death. For he is a

564
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:52,299
murderer. The revenger of blood shall slay the murderer when he meeteth him.

565
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:56,179
And we go through this passage of Scripture, we see what's taking place, and

566
00:32:56,179 --> 00:33:00,419
these that are guilty of that which is mentioned in these verses that we've

567
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:04,659
just read, they would be guilty of murder, and they shall be surely put to death

568
00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:10,219
based upon, again, that which we find in Genesis chapter 9. We move forward and

569
00:33:10,219 --> 00:33:14,459
begin to see what's happening, and who this city of refuge, or these cities of

570
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:18,779
refuge, were really for. In verse number 25, and the congregation shall deliver

571
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:22,859
the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation

572
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:26,739
shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled. And he shall

573
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:32,419
abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy

574
00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:36,859
oil. That's what I referenced this morning about the fact that our Lord, our

575
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:42,339
great high priest, the Lord Jesus Christ, he conquered death, he passed into the

576
00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:47,379
heavens. Of course, under the Levitical priesthood, the priest died, and here is

577
00:33:47,379 --> 00:33:52,739
a high priest, when he died, that one that found refuge in the city of refuge could

578
00:33:52,739 --> 00:34:00,859
then return to their place of dwelling. It says in verse 26, but if the slayer

579
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:04,499
shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither

580
00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:08,699
he was fled, and the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city

581
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:13,379
of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer, he shall not be guilty

582
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:18,539
of blood. See, he had to stay in the city of refuge. That's where there was

583
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:23,419
protection. We find in verse 28, because he should have remained in the city of

584
00:34:23,419 --> 00:34:29,219
his refuge until the death of the high priest. In verse 30, whoso killeth any

585
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:34,299
person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses, but one

586
00:34:34,299 --> 00:34:38,459
witness shall not testify against any person that caused him to die. Moreover,

587
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:41,939
you shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of

588
00:34:41,939 --> 00:34:47,139
death, but he shall surely be put to death. And you shall take no satisfaction

589
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:50,139
for him that has fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to

590
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:54,219
dwell in the land until the death of the priest. So ye shall not pollute the land

591
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:59,539
wherein ye are. For blood defileth the land, and the land cannot be cleansed of

592
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:05,299
the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it. Defile not

593
00:35:05,379 --> 00:35:09,459
therefore the land which ye shall inhabit wherein I dwell. For I, the Lord, dwell

594
00:35:09,459 --> 00:35:14,139
among the children of Israel. And so we find that these cities of refuge were

595
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:21,099
established for the one that would be in a situation where someone died, but

596
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:25,459
it was not with any premeditation. They were not a murderer. You see that in

597
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:30,419
verse number 22. But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast

598
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:34,179
upon him anything without laying of weight, or with any stone wherewith a

599
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:39,739
man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him that he die, and was not his

600
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:44,299
enemy, neither sought his harm, then the congregation shall judge between the

601
00:35:44,299 --> 00:35:47,739
slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments, and they

602
00:35:47,739 --> 00:35:53,059
could flee to the city of refuge. And so we find as we would look, yes, there's

603
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:57,819
additional information that is given, and these truths are expounded upon

604
00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:03,259
throughout the the Old Testament and throughout the law, but as Noah and his

605
00:36:03,259 --> 00:36:09,059
family would exit the ark, as they would prepare for life after the flood, they

606
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:14,659
first make offering, they first worship the Lord, and then the Lord gives them

607
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:19,779
instruction. The Lord says, be fruitful and multiply. Why? Because only the eight

608
00:36:19,779 --> 00:36:26,659
of them. Everyone else had been destroyed, because safety was in the ark. It was the

609
00:36:26,659 --> 00:36:31,819
only place of refuge. It was in the ark. Tomorrow in our Joshua lesson, we'll look

610
00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:38,619
at the truth there in Joshua chapter 2, when the spies make the agreement

611
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:45,099
with Rahab, and there was only one place of safety, and that was in the house. It

612
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:49,179
was an agreement that was made. Such is the case here in Genesis. We understand

613
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:53,379
that safety was only for those within the ark, and so these eight people now

614
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:59,579
come off the ark, these Noah, his three sons, and their wives, and we find that

615
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:03,979
they are given the responsibility with regard to reproduction. We find that

616
00:37:03,979 --> 00:37:09,379
their diet is changed, and God gives them information with regard to these dietary

617
00:37:09,379 --> 00:37:15,179
changes, and then God reminds them of the value of life, and he lays the groundwork

618
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:20,779
for capital punishment, that whoso sheddeth man's blood by man shall his

619
00:37:20,779 --> 00:37:26,459
blood be shed. We find that God would then continue to speak unto Noah, as we

620
00:37:26,459 --> 00:37:30,699
find in verse number 8, and God spake unto Noah and to his sons with him

621
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:37,139
saying, I behold, I establish my covenant with you. Next Sunday evening, the

622
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:42,139
subject of our study will be the covenant that God makes with Noah, and

623
00:37:42,139 --> 00:37:46,139
what a joy it is to read of this covenant that is given to us in this

624
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:51,739
passage of Scripture, which we'll look at next week. This evening, life after the

625
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:55,419
flood. I'm thankful that God gives instruction to Noah and his children.

626
00:37:55,419 --> 00:37:58,259
There were some things that changed. There was some instruction that was

627
00:37:58,259 --> 00:38:05,219
needed to be given to them. Reminders, and we find that for us, as we live here in

628
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:11,179
2020, I'm thankful that God has given us the instructions for how to live life.

629
00:38:11,179 --> 00:38:16,459
I was chatting with someone recently, and I said to them, I said, I am so thankful

630
00:38:16,459 --> 00:38:21,939
that the Creator God, who's in control of all things, that He's given us His Word,

631
00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:29,059
and He's informed us, He's instructed us on how we are to live our lives, so that

632
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:33,500
we can live our lives in such a way that we would please Him. Paul had a desire in

633
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,940
his life that he would please the Lord. Paul instructs Timothy and encourages

634
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:42,559
Timothy to live his life in such a way that he would please the Lord. I'm so

635
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:47,140
thankful that we can go to the Word of God, and we can understand what it is

636
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:52,099
that God would require of us so that we could live for Jesus, yes, as we sang that

637
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:56,579
song this evening, but we could live a life that is pleasing in His sight.

638
00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:00,899
Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. We thank You for Thy Word, for

639
00:39:00,899 --> 00:39:04,179
the truth of Thy Word. We thank You for the instruction that You've given to

640
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:08,419
Noah and to his sons in this passage of Scripture, and I pray, God, that You would

641
00:39:08,419 --> 00:39:14,779
help us to understand that Your Word has been given to us as instruction. I'm so

642
00:39:14,779 --> 00:39:19,219
thankful that You would give instruction to Your people, that You do

643
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:25,899
not sit in the heavens and just look down upon mankind without giving us any

644
00:39:25,899 --> 00:39:30,739
direction, without giving us any instruction, but God, that You've given us

645
00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:35,820
Thy Holy Word, Thy Word that is profitable, Thy Word that guides us and

646
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:40,659
directs us, and Lord, I pray that we would live in submission, even as we sang the

647
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:44,700
song this morning, trust and obey, that we would be doers of the Word and not

648
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:49,179
hearers only. God, that we would live lives that are pleasing in Thy sight.

649
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:52,500
Thank You for this instruction that You gave to Noah. Thank You for recording it

650
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,779
for us so that we'd understand that which You gave them as they departed the

651
00:39:56,779 --> 00:40:00,459
ark. I pray that You'd be glorified in our lives, that all that we say and do

652
00:40:00,459 --> 00:40:04,339
would bring honor and glory to Thy name.

653
00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:06,819
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

654
00:40:06,819 --> 00:40:08,899
We'll have a moment of invitation here.

655
00:40:08,899 --> 00:40:09,979
Kimberly's going to play quietly.
