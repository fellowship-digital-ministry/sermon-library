1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,199
and be looking at verses 15 through 17 this morning Colossians chapter number 3 as we continue to make our way through this great book and

2
00:00:07,239 --> 00:00:12,079
Of course starting in verse number 5 and down through verse number 14 over the last three weeks

3
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:14,079
We've had the opportunity to read

4
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:20,440
that detailed instruction that the Apostle Paul gives to the believers here in Colossi and of course by

5
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:25,959
Preservation to us as well and we've learned that there's some things to put off fornication

6
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:32,639
uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence covetousness anger wrath malice

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,159
blasphemy filthy communication and lying what a list and

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,000
He said all these things you're to put off and then of course after you put those things off

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,479
He says put on therefore and that list included bowels of mercy kindness humbleness of mind meekness long-suffering

10
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:58,000
Forbearing one another forgiving one another and then he said of this above all these things put on charity

11
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,319
which is the bond of perfectness and

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,120
What a blessing to understand the principle that God has given us

13
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,559
Of course

14
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:12,000
We often reference it from Galatians 5 that were to walk in the spirit

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,400
So that we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh in here

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:23,199
I believe that it's a very practical passage of Scripture that teaches us what it is to put to walk in the spirit

17
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:30,000
of course in that passage in Galatians 5 the Word of God tells us the works of the flesh are manifest in this way and

18
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:35,800
Provides us with a list and this is the fruit of the Spirit is and defines for us gives us those nine

19
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,000
Attributes as to how the fruit of the Spirit is described. And so we find that here

20
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:44,319
The Apostle Paul is providing us with this

21
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:51,760
Application if you will I would say this now that we have put off all of those things that we mentioned really we'd say the

22
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,239
Old man, remember we used this phrase last week with his grave clothes

23
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:01,160
And now we've put on the new man with his grace clothes

24
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,419
We find that this now should be evidenced in our behavior

25
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,199
Doesn't that make sense if we've put off all these things if we've put on all these things

26
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,199
Remember 2nd Corinthians 5 if any man be in Christ, he's a new creature old things are passed away

27
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:22,240
Behold, all things are become new and as we walk in the spirit so that we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh

28
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:26,080
We find that that it should impact our behavior

29
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,440
It should be evident in the way that we live and I believe that that's exactly what we see as we finish up the third

30
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,160
Chapter of the book of Colossians. In fact, even going into the first verse of chapter number four

31
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:44,679
We find that this remainder of this chapter in the first verse of chapter 4 really deals with the behavior of the believer

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,279
In three particular areas this morning

33
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:52,360
We'll be looking at verses 15 through 17 and I believe in this passage of Scripture

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,960
That God is really dealing with the behavior of the believer in the church house in the church house

35
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,839
We find that next week

36
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:07,559
We'll be looking at verses 18 through 21 and in that passage of Scripture God deals with our behavior in the home

37
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:15,039
And then we find that in verses 22 through chapter 4 and verse number 1 that God deals with our behavior in the workplace

38
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:17,880
I made this statement last week as we look through the

39
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:24,399
the particular details that were to put on and we looked at that list and I made this statement that if we begin to

40
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:29,199
truly walk with God as we're called to do so and we truly would to

41
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,919
Put into practice this which we find in the passage of Scripture. I believe we could make a great difference in our world

42
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:41,279
Truly that people would see Christ in us

43
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,160
Amen, and that's what they need to see. They don't need to see that. Well, they're just like we are

44
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,360
They don't have anything else that we need how many times we've heard people say about the church when you invite them

45
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,279
Oh, it's just full of a bunch of hypocrites and so on and so forth and people have stories and accounts and experiences of

46
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:03,880
Dealing with Christians and being lied to and being taking advantage of and so on and so forth and those things ought not be

47
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,960
Amen, and we find it as we would live the Christ life

48
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:16,040
remember the plan of God is that we as his people would be conformed to the image of his Son that we'd be sanctified and

49
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,119
What a blessing to understand that God

50
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:23,760
Gives us in his word truth with regard to not only

51
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:30,920
What to put on and put off or put off and put on we should say but also how we are to behave or how those

52
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,200
Decisions would affect our behavior before we get into the passage

53
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,440
I'm reminded of what Paul said to Timothy over in 1st Timothy 3 in verse 15. He said but if I tarry long

54
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,480
That thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God

55
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,160
Which is the church of the Living God the pillar and ground of the truth

56
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,160
Not everything that's called church today is church

57
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,640
amen, and

58
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,760
There is behavior that is appropriate in the church

59
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,959
And as we study this passage of Scripture in Colossians 3 verses 15 through 17

60
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,880
I would say this as we look at the title for the message behavior in the church house

61
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,679
I would say that our behavior in the church house should be characterized by five things and

62
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,079
Don't get too nervous that I have five points this morning

63
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,640
We'll go quickly through them

64
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:27,519
But I believe that our behavior should be characterized by the five things that we find in this portion of Scripture

65
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,279
Let me begin reading in verse 15. The Bible says this and the peace of God

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,660
Excuse me, and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the witch

67
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:43,600
Also, ye are called in one body and be thankful. Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom

68
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,359
Teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs

69
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:54,920
Singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord and whatsoever you do in word or deed

70
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,959
Do all in the name of the Lord Jesus

71
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:06,720
Giving thanks to God and the Father by Him with the help of God this morning. I want to give you these five character

72
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,760
Characteristics if you will on how our behavior should be characterized in the church house

73
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,600
I will say this the Apostle Paul is not

74
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:23,859
instructing these believers to practice something that he is not already doing personally and that's a wonderful blessing when you have the

75
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:28,519
opportunity to study the life of the Apostle Paul and you study his life and then you read his

76
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,399
Instruction to these believers as God would use him to pen much of the New Testament

77
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,239
We see that Paul was a man that as he said to the church in Philippi

78
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:43,480
not only the things that you've heard from me, but the things that you've seen in me do and

79
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,359
What a blessing to understand the instruction that is provided here number one

80
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:54,920
If you're taking notes our behavior in the church house should be characterized by peace by peace

81
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,600
Notice the Word of God says and let the peace of God

82
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:06,279
Rule in your hearts we find that it is the peace of God. It is not man's peace

83
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:12,040
It is not something that we try to conjure up in our own ways and try to figure out how to do this

84
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,920
It's not manufactured by us

85
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:20,920
It is the peace of God and God tells us here in the passage of Scripture that were to let it's the peace of God

86
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,079
Let God's peace notice rule in your hearts

87
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:31,119
The word rule carries with it the idea of being an umpire being a rule or the one that would oversee

88
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,959
You would think about the time of writing and you would think about some of those

89
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,200
games that would be played and how they would have

90
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:45,600
Officials and they would have the judges and how they were the ones that would rule over they would have the control of that

91
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,040
Particular event we're familiar with that when you think about various

92
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:56,799
Athletic competitions, in fact when Friday evening we're at a volleyball game and there was a there's supposed to be two referees

93
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:58,040
But there's only one and man

94
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,640
She did the best she could but she missed a whole bunch of calls

95
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,640
But guess what? She was the one that was ruling that court

96
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,160
It was her call and whatever call she made whether it was agreed upon or not

97
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,959
It stood and in the same manner we see that were to let the peace of God notice that word let

98
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:22,000
It's something that we need to be aware of and we need to allow God's peace to rule in our hearts

99
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,279
And I believe that we think about we're mindful of what Jesus said in John 14 in verse number 27

100
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:33,919
Of course as he's preparing his disciples for that day in which he would go to the cross of Calvary just a short time

101
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:37,559
from when he's speaking these words to his disciples and

102
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,960
He's already told them about not letting their heart be troubled and he's told them great things

103
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,960
But he tells them this in John 14 in verse number 27 peace. I leave with you

104
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,320
Then he says this

105
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,359
My peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you

106
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:58,960
Let not your heart be troubled neither

107
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:07,200
Let it be afraid. Oh in the house of God. We need to allow the peace of God to rule in our hearts

108
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,679
I understand that the Scriptures talk about the the peace of God

109
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,159
which passeth all

110
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:19,400
understanding we understand that he will keep us in perfect peace whose mind is stayed upon him and

111
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,359
What a blessing to know the peace of God. I

112
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Believe contextually as we're thinking about the behavior in the church when he's speaking about the peace of God ruling in your hearts

113
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,599
we're thinking about a body of believers and

114
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:39,719
Remember, he'd already instructed him in the previous passage in verse 13 for bearing one another and forgiving one another

115
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,599
And now he says that we're to let the peace of God rule in our hearts and with that context and with that

116
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,440
Understanding I believe that we would understand that this is the same peace that we see in the life of Christ

117
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,880
During his earthly ministry and it should be seen in our lives

118
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,640
And I would say this

119
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,640
peace in this

120
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,640
and it's really the opposite of having conflict and division.

121
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,640
See, many people have the idea that peace is the absence of trouble,

122
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,640
but the reality is that we can be in the very midst of great trouble

123
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,640
and have the peace of God. Amen?

124
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,640
But we think about the peace of God in church,

125
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,640
and as we as a body of believers,

126
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,640
as we're allowing the peace of God to rule in our hearts,

127
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:32,640
it's going to result in not having conflict and division and schisms and so on and so forth.

128
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,640
Why? Because we're allowing the peace of God to rule in our hearts.

129
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,640
How often the people of God can be in contention one with another

130
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,640
and hinder the work of God,

131
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,640
or to let the peace of God rule in our hearts.

132
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,640
How do we do that? Well, that's the result of putting off and putting on.

133
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,640
As we put off all of those things, as we put on all of these things,

134
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,640
we get rid of the old man in his grave clothes,

135
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
we put on the new man in his grace clothes,

136
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,640
then that's evident in our behavior and we allow the peace of God to rule in our hearts.

137
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,640
See, it's opposite of what we see in the church in Corinth.

138
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,640
The church in Corinth is not a model church.

139
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,640
The church in Thessalonica is a good church, a model church,

140
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,640
but the church in Corinth is filled with problems and difficulties,

141
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,640
and Paul is correcting them in 1 Corinthians,

142
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,640
and he's giving them very straight instruction.

143
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,640
I'll mention this many years ago,

144
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,640
but I'll never forget being in a place down in Tennessee,

145
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,640
and I saw a church, and it was called the First Baptist Church of Corinth,

146
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,640
and I thought, those guys are crazy. They're out of their mind.

147
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,640
Why would you name your church the First Baptist Church of Corinth?

148
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
But they did.

149
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,640
And listen, here's how God tells us in his word about the church in Corinth.

150
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,640
See, they're not letting the peace of God rule in their hearts.

151
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Look at 1 Corinthians 1.

152
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,640
Look at just a couple of verses.

153
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Notice in verse 11, as Paul is beginning really still his introduction

154
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,640
and the purpose of his writing, he says this in 1 Corinthians 1 and verse 11,

155
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,640
For if it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren,

156
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,640
by them which are of the house of Chloe,

157
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,640
that there are contentions among you.

158
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,640
In chapter 3, notice what he says in verse 1.

159
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,640
He says,

160
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,640
And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual,

161
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,640
but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.

162
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,640
I have fed you with milk and not with meat,

163
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,640
for hitherto you were not able to bear it,

164
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,640
neither yet now are you able.

165
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,640
Because you are carnal.

166
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,640
Notice the result of that carnality.

167
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,640
It says,

168
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,640
For whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions,

169
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,640
are ye carnal and walk as men?

170
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,640
And he begins to describe that carnality being seen

171
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,640
in those that were saying,

172
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,640
I'm of Paul, I'm of Apollos, and so on and so forth.

173
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,640
And we understand the divisions that are mentioned there,

174
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,640
but we find that that is not the plan of God

175
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,640
for the behavior of the people of God in the church of God.

176
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,640
We're to let the peace of God rule in our hearts.

177
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,640
As we go back to Colossians 3,

178
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,640
and we notice the behavior that is listed here,

179
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,640
I believe not only should the behavior in the church house

180
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,640
be characterized by peace,

181
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,640
but it also should be characterized by unity.

182
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,640
Look back in verse 15,

183
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,640
the Bible says,

184
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,640
And let the peace of God rule in your hearts,

185
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
notice this,

186
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,640
to the which also ye are called in one body.

187
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,640
It's a blessed thing to have unity.

188
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
Amen?

189
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,640
Personally, I don't like division.

190
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,640
I don't like contention.

191
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,640
I don't like all of that stuff.

192
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,640
I like unity.

193
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,640
And the reality is that we understand,

194
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,640
as Paul would say to the church in Ephesus in Ephesians 4,

195
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,640
he tells them that they're endeavoring

196
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,640
to keep the unity of the Spirit

197
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,640
a bond of peace in Ephesians 4,

198
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,640
in verse 3.

199
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,640
And we think about this thing of unity,

200
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
he says here,

201
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,640
to the which ye are called in one body.

202
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,640
We've often mentioned the way in which we strive for

203
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,640
and we endeavor to keep the unity of the Spirit,

204
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,640
that unity is the result of walking with God.

205
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,640
Unity is the result of embracing the truth

206
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,640
of the Word of God.

207
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,640
Unity is not something, again, that we manufacture.

208
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,640
It's not something where we come to this place

209
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,640
of just deciding that everyone can hold hands

210
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
in this ecumenical movement.

211
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,640
We're just going to embrace the things that would unite us

212
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,640
and just forget about the things that would divide us.

213
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,640
No, unity is when we take the Word of God

214
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,640
and say this is the standard

215
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,640
and we're going to agree with God.

216
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
Amen?

217
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,640
And as I agree with God and as you agree with God

218
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,640
and each one of us agree with God,

219
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
then guess what?

220
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
We can have unity.

221
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,640
And we can have that spirit of unity in the church.

222
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,640
And what a blessing that is.

223
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,640
And we find that this is the plan of God.

224
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,640
This is the behavior that ought to be evidenced.

225
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,640
And we find characterized not only by peace,

226
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,640
but by unity.

227
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,640
Notice in Philippians 2.

228
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,640
Notice how Paul will describe this to these believers here.

229
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,640
And he's speaking to these.

230
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,640
We mentioned this portion of Scripture last week

231
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,640
as we spoke about humility and humbleness of mind.

232
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,640
But notice here in Philippians 2,

233
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,640
beginning in v. 1, he says,

234
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,640
if there be therefore any consolation in Christ,

235
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,640
if any comfort of love,

236
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,640
if any fellowship of the Spirit,

237
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,640
if any bowels and mercies.

238
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,640
Notice what Paul says.

239
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,640
Fulfill ye my joy.

240
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,640
How are they going to fulfill his joy?

241
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,640
Notice what he says.

242
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,640
That ye be like-minded.

243
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,640
Having the same love.

244
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,640
Being of one accord of one mind.

245
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,640
You know what the devil seeks to do

246
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,640
is he seeks to divide.

247
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,640
That's what the enemy does.

248
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,640
You can look at the church in Acts

249
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,640
and you can read about the church in Jerusalem

250
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,640
as the disciples started after the day of Pentecost

251
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,640
and all that took place there with the church

252
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,640
and the progress of the Gospel being preached

253
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,640
and souls being saved and the church growing

254
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,640
and God working mightily.

255
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,640
You find that they were in one accord.

256
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,640
You often see that phraseology that is mentioned.

257
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,640
And so what happens?

258
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Well, the enemy comes in

259
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,640
and the enemy seeks to divide.

260
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,640
And the enemy is always about division.

261
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,640
The enemy does not want us as the people of God

262
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,640
to be united.

263
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,640
He wants us to be divided. Why?

264
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,640
Because if we're fighting with each other,

265
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,640
if we're divided in the church house,

266
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,640
then we're not doing what we're supposed to do.

267
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,640
We're not out there sowing the seeds.

268
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,640
We're not out there reaping the harvest.

269
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,640
We're not out there preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ

270
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,640
to a lost and dying world. Why?

271
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,640
Because we're all focused on what's going on in the church

272
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,640
and what our little divisions and schisms

273
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,640
and I'm this and I'm that and you're this

274
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,640
and so on and so forth.

275
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,640
And all of a sudden,

276
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,640
we find that the enemy has been successful

277
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,640
on rendering the people of God useless.

278
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,640
That's the plan of the enemy.

279
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,640
To cause division.

280
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
You know, it's not said of the church in Corinth

281
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,640
that they were spreading the Word of God

282
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,640
the way that the church in Thessalonica was.

283
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,640
And you can read of these differences

284
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
and understand.

285
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,640
And so, when we begin to think about

286
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
this understanding of the plan of God

287
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,640
and how we put off those grave clothes

288
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,640
with the old man

289
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
and put on the new man with the grace clothes

290
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,640
and how our behavior will change

291
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,640
and we'll have that peace of God

292
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
ruling in our hearts

293
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,640
that will lead to unity amongst the brethren.

294
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
It's a blessed thing to have unity.

295
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,640
I don't like being at odds with anyone.

296
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,640
I mean, there are some people

297
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
that just seem to like contention.

298
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
You ever meet some people like that?

299
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,640
They just kind of thrive on it.

300
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,640
I don't get that.

301
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,640
I don't like contention.

302
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
I don't like division.

303
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,640
I like unity.

304
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,640
And I'm thankful that we have the Word of God.

305
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,640
Often times, I've spoken to people in my office

306
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,640
in various situations, counseling,

307
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,640
maybe some folks that have visited the church

308
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
that have questions about the church

309
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,640
and so on and so forth

310
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,640
or someone that has some disagreement

311
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,640
with something that they've seen

312
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,640
in our doctrinal statement

313
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
or some other situation.

314
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,640
And I'll say something to this effect.

315
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,640
Can we just agree to agree with God?

316
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,640
As Baptist people, we've said for centuries

317
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,640
that the Word of God is our sole authority

318
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
for faith and practice.

319
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,640
And so therefore, if it is the sole authority

320
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
for faith and practice,

321
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
if we agree with God,

322
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,640
let's see what God says.

323
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,640
And we just open the Scriptures

324
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
and let God be God

325
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,640
and let the Word of God say

326
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,640
what the Word of God says.

327
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,640
You know the Word of God isn't as difficult

328
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,640
as some people make it out to be.

329
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,640
They say, oh, it's too hard to understand.

330
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,640
Sometimes it's just that we don't want to understand it

331
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,640
because we don't want to apply it.

332
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
We don't want to do it.

333
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,640
We don't want to live it.

334
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,640
And here, as Paul has gone through

335
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,640
with this church and Colossians,

336
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,640
he's gone through all of this behavior

337
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,640
and all of this put off and put on,

338
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,640
he says now that our behavior

339
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,640
in the church house will be characterized

340
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
in this manner.

341
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,640
He'll deal with the home in our next section

342
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
and then in the workplace.

343
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
Why?

344
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,640
Because we're Christians 24-7.

345
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,640
It's not just Christians in the church house.

346
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,640
We're to be representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ

347
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,640
every minute of every day of our lives.

348
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,640
And that's why he deals with the church house,

349
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,640
the home, and the workplace.

350
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,640
And we'll get through those over the next couple of weeks.

351
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,640
Back in Colossians 3, notice,

352
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,640
not only should our behavior in the church house

353
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,640
be characterized by peace and unity,

354
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,640
I believe number three,

355
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,640
it should be characterized by devotion.

356
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,640
By devotion.

357
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,640
You know, there's a purpose when we come to church.

358
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,640
Our purpose is to exalt and magnify

359
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
the Lord Jesus Christ.

360
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,640
Our purpose is to teach the Word of God.

361
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,640
Again, as I mentioned by way of introduction,

362
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
not everything that's called a church is a church today.

363
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,440
And there's a lot of places in which, throughout our society,

364
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,640
where the Word of God just, quite frankly, is not being taught.

365
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,940
I'm thankful for those churches that are standing on the truth of the Word of God

366
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,840
and that are continuing to be faithful,

367
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,940
that are continuing to preach the Word of God.

368
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,440
But there's a great pressure in our society today

369
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,740
to kind of step away from some of those things

370
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,240
and not be so contentious and so dogmatic about what God says in His Word,

371
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,140
and let's just be love, and let's just embrace, and so on and so forth.

372
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:39,140
But I'm sorry, I believe this morning that love is going to tell us the truth.

373
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:44,140
Love is not permissive, love is protective.

374
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,740
We find here that as we enter into verse number 16,

375
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,640
we see this idea of devotion, where the Bible says,

376
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,440
let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.

377
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,940
What a great phraseology.

378
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,240
Again, we see the word let, we see that in verse 15,

379
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,740
again in verse number 16, something that we're to do to allow the Word of Christ.

380
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,340
And we think about this word dwell when it says to dwell in you richly in all wisdom.

381
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,640
It means to abide in and influence.

382
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,540
Why is it that Paul would tell Timothy in 2 Timothy 4,

383
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,940
after he tells him about all of the things with regard to the last days,

384
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,140
and all of the perilous times that will be present in the last days,

385
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,640
and evil men and seducers waxing worse and worse,

386
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,540
and all of that, and he enters into the fourth chapter and he says,

387
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,140
preach the Word.

388
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,240
Preach the Word.

389
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,140
Why? Because we need the Word of God to be dwelling in us.

390
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,640
We need it to be influencing us.

391
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,540
We find that Peter would give the instruction to the elders,

392
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:49,440
the pastors in 1 Peter 5, to feed the flock of God.

393
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,040
What do we feed? We feed the Word of God.

394
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,240
That's our responsibility.

395
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,240
That's the responsibility of the pastor, to feed the flock of God.

396
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,140
And we find this idea of the Word of God,

397
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,640
let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom,

398
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,240
and we're allowing it to abide in us and to influence us.

399
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,640
I said this many years ago.

400
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,740
I didn't make up the phrase or the quote,

401
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,940
but someone said this,

402
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,640
thumbprints in the Bible are more important than footprints on the moon.

403
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,940
And I said, that's good.

404
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,640
Why? Because we're in the Word of God so that it can get into us.

405
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,140
I want to think and act biblically.

406
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,240
I want to be in a place where when something comes up in my life

407
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,340
and I'm looking at a situation, a decision that has to be made,

408
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:37,340
that I've allowed the Word of Christ to dwell in me richly in all wisdom,

409
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,140
that I can have that source of wisdom,

410
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:46,340
that Word of God that will give me the guidance and the direction that I need.

411
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,640
When I speak of devotion, I believe that it's a personal devotion,

412
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,740
but it's not only a personal devotion.

413
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,840
We find that it would be a corporate devotion.

414
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,340
The reality is that we individually, as the children of God,

415
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,640
we are to be seeking the Word of God.

416
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,740
We're to be feasting upon the Word of God daily in our lives.

417
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,440
That we should hunger and thirst after righteousness.

418
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,840
As newborn babes, that we would desire the sincere milk of the Word

419
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,240
that we may grow thereby.

420
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,540
That we would truly, as I preached several weeks ago,

421
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,140
say, as Samuel said,

422
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,940
speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth.

423
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:32,440
That we're personally, each of us, each one, each member of the church,

424
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,740
that we are personally in the Word of God,

425
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,940
feasting upon the Word of God.

426
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,340
When's the last time someone in the church came to you and said,

427
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,240
hey, brother, hey, sister,

428
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,040
what's God been teaching you in your devotions this week?

429
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,140
How's God been working in your life?

430
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,140
It's not something very common that we practice in our lives.

431
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,140
We talk about all kinds of things, right?

432
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,340
We really do.

433
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,940
But for some reason, we avoid the conversation of,

434
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,140
hey, brother so-and-so, what did God show you this week in His Word?

435
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,740
How's God working in your life?

436
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,540
Several years ago, I was at a pastor's meeting.

437
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,540
I sat down to have lunch at this pastor's meeting.

438
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,440
It was a large pastor's meeting.

439
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,640
In fact, Kimberly's parents, we were there with them.

440
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,140
And we met a number of pastors that had never met before.

441
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,540
And Brother Sommerdorf kind of led the group that we were there with.

442
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,640
And there were hundreds of pastors that were at this particular conference.

443
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,540
And some had their spouses with them.

444
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,140
Some had staff members with them.

445
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,040
And I remember sitting down to have lunch.

446
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,840
And it was the very first day that we were there.

447
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,740
And there was a pastor.

448
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,740
I prayed for him this morning.

449
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,240
His name is Scotty Bockhaus.

450
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,540
Do you know Brother Scotty?

451
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,240
And Scotty Bockhaus.

452
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,640
And he's a pastor.

453
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,940
And we sat down to have lunch.

454
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,140
I'd never met the guy other than just introducing ourselves to one another.

455
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,940
We sat down for lunch.

456
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:57,640
And he said, so, brother, what's God been teaching you in His Word?

457
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,540
And I thought, that's good.

458
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,040
And I was able to share with him what God had been teaching me,

459
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,940
where I was in my personal devotions.

460
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,140
And then I asked him.

461
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,840
And, man, we had great fellowship.

462
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,040
We weren't just talking about the weather or the sports or the politics or whatever, right?

463
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,840
No.

464
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,840
Talk about how's God working?

465
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,940
How's He using His Word in my life, in your life?

466
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,740
It's that personal devotion.

467
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,740
I believe also that it's a corporate devotion.

468
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:30,040
Notice, as we come together for the purpose of worship of the Lord,

469
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,540
notice what he says in verse 16.

470
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:38,340
Teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,

471
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,940
singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

472
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,340
That idea of teaching and admonishing.

473
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,640
It's instruction. It's warning.

474
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,840
It's the public ministry of the Word of God, as I'm doing even here this morning.

475
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,640
It's what Paul spoke about when he said in Colossians 1 and verse 28,

476
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,940
whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom,

477
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:03,140
that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus,

478
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:10,240
whereunto I also labor, striving according to His working which worketh in me mightily.

479
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,140
And Paul was engaged in this behavior.

480
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,940
And he's saying to these believers in Colossae that if you've put off these things

481
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,440
and you've put on these things,

482
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,640
it should be evidenced in your behavior in first in the church house.

483
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,740
It should be characterized not only by what we find here with peace and unity,

484
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,840
but now with devotion.

485
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:38,040
I wonder how often we go through the process of self-examination.

486
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,440
We say, where am I in my walk with Christ?

487
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,540
Am I closer to God today than I was a year ago?

488
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:49,240
Am I closer to God today than I was a month ago, a week ago?

489
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,540
How's my devotion? What am I learning?

490
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,440
What have I learned publicly? What have I learned privately?

491
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:02,440
Notice what it says here, teaching and admonishing one another.

492
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,540
You know, there are a lot of one another commands in the New Testament

493
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,640
with regard to the people of God and the church of God.

494
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,140
That's why the church of God is a called out assembly, right?

495
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:18,040
I understand people use Livestream. That's not church.

496
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,940
Church is the assembling of God's people. Why?

497
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,240
Because how are we going to admonish and instruct one another

498
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,140
if we've not assembled together, right?

499
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,840
Now, I'm not against Livestream. We have it.

500
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,140
We have people that are watching and I'm perfectly fine with it.

501
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:40,140
But the reality is that we can't fulfill these responsibilities unless we assemble.

502
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,540
And so we assemble because we want to instruct.

503
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:47,140
We want to, as we find here in this verse of Scripture,

504
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,740
teach and admonish one another.

505
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,340
Iron sharpeneth iron.

506
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,940
That's what Solomon said in Proverbs. Iron sharpeneth iron.

507
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,240
And so as we have the opportunity to engage in this work

508
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,940
and we understand how we're to be instructing and warning one another,

509
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,140
there's some experiences that you've had that somebody else might not have

510
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:12,840
that you as a more mature believer might have the opportunity to instruct them

511
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:18,340
and to warn them and to give them truth from the Word of God.

512
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,840
And that's a wonderful thing.

513
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,940
It's a blessed thing when we have that spirit

514
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:30,340
not only of peace and unity, but of devotion.

515
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,540
God's house is a house of prayer. It's a spiritual house.

516
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,239
Church is not a club.

517
00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:39,239
It's not just something that we just, okay, check it off the box.

518
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:44,340
I did church this week. No. So much more than that.

519
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:48,040
Not only do we see peace and unity and devotion,

520
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,440
but I believe that as we look down into verse number 17,

521
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,540
our behavior in the church house should be characterized by purpose.

522
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,040
By purpose. What do I mean by that?

523
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:05,340
I believe the purpose is to exalt and magnify the Lord.

524
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,040
Very plainly. That is the purpose.

525
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,640
Notice how he says it in verse 17,

526
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,940
"...and whatsoever ye do in word or deed..."

527
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,340
Now that's a pretty conclusive statement.

528
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,940
I mean a broad, far-reaching, all-inclusive statement.

529
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,940
He says, "...and whatsoever you do in word or deed,

530
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,940
do all in the name of the Lord Jesus."

531
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,640
I'm mindful of what John the Baptist said.

532
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,140
He must increase. I must decrease.

533
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,040
It's all about the Lord.

534
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,840
It's not about the individual.

535
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,840
It's not about making a name for ourselves.

536
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,239
It's not about someone looking at another brother or sister in the church

537
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:52,739
and putting them up on a pedestal.

538
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:57,540
No, it's about the Lord Jesus Christ being magnified and exalted in our midst.

539
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,540
It's about us giving testimony of how God has worked in our midst.

540
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:05,160
our lives. Listen, all that we are is, as Paul said, by the grace of God. I am what

541
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:10,860
I am by the grace of God. God's working in our lives. Where would we be this

542
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:15,000
morning if it had not been for Christ? Where would we be this morning if it

543
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,320
were not for the gospel coming to your home and to my home, right? It's all about

544
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,840
the Lord. And we come to church, we come with this purpose that we're to do all

545
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:31,140
whatsoever you do, in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus. It's

546
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:39,060
His church and it's all about Him. In the video presentation, Brother Pate

547
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:44,700
referenced Matthew 16, 18, where the Lord Jesus Christ said, I will build my church

548
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,980
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. This is God's church and all

549
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:55,120
that we do is to be done for His honor and for His glory, that He might be

550
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,120
exalted and magnified in our midst. In Acts 20, in verse number 28, as Paul is

551
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:04,560
speaking to those leaders of the church in Ephesus, as he's on his way to

552
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:09,200
Jerusalem, he gives them much instruction. He desired to be able to see

553
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,800
them and, oh, the depth and richness of that which he communicates to these

554
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:19,080
church leaders in Acts 20. But I want you to notice in

555
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:24,220
verse number 28, Paul says this, take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the

556
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:28,380
flock over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers. Notice what he says,

557
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:34,320
to feed the church of God, but then it says this, which he hath purchased with

558
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:41,020
his own blood. It's His church. We sing the song more about Jesus, how

559
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:46,700
appropriate that song is, because it's really all about Jesus. Jesus is the

560
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:53,240
sweetest name I know. Amen? And we find that we come with that purpose when we

561
00:31:53,240 --> 00:32:00,140
assembled this morning, when you woke up this morning, you had some purpose and

562
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:05,200
some desire that you're gonna be in church, and your purpose, hopefully, was

563
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,020
that you would come and that you would be able to worship the Lord and magnify

564
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,680
and exalt the Lord, that you'd be encouraged and strengthened through the

565
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,360
the singing of the great hymns of the faith, that you'd be encouraged and

566
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,320
strengthened and challenged through the preaching of the Word of God, that we

567
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,360
would come expecting to hear from God, anticipating how God would work in our

568
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,520
lives individually, and purpose to take what we hear and apply it in our lives,

569
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:35,080
that we would be doers of the Word and not hearers only. You know, there's some

570
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,480
people over the years I'm thankful that God has blessed, and we don't have too

571
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,880
much of this, at least not on a regular basis. It's happened from time to time.

572
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,040
When you're in any place for the length of time, not that 10 years is

573
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,640
extremely long, but really for the average of a pastor, it's a lengthy

574
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,800
period of time, and there are people that sometimes show up to church just to

575
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:01,440
criticize the sermon. People that listen online just to criticize the sermon.

576
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,120
You didn't come for the right purpose. You didn't come with the heart of all

577
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,680
that we do for the glory of God and how God might work in my heart and in my

578
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,960
life, and how he might allow me to be able to influence another brother or

579
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:23,680
sister in Christ. As you know, I attend regularly a pastor's meeting, the

580
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,400
Atlantic Independent Baptist Fellowship, and as I attend that pastor's meeting,

581
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,280
there are certain times, certain periods of time, where things are busier than

582
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,800
other times, and there are times in which, man, it's a tough deal for me to put on

583
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,760
my schedule to be out of the office and to go to a pastor's meeting, but

584
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:44,480
something that I understand is that not only do I need it, but sometimes somebody

585
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,560
else needs me to be there. And I can't tell you how many times I've been

586
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:55,240
encouraged by attending one of these pastor's meeting, but also how I've been

587
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,760
able to encourage someone else. As I travel to the pastor's meetings,

588
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,120
oftentimes I pray that the Lord would allow me to be a blessing. I pray,

589
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,480
understanding that there are some pastors that might be there that day that are

590
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,600
ready to submit their resignation, they're just done with the ministry,

591
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,560
they're fed up, they've been hurt, they've been whatever, and they're just done, and

592
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,720
that God would help me to be a blessing and an encouragement. You know, the same

593
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,920
thing is true in the house of God. Yeah, we come that God would work in our

594
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,560
hearts and lives, but the reality is that you, somebody else, might need you to be

595
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:34,080
here today, because you might have the opportunity to, as we find in verse

596
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:39,080
number 16, that teaching and admonishing, that them seeing your life and seeing

597
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:44,200
your purpose, and you could have that influence in someone else's life. What a

598
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:52,720
blessing. See, the church is a family. Church is a family. There's a family. We

599
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:59,920
have the opportunity to come together in that unity and with that purpose of, it's

600
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:05,000
not about the individual, it's about the Lord Jesus Christ, and it's about how can

601
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,560
we advance His kingdom, how can we better serve and please Him with our lives

602
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,120
corporately and collectively. And God places the individuals, even as Paul

603
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:20,320
would use the illustration of the body of Christ and each member having its

604
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,960
purpose, and we find that God assembles the church, He builds His church, but He

605
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,600
does so so that He would be glorified. We think about our own personal, the ways

606
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:36,680
in which God has given us spiritual gifts. We understand about the truth of

607
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,000
let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, and what?

608
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Glorify your Father which is in heaven. When we read about the truth, as we think

609
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,160
about those spiritual gifts that God has blessed us with, and we understand

610
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:56,560
that He's given them to us, it's not that we had any say in it, He's gifted us

611
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,920
individually, but we find it as we minister, and as we're good stewards of

612
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,960
the manifold grace of God, that the purpose of our ministry is that in all

613
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,800
things that the Lord Jesus Christ would be glorified, according to 1st Peter

614
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:15,680
chapter number 4. And that's the purpose. And so as we gather together, as we think

615
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:21,280
about the behavior in the church house, and we think about the truth that Paul

616
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,560
has given, that we have here in the Word of God, in Colossians 3 verses 5

617
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,760
through 14, and we say we've done all of those things, and now it's going to be

618
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:39,160
evidenced in my behavior in the church house, characterized by peace, unity,

619
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:47,080
devotion, purpose, and number five, to be characterized by praise. Be characterized

620
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:51,520
by praise. I skipped over a couple of the phrases because really I believe all

621
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,960
three of these verses deal with the subject of praise. It's a wonderful thing

622
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:02,040
to praise the Lord. Let me say this, He is worthy of our praise. Amen? In everything

623
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:07,720
give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. In

624
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:14,120
everything. You say, well that's kind of hard. God's good all the time. God is good

625
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:22,480
all the time. Amen? Taste and see that the Lord is good. David confessed and

626
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,280
proclaimed that he had delivered him out of all of his troubles. He didn't say

627
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,440
that he kept all of the troubles from ever happening. He said God's just been

628
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:35,280
good even through the storms. Amen? Notice what he says in verse number 15 when we

629
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,480
think about this idea of praise. He ends the verse of Scripture and says this,

630
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:47,200
and be ye thankful. And be thankful. I believe that in verse number 16 when we

631
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,480
look about the the statement there in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,

632
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,440
singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord, though the phrase

633
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,880
praise or thanksgiving is not found there, I believe that the the verbiage

634
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:06,120
that is used inhabits the idea of praise and thanksgiving. As we're singing and

635
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:11,440
we're praising the Lord, I'm so thankful for the great hymns of the faith that

636
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:17,000
remind us and reinforce for us great biblical truth. And we find that we

637
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,640
praise him through our singing. We'll see that in just a moment as we go over the

638
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,760
book of Psalms in closing. But notice at the end of verse number 17, he says

639
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:33,760
giving thanks to God and the Father by Him. You know, our behavior should be

640
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:42,920
characterized by praise. We ought not be woe is me type of Christians. I know that

641
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,760
there's been some reference, I think my dad referenced it, but that Eeyore kind

642
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,920
of syndrome. How many y'all know who Eeyore is? Right? Oh bother. Right? Like

643
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,760
everything's a problem, right? It's just, you know, he's just living under the

644
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,920
circumstances, right? But as the people of God, we live above the circumstances. We

645
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,000
understand that God is sovereign and he's ordained things and he's allowed

646
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,760
things and so I'm gonna just praise him. I'm just gonna thank him. Why? Because God

647
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:16,680
is good. He's good all the time. We find that we as the people of God are

648
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,800
to be giving thanks and praising him. You know one of the characteristics that God

649
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:26,880
gives us in his Word with regard to the perilous times is that people would be

650
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:33,760
unthankful. Unthankful. Do you not see that in the world in which we live? People

651
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:41,320
are unthankful. People think they deserve something. Listen, as the people of God we

652
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,840
recognize all that we have is because of God's blessing. All that we are and all

653
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:52,920
that we have is all because of God. And so therefore we ought to praise him. We

654
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,440
ought to bless his holy name. Psalm 103 says not only bless his holy name but

655
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,600
all that is within me bless his holy name.

656
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,400
holy name. I mean that's passionate praise, amen? And I understand we don't

657
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,920
swing from the rafters and all that kind of crazy stuff, but the reality is that

658
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,640
we ought to be passionate about our praise. Listen, we can be

659
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,400
passionate about a lot of things, can we not? We ought to be passionate about

660
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:24,320
praising our God. Why? Because He's good. Turn over to Psalm 100, if you will. We'll

661
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,940
finish with a couple of passages in the book of Psalms this morning. Psalm 100 is

662
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:32,660
a psalm that we're familiar with, and I won't read all the five verses here, I

663
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:37,780
just want you to notice in verse number four, it's a wonderful psalm, but notice

664
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:44,140
what he says here in Psalm 100 and verse number four, enter into his gates, how?

665
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:52,420
With thanksgiving. And into his courts with what? Praise. Be thankful unto him

666
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:59,260
and bless his name. Oh man, we come to church and we're saying, oh Lord, thank you.

667
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:05,660
Thank you that you, in your infinite wisdom, you designed a church, right? It's

668
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:11,940
God's plan. Church isn't man's plan. It wasn't some person that just thought up,

669
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,420
you know, we should have church. No, it's God's plan, and God's given us the

670
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:20,380
instruction. We say, thank you that I have the ability to go. It's not a,

671
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:26,820
I gotta go to church. No, it's we get to, and God has something for me, and we

672
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:31,060
enter into his gates, we enter with thanksgiving. That's why I've often

673
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,700
said that as we have our time of prayer, when we think about our personal devotion,

674
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,380
not only allowing, let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, but

675
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:42,540
as we would spend time with God in prayer, that our prayer time ought to

676
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:46,060
be characterized, and really I believe our prayer time ought to be started with

677
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:50,860
praise and thanksgiving, that we just bless the name of the Lord, that we just

678
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:59,500
get caught up in how good he is. We ought to be thankful. We ought to praise him.

679
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:04,900
Notice Psalm 150, another familiar Psalm, but I want you to see, and I'm gonna read

680
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:19,300
the entirety of this Psalm. I did not count, but perhaps it would be a worthy

681
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:24,940
exercise to count the number of times praise is used in these just six verses.

682
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:33,460
Praise ye the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary. Praise him in the firmament of

683
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:40,020
his power. Praise him for his mighty acts. Praise him according to his

684
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:45,420
excellent greatness. Praise him with the sound of the trumpet. Praise him with the

685
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:50,420
psalter and harp. Praise him with the timbrel and dance. Praise him with

686
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:55,860
stringed instruments and organs. Praise him upon the loud cymbals. Praise him

687
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:02,020
upon the high-sounding cymbals. Let everything that hath breath praise the

688
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:12,020
Lord. Praise ye the Lord. Wow. Just read Psalm 150 every day this week. Honestly.

689
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:18,180
Say, God help me to be a praising Christian. Help me to understand. Notice

690
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,460
when he says in verse 2, praise him for his mighty acts. Praise him according to

691
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:26,860
his excellent greatness. That we not only praise God for what he does, but we

692
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:31,900
praise God for who he is. And we dig into the Word of God and we find out those

693
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:36,380
attributes of our God and we just thank God that he's holy and he's just and

694
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,940
he's sovereign and he's omnipotent and he's omniscient and he's omnipresent and he's my

695
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:44,860
helper. He's a very present help in the time of trouble. He's Alpha and Omega, the

696
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:48,700
beginning and the end. He's the Lord God omnipotent who reigneth. He's coming

697
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:54,500
again. Oh man, we just get excited about praising him. Amen. He's worthy of our

698
00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:00,060
praise. And we think about the way in which this passage of Scripture deals

699
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:06,940
with the behavior of God's people, specifically in the house of God. We say

700
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:13,460
how should our behavior be characterized? Peace. Let the peace of God rule in your

701
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:22,060
hearts. Unity in one body. Devotion. Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly

702
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:29,540
in all wisdom, personally and corporately, teaching and admonishing one another. How

703
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:35,500
should it be characterized? It should be characterized with purpose. With purpose.

704
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:42,780
All that we do is so that God would be exalted and magnified. Remember what Paul

705
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:47,060
said at the end of that passage in Colossians 1 when he spoke about his

706
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:52,060
ministry of teaching and warning every believer. He gave us what the purpose was

707
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:56,740
that he would, that we would may, that we may present every man perfect in Christ

708
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:02,660
Jesus. See, because one day we're gonna stand before him. We have purpose. Our

709
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:08,780
purpose is to exalt and magnify Christ whether in word or deed whatsoever we do.

710
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:14,180
Amen. It's all for God's glory. And then we see it's to be characterized by

711
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:21,740
praise. Oh, that we just lift up and praise the name of our God. He is worthy. He is

712
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:28,300
worthy of our praise. Next week we'll see the behavior in the home. A home that

713
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:33,300
is God-honoring. You know, God has, God not only created the church or had the

714
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,980
idea for the church, he had the idea for the home. It wasn't man's idea. It's God's

715
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,740
idea. It's God's plan. And as we take the Word of God and we say, okay, this is what

716
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,780
the behavior in the church house is supposed to be. Now this is what the

717
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:48,260
behavior in a home is supposed to be. And we'll see that God deals with each of the

718
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:52,380
individuals within a home. I'm so thankful for the Word of God and the way

719
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:57,660
in which it instructs us and helps us so that we could understand how it is that

720
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,900
we're to behave ourselves. Remember what Paul said to Timothy, that thou mayest

721
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:05,700
know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God. And here we find

722
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:10,140
that as we put off that old man in those grave clothes and we put on that new man

723
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:14,620
in the grace clothes, that it will be evidenced in our behavior. Oh, that God

724
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:20,620
would help us. That God would help us to be conformed to the image of His Son. That

725
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:26,300
we'd walk in the Spirit and not in the flesh. Let's pray. Father, we love You. We

726
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:31,660
thank You for loving us. We thank You for the Word of God. Father, I pray that You

727
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:37,500
would help us this morning to understand the importance of our behavior in the

728
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:42,820
church house. That we'd understand that these things are not manufactured in our

729
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:48,340
flesh. That these things are the result of walking in the Spirit. These things

730
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:55,420
are the result of putting off the old man and putting on the new. We thank You

731
00:46:55,420 --> 00:47:01,380
for the transformation that took place at our salvation. And God, I pray that You'd

732
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:06,140
help each one of us, each individual that's present this morning, to be

733
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:09,660
willing to crucify their flesh, to walk in the Spirit so we would not fulfill

734
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:16,100
the lust of the flesh. That we would say, as the Apostle Paul said, I am crucified

735
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:23,580
with Christ. That we'd live this life here on this earth for Your honor and for

736
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:33,300
Your glory. That we as a local assembly, Your church in this locale, God, we'd be

737
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:41,980
pleasing in Your sight. That our behavior be characterized with these

738
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:50,180
five truths that we find in this passage of Scripture. Would You work in hearts

739
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:54,660
and lives this morning? We pray the Holy Spirit of God would do what only He can

740
00:47:54,660 --> 00:48:01,100
do. He would take the Word of God and minister the heart of Your people. That

741
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:04,900
decisions would be made that would please Thee. We'll give You the glory for

742
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:08,420
all that You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me?

743
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,980
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. We'll have a moment of invitation. Kimberly's

744
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:15,780
gonna play quietly on the piano and as she does, perhaps the Holy Spirit of God

745
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:19,220
pricked your heart this morning and you need to come to this altar and ask God

746
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:25,940
to help you in some way. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
