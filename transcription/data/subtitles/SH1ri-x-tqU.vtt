WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.199
and be looking at verses 15 through 17 this morning Colossians chapter number 3 as we continue to make our way through this great book and

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:12.079
Of course starting in verse number 5 and down through verse number 14 over the last three weeks

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:14.079
We've had the opportunity to read

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:20.440
that detailed instruction that the Apostle Paul gives to the believers here in Colossi and of course by

00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:25.959
Preservation to us as well and we've learned that there's some things to put off fornication

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:32.639
uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence covetousness anger wrath malice

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.159
blasphemy filthy communication and lying what a list and

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.000
He said all these things you're to put off and then of course after you put those things off

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.479
He says put on therefore and that list included bowels of mercy kindness humbleness of mind meekness long-suffering

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:58.000
Forbearing one another forgiving one another and then he said of this above all these things put on charity

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.319
which is the bond of perfectness and

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.120
What a blessing to understand the principle that God has given us

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.559
Of course

00:01:07.559 --> 00:01:12.000
We often reference it from Galatians 5 that were to walk in the spirit

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.400
So that we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh in here

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:23.199
I believe that it's a very practical passage of Scripture that teaches us what it is to put to walk in the spirit

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:30.000
of course in that passage in Galatians 5 the Word of God tells us the works of the flesh are manifest in this way and

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:35.800
Provides us with a list and this is the fruit of the Spirit is and defines for us gives us those nine

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.000
Attributes as to how the fruit of the Spirit is described. And so we find that here

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.319
The Apostle Paul is providing us with this

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.760
Application if you will I would say this now that we have put off all of those things that we mentioned really we'd say the

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.239
Old man, remember we used this phrase last week with his grave clothes

00:01:56.239 --> 00:02:01.160
And now we've put on the new man with his grace clothes

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.419
We find that this now should be evidenced in our behavior

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:11.199
Doesn't that make sense if we've put off all these things if we've put on all these things

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.199
Remember 2nd Corinthians 5 if any man be in Christ, he's a new creature old things are passed away

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:22.240
Behold, all things are become new and as we walk in the spirit so that we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:26.080
We find that that it should impact our behavior

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.440
It should be evident in the way that we live and I believe that that's exactly what we see as we finish up the third

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.160
Chapter of the book of Colossians. In fact, even going into the first verse of chapter number four

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:44.679
We find that this remainder of this chapter in the first verse of chapter 4 really deals with the behavior of the believer

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.279
In three particular areas this morning

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:52.360
We'll be looking at verses 15 through 17 and I believe in this passage of Scripture

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.960
That God is really dealing with the behavior of the believer in the church house in the church house

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.839
We find that next week

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:07.559
We'll be looking at verses 18 through 21 and in that passage of Scripture God deals with our behavior in the home

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:15.039
And then we find that in verses 22 through chapter 4 and verse number 1 that God deals with our behavior in the workplace

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:17.880
I made this statement last week as we look through the

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.399
the particular details that were to put on and we looked at that list and I made this statement that if we begin to

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:29.199
truly walk with God as we're called to do so and we truly would to

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.919
Put into practice this which we find in the passage of Scripture. I believe we could make a great difference in our world

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:41.279
Truly that people would see Christ in us

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.160
Amen, and that's what they need to see. They don't need to see that. Well, they're just like we are

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.360
They don't have anything else that we need how many times we've heard people say about the church when you invite them

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.279
Oh, it's just full of a bunch of hypocrites and so on and so forth and people have stories and accounts and experiences of

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:03.880
Dealing with Christians and being lied to and being taking advantage of and so on and so forth and those things ought not be

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.960
Amen, and we find it as we would live the Christ life

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:16.040
remember the plan of God is that we as his people would be conformed to the image of his Son that we'd be sanctified and

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.119
What a blessing to understand that God

00:04:19.679 --> 00:04:23.760
Gives us in his word truth with regard to not only

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.920
What to put on and put off or put off and put on we should say but also how we are to behave or how those

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.200
Decisions would affect our behavior before we get into the passage

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.440
I'm reminded of what Paul said to Timothy over in 1st Timothy 3 in verse 15. He said but if I tarry long

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.480
That thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.160
Which is the church of the Living God the pillar and ground of the truth

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:54.160
Not everything that's called church today is church

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:56.640
amen, and

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.760
There is behavior that is appropriate in the church

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.959
And as we study this passage of Scripture in Colossians 3 verses 15 through 17

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:09.880
I would say this as we look at the title for the message behavior in the church house

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.679
I would say that our behavior in the church house should be characterized by five things and

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.079
Don't get too nervous that I have five points this morning

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:20.640
We'll go quickly through them

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:27.519
But I believe that our behavior should be characterized by the five things that we find in this portion of Scripture

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:31.279
Let me begin reading in verse 15. The Bible says this and the peace of God

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.660
Excuse me, and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the witch

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:43.600
Also, ye are called in one body and be thankful. Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.359
Teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:54.920
Singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord and whatsoever you do in word or deed

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.959
Do all in the name of the Lord Jesus

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:06.720
Giving thanks to God and the Father by Him with the help of God this morning. I want to give you these five character

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.760
Characteristics if you will on how our behavior should be characterized in the church house

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.600
I will say this the Apostle Paul is not

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:23.859
instructing these believers to practice something that he is not already doing personally and that's a wonderful blessing when you have the

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:28.519
opportunity to study the life of the Apostle Paul and you study his life and then you read his

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.399
Instruction to these believers as God would use him to pen much of the New Testament

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:37.239
We see that Paul was a man that as he said to the church in Philippi

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:43.480
not only the things that you've heard from me, but the things that you've seen in me do and

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.359
What a blessing to understand the instruction that is provided here number one

00:06:49.359 --> 00:06:54.920
If you're taking notes our behavior in the church house should be characterized by peace by peace

00:06:56.079 --> 00:06:59.600
Notice the Word of God says and let the peace of God

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:06.279
Rule in your hearts we find that it is the peace of God. It is not man's peace

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:12.040
It is not something that we try to conjure up in our own ways and try to figure out how to do this

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.920
It's not manufactured by us

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:20.920
It is the peace of God and God tells us here in the passage of Scripture that were to let it's the peace of God

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.079
Let God's peace notice rule in your hearts

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:31.119
The word rule carries with it the idea of being an umpire being a rule or the one that would oversee

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.959
You would think about the time of writing and you would think about some of those

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.200
games that would be played and how they would have

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:45.600
Officials and they would have the judges and how they were the ones that would rule over they would have the control of that

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:49.040
Particular event we're familiar with that when you think about various

00:07:49.679 --> 00:07:56.799
Athletic competitions, in fact when Friday evening we're at a volleyball game and there was a there's supposed to be two referees

00:07:56.799 --> 00:07:58.040
But there's only one and man

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.640
She did the best she could but she missed a whole bunch of calls

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:03.640
But guess what? She was the one that was ruling that court

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:09.160
It was her call and whatever call she made whether it was agreed upon or not

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:14.959
It stood and in the same manner we see that were to let the peace of God notice that word let

00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:22.000
It's something that we need to be aware of and we need to allow God's peace to rule in our hearts

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.279
And I believe that we think about we're mindful of what Jesus said in John 14 in verse number 27

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:33.919
Of course as he's preparing his disciples for that day in which he would go to the cross of Calvary just a short time

00:08:34.239 --> 00:08:37.559
from when he's speaking these words to his disciples and

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:42.960
He's already told them about not letting their heart be troubled and he's told them great things

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.960
But he tells them this in John 14 in verse number 27 peace. I leave with you

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.320
Then he says this

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:56.359
My peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you

00:08:56.479 --> 00:08:58.960
Let not your heart be troubled neither

00:08:59.479 --> 00:09:07.200
Let it be afraid. Oh in the house of God. We need to allow the peace of God to rule in our hearts

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.679
I understand that the Scriptures talk about the the peace of God

00:09:11.719 --> 00:09:13.159
which passeth all

00:09:13.159 --> 00:09:19.400
understanding we understand that he will keep us in perfect peace whose mind is stayed upon him and

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.359
What a blessing to know the peace of God. I

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Believe contextually as we're thinking about the behavior in the church when he's speaking about the peace of God ruling in your hearts

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.599
we're thinking about a body of believers and

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:39.719
Remember, he'd already instructed him in the previous passage in verse 13 for bearing one another and forgiving one another

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:45.599
And now he says that we're to let the peace of God rule in our hearts and with that context and with that

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.440
Understanding I believe that we would understand that this is the same peace that we see in the life of Christ

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.880
During his earthly ministry and it should be seen in our lives

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.640
And I would say this

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.640
peace in this

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.640
and it's really the opposite of having conflict and division.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.640
See, many people have the idea that peace is the absence of trouble,

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.640
but the reality is that we can be in the very midst of great trouble

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.640
and have the peace of God. Amen?

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.640
But we think about the peace of God in church,

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.640
and as we as a body of believers,

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.640
as we're allowing the peace of God to rule in our hearts,

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:32.640
it's going to result in not having conflict and division and schisms and so on and so forth.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:38.640
Why? Because we're allowing the peace of God to rule in our hearts.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.640
How often the people of God can be in contention one with another

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.640
and hinder the work of God,

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.640
or to let the peace of God rule in our hearts.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.640
How do we do that? Well, that's the result of putting off and putting on.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.640
As we put off all of those things, as we put on all of these things,

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.640
we get rid of the old man in his grave clothes,

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.640
we put on the new man in his grace clothes,

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:08.640
then that's evident in our behavior and we allow the peace of God to rule in our hearts.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.640
See, it's opposite of what we see in the church in Corinth.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.640
The church in Corinth is not a model church.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.640
The church in Thessalonica is a good church, a model church,

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.640
but the church in Corinth is filled with problems and difficulties,

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.640
and Paul is correcting them in 1 Corinthians,

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.640
and he's giving them very straight instruction.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.640
I'll mention this many years ago,

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.640
but I'll never forget being in a place down in Tennessee,

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.640
and I saw a church, and it was called the First Baptist Church of Corinth,

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.640
and I thought, those guys are crazy. They're out of their mind.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.640
Why would you name your church the First Baptist Church of Corinth?

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.640
But they did.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.640
And listen, here's how God tells us in his word about the church in Corinth.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.640
See, they're not letting the peace of God rule in their hearts.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.640
Look at 1 Corinthians 1.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.640
Look at just a couple of verses.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:02.640
Notice in verse 11, as Paul is beginning really still his introduction

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.640
and the purpose of his writing, he says this in 1 Corinthians 1 and verse 11,

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.640
For if it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren,

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.640
by them which are of the house of Chloe,

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.640
that there are contentions among you.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.640
In chapter 3, notice what he says in verse 1.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.640
He says,

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.640
And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual,

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.640
but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.640
I have fed you with milk and not with meat,

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.640
for hitherto you were not able to bear it,

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.640
neither yet now are you able.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.640
Because you are carnal.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.640
Notice the result of that carnality.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.640
It says,

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:45.640
For whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions,

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.640
are ye carnal and walk as men?

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.640
And he begins to describe that carnality being seen

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.640
in those that were saying,

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.640
I'm of Paul, I'm of Apollos, and so on and so forth.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.640
And we understand the divisions that are mentioned there,

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.640
but we find that that is not the plan of God

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.640
for the behavior of the people of God in the church of God.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.640
We're to let the peace of God rule in our hearts.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.640
As we go back to Colossians 3,

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.640
and we notice the behavior that is listed here,

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.640
I believe not only should the behavior in the church house

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.640
be characterized by peace,

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.640
but it also should be characterized by unity.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.640
Look back in verse 15,

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.640
the Bible says,

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.640
And let the peace of God rule in your hearts,

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.640
notice this,

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.640
to the which also ye are called in one body.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.640
It's a blessed thing to have unity.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.640
Amen?

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.640
Personally, I don't like division.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.640
I don't like contention.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.640
I don't like all of that stuff.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.640
I like unity.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.640
And the reality is that we understand,

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.640
as Paul would say to the church in Ephesus in Ephesians 4,

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.640
he tells them that they're endeavoring

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.640
to keep the unity of the Spirit

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.640
a bond of peace in Ephesians 4,

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.640
in verse 3.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.640
And we think about this thing of unity,

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.640
he says here,

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.640
to the which ye are called in one body.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.640
We've often mentioned the way in which we strive for

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.640
and we endeavor to keep the unity of the Spirit,

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.640
that unity is the result of walking with God.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.640
Unity is the result of embracing the truth

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.640
of the Word of God.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.640
Unity is not something, again, that we manufacture.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.640
It's not something where we come to this place

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.640
of just deciding that everyone can hold hands

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.640
in this ecumenical movement.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.640
We're just going to embrace the things that would unite us

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.640
and just forget about the things that would divide us.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.640
No, unity is when we take the Word of God

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.640
and say this is the standard

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.640
and we're going to agree with God.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.640
Amen?

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.640
And as I agree with God and as you agree with God

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.640
and each one of us agree with God,

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.640
then guess what?

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.640
We can have unity.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.640
And we can have that spirit of unity in the church.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.640
And what a blessing that is.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.640
And we find that this is the plan of God.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.640
This is the behavior that ought to be evidenced.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.640
And we find characterized not only by peace,

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.640
but by unity.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.640
Notice in Philippians 2.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.640
Notice how Paul will describe this to these believers here.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.640
And he's speaking to these.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.640
We mentioned this portion of Scripture last week

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.640
as we spoke about humility and humbleness of mind.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.640
But notice here in Philippians 2,

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.640
beginning in v. 1, he says,

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.640
if there be therefore any consolation in Christ,

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.640
if any comfort of love,

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.640
if any fellowship of the Spirit,

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.640
if any bowels and mercies.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.640
Notice what Paul says.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.640
Fulfill ye my joy.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.640
How are they going to fulfill his joy?

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.640
Notice what he says.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:43.640
That ye be like-minded.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.640
Having the same love.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.640
Being of one accord of one mind.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.640
You know what the devil seeks to do

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.640
is he seeks to divide.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.640
That's what the enemy does.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.640
You can look at the church in Acts

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.640
and you can read about the church in Jerusalem

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:03.640
as the disciples started after the day of Pentecost

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.640
and all that took place there with the church

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.640
and the progress of the Gospel being preached

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.640
and souls being saved and the church growing

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.640
and God working mightily.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.640
You find that they were in one accord.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.640
You often see that phraseology that is mentioned.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.640
And so what happens?

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.640
Well, the enemy comes in

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.640
and the enemy seeks to divide.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.640
And the enemy is always about division.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.640
The enemy does not want us as the people of God

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.640
to be united.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.640
He wants us to be divided. Why?

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.640
Because if we're fighting with each other,

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.640
if we're divided in the church house,

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.640
then we're not doing what we're supposed to do.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.640
We're not out there sowing the seeds.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.640
We're not out there reaping the harvest.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.640
We're not out there preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.640
to a lost and dying world. Why?

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.640
Because we're all focused on what's going on in the church

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.640
and what our little divisions and schisms

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.640
and I'm this and I'm that and you're this

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.640
and so on and so forth.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.640
And all of a sudden,

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.640
we find that the enemy has been successful

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:01.640
on rendering the people of God useless.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.640
That's the plan of the enemy.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.640
To cause division.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.640
You know, it's not said of the church in Corinth

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.640
that they were spreading the Word of God

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.640
the way that the church in Thessalonica was.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.640
And you can read of these differences

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.640
and understand.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.640
And so, when we begin to think about

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.640
this understanding of the plan of God

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.640
and how we put off those grave clothes

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.640
with the old man

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.640
and put on the new man with the grace clothes

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.640
and how our behavior will change

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.640
and we'll have that peace of God

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.640
ruling in our hearts

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.640
that will lead to unity amongst the brethren.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.640
It's a blessed thing to have unity.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.640
I don't like being at odds with anyone.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.640
I mean, there are some people

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.640
that just seem to like contention.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.640
You ever meet some people like that?

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.640
They just kind of thrive on it.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.640
I don't get that.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.640
I don't like contention.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.640
I don't like division.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.640
I like unity.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.640
And I'm thankful that we have the Word of God.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.640
Often times, I've spoken to people in my office

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.640
in various situations, counseling,

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.640
maybe some folks that have visited the church

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.640
that have questions about the church

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.640
and so on and so forth

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.640
or someone that has some disagreement

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.640
with something that they've seen

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.640
in our doctrinal statement

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.640
or some other situation.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.640
And I'll say something to this effect.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.640
Can we just agree to agree with God?

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.640
As Baptist people, we've said for centuries

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.640
that the Word of God is our sole authority

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.640
for faith and practice.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.640
And so therefore, if it is the sole authority

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.640
for faith and practice,

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.640
if we agree with God,

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.640
let's see what God says.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.640
And we just open the Scriptures

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.640
and let God be God

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.640
and let the Word of God say

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.640
what the Word of God says.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.640
You know the Word of God isn't as difficult

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.640
as some people make it out to be.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.640
They say, oh, it's too hard to understand.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.640
Sometimes it's just that we don't want to understand it

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.640
because we don't want to apply it.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.640
We don't want to do it.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.640
We don't want to live it.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.640
And here, as Paul has gone through

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.640
with this church and Colossians,

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.640
he's gone through all of this behavior

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.640
and all of this put off and put on,

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.640
he says now that our behavior

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.640
in the church house will be characterized

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.640
in this manner.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.640
He'll deal with the home in our next section

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.640
and then in the workplace.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.640
Why?

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.640
Because we're Christians 24-7.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.640
It's not just Christians in the church house.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.640
We're to be representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.640
every minute of every day of our lives.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.640
And that's why he deals with the church house,

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.640
the home, and the workplace.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.640
And we'll get through those over the next couple of weeks.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.640
Back in Colossians 3, notice,

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.640
not only should our behavior in the church house

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.640
be characterized by peace and unity,

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.640
I believe number three,

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.640
it should be characterized by devotion.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.640
By devotion.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.640
You know, there's a purpose when we come to church.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.640
Our purpose is to exalt and magnify

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.640
the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.640
Our purpose is to teach the Word of God.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.640
Again, as I mentioned by way of introduction,

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.640
not everything that's called a church is a church today.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.440
And there's a lot of places in which, throughout our society,

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:09.640
where the Word of God just, quite frankly, is not being taught.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.940
I'm thankful for those churches that are standing on the truth of the Word of God

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.840
and that are continuing to be faithful,

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.940
that are continuing to preach the Word of God.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.440
But there's a great pressure in our society today

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.740
to kind of step away from some of those things

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:28.240
and not be so contentious and so dogmatic about what God says in His Word,

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.140
and let's just be love, and let's just embrace, and so on and so forth.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:39.140
But I'm sorry, I believe this morning that love is going to tell us the truth.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:44.140
Love is not permissive, love is protective.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.740
We find here that as we enter into verse number 16,

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.640
we see this idea of devotion, where the Bible says,

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:56.440
let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.940
What a great phraseology.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.240
Again, we see the word let, we see that in verse 15,

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.740
again in verse number 16, something that we're to do to allow the Word of Christ.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:09.340
And we think about this word dwell when it says to dwell in you richly in all wisdom.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:13.640
It means to abide in and influence.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:18.540
Why is it that Paul would tell Timothy in 2 Timothy 4,

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.940
after he tells him about all of the things with regard to the last days,

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.140
and all of the perilous times that will be present in the last days,

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.640
and evil men and seducers waxing worse and worse,

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.540
and all of that, and he enters into the fourth chapter and he says,

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.140
preach the Word.

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.240
Preach the Word.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.140
Why? Because we need the Word of God to be dwelling in us.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.640
We need it to be influencing us.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.540
We find that Peter would give the instruction to the elders,

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:49.440
the pastors in 1 Peter 5, to feed the flock of God.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.040
What do we feed? We feed the Word of God.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.240
That's our responsibility.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.240
That's the responsibility of the pastor, to feed the flock of God.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.140
And we find this idea of the Word of God,

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.640
let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom,

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.240
and we're allowing it to abide in us and to influence us.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.640
I said this many years ago.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.740
I didn't make up the phrase or the quote,

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:13.940
but someone said this,

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:18.640
thumbprints in the Bible are more important than footprints on the moon.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.940
And I said, that's good.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.640
Why? Because we're in the Word of God so that it can get into us.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.140
I want to think and act biblically.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:30.240
I want to be in a place where when something comes up in my life

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.340
and I'm looking at a situation, a decision that has to be made,

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:37.340
that I've allowed the Word of Christ to dwell in me richly in all wisdom,

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.140
that I can have that source of wisdom,

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:46.340
that Word of God that will give me the guidance and the direction that I need.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:50.640
When I speak of devotion, I believe that it's a personal devotion,

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.740
but it's not only a personal devotion.

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.840
We find that it would be a corporate devotion.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.340
The reality is that we individually, as the children of God,

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.640
we are to be seeking the Word of God.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.740
We're to be feasting upon the Word of God daily in our lives.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:10.440
That we should hunger and thirst after righteousness.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.840
As newborn babes, that we would desire the sincere milk of the Word

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.240
that we may grow thereby.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.540
That we would truly, as I preached several weeks ago,

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.140
say, as Samuel said,

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.940
speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:32.440
That we're personally, each of us, each one, each member of the church,

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.740
that we are personally in the Word of God,

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.940
feasting upon the Word of God.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:41.340
When's the last time someone in the church came to you and said,

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.240
hey, brother, hey, sister,

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:48.040
what's God been teaching you in your devotions this week?

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.140
How's God been working in your life?

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:55.140
It's not something very common that we practice in our lives.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.140
We talk about all kinds of things, right?

00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.340
We really do.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.940
But for some reason, we avoid the conversation of,

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:07.140
hey, brother so-and-so, what did God show you this week in His Word?

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.740
How's God working in your life?

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.540
Several years ago, I was at a pastor's meeting.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.540
I sat down to have lunch at this pastor's meeting.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.440
It was a large pastor's meeting.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:20.640
In fact, Kimberly's parents, we were there with them.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.140
And we met a number of pastors that had never met before.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.540
And Brother Sommerdorf kind of led the group that we were there with.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:31.640
And there were hundreds of pastors that were at this particular conference.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.540
And some had their spouses with them.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:35.140
Some had staff members with them.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.040
And I remember sitting down to have lunch.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.840
And it was the very first day that we were there.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.740
And there was a pastor.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:40.740
I prayed for him this morning.

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.240
His name is Scotty Bockhaus.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.540
Do you know Brother Scotty?

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.240
And Scotty Bockhaus.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.640
And he's a pastor.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.940
And we sat down to have lunch.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.140
I'd never met the guy other than just introducing ourselves to one another.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:51.940
We sat down for lunch.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:57.640
And he said, so, brother, what's God been teaching you in His Word?

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.540
And I thought, that's good.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:04.040
And I was able to share with him what God had been teaching me,

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.940
where I was in my personal devotions.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.140
And then I asked him.

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.840
And, man, we had great fellowship.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:15.040
We weren't just talking about the weather or the sports or the politics or whatever, right?

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:15.840
No.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.840
Talk about how's God working?

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.940
How's He using His Word in my life, in your life?

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:22.740
It's that personal devotion.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.740
I believe also that it's a corporate devotion.

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:30.040
Notice, as we come together for the purpose of worship of the Lord,

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.540
notice what he says in verse 16.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:38.340
Teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.940
singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.340
That idea of teaching and admonishing.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.640
It's instruction. It's warning.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:50.840
It's the public ministry of the Word of God, as I'm doing even here this morning.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.640
It's what Paul spoke about when he said in Colossians 1 and verse 28,

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.940
whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom,

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:03.140
that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus,

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:10.240
whereunto I also labor, striving according to His working which worketh in me mightily.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.140
And Paul was engaged in this behavior.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.940
And he's saying to these believers in Colossae that if you've put off these things

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.440
and you've put on these things,

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:22.640
it should be evidenced in your behavior in first in the church house.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:27.740
It should be characterized not only by what we find here with peace and unity,

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:31.840
but now with devotion.

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:38.040
I wonder how often we go through the process of self-examination.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.440
We say, where am I in my walk with Christ?

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.540
Am I closer to God today than I was a year ago?

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:49.240
Am I closer to God today than I was a month ago, a week ago?

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.540
How's my devotion? What am I learning?

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:55.440
What have I learned publicly? What have I learned privately?

00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:02.440
Notice what it says here, teaching and admonishing one another.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.540
You know, there are a lot of one another commands in the New Testament

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.640
with regard to the people of God and the church of God.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:13.140
That's why the church of God is a called out assembly, right?

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:18.040
I understand people use Livestream. That's not church.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:21.940
Church is the assembling of God's people. Why?

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:25.240
Because how are we going to admonish and instruct one another

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:29.140
if we've not assembled together, right?

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:30.840
Now, I'm not against Livestream. We have it.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:34.140
We have people that are watching and I'm perfectly fine with it.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:40.140
But the reality is that we can't fulfill these responsibilities unless we assemble.

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.540
And so we assemble because we want to instruct.

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:47.140
We want to, as we find here in this verse of Scripture,

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.740
teach and admonish one another.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.340
Iron sharpeneth iron.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.940
That's what Solomon said in Proverbs. Iron sharpeneth iron.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.240
And so as we have the opportunity to engage in this work

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:04.940
and we understand how we're to be instructing and warning one another,

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:08.140
there's some experiences that you've had that somebody else might not have

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:12.840
that you as a more mature believer might have the opportunity to instruct them

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:18.340
and to warn them and to give them truth from the Word of God.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.840
And that's a wonderful thing.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.940
It's a blessed thing when we have that spirit

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:30.340
not only of peace and unity, but of devotion.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:34.540
God's house is a house of prayer. It's a spiritual house.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.239
Church is not a club.

00:28:36.239 --> 00:28:39.239
It's not just something that we just, okay, check it off the box.

00:28:39.239 --> 00:28:44.340
I did church this week. No. So much more than that.

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:48.040
Not only do we see peace and unity and devotion,

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:52.440
but I believe that as we look down into verse number 17,

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.540
our behavior in the church house should be characterized by purpose.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:59.040
By purpose. What do I mean by that?

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:05.340
I believe the purpose is to exalt and magnify the Lord.

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:08.040
Very plainly. That is the purpose.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.640
Notice how he says it in verse 17,

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:14.940
"...and whatsoever ye do in word or deed..."

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:19.340
Now that's a pretty conclusive statement.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:23.940
I mean a broad, far-reaching, all-inclusive statement.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.940
He says, "...and whatsoever you do in word or deed,

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:31.940
do all in the name of the Lord Jesus."

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.640
I'm mindful of what John the Baptist said.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:39.140
He must increase. I must decrease.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.040
It's all about the Lord.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:44.840
It's not about the individual.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.840
It's not about making a name for ourselves.

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.239
It's not about someone looking at another brother or sister in the church

00:29:51.239 --> 00:29:52.739
and putting them up on a pedestal.

00:29:52.739 --> 00:29:57.540
No, it's about the Lord Jesus Christ being magnified and exalted in our midst.

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.540
It's about us giving testimony of how God has worked in our midst.

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:05.160
our lives. Listen, all that we are is, as Paul said, by the grace of God. I am what

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:10.860
I am by the grace of God. God's working in our lives. Where would we be this

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:15.000
morning if it had not been for Christ? Where would we be this morning if it

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.320
were not for the gospel coming to your home and to my home, right? It's all about

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.840
the Lord. And we come to church, we come with this purpose that we're to do all

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:31.140
whatsoever you do, in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus. It's

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:39.060
His church and it's all about Him. In the video presentation, Brother Pate

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:44.700
referenced Matthew 16, 18, where the Lord Jesus Christ said, I will build my church

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:49.980
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. This is God's church and all

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:55.120
that we do is to be done for His honor and for His glory, that He might be

00:30:55.120 --> 00:31:00.120
exalted and magnified in our midst. In Acts 20, in verse number 28, as Paul is

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:04.560
speaking to those leaders of the church in Ephesus, as he's on his way to

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:09.200
Jerusalem, he gives them much instruction. He desired to be able to see

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.800
them and, oh, the depth and richness of that which he communicates to these

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:19.080
church leaders in Acts 20. But I want you to notice in

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:24.220
verse number 28, Paul says this, take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:28.380
flock over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers. Notice what he says,

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:34.320
to feed the church of God, but then it says this, which he hath purchased with

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:41.020
his own blood. It's His church. We sing the song more about Jesus, how

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:46.700
appropriate that song is, because it's really all about Jesus. Jesus is the

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:53.240
sweetest name I know. Amen? And we find that we come with that purpose when we

00:31:53.240 --> 00:32:00.140
assembled this morning, when you woke up this morning, you had some purpose and

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:05.200
some desire that you're gonna be in church, and your purpose, hopefully, was

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:09.020
that you would come and that you would be able to worship the Lord and magnify

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:12.680
and exalt the Lord, that you'd be encouraged and strengthened through the

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:16.360
the singing of the great hymns of the faith, that you'd be encouraged and

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.320
strengthened and challenged through the preaching of the Word of God, that we

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:25.360
would come expecting to hear from God, anticipating how God would work in our

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:30.520
lives individually, and purpose to take what we hear and apply it in our lives,

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:35.080
that we would be doers of the Word and not hearers only. You know, there's some

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:40.480
people over the years I'm thankful that God has blessed, and we don't have too

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:44.880
much of this, at least not on a regular basis. It's happened from time to time.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.040
When you're in any place for the length of time, not that 10 years is

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:51.640
extremely long, but really for the average of a pastor, it's a lengthy

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:55.800
period of time, and there are people that sometimes show up to church just to

00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:01.440
criticize the sermon. People that listen online just to criticize the sermon.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:07.120
You didn't come for the right purpose. You didn't come with the heart of all

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:11.680
that we do for the glory of God and how God might work in my heart and in my

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:16.960
life, and how he might allow me to be able to influence another brother or

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:23.680
sister in Christ. As you know, I attend regularly a pastor's meeting, the

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:27.400
Atlantic Independent Baptist Fellowship, and as I attend that pastor's meeting,

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.280
there are certain times, certain periods of time, where things are busier than

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:35.800
other times, and there are times in which, man, it's a tough deal for me to put on

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:39.760
my schedule to be out of the office and to go to a pastor's meeting, but

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:44.480
something that I understand is that not only do I need it, but sometimes somebody

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:50.560
else needs me to be there. And I can't tell you how many times I've been

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:55.240
encouraged by attending one of these pastor's meeting, but also how I've been

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:59.760
able to encourage someone else. As I travel to the pastor's meetings,

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:04.120
oftentimes I pray that the Lord would allow me to be a blessing. I pray,

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:07.480
understanding that there are some pastors that might be there that day that are

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.600
ready to submit their resignation, they're just done with the ministry,

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:14.560
they're fed up, they've been hurt, they've been whatever, and they're just done, and

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:18.720
that God would help me to be a blessing and an encouragement. You know, the same

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:24.920
thing is true in the house of God. Yeah, we come that God would work in our

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:29.560
hearts and lives, but the reality is that you, somebody else, might need you to be

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:34.080
here today, because you might have the opportunity to, as we find in verse

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:39.080
number 16, that teaching and admonishing, that them seeing your life and seeing

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:44.200
your purpose, and you could have that influence in someone else's life. What a

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:52.720
blessing. See, the church is a family. Church is a family. There's a family. We

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:59.920
have the opportunity to come together in that unity and with that purpose of, it's

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:05.000
not about the individual, it's about the Lord Jesus Christ, and it's about how can

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.560
we advance His kingdom, how can we better serve and please Him with our lives

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:16.120
corporately and collectively. And God places the individuals, even as Paul

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:20.320
would use the illustration of the body of Christ and each member having its

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:24.960
purpose, and we find that God assembles the church, He builds His church, but He

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.600
does so so that He would be glorified. We think about our own personal, the ways

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:36.680
in which God has given us spiritual gifts. We understand about the truth of

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.000
let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, and what?

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Glorify your Father which is in heaven. When we read about the truth, as we think

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.160
about those spiritual gifts that God has blessed us with, and we understand

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:56.560
that He's given them to us, it's not that we had any say in it, He's gifted us

00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:00.920
individually, but we find it as we minister, and as we're good stewards of

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:04.960
the manifold grace of God, that the purpose of our ministry is that in all

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:09.800
things that the Lord Jesus Christ would be glorified, according to 1st Peter

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:15.680
chapter number 4. And that's the purpose. And so as we gather together, as we think

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:21.280
about the behavior in the church house, and we think about the truth that Paul

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:27.560
has given, that we have here in the Word of God, in Colossians 3 verses 5

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:30.760
through 14, and we say we've done all of those things, and now it's going to be

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:39.160
evidenced in my behavior in the church house, characterized by peace, unity,

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:47.080
devotion, purpose, and number five, to be characterized by praise. Be characterized

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:51.520
by praise. I skipped over a couple of the phrases because really I believe all

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:55.960
three of these verses deal with the subject of praise. It's a wonderful thing

00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:02.040
to praise the Lord. Let me say this, He is worthy of our praise. Amen? In everything

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:07.720
give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. In

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:14.120
everything. You say, well that's kind of hard. God's good all the time. God is good

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:22.480
all the time. Amen? Taste and see that the Lord is good. David confessed and

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:27.280
proclaimed that he had delivered him out of all of his troubles. He didn't say

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.440
that he kept all of the troubles from ever happening. He said God's just been

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:35.280
good even through the storms. Amen? Notice what he says in verse number 15 when we

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.480
think about this idea of praise. He ends the verse of Scripture and says this,

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:47.200
and be ye thankful. And be thankful. I believe that in verse number 16 when we

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:51.480
look about the the statement there in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:56.440
singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord, though the phrase

00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:00.880
praise or thanksgiving is not found there, I believe that the the verbiage

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:06.120
that is used inhabits the idea of praise and thanksgiving. As we're singing and

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:11.440
we're praising the Lord, I'm so thankful for the great hymns of the faith that

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:17.000
remind us and reinforce for us great biblical truth. And we find that we

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.640
praise him through our singing. We'll see that in just a moment as we go over the

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:25.760
book of Psalms in closing. But notice at the end of verse number 17, he says

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:33.760
giving thanks to God and the Father by Him. You know, our behavior should be

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:42.920
characterized by praise. We ought not be woe is me type of Christians. I know that

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:47.760
there's been some reference, I think my dad referenced it, but that Eeyore kind

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:52.920
of syndrome. How many y'all know who Eeyore is? Right? Oh bother. Right? Like

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:57.760
everything's a problem, right? It's just, you know, he's just living under the

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:01.920
circumstances, right? But as the people of God, we live above the circumstances. We

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.000
understand that God is sovereign and he's ordained things and he's allowed

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.760
things and so I'm gonna just praise him. I'm just gonna thank him. Why? Because God

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:16.680
is good. He's good all the time. We find that we as the people of God are

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:21.800
to be giving thanks and praising him. You know one of the characteristics that God

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:26.880
gives us in his Word with regard to the perilous times is that people would be

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:33.760
unthankful. Unthankful. Do you not see that in the world in which we live? People

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:41.320
are unthankful. People think they deserve something. Listen, as the people of God we

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:45.840
recognize all that we have is because of God's blessing. All that we are and all

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:52.920
that we have is all because of God. And so therefore we ought to praise him. We

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:57.440
ought to bless his holy name. Psalm 103 says not only bless his holy name but

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:02.600
all that is within me bless his holy name.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:06.400
holy name. I mean that's passionate praise, amen? And I understand we don't

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:10.920
swing from the rafters and all that kind of crazy stuff, but the reality is that

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.640
we ought to be passionate about our praise. Listen, we can be

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:17.400
passionate about a lot of things, can we not? We ought to be passionate about

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:24.320
praising our God. Why? Because He's good. Turn over to Psalm 100, if you will. We'll

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.940
finish with a couple of passages in the book of Psalms this morning. Psalm 100 is

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:32.660
a psalm that we're familiar with, and I won't read all the five verses here, I

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:37.780
just want you to notice in verse number four, it's a wonderful psalm, but notice

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:44.140
what he says here in Psalm 100 and verse number four, enter into his gates, how?

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:52.420
With thanksgiving. And into his courts with what? Praise. Be thankful unto him

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:59.260
and bless his name. Oh man, we come to church and we're saying, oh Lord, thank you.

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:05.660
Thank you that you, in your infinite wisdom, you designed a church, right? It's

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:11.940
God's plan. Church isn't man's plan. It wasn't some person that just thought up,

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:16.420
you know, we should have church. No, it's God's plan, and God's given us the

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:20.380
instruction. We say, thank you that I have the ability to go. It's not a,

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:26.820
I gotta go to church. No, it's we get to, and God has something for me, and we

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:31.060
enter into his gates, we enter with thanksgiving. That's why I've often

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:34.700
said that as we have our time of prayer, when we think about our personal devotion,

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:38.380
not only allowing, let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, but

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:42.540
as we would spend time with God in prayer, that our prayer time ought to

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:46.060
be characterized, and really I believe our prayer time ought to be started with

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:50.860
praise and thanksgiving, that we just bless the name of the Lord, that we just

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:59.500
get caught up in how good he is. We ought to be thankful. We ought to praise him.

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:04.900
Notice Psalm 150, another familiar Psalm, but I want you to see, and I'm gonna read

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:19.300
the entirety of this Psalm. I did not count, but perhaps it would be a worthy

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:24.940
exercise to count the number of times praise is used in these just six verses.

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:33.460
Praise ye the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary. Praise him in the firmament of

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:40.020
his power. Praise him for his mighty acts. Praise him according to his

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:45.420
excellent greatness. Praise him with the sound of the trumpet. Praise him with the

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:50.420
psalter and harp. Praise him with the timbrel and dance. Praise him with

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:55.860
stringed instruments and organs. Praise him upon the loud cymbals. Praise him

00:42:55.860 --> 00:43:02.020
upon the high-sounding cymbals. Let everything that hath breath praise the

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:12.020
Lord. Praise ye the Lord. Wow. Just read Psalm 150 every day this week. Honestly.

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:18.180
Say, God help me to be a praising Christian. Help me to understand. Notice

00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:21.460
when he says in verse 2, praise him for his mighty acts. Praise him according to

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:26.860
his excellent greatness. That we not only praise God for what he does, but we

00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:31.900
praise God for who he is. And we dig into the Word of God and we find out those

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:36.380
attributes of our God and we just thank God that he's holy and he's just and

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:40.940
he's sovereign and he's omnipotent and he's omniscient and he's omnipresent and he's my

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:44.860
helper. He's a very present help in the time of trouble. He's Alpha and Omega, the

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:48.700
beginning and the end. He's the Lord God omnipotent who reigneth. He's coming

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:54.500
again. Oh man, we just get excited about praising him. Amen. He's worthy of our

00:43:54.500 --> 00:44:00.060
praise. And we think about the way in which this passage of Scripture deals

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:06.940
with the behavior of God's people, specifically in the house of God. We say

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:13.460
how should our behavior be characterized? Peace. Let the peace of God rule in your

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:22.060
hearts. Unity in one body. Devotion. Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:29.540
in all wisdom, personally and corporately, teaching and admonishing one another. How

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:35.500
should it be characterized? It should be characterized with purpose. With purpose.

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:42.780
All that we do is so that God would be exalted and magnified. Remember what Paul

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:47.060
said at the end of that passage in Colossians 1 when he spoke about his

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:52.060
ministry of teaching and warning every believer. He gave us what the purpose was

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:56.740
that he would, that we would may, that we may present every man perfect in Christ

00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:02.660
Jesus. See, because one day we're gonna stand before him. We have purpose. Our

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:08.780
purpose is to exalt and magnify Christ whether in word or deed whatsoever we do.

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:14.180
Amen. It's all for God's glory. And then we see it's to be characterized by

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:21.740
praise. Oh, that we just lift up and praise the name of our God. He is worthy. He is

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:28.300
worthy of our praise. Next week we'll see the behavior in the home. A home that

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:33.300
is God-honoring. You know, God has, God not only created the church or had the

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:37.980
idea for the church, he had the idea for the home. It wasn't man's idea. It's God's

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:42.740
idea. It's God's plan. And as we take the Word of God and we say, okay, this is what

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.780
the behavior in the church house is supposed to be. Now this is what the

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:48.260
behavior in a home is supposed to be. And we'll see that God deals with each of the

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:52.380
individuals within a home. I'm so thankful for the Word of God and the way

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:57.660
in which it instructs us and helps us so that we could understand how it is that

00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:00.900
we're to behave ourselves. Remember what Paul said to Timothy, that thou mayest

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:05.700
know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God. And here we find

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:10.140
that as we put off that old man in those grave clothes and we put on that new man

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:14.620
in the grace clothes, that it will be evidenced in our behavior. Oh, that God

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:20.620
would help us. That God would help us to be conformed to the image of His Son. That

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:26.300
we'd walk in the Spirit and not in the flesh. Let's pray. Father, we love You. We

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:31.660
thank You for loving us. We thank You for the Word of God. Father, I pray that You

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:37.500
would help us this morning to understand the importance of our behavior in the

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:42.820
church house. That we'd understand that these things are not manufactured in our

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:48.340
flesh. That these things are the result of walking in the Spirit. These things

00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:55.420
are the result of putting off the old man and putting on the new. We thank You

00:46:55.420 --> 00:47:01.380
for the transformation that took place at our salvation. And God, I pray that You'd

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:06.140
help each one of us, each individual that's present this morning, to be

00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:09.660
willing to crucify their flesh, to walk in the Spirit so we would not fulfill

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:16.100
the lust of the flesh. That we would say, as the Apostle Paul said, I am crucified

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:23.580
with Christ. That we'd live this life here on this earth for Your honor and for

00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:33.300
Your glory. That we as a local assembly, Your church in this locale, God, we'd be

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:41.980
pleasing in Your sight. That our behavior be characterized with these

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:50.180
five truths that we find in this passage of Scripture. Would You work in hearts

00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:54.660
and lives this morning? We pray the Holy Spirit of God would do what only He can

00:47:54.660 --> 00:48:01.100
do. He would take the Word of God and minister the heart of Your people. That

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:04.900
decisions would be made that would please Thee. We'll give You the glory for

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:08.420
all that You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me?

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:11.980
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. We'll have a moment of invitation. Kimberly's

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.780
gonna play quietly on the piano and as she does, perhaps the Holy Spirit of God

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:19.220
pricked your heart this morning and you need to come to this altar and ask God

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:25.940
to help you in some way. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
