WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.119
Into the entirety of the psalm, but just want to look at these first three verses this morning

00:00:04.119 --> 00:00:08.239
and I've titled the message this praise him praise him and

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.079
We sing that song what a wonderful hymn it is. How many of you know something about Fanny Crosby?

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.920
What do you know about Fanny Crosby?

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.000
All right, one of the first things people say she was blind, right? She's a great songwriter

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.600
You know that she's the one that wrote the song praise him praise him

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.159
And she's blind

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:34.000
Praise him praise him. Listen. We have much to praise the Lord for amen

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.159
Sometimes we begin to live under the circumstances

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:40.080
We begin to get overwhelmed by the things in life and sometimes it's more

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:44.200
We find ourselves in a position where it's easier maybe to complain

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:48.319
Than it is to praise as we look at this passage of Scripture

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:52.720
In fact as we read the entirety of the book of Psalms, we find it on a regular occasion

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.880
We are confronted with the subject of praise

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.560
It's good for us to be reminded of the importance of praise in our lives as God's people

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.239
In fact as you as I I believe this morning I could say this I believe that I would be

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.879
Accurate in saying this I think it's a safe assumption to say that each of us would agree this morning

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.279
That God is worthy of our praise

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.800
He's worthy of our worship

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.480
You read the book of Revelation in chapter number four and five and begin to see the scene in heaven

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.319
You begin to see how that the Lamb is being worshiped how he's being praised

00:01:25.839 --> 00:01:31.680
our Savior what a blessing and the reality is that as we look at the the

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:38.919
Experiences that we have on life as we deal with the troubles the trials of the victories the times of triumph

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:44.639
The reality is that we ought to be a people that praise him. I know that you're there in Psalm 34

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:45.519
You don't need to turn there

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:52.720
But I want to read to you the final psalm of the book of Psalms in Psalm 150 how accurately it really summarizes

00:01:52.959 --> 00:02:00.239
Much of not the only theme but certainly a very profound thought throughout the book of Psalms that of praise

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.639
The song psalmist said praise ye the Lord praise God in his sanctuary

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.399
Praise him in the firmament of his power

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.800
Praise him for his mighty acts praise him according to his excellent greatness

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:18.160
Praise him with the sound of the trumpet praise him with the saw tree and harp

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.520
Praise him with the timbrel and dance praise him with stringed instruments and organs

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.100
Praise him upon the loud cymbals praise him upon the high sounding cymbals

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.199
Then notice the final verse to this great book. Let everything that hath breath

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:35.759
praise the Lord

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.919
praise

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:38.919
Ye the Lord

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.600
Praise him praise him Psalm 34 a psalm that's ascribed to David

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.880
The Bible says this I will bless the Lord at all times

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:49.960
His praise shall continually be in my mouth

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.199
My soul shall make her boast in the Lord. The humble shall hear thereof and be glad Oh

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:02.220
Magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.759
together the word praise carries with the idea to extol in words or song to magnify

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.440
to glorify on account of

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:13.679
perfections or

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:18.000
Excellent works now. Let me ask you based upon that definition

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.600
We would easily conclude that our God is worthy of our praise. He is perfect in every way. Amen

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:26.679
We have plenty of imperfections

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.720
Yes

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:36.119
We are imperfect people, but we serve a perfect God and I'm so thankful for the the truth of his character

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:41.080
we think about the definition that we would to glorify an account of perfections or

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:49.600
Excellent works in the sense of or in the case of praising our God. We praise him in both references not an or

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:56.880
Situation, but we praise him on the account of his perfections and on his excellent works

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.039
Our God is awesome. In fact, it's interesting

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.839
You don't need to turn there

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:07.679
but I will reference for you in Psalm 111 in verse number three and four the Bible says his work is honorable and glorious and

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:12.759
His righteousness endureth forever. He hath made his wonderful works

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.360
to be remembered

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:18.119
the Lord is gracious and full of

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.839
Compassion as I think about that phrase in verse number four that he hath made his wonderful works to be remembered

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:30.640
I'm mindful of the book that we hold in our hands and the many accounts that God has given us of his wonderful works and

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:36.279
how we can rehearse them and we can recall them and and how it causes us to understand the

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.640
excellent works of our God

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:45.839
It's interesting in Psalm 40 in verse number three the psalmist said and he hath put a new song in my mouth

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:48.679
even praise

00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:54.839
Unto our God many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the Lord

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:59.279
We often speak about the fact that redemption and really if you think about that

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.279
Psalm in Psalm 40 how that the psalmist starts and talks about the fact that he brought me up out of in a horrible pit

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:09.720
In verse number two out of the miry clay set my feet upon a rock established my goings

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.480
Can you remember the work that God did in your life?

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.760
And he says he had put a new song in my mouth. What is that new song? It's praise unto our God

00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:21.359
It's praise unto our God. I

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:23.679
Wonder this morning

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:28.440
There are times I shared this with someone before the service and I told him I'd mentioned it in the in the message in

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:33.200
Kind of in the introduction this morning ever a time in your life where you just kind of

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.279
Find yourself complaining about something

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.079
No

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:45.119
Let's go to another text of Scripture about being truthful. Amen, but the reality is that

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.119
Complaining sometimes just comes real natural for us

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:51.399
sometimes we live so much under the

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:55.079
Circumstances that we just go through life and there are times in which we're not really

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:02.320
Intending to complain we did not set out in our conversation to have a complaint session

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:07.239
Yet we find ourselves at times as we kind of pause in the midst of that

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:11.119
Conversation or and the things that we're saying saying man. I'm just complaining. I

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.980
Wonder this morning. Do we ever catch ourselves praising?

00:06:16.359 --> 00:06:20.119
Where we didn't just like purpose to I want to have a conversation

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:24.320
I'm gonna go talk to Michael and I'm gonna purpose to praise God as I talk to Michael

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.480
See, I've planned that I've purposed that right?

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.200
but what I'm asking is are there times in the midst of our

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:37.399
Conversations we go through life as we are traveling this journey that we just catch ourselves praising God just overwhelmed with how wonderful

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.839
He is

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:41.559
And and we find that the psalmist would say

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.119
Here's some things about praising the Lord and certainly we would be mindful of the importance of understanding

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:51.480
That we are to stand in all of our God

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.679
I believe this morning that we've been commanded. We've been instructed to praise the Lord

00:06:57.399 --> 00:07:04.279
Amen, we've been instructed in everything give. Thanks. This is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you rejoice evermore

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:07.119
The Apostle Paul as he writes the book of Philippians

00:07:07.119 --> 00:07:12.720
He begins in the third chapter about speaking about and he says finally, but he has a whole nother chapter left

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.920
And so, you know when the preacher says finally, he's not really at his last point

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:22.920
The reality however, is that he says finally my brethren rejoice in the Lord you get to chapter number four rejoice in the Lord

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.399
always and again

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:26.559
I say rejoice and we think about this

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:33.839
extolling and praising the Lord that we would magnify him that we would lift him up and we think about this principle of praising the

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:35.000
Lord

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.640
Certainly we find that he is worthy of it that we as his people ought to be

00:07:39.799 --> 00:07:45.519
Engaged in it and I believe this morning that the more time we spend with God

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:51.200
The closer we draw to him the more natural that praise just kind of flows

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.320
Because I'm in his presence and I'm enjoying

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.839
the the the truth of who God is and I'm being reminded of his character and I'm

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.440
Rejoicing and who he is and I'm praising God and I find myself praising him

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.160
Why because I've been near him because I've drawn close to him and I've understood

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:17.279
How perfect and how holy he is I've been reminded of his character

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.279
I've been reminded of his works his excellent works

00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:26.000
And as I look at the truth of the Word of God and I think about the psalmist

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.480
As I mentioned a moment ago about him saying that you stand in all of him

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:34.520
It's interesting that in verse 8 of Psalm 33 the Bible says let all the earth fear the Lord

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.880
Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in all of him

00:08:39.359 --> 00:08:46.119
And then the very next verse says this for he spake and it was done he commanded and it stood still

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.840
obvious reference to creation

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.960
I begin to think about

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:57.159
The Lord and begin to think about praising him and the reality this morning is that we ought to praise God for who he is

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.359
Amen

00:08:59.359 --> 00:09:03.039
As I enter into my prayer time on a daily basis

00:09:03.039 --> 00:09:09.239
I begin by reminding myself and rehearsing before the Lord his character traits

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.760
Not because he needs to be reminded of the fact that he's holy and just and

00:09:14.479 --> 00:09:19.200
Omniscient and omnipotent and omnipresent and all of those things not that he needs to be reminded of it

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.200
But you know what? I need to be reminded of it

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:29.039
And as I begin to rehearse those things and I begin to consider the the the references in the Word of God that teach me

00:09:29.039 --> 00:09:32.599
Who he is and define for us his character

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.719
It caused me to get into that spirit of praising and worshiping. Oh

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.840
We ought to praise God for who he is. We ought to praise God for what he's done

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.520
That song for all he's done

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.400
God's done some great things for us

00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:52.679
And what a blessing to to consider the fact that we praise him not only for who he is

00:09:52.679 --> 00:10:00.039
But also for what he's done. We praise him because he is perfect. We praise him because of his excellent works. It's an it's a

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:05.319
combination of both and we begin to get into that mindset of praising

00:10:05.319 --> 00:10:09.439
the Lord. As we look here at Psalm 34, I want to just share a couple of thoughts

00:10:09.439 --> 00:10:12.079
with you this morning. I want you to notice, number one, that the psalmist

00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:17.239
resolved to praise the Lord. I know that word resolved is a strong word. I think

00:10:17.239 --> 00:10:21.519
it's an important word. In fact, as you go throughout the book of Psalms, as you

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:25.599
read many of the Psalms that are ascribed to David, you will see regularly this

00:10:25.599 --> 00:10:31.479
phrase, I will. And you find that there are several references to this thought, I

00:10:31.479 --> 00:10:35.719
will bless the Lord or I will praise thee. In fact, the phrase I will praise

00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:40.199
thee is referenced in those particular words over 11 times just in the Psalms.

00:10:40.199 --> 00:10:44.399
And you think about the resolve, the purpose, the commitment that the

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:48.959
psalmist is making that he is resolved to praise the Lord. We find that he says

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:53.799
here in verse number one, I will bless the Lord at all times. Notice the next

00:10:53.799 --> 00:11:01.679
phrase, his praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul shall make her boast

00:11:01.679 --> 00:11:06.239
in the Lord. The humble shall hear thereof and be glad. O magnify the Lord

00:11:06.239 --> 00:11:13.119
with me and let us exalt his name together. It's interesting if you were to

00:11:13.119 --> 00:11:18.759
read Psalm 107, oftentimes we'll use a portion of the first opening of that

00:11:18.759 --> 00:11:23.319
particular passage in verse number two where the Bible says, let the redeemed of

00:11:23.319 --> 00:11:27.159
the Lord say so. And maybe we'll use that phraseology when talking about praising

00:11:27.159 --> 00:11:31.319
the Lord and giving testimony. In fact, the psalmist says, O give thanks unto the

00:11:31.319 --> 00:11:37.359
Lord for he is good, for his mercy endureth forever. Begin to think about

00:11:37.359 --> 00:11:42.759
the psalm and the truth that is captured in Psalm 107. On four occasions the

00:11:42.759 --> 00:11:47.839
psalmist says, O that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:53.479
wonderful works to the children of men. And this morning when we think about the

00:11:53.479 --> 00:12:00.319
truth of praise him, praise him, it should not be something that is difficult for

00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:05.599
God's people. It should not be something that you have to kind of work up, if you

00:12:05.599 --> 00:12:09.319
will, that you're gonna praise God. It ought to be a natural thing because of

00:12:09.319 --> 00:12:12.879
the time that we've spent in his presence and because of our understanding

00:12:12.879 --> 00:12:17.839
of who he is and what he's done for us. And we find that the psalmist is

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:22.399
resolved. I like the resolve of the psalmist. I think this morning that we

00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:25.539
should say something similar. I mean, we can adopt the same words that the

00:12:25.539 --> 00:12:31.439
psalmist uses and we can have for our purpose and our resolve that I will

00:12:31.439 --> 00:12:37.159
praise the Lord. We just make that decision. We make that determination. We

00:12:37.159 --> 00:12:41.679
purpose in our hearts that we're gonna praise him. And the reality as we look at

00:12:41.679 --> 00:12:45.559
the nation of Israel, of course, we're mindful of all of the accounts and how

00:12:45.559 --> 00:12:49.799
often they are criticized for complaining. And certainly they're guilty

00:12:49.799 --> 00:12:54.679
of it. In fact, I've often shared with you that I like the word that is used often

00:12:54.679 --> 00:12:58.239
in the Old Testament to describe the complaining of God's people and it's

00:12:58.239 --> 00:13:05.079
murmur. That they were murmuring. In fact, the Bible tells us how that they were

00:13:05.079 --> 00:13:10.079
murmuring even within their tents. Now think about that. You think about that

00:13:10.079 --> 00:13:13.399
truth and the the expression of that phraseology and you think about their

00:13:13.399 --> 00:13:19.759
tents being the the place in which they would dwell. In fact, that's found in

00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:24.759
Psalm 106 and verse 25, but murmured in their tents and hearken not unto the

00:13:24.759 --> 00:13:30.679
voice of the Lord. See, the psalmist said, I'm gonna purpose. I'm gonna resolve to

00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:34.639
praise the Lord. There's some things that I understand and obviously as we think

00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:38.039
about the sweet psalmist of Israel, as we think about David and we think about his

00:13:38.079 --> 00:13:41.679
walk with God, we think about his experiences and we understand some

00:13:41.679 --> 00:13:44.799
things that have been recorded for us in the Word of God with regard to the life

00:13:44.799 --> 00:13:49.939
of David and we see the closeness that he has. And you find that David says, the

00:13:49.939 --> 00:13:55.199
Lord is my shepherd in Psalm 23. And we begin to fill your mind with those

00:13:55.199 --> 00:13:59.879
truths of the Word of God and begin to spend that time. Remember, the Psalms tell

00:13:59.879 --> 00:14:07.399
us that in his presence is fullness of joy. The reality is that there's a sense

00:14:07.399 --> 00:14:11.479
of resolve that I see here on the part of the psalmist, a sense of resolve that

00:14:11.479 --> 00:14:15.039
I need, a sense of resolve that I believe that each of us could use in our lives.

00:14:15.039 --> 00:14:18.799
In Psalm 9, I'm gonna share a number of references with you. You can turn there

00:14:18.799 --> 00:14:23.119
if you want. I'll read them to you. You don't have to take the time to try to

00:14:23.119 --> 00:14:26.999
fumble back and forth. They're all here in the book of Psalms, so we're not gonna

00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:32.719
go to all sorts of other places, at least not yet. In Psalm 9, in verse number 1,

00:14:32.759 --> 00:14:37.839
again, a psalm that is ascribed to David, the Bible says this, I will praise thee,

00:14:37.839 --> 00:14:47.319
O Lord, and then I like this phrase, with my whole heart I will show forth all thy

00:14:47.319 --> 00:14:54.599
marvelous works. Think about the wholehearted aspect that the psalmist

00:14:54.599 --> 00:14:59.999
shares with us here. It's not just a, I have to say this because duty demands it,

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:03.359
so to speak. I have to say this because somebody's looking for a testimony. We

00:15:03.359 --> 00:15:07.399
have praise and thanksgiving type of service. In fact, during our Thanksgiving

00:15:07.399 --> 00:15:13.639
season, we have a prayer, praise, and pie service. We ask people to share testimonies.

00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:17.119
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so. Praise the Lord. It ought not to be a

00:15:17.119 --> 00:15:21.039
difficult thing. In fact, it ought to be when we take testimonies that we run out

00:15:21.039 --> 00:15:27.879
of time, amen, because there's so much to praise them for, truly. We sing the song,

00:15:27.879 --> 00:15:33.879
count your blessings, name them one by one. Dean, often as he sings that song or

00:15:33.879 --> 00:15:38.159
leads that song, he gets sidetracked and he doesn't continue leading in the time

00:15:38.159 --> 00:15:43.079
because he's going like this, right? Count your blessings. You've seen him, I've

00:15:43.079 --> 00:15:47.199
seen him do it, I know you've seen him do it. The reality is that the songwriter,

00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:51.599
through that song, is trying to remind us of the truth of Psalm 68, that he, God,

00:15:51.599 --> 00:15:58.399
hath daily loatheth us with benefits. There's so much to praise him for, and we

00:15:58.399 --> 00:16:02.759
need to resolve to praise the Lord. Psalm 69, notice what is said here by the

00:16:02.759 --> 00:16:07.239
psalmist in Psalm 69, in verse number 30.

00:16:14.359 --> 00:16:18.919
In Psalm 69, in verse number 30, the psalmist says, I will praise the name of

00:16:18.919 --> 00:16:27.439
God with a psalm and will magnify him with thanksgiving. Does our song praise

00:16:27.439 --> 00:16:35.279
God? I hope it does. I hope the songs that we sing are offering, rendering praise

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:40.679
unto our God, reminding us of who he is, reminding us of what he's done. It's a

00:16:40.679 --> 00:16:47.679
psalm of praise. In Psalm 86, turn over several pages here and look at Psalm 86

00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:52.919
and, again, a psalm that's ascribed to David, and we find that here in this

00:16:52.919 --> 00:16:57.199
particular psalm, he's rejoicing. Really, it's a prayer of David. He's rejoicing

00:16:57.199 --> 00:17:01.999
for how the Lord would answer his prayer and teaching him his way. He says this in

00:17:01.999 --> 00:17:08.319
verse number 12, I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:21.559
glorify thy name forevermore. In Psalm 118, again, this psalm begins with that

00:17:21.559 --> 00:17:25.799
same phraseology that we mentioned from Psalm 107, O give thanks unto the Lord

00:17:25.799 --> 00:17:31.679
for he is good, because his mercy endureth forever. But here in Psalm 118,

00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:37.119
in verse number 21, the Bible says this, I will praise thee, notice this, for thou

00:17:37.119 --> 00:17:43.199
hast heard me and art become my salvation. I want you to just pause there just for a

00:17:43.199 --> 00:17:46.239
moment. We often speak about the importance of prayer, the privilege of

00:17:46.239 --> 00:17:51.119
prayer, the fact that we can enter boldly into the throne room of God and we

00:17:51.119 --> 00:17:55.999
can bring our petitions before the Lord knowing that he hears and answers prayer.

00:17:55.999 --> 00:18:02.639
The psalmist says here, I will praise thee. Why? For thou hast heard me. The

00:18:02.639 --> 00:18:06.639
reality is that we find that Paul would say this to the believers in Philippi as

00:18:06.639 --> 00:18:11.559
he would give them the instruction of praying and giving thanks, and he would

00:18:11.559 --> 00:18:16.159
say this to these believers, and it's a great model for us to follow in

00:18:16.159 --> 00:18:20.159
Philippians 4, in verse number 6, be careful for nothing but in everything by

00:18:20.159 --> 00:18:25.679
prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving let your requests be made

00:18:25.679 --> 00:18:33.639
known unto God. See, we ought to praise God that he hears us. Yes, that he answers

00:18:33.719 --> 00:18:37.000
us, but sometimes the answer doesn't come immediately. Have you ever prayed for

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.159
something that you didn't get a response immediately? But you know what? We can

00:18:41.159 --> 00:18:45.279
praise God that he heard us. Based upon the authority of the Word of God, our God

00:18:45.279 --> 00:18:51.159
hears and answers prayer. And sometimes we're good at praising God for the

00:18:51.159 --> 00:18:56.719
answer, and sometimes when we're waiting for the answer, there's not a whole lot

00:18:56.719 --> 00:19:00.959
of praise going on. We're waiting for God to answer, waiting for God to answer,

00:19:00.959 --> 00:19:04.440
waiting for God to answer. But here the psalmist says, I'm praising God because

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:10.799
he heard my prayer. And I wonder this morning, if we just can take for a moment

00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:16.839
in our minds and in our lives today, just take a pause and just recognize what a

00:19:16.839 --> 00:19:22.519
blessing it is to know that our God hears us. You remember the situation with

00:19:22.519 --> 00:19:29.880
Elijah at Mount Carmel? He challenged all of those Baal worshippers, and he

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:34.320
challenged them. And we find the Bible tells us if you were to read the passage

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.880
of Scripture there in 1 Kings, in chapter number 18, you begin to understand all

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.880
that's happening in the challenge, and you find that Elijah says to them that

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:47.079
he'd let them go first. And here's what he says, and ye call, verse number 24,

00:19:47.079 --> 00:19:52.119
call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord. The

00:19:52.119 --> 00:19:57.519
God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and

00:19:57.519 --> 00:20:01.959
said, it is well spoken.

00:20:01.959 --> 00:20:06.779
that after they're crying out and they're doing all of these things and they're praying

00:20:06.779 --> 00:20:13.779
because it's a false God, they have ears but they hear not. Amen? And we find here that

00:20:13.779 --> 00:20:19.239
Elijah would pray and God answers him, but it's amazing as you look at the prayer that

00:20:19.239 --> 00:20:24.479
he prays, it's recorded for us in verse 36, and verse 37 you see the response, and I can

00:20:24.479 --> 00:20:31.479
rejoice this morning that our God hears us. He's not far off, it's not as if he's not

00:20:32.199 --> 00:20:37.359
listening to us, he hears us when we pray and we can have that assurance. What a praise

00:20:37.359 --> 00:20:44.359
him for that. Psalm 139, well let me say there in Psalm 118, look at the last couple of verses

00:20:45.639 --> 00:20:51.639
in that passage, what a great truth is given to us in verse 28 and 29, notice how he begins,

00:20:51.639 --> 00:20:58.639
Thou art my God. It's personal. He is my God. Remember we talked about the 23rd Psalm,

00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:10.679
the Lord is my shepherd. The reality this morning is that the Lord is the shepherd,

00:21:11.999 --> 00:21:18.439
he is the good shepherd, he is the chief shepherd, he is the great shepherd, those names are

00:21:18.439 --> 00:21:25.199
ascribed to him. But what a difference it makes when we say the Lord is my shepherd,

00:21:25.199 --> 00:21:29.559
that personal relationship that we have with the Lord Jesus Christ and what a blessing

00:21:29.559 --> 00:21:36.559
we find. The psalmist says, Thou art my God, notice, and I will praise thee. Thou art my

00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:45.039
God, I will exalt thee. Oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good, for his mercy endureth

00:21:45.159 --> 00:21:52.159
forever. I wonder how often we just stop and praise God that he is mine and I am his. Now

00:21:55.079 --> 00:22:02.079
I belong to Jesus, aren't you thankful for that? He is my God. We look at the psalmist

00:22:03.399 --> 00:22:08.119
and the psalmist speaks about the fact that he is my God, my shield, my rock, my fortress,

00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:12.919
my refuge and my hiding place and how we can rejoice in all of those things, why? Because

00:22:12.919 --> 00:22:19.159
it's personal, he's my God, he is the Lord God Almighty, he is the creator of everything,

00:22:19.159 --> 00:22:26.159
the sustainer of everything, but he's my God, personally. He's not far off that he cannot

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:31.919
be, no, no, no, he's my God. Remember as we've been studying through the book of Hebrews,

00:22:31.919 --> 00:22:35.479
we have an high priest which cannot be, which, let me read the verse, I'm going to butcher

00:22:35.479 --> 00:22:39.799
it, let me go there, Hebrews chapter number 4, in verse number 15, For we have not a high

00:22:39.839 --> 00:22:43.839
priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points

00:22:43.839 --> 00:22:50.839
tempted like as we are yet without sin. We have a great high priest, he's our God. We

00:22:51.839 --> 00:22:56.359
find that the psalmist is rejoicing, he says I will praise thee in Psalm 139 and verse

00:22:56.359 --> 00:23:02.039
number 14, why? For I am wonderfully made. Notice as the psalmist would reference that

00:23:02.039 --> 00:23:08.759
truth and we would understand that we have been created by our God, that he is the creator

00:23:08.759 --> 00:23:14.279
of all and therefore we find that the psalmist says this in Psalm 139 and verse 14, I will

00:23:14.279 --> 00:23:19.679
praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made, marvelous are thy works and that my

00:23:19.679 --> 00:23:26.679
soul knoweth right well. I will praise thee. So we find that the psalmist as we were to

00:23:27.959 --> 00:23:33.759
look at Psalm 34 and were to see the way in which the psalmist begins this passage of

00:23:33.799 --> 00:23:39.119
scripture with this resolve that I will bless the Lord at all times and his praise shall

00:23:39.119 --> 00:23:43.759
continually be in my mouth and we think about the subject matter of praise him, praise him

00:23:43.759 --> 00:23:48.199
and we find the psalmist as we've referenced a number of verses of scripture this morning,

00:23:48.199 --> 00:23:53.359
he has resolved to praise the Lord. Oh that we too would resolve to praise the Lord, that

00:23:53.359 --> 00:23:58.079
we would purpose, that we would determine in our lives that we're going to praise him,

00:23:58.079 --> 00:24:03.119
why? Because he's worthy of it. But we find that it doesn't end with resolve. Can I tell

00:24:03.119 --> 00:24:07.439
you that it's, there are several things that we have purposed to do in our lives no doubt

00:24:07.439 --> 00:24:14.319
that we never followed through with. So I'm going to do this and then we didn't really

00:24:14.319 --> 00:24:19.639
kind of follow through. And here we find not only did the psalmist resolve to praise the

00:24:19.639 --> 00:24:26.159
Lord but we find the psalmist regularly praised the Lord. I like the phraseology that we find

00:24:26.159 --> 00:24:35.879
in Psalm 34 when he says this, notice these words, at all times. At all times. Now we

00:24:35.879 --> 00:24:42.959
find that the New Testament puts it this way in everything, right? And by the way there

00:24:42.959 --> 00:24:46.719
in 1 Thessalonians 5 when he says in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in

00:24:46.719 --> 00:24:52.239
Christ Jesus concerning you. It's God's will that we give thanks, that we praise him, that

00:24:52.239 --> 00:24:58.319
we exalt him, that we lift him up. And we find that the psalmist says that at all times,

00:24:58.319 --> 00:25:05.559
notice he says this, his praise shall continually be in my mouth. Those are two phrases that

00:25:05.559 --> 00:25:11.219
we find here at all times and continually that should help us to understand the importance

00:25:11.219 --> 00:25:16.839
of regularly praising the Lord. When we speak about regularly praising the Lord the reality

00:25:16.839 --> 00:25:25.399
is that it ought to be done in private. Privately. Praising the Lord. But it doesn't stop in

00:25:25.399 --> 00:25:33.439
private. We ought to praise him publicly. Amen? In fact the psalmist often references

00:25:33.439 --> 00:25:40.959
the intent that he has to praise the Lord in public. In Psalm 108 in verse number 3

00:25:40.959 --> 00:25:46.239
the psalmist says this, I will praise thee O Lord among the people and I will sing praises

00:25:46.239 --> 00:25:55.879
unto thee among the nations. See when we praise God privately it's probably going

00:25:55.879 --> 00:26:02.399
to overflow into our public praise of God. What do I mean by that? I'm so full of praising

00:26:02.399 --> 00:26:07.919
God in my private walk with him, and I'm not saying this of me, I'm saying that as we do

00:26:07.919 --> 00:26:13.679
this, as we resolve to praise the Lord, as we are regularly praising him in our time

00:26:13.679 --> 00:26:18.759
with him on a daily basis and we're standing in awe of who he is and we're mindful of his

00:26:18.759 --> 00:26:23.319
character, we're mindful of his excellent works and we're praising him, that's going

00:26:23.319 --> 00:26:31.319
to flow out publicly. I made a statement to somebody just on Friday, I know the person

00:26:31.319 --> 00:26:40.679
I was speaking to was lost. I know that. And as a question was asked of me I responded

00:26:40.679 --> 00:26:45.239
by saying this, well Lord willing this is going to, and I thought he has no idea what

00:26:45.239 --> 00:26:52.639
Lord willing even means. But I caught myself saying it. And it was kind of interesting.

00:26:52.639 --> 00:26:56.919
I've shared the gospel with the individual, I've tried to witness to him and to share

00:26:56.919 --> 00:27:02.319
the truth with him that he might be saved, and I just found myself just using that phraseology.

00:27:02.319 --> 00:27:07.719
That's a phraseology that maybe we use amongst brethren, but not so often that we use amongst

00:27:07.719 --> 00:27:13.719
heathen or lost people, why? They don't understand the phrase. What I'm saying this morning is

00:27:13.719 --> 00:27:20.079
that as we praise God privately, it will be known in our public lives. Because it just

00:27:20.079 --> 00:27:29.919
becomes an overflow. See, as believers, we don't have a situation where we have separated

00:27:29.919 --> 00:27:41.199
our lives into the sacred part of me and the social aspect or the societal aspect of

00:27:41.199 --> 00:27:49.239
my life. No, the reality is that we're Christians. And as we praise Him privately and we get

00:27:49.239 --> 00:27:55.319
full of who God is, we find that it will begin to be seen even in our public life. And by

00:27:55.319 --> 00:28:00.239
the way, that's a good thing. How are they going to know how good our God is if we don't

00:28:00.239 --> 00:28:06.719
tell them? Right? And what I mean is when it becomes a continual thing, a consistent

00:28:06.719 --> 00:28:12.599
thing in our life, when we're praising the Lord and we are able to show that people see,

00:28:12.599 --> 00:28:17.239
man, they praise the Lord. This is real. This isn't some made up thing. This isn't something

00:28:17.239 --> 00:28:21.439
that I know somebody's watching me, that I know somebody's listening, that something adverse

00:28:21.439 --> 00:28:25.199
has happened and we're going to see how they respond and we're going to make sure that

00:28:25.199 --> 00:28:32.799
we're... No. It just becomes natural. Why? Because I'm praising Him regularly. I think

00:28:32.799 --> 00:28:41.479
about the truth of praising God in times of positive circumstances. I would say this of

00:28:41.479 --> 00:28:47.479
that, it's actually kind of easy. Amen? It's kind of easy to praise God when things are

00:28:47.479 --> 00:28:53.359
going well. I mean, when things are going well and everything's good, it's kind of easy

00:28:53.359 --> 00:28:58.079
to praise God. I want to think about the situation. Turn back, if you will, to 1 Chronicles chapter

00:28:58.079 --> 00:29:03.239
16. I want to take you back to an event in the life of David. And I want you to think

00:29:03.239 --> 00:29:06.719
about what's happening here and I want you to think about the magnitude of what's going

00:29:06.719 --> 00:29:12.559
on and the praising that's taking place and what a great time in Israel's history this

00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:18.639
is as David would lead the nation into bringing the ark back to Jerusalem. We understand that

00:29:18.639 --> 00:29:23.959
in chapter number 15, things did not go as they had planned for it to go. And we find,

00:29:23.959 --> 00:29:29.599
excuse me, in chapter number 13. In chapter number 15, the record is given of the transport

00:29:29.599 --> 00:29:35.839
and how God worked and how God was praised throughout that time. And we come to chapter

00:29:35.839 --> 00:29:42.279
16, and the Bible begins with this phrase, so they brought the ark of God and set it

00:29:42.279 --> 00:29:47.719
in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it. Now, this is a positive time in Israel's

00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:51.599
history. I mean, this is an exciting time. If you were to contrast what took place in

00:29:51.599 --> 00:29:57.319
chapter 13 and what now is happening in chapter 15 and 16, you would see that this is a great

00:29:57.319 --> 00:30:01.999
spiritual time of rejoicing in the nation of Israel's history.

00:30:01.999 --> 00:30:03.599
and David is leading,

00:30:03.599 --> 00:30:06.879
and the Bible tells us that the ark is now there.

00:30:06.879 --> 00:30:08.519
And it tells us in v. 4,

00:30:08.519 --> 00:30:11.039
"...And he, David, appointed certain of the Levites

00:30:11.039 --> 00:30:13.119
to minister before the ark of the Lord,

00:30:13.119 --> 00:30:16.199
and to record, and to thank and praise

00:30:16.199 --> 00:30:20.919
the Lord God of Israel."

00:30:20.919 --> 00:30:22.799
V. 7,

00:30:22.799 --> 00:30:26.199
"...Then on that day David delivered..."

00:30:26.199 --> 00:30:29.439
Notice this word, first.

00:30:29.639 --> 00:30:32.519
There's a priority on praising.

00:30:32.519 --> 00:30:36.279
"...Then on that day David delivered first this psalm

00:30:36.279 --> 00:30:39.679
to thank the Lord into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.

00:30:39.679 --> 00:30:41.599
Give thanks unto the Lord.

00:30:41.599 --> 00:30:42.959
Call upon His name.

00:30:42.959 --> 00:30:45.639
Make known His deeds among the people.

00:30:45.639 --> 00:30:47.839
Sing unto Him. Sing psalms unto Him.

00:30:47.839 --> 00:30:49.999
Talk ye of all His wondrous works.

00:30:49.999 --> 00:30:51.599
Glory in His holy name.

00:30:51.599 --> 00:30:53.239
Let the heart of them rejoice.

00:30:53.239 --> 00:30:54.519
Seek the Lord.

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:56.679
Seek the Lord and His strength.

00:30:56.719 --> 00:31:00.759
Seek His face continually."

00:31:00.759 --> 00:31:01.639
V. 25,

00:31:01.639 --> 00:31:05.719
"...For great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

00:31:05.719 --> 00:31:07.999
He also is to be feared above all gods.

00:31:07.999 --> 00:31:09.959
For all the gods of the people are idols,

00:31:09.959 --> 00:31:11.439
but the Lord made the heavens."

00:31:11.439 --> 00:31:12.319
V. 29,

00:31:12.319 --> 00:31:14.839
"...Give unto the Lord the glory due unto His name.

00:31:14.839 --> 00:31:16.639
Bring an offering and come before Him.

00:31:16.639 --> 00:31:19.159
Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness,

00:31:19.159 --> 00:31:21.119
for before Him, all the earth,

00:31:21.119 --> 00:31:23.479
the world also shall be stable,

00:31:23.479 --> 00:31:25.239
that it be not moved.

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:27.199
Let the heavens be glad,

00:31:27.199 --> 00:31:28.559
and let the earth rejoice,

00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:30.359
and let men say among the nations,

00:31:30.359 --> 00:31:33.999
The Lord reigneth.

00:31:33.999 --> 00:31:35.639
Let the sea roar,

00:31:35.639 --> 00:31:37.159
and the fullness thereof.

00:31:37.159 --> 00:31:38.479
Let the fields rejoice,

00:31:38.479 --> 00:31:39.999
and all that is therein.

00:31:39.999 --> 00:31:41.839
Then shall the trees of the woods sing out

00:31:41.839 --> 00:31:42.959
at the presence of the Lord,

00:31:42.959 --> 00:31:44.679
because He cometh to judge the earth."

00:31:44.679 --> 00:31:45.399
V. 34,

00:31:45.399 --> 00:31:47.839
"...Oh, give thanks unto the Lord for He is good.

00:31:47.839 --> 00:31:49.319
For His mercy endureth forever.

00:31:49.319 --> 00:31:50.519
And say ye,

00:31:50.519 --> 00:31:53.079
Save us, O God, of our salvation,

00:31:53.079 --> 00:31:54.199
and gather us together,

00:31:54.199 --> 00:31:55.599
and deliver us from the heathen,

00:31:55.599 --> 00:31:58.159
that we may give thanks to Thy holy name,

00:31:58.159 --> 00:31:59.959
and glory in Thy praise."

00:31:59.959 --> 00:32:00.959
V. 36,

00:32:00.959 --> 00:32:03.639
"...Blessed be the Lord God of Israel forever and ever."

00:32:03.639 --> 00:32:04.719
And all the people said,

00:32:04.719 --> 00:32:05.959
Amen,

00:32:05.959 --> 00:32:08.479
and praised the Lord.

00:32:10.119 --> 00:32:12.679
You can read many accounts such as this

00:32:12.679 --> 00:32:14.359
throughout Israel's history,

00:32:14.359 --> 00:32:16.159
where they had some amazing things happen

00:32:16.159 --> 00:32:18.399
and they responded by praising God.

00:32:19.279 --> 00:32:20.999
They saw the hand of the Lord at work.

00:32:20.999 --> 00:32:22.039
They were delivered

00:32:22.039 --> 00:32:25.919
and they were experiencing the miracles of God

00:32:25.919 --> 00:32:28.119
and they respond by praising.

00:32:28.119 --> 00:32:29.319
And what a blessing that is.

00:32:29.319 --> 00:32:30.999
That's how we ought to respond.

00:32:32.319 --> 00:32:34.479
The more challenging thing for us

00:32:34.479 --> 00:32:38.039
is to praise the Lord during times of adversity.

00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:40.599
During times of adverse circumstances.

00:32:40.599 --> 00:32:43.959
But if we're mindful of what the psalmist said in Psalm 34,

00:32:43.959 --> 00:32:46.119
when he said that he was going to praise the Lord,

00:32:46.119 --> 00:32:49.319
bless the Lord, it says at all times.

00:32:49.319 --> 00:32:51.279
At all times.

00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:53.799
Now, the reality is that we find ourselves

00:32:53.799 --> 00:32:55.439
in a situation in life

00:32:55.439 --> 00:32:57.319
that there are times in which we have

00:32:57.319 --> 00:33:00.679
those positive circumstances.

00:33:00.679 --> 00:33:04.039
It seems as if the adversity comes

00:33:04.039 --> 00:33:08.919
maybe more so than the times of not having adversity.

00:33:09.919 --> 00:33:12.279
It's in those times of adversity

00:33:12.279 --> 00:33:15.959
that we can find ourselves in a place of challenge

00:33:15.959 --> 00:33:17.159
to praise the Lord.

00:33:18.119 --> 00:33:21.879
It's in those times that we find it maybe easy

00:33:21.879 --> 00:33:24.039
to complain, to murmur,

00:33:25.279 --> 00:33:27.639
to have the, woe is me,

00:33:27.639 --> 00:33:30.359
to have the pity party kind of a situation.

00:33:32.399 --> 00:33:34.679
But the reality is that the psalmist,

00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:37.079
when he made the resolve to praise the Lord,

00:33:37.079 --> 00:33:41.719
he didn't say, I will bless the Lord when he's good to me.

00:33:42.999 --> 00:33:46.199
Because the reality is that if it were written that way,

00:33:46.199 --> 00:33:47.919
we would misunderstand that

00:33:47.919 --> 00:33:50.999
because the reality is that God is always good to us.

00:33:51.999 --> 00:33:54.839
But unfortunately, we sometimes interpret

00:33:54.839 --> 00:33:56.559
whether he's good to us or not

00:33:56.559 --> 00:33:59.919
based upon our circumstances.

00:33:59.919 --> 00:34:02.359
The Bible declares the Lord is good.

00:34:03.559 --> 00:34:04.799
We'll say something like this,

00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:07.119
all the time, God is good.

00:34:07.119 --> 00:34:07.959
Amen?

00:34:07.959 --> 00:34:10.199
God is good all the time, he really is.

00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:12.519
It's not just a cliche that we use

00:34:12.519 --> 00:34:14.959
because we understand that God has a purpose.

00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:16.999
We understand that he's sovereign

00:34:16.999 --> 00:34:20.719
and in his plan, he's working out his will.

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:23.159
And there are times in which he's working out his will

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:24.759
and it might require that we go through

00:34:24.759 --> 00:34:27.439
some level of adversity or difficulty.

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:32.919
Think about the Apostle Paul in 2 Corinthians 12.

00:34:34.359 --> 00:34:35.679
He's dealing with infirmity,

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:37.439
he's dealing with a difficulty,

00:34:37.439 --> 00:34:39.879
and he besought the Lord thrice, the Bible tells us.

00:34:39.879 --> 00:34:41.759
And the Lord's answer was what?

00:34:41.759 --> 00:34:43.679
My grace is sufficient for thee.

00:34:44.479 --> 00:34:45.999
And it's interesting as you would look

00:34:45.999 --> 00:34:47.839
at the response of the Apostle Paul

00:34:47.839 --> 00:34:50.359
in that portion of Scripture in 2 Corinthians 12,

00:34:50.359 --> 00:34:51.679
when he receives that answer,

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:53.119
that my grace is sufficient for thee.

00:34:53.119 --> 00:34:55.199
In verse number nine, he ends by saying,

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:57.559
most gladly therefore will I rather glory

00:34:57.559 --> 00:34:59.479
in my infirmities that the power of Christ

00:34:59.479 --> 00:35:00.759
may rest upon me.

00:35:00.759 --> 00:35:03.599
Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities,

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:05.239
in reproaches, in necessities,

00:35:05.239 --> 00:35:06.959
in persecutions, in distresses.

00:35:06.959 --> 00:35:09.639
Notice, for Christ's sake, for when I am weak,

00:35:09.639 --> 00:35:10.959
then am I strong.

00:35:13.879 --> 00:35:15.319
There's a truth that is given to us

00:35:15.319 --> 00:35:17.879
in the book of Philippians in chapter number three.

00:35:19.919 --> 00:35:23.319
As the Apostle Paul is writing to this church in Philippi,

00:35:23.319 --> 00:35:26.199
we're going to eventually get to a passage in Acts

00:35:26.199 --> 00:35:28.719
where Paul was in Philippi.

00:35:28.719 --> 00:35:31.439
But I want you to think about Paul writing this letter

00:35:31.439 --> 00:35:33.999
back to the believers there at Philippi,

00:35:33.999 --> 00:35:36.719
and I want you to understand that as he's writing

00:35:36.719 --> 00:35:40.439
this book of rejoicing, he's writing from a place of prison,

00:35:40.439 --> 00:35:43.359
and we understand that as Paul is writing this book,

00:35:44.039 --> 00:35:45.999
that even while he was there personally ministering,

00:35:45.999 --> 00:35:49.119
he dealt with some serious adversity.

00:35:50.039 --> 00:35:52.199
There's some serious conflict in Philippi.

00:35:53.399 --> 00:35:55.519
We find that Paul is writing back to them

00:35:55.519 --> 00:35:57.159
about the importance of rejoicing

00:35:57.159 --> 00:36:00.239
and the idea of joy or rejoicing as a theme

00:36:00.239 --> 00:36:03.799
that's found throughout the book of Philippians.

00:36:03.799 --> 00:36:05.559
But it's interesting in the third chapter

00:36:05.559 --> 00:36:08.959
as we come to verse number 10,

00:36:08.959 --> 00:36:13.959
I've been guilty of only quoting a portion of this verse

00:36:15.799 --> 00:36:17.399
in Philippians 3 and verse number 10

00:36:17.399 --> 00:36:20.399
when Paul says that I may know Him

00:36:20.399 --> 00:36:23.239
and the power of His resurrection.

00:36:24.119 --> 00:36:25.679
So you think about the power of His resurrection.

00:36:25.679 --> 00:36:26.719
I mean, it's wonderful, isn't it?

00:36:26.719 --> 00:36:28.359
I mean, we understand the resurrection

00:36:28.359 --> 00:36:29.639
is the cornerstone of our faith.

00:36:29.639 --> 00:36:32.319
We understand that if Christ be not risen,

00:36:32.319 --> 00:36:34.839
then your faith, your preaching, it's in vain.

00:36:36.239 --> 00:36:38.119
But now is Christ risen, right?

00:36:38.119 --> 00:36:40.159
That's what he says in 1 Corinthians 15.

00:36:40.159 --> 00:36:41.799
And we find here in Philippians 3,

00:36:41.799 --> 00:36:44.119
we rejoice in the fact of the power of His resurrection,

00:36:44.119 --> 00:36:46.159
but notice that the Bible says this,

00:36:46.159 --> 00:36:51.079
and the fellowship of His sufferings

00:36:52.439 --> 00:36:55.719
being made conformable unto His death.

00:36:56.919 --> 00:36:59.959
The fellowship of His sufferings.

00:37:01.399 --> 00:37:06.399
I'd rather focus upon the power of His resurrection

00:37:06.559 --> 00:37:09.879
than the fellowship of His sufferings.

00:37:09.879 --> 00:37:13.479
But think about the way in which our Savior suffered for us.

00:37:13.479 --> 00:37:16.359
You think about all that took place,

00:37:16.359 --> 00:37:19.559
how that God made Him to be sin for us who knew no sin,

00:37:19.559 --> 00:37:22.079
that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him,

00:37:22.079 --> 00:37:24.279
that we think about the things that He suffered

00:37:24.279 --> 00:37:25.919
and the things that He did.

00:37:25.919 --> 00:37:28.719
And we look here, the apostle is saying

00:37:28.719 --> 00:37:30.399
that I want to know Him

00:37:30.399 --> 00:37:32.039
and I want to know Him in the power of His resurrection,

00:37:32.039 --> 00:37:34.759
but also the fellowship of His sufferings

00:37:34.839 --> 00:37:38.479
being made conformable unto His death.

00:37:39.839 --> 00:37:41.839
I want you to think about Paul and Silas

00:37:41.839 --> 00:37:45.599
as they were there in Philippi in Acts 16.

00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:47.199
Turn back there if you will.

00:37:49.359 --> 00:37:51.879
I want you to, as we kind of conclude this morning

00:37:51.879 --> 00:37:54.399
with this thought of praising the Lord

00:37:54.399 --> 00:37:56.679
and how that we ought to resolve to praise Him,

00:37:56.679 --> 00:38:01.679
but we ought to be engaged in regularly praising the Lord.

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:06.679
It begins in the private life

00:38:07.239 --> 00:38:09.199
of every one of God's children.

00:38:10.159 --> 00:38:12.799
As I praise Him privately,

00:38:12.799 --> 00:38:15.839
it will overflow into my public life.

00:38:18.439 --> 00:38:20.639
As I praise Him privately and publicly,

00:38:20.639 --> 00:38:22.719
as I've resolved to do so,

00:38:22.719 --> 00:38:24.639
and I'm regularly practicing,

00:38:24.639 --> 00:38:27.599
if I can use that phraseology, praising my God,

00:38:27.599 --> 00:38:31.639
and I praise Him in all situations, at all times,

00:38:31.639 --> 00:38:32.839
continually.

00:38:33.839 --> 00:38:36.879
In Acts 16, we're familiar with what's taking place here

00:38:36.879 --> 00:38:40.119
as Paul and Silas are there in Philippi

00:38:40.119 --> 00:38:43.079
and we understand that they received that direction

00:38:43.079 --> 00:38:43.919
in verse number 10,

00:38:43.919 --> 00:38:45.159
after he'd seen the vision,

00:38:45.159 --> 00:38:47.999
immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia,

00:38:47.999 --> 00:38:50.079
assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us

00:38:50.079 --> 00:38:52.199
for to preach the Gospel unto them.

00:38:52.199 --> 00:38:54.159
We find that they come to Philippi.

00:38:54.159 --> 00:38:56.599
It was the chief city of that part of Macedonia,

00:38:56.599 --> 00:38:59.859
according to verse number 12 of our passage here in Acts 16.

00:38:59.859 --> 00:39:01.659
We find that it was there that they found Lydia,

00:39:01.659 --> 00:39:03.419
a certain woman in verse number 14,

00:39:03.419 --> 00:39:05.859
and she was baptized in her household.

00:39:05.859 --> 00:39:09.139
And we find that Paul is giving truth

00:39:09.139 --> 00:39:11.659
and it came to pass in verse 16,

00:39:13.099 --> 00:39:14.139
as we went to prayer,

00:39:14.139 --> 00:39:18.099
certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us,

00:39:18.099 --> 00:39:22.219
which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.

00:39:22.219 --> 00:39:24.859
The same followed Paul and us and cried saying,

00:39:24.859 --> 00:39:27.219
these men are the servants of the Most High God

00:39:27.219 --> 00:39:30.899
which show unto us the way of salvation.

00:39:30.899 --> 00:39:33.219
And this did she many days.

00:39:33.219 --> 00:39:34.299
But Paul being grieved,

00:39:34.299 --> 00:39:35.339
turned and said to the spirit,

00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:37.059
I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ

00:39:37.059 --> 00:39:38.219
to come out of her.

00:39:38.219 --> 00:39:41.139
And he came out the same hour.

00:39:41.139 --> 00:39:43.019
Can I tell you that the message of verse 17

00:39:43.019 --> 00:39:44.699
was a true message.

00:39:44.699 --> 00:39:47.099
They were the men, these men,

00:39:47.099 --> 00:39:48.979
they were the servants of the Most High God.

00:39:48.979 --> 00:39:51.499
They were showing the way of salvation.

00:39:51.499 --> 00:39:54.539
But that message was coming from a wrong vessel.

00:39:54.539 --> 00:39:56.339
There's a whole message that we could develop

00:39:56.339 --> 00:39:58.299
on that single thought this morning.

00:39:59.699 --> 00:40:01.859
We find that in verse number 19,

00:40:01.859 --> 00:40:07.539
as this transpired, that the masters of this one that was crying out, this one that had

00:40:07.539 --> 00:40:12.539
the spirit of divination, this one that brought much gain by her suits, saying that when they

00:40:12.539 --> 00:40:17.499
saw that the hope of their gains was gone, that they caught Paul and Silas and drew them

00:40:17.499 --> 00:40:22.099
in the marketplace and the rulers and they brought them to the magistrates saying, these

00:40:22.099 --> 00:40:25.579
men being Jews do exceedingly trouble our city.

00:40:25.579 --> 00:40:26.579
What happened?

00:40:26.579 --> 00:40:30.639
Verse 23, and when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging

00:40:30.639 --> 00:40:35.079
the jailer to keep them safely, who having received such a charge, thrust them into the

00:40:35.079 --> 00:40:38.559
inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks.

00:40:38.559 --> 00:40:49.479
And at midnight, we know the account, and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang

00:40:49.479 --> 00:40:53.599
praises unto God.

00:40:53.599 --> 00:40:59.399
And then I noticed that last phrase, and the prisoners heard them.

00:40:59.399 --> 00:41:01.239
The prisoners heard them.

00:41:01.239 --> 00:41:08.439
I'm not sure how much the prisoners knew of what had transpired.

00:41:08.439 --> 00:41:17.799
I don't know how much they were aware of, but one thing I know is that Paul and Silas

00:41:17.799 --> 00:41:22.359
were adversely dealt with here in Philippi.

00:41:22.359 --> 00:41:28.539
We find that as they are beaten, as they are imprisoned, the Bible tells us that they not

00:41:28.539 --> 00:41:32.259
only prayed, but they sang praises.

00:41:32.259 --> 00:41:36.059
And as they sang praises, some people heard them.

00:41:36.059 --> 00:41:43.179
Now, I don't know, I've never spent a night in jail, I hope I never have to, but it would

00:41:43.179 --> 00:41:47.579
seem to me, and if you want to disagree, we can talk about it later, it would seem to

00:41:47.579 --> 00:41:54.179
me that some of those prisoners that heard them had probably been there for a period

00:41:54.179 --> 00:41:55.179
of time.

00:41:55.419 --> 00:41:59.259
Is that a safe assumption?

00:41:59.259 --> 00:42:02.779
No doubt, I'm not saying that all of them had been there for years, but some of them

00:42:02.779 --> 00:42:06.339
no doubt had been there for a period of time.

00:42:06.339 --> 00:42:11.259
And I would venture to say that for some of them that had spent some time there, they

00:42:11.259 --> 00:42:17.639
had never had a night where they heard some people singing and praising God.

00:42:17.639 --> 00:42:25.319
And I would venture to say that the Philippian jailer who knew what happened, I'd venture

00:42:25.319 --> 00:42:29.919
to say that he'd never seen anything like it either.

00:42:29.919 --> 00:42:31.739
Why?

00:42:31.739 --> 00:42:36.159
Because when God sent the earthquake, and that man was ready to kill himself, and Paul

00:42:36.159 --> 00:42:41.199
ran in and said, no, do yourself no harm, or ran out, excuse me, do yourself no harm,

00:42:41.199 --> 00:42:42.199
right?

00:42:42.199 --> 00:42:47.419
Paul, he hollered, cried with a loud voice in verse 38, 28, excuse me, do thyself no

00:42:48.199 --> 00:42:49.199
harm, for we're all here.

00:42:49.199 --> 00:42:51.179
What's the first thing that man says to him?

00:42:51.179 --> 00:42:56.299
What must I do to be saved?

00:42:56.299 --> 00:42:57.939
What must I do to be saved?

00:42:57.939 --> 00:43:02.459
See, there was an impact that their praise had.

00:43:02.459 --> 00:43:08.579
See, the reality this morning is that when we look at this passage of Scripture, and

00:43:08.579 --> 00:43:13.059
we say that the psalmist had resolved to praise the Lord, that the psalmist regularly praised

00:43:13.059 --> 00:43:18.139
the Lord, we begin to consider how this praise should look in our lives, in my life, in your

00:43:18.139 --> 00:43:22.979
life, and we begin to consider and really ask ourselves this morning as we would do

00:43:22.979 --> 00:43:31.979
some self-evaluation and examination and say, how is my praising?

00:43:31.979 --> 00:43:38.539
How many people have heard me praising versus how many people have heard me complaining?

00:43:38.539 --> 00:43:42.459
How often do my children hear me praising?

00:43:42.459 --> 00:43:45.219
How often do they hear me complaining?

00:43:45.219 --> 00:43:46.219
How often does my spouse?

00:43:46.219 --> 00:43:47.219
I mean, you get the idea.

00:43:47.219 --> 00:43:48.779
I don't have to go through every single scenario, right?

00:43:48.779 --> 00:43:53.179
You understand what I'm saying this morning.

00:43:53.179 --> 00:43:58.619
But we find that in the time of adversity, when we find that it might be a little bit

00:43:58.619 --> 00:44:04.779
difficult to praise the Lord, when we understand some things, if I go back to really my thought

00:44:04.779 --> 00:44:09.379
that the more time we spend with God, the more time we're in His presence and we're

00:44:09.379 --> 00:44:13.339
understanding His character and we're understanding His excellent works, the more natural it

00:44:13.339 --> 00:44:21.819
becomes that in times of adversity, it does not necessarily have to be a forced thing.

00:44:21.819 --> 00:44:22.819
It can still be natural.

00:44:22.819 --> 00:44:23.819
You say, how?

00:44:23.819 --> 00:44:28.459
I'm glad you asked.

00:44:28.459 --> 00:44:30.419
Let me share a verse with you in Romans chapter number 8.

00:44:30.419 --> 00:44:37.939
It's a verse that we know, but it's a verse sometimes I think that we know it better to

00:44:37.939 --> 00:44:46.819
counsel with than to practice in our lives.

00:44:46.819 --> 00:44:53.459
The truth this morning is that in time of adversity, in time of difficulty, we still

00:44:53.459 --> 00:44:54.979
ought to praise the Lord.

00:44:54.979 --> 00:44:57.459
That still would be captured in everything, right?

00:44:57.459 --> 00:44:58.459
You agree with that?

00:44:58.459 --> 00:45:02.419
At all times, continually.

00:45:02.419 --> 00:45:12.779
In Romans chapter number 8, I want you to consider this great promise in verse 28.

00:45:12.779 --> 00:45:22.099
I want you to think about these first three words, and we know.

00:45:22.099 --> 00:45:29.339
Now to know something is different than to think something.

00:45:29.339 --> 00:45:31.019
Would you agree?

00:45:31.019 --> 00:45:36.859
To know something is different than to assume something.

00:45:36.859 --> 00:45:38.859
Would you agree?

00:45:38.859 --> 00:45:42.259
Paul's not making an assumption in this verse of Scripture.

00:45:42.259 --> 00:45:44.339
Paul's not sharing a thought.

00:45:44.339 --> 00:45:46.659
I think this to be the case.

00:45:46.659 --> 00:45:55.259
Paul says, and we know, because there's something that we know about God.

00:45:55.259 --> 00:45:58.259
There's some things that we know about the character of God.

00:45:58.259 --> 00:46:00.859
There's some things that we know about the sovereignty of God.

00:46:00.899 --> 00:46:03.659
There's some things that we know about the plan of God.

00:46:03.659 --> 00:46:07.859
And so when we look at this passage of Scripture, again, Paul is the human penman that's writing

00:46:07.859 --> 00:46:08.859
these words.

00:46:08.859 --> 00:46:13.339
He's the one that we just read of in Acts 16 that experienced that adversity.

00:46:13.339 --> 00:46:17.699
By the way, he suffered many adversities.

00:46:17.699 --> 00:46:21.939
If you read the passage in 2 Corinthians chapter number 10, you can read a whole list of things

00:46:21.939 --> 00:46:22.939
that he suffered.

00:46:22.939 --> 00:46:27.939
In fact, if you read the same passage of Scripture in Philippians chapter number 3 that I shared

00:46:27.939 --> 00:46:33.139
with you in verse number 10, we find that in that same passage of Scripture, he talks

00:46:33.139 --> 00:46:36.539
about the fact that there were some things that he suffered.

00:46:36.539 --> 00:46:40.259
There were some things that he dealt with.

00:46:40.259 --> 00:46:45.779
We find that he would testify, as he's writing to Timothy, that the Lord delivered me out

00:46:45.779 --> 00:46:48.419
of them all.

00:46:48.419 --> 00:46:54.299
And we find here in Romans 8 and verse 28, and we know, all right?

00:46:54.299 --> 00:47:00.779
So we made focus on the word, no, but then I wanted you to make focus on the next phrase.

00:47:00.779 --> 00:47:06.259
And we know that, what's it say?

00:47:06.259 --> 00:47:11.659
All things, all things.

00:47:11.659 --> 00:47:15.499
Now, we could ask a young person here, does that mean everything?

00:47:15.499 --> 00:47:18.099
Well, yeah, and it's pretty simple, right?

00:47:18.099 --> 00:47:19.099
All things.

00:47:20.099 --> 00:47:24.259
So, understand, as we break down the verse of Scripture, as we think about what Paul

00:47:24.259 --> 00:47:28.539
is saying here, the truth that's being shared with us, he says we know something.

00:47:28.539 --> 00:47:31.939
We have the knowledge of this truth that he's sharing.

00:47:31.939 --> 00:47:35.379
It's not something that we think or we assume.

00:47:35.379 --> 00:47:44.859
We know that all things work together for good.

00:47:44.859 --> 00:47:46.659
You say, pastor, you don't know about my thing.

00:47:46.659 --> 00:47:49.899
I might not know about your thing, but God does.

00:47:49.899 --> 00:47:52.019
Is that fair to say?

00:47:52.019 --> 00:47:53.019
He's omniscient, right?

00:47:53.019 --> 00:47:54.579
He knows about it.

00:47:54.579 --> 00:48:01.019
And can I tell you that in the history of humankind, in over 6,000 years of human history,

00:48:01.019 --> 00:48:06.099
you are not the first one to experience your thing.

00:48:06.099 --> 00:48:07.099
Would you agree?

00:48:07.099 --> 00:48:11.019
You say, no, you don't know what I'm dealing with, pastor.

00:48:11.019 --> 00:48:14.579
There's been billions of people that have lived upon this earth.

00:48:14.579 --> 00:48:18.259
I am not the only one that's ever dealt with some difficulty, and neither are you.

00:48:18.259 --> 00:48:23.179
And I'm not trying to be, I'm trying to be facetious a little bit, but I'm trying to

00:48:23.179 --> 00:48:25.379
help us this morning.

00:48:25.379 --> 00:48:30.619
Because the reality is that sometimes we think that our particular circumstance or our particular

00:48:30.619 --> 00:48:35.179
situation is like nothing else that anyone else has ever experienced.

00:48:35.179 --> 00:48:38.579
But that's not true.

00:48:38.579 --> 00:48:42.139
It's just not true.

00:48:42.139 --> 00:48:46.859
And so we look at this and we understand that the truth that God is sharing with us

00:48:46.859 --> 00:48:52.099
is that we know that all things work together for good.

00:48:52.099 --> 00:49:04.899
To them, it says this, that love God to them who are the called according to His purpose.

00:49:04.899 --> 00:49:09.659
We love Him because He first loved us.

00:49:09.659 --> 00:49:11.739
If you love me, keep my commandments.

00:49:12.339 --> 00:49:15.419
I've had people share with me as I've sought to give them encouragement from this verse

00:49:15.419 --> 00:49:16.459
of Scripture.

00:49:16.459 --> 00:49:22.659
It doesn't apply to me because I'm not one that was called according to His purpose.

00:49:22.659 --> 00:49:27.899
What a way to twist Scripture.

00:49:27.899 --> 00:49:30.139
I think about Joseph.

00:49:30.139 --> 00:49:34.659
Many of you know Joseph is named Joseph and not Christopher, because I love the Bible

00:49:34.659 --> 00:49:35.659
character Joseph.

00:49:35.659 --> 00:49:39.779
His middle name is Christopher.

00:49:39.779 --> 00:49:46.699
Joseph was a man, as you would read his life account in Genesis 37 through 50, you begin

00:49:46.699 --> 00:49:51.499
to see that he suffered some terrible things.

00:49:51.499 --> 00:49:58.299
In fact, I would venture to say that most of us in this room have never encountered

00:49:58.299 --> 00:50:00.179
half of what he had to deal with.

00:50:00.179 --> 00:50:08.659
But you know what's amazing is that we know the end of the story for the life of Joseph.

00:50:08.659 --> 00:50:11.539
We know how he ended up in the palace.

00:50:11.539 --> 00:50:13.979
We know how everything kind of worked out.

00:50:13.979 --> 00:50:22.339
But you know when he was in Potiphar's house, before that when he was in the pit, when he

00:50:22.339 --> 00:50:29.579
was in Potiphar's house, when he was in the prison, when he was forgotten for two years,

00:50:29.579 --> 00:50:35.259
all of those things were the culmination of what God was doing in the life of that man

00:50:35.259 --> 00:50:37.539
Joseph.

00:50:37.539 --> 00:50:41.699
I've often said this as I've thought about the life of Joseph as it's given to us in

00:50:41.699 --> 00:50:46.539
that portion of scripture, we begin to think of all that took place and all that transpired.

00:50:46.539 --> 00:50:50.699
In fact, Joseph would have this of his own testimony when he speaks to his brothers,

00:50:50.699 --> 00:50:52.859
as for you, you thought evil, right?

00:50:52.859 --> 00:50:58.539
They meant it for evil, but he says this in Genesis 50 and verse 19, and Joseph said to

00:50:58.539 --> 00:51:02.179
them, fear not, for am I in the place of God?

00:51:02.179 --> 00:51:09.659
But as for you, you thought evil against me, but God meant it unto good to bring to pass

00:51:09.659 --> 00:51:14.099
as it is this day to save much people alive.

00:51:14.099 --> 00:51:21.019
What a perspective that Joseph had, a perspective that would do well for us to learn about and

00:51:21.019 --> 00:51:24.339
really implement in our own lives.

00:51:24.339 --> 00:51:28.619
Joseph had this understanding that because he was in a pit, because he was in Potiphar's

00:51:28.619 --> 00:51:32.179
house, because he was in the prison, it's what led him to be in the palace.

00:51:32.179 --> 00:51:35.779
And as he's in the palace, he's able to interpret this dream obviously before he gets to the

00:51:35.779 --> 00:51:40.699
palace, but even think about the time in which he's in the prison.

00:51:40.699 --> 00:51:44.819
Would he have met the butler and baker if he was still in Potiphar's house?

00:51:44.819 --> 00:51:46.939
Most likely not.

00:51:46.939 --> 00:51:50.419
So he meets the butler and the baker because he's in the prison house.

00:51:50.419 --> 00:51:52.539
By the way, did he deserve to be there?

00:51:52.539 --> 00:51:53.539
No.

00:51:53.739 --> 00:51:55.779
Do you know how many people say, I don't deserve this?

00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:57.979
I understand.

00:51:57.979 --> 00:52:02.459
Let God be God.

00:52:02.459 --> 00:52:04.539
He's in the prison house.

00:52:04.539 --> 00:52:05.819
He interprets the dreams.

00:52:05.819 --> 00:52:07.579
The butler and the baker go back.

00:52:07.579 --> 00:52:10.459
The butler, he restored to his butlership, right?

00:52:10.459 --> 00:52:11.459
The baker, he's killed.

00:52:11.459 --> 00:52:14.459
That was the interpretation of the dreams.

00:52:14.459 --> 00:52:16.819
And what does Joseph say to them?

00:52:16.819 --> 00:52:20.859
There's one request that he makes, remember me.

00:52:20.859 --> 00:52:21.859
Remember me.

00:52:22.379 --> 00:52:26.499
And it's interesting because after the butler gets back, guess what the butler does?

00:52:26.499 --> 00:52:28.099
He conveniently forgets.

00:52:28.099 --> 00:52:30.099
Isn't that helpful?

00:52:30.099 --> 00:52:35.739
But I want you to think about what's going on in the life of Joseph.

00:52:35.739 --> 00:52:40.379
I want you to just for a moment think about Joseph in this particular situation and think

00:52:40.379 --> 00:52:44.699
about the way in which he was forgotten for those two full years.

00:52:44.699 --> 00:52:50.579
And as he's there in that situation, as he's dealing with in that prison and all that he's

00:52:50.579 --> 00:52:56.859
dealing with, we find that it's during that time that Pharaoh dreamed a dream.

00:52:56.859 --> 00:53:05.459
Now, had the butler returned immediately and said to the Pharaoh, there's a guy in prison

00:53:05.459 --> 00:53:06.459
that interpret my dream.

00:53:06.459 --> 00:53:13.019
I mean, it came to pass just as he said, what do you think Pharaoh would have said?

00:53:13.019 --> 00:53:17.779
I think he would have said, that's great, but I got guys that interpret dreams, right?

00:53:17.779 --> 00:53:21.219
Where did Pharaoh go first after he dreamed his dream in chapter number 41?

00:53:21.219 --> 00:53:23.659
He went to his magicians and his astrologers.

00:53:23.659 --> 00:53:27.259
That's what he did for them to interpret the dream.

00:53:27.259 --> 00:53:28.259
But guess what?

00:53:28.259 --> 00:53:30.339
They couldn't interpret the dream.

00:53:30.339 --> 00:53:36.059
It's at that particular time that Joseph says or that the butler says, I remember my false

00:53:36.059 --> 00:53:37.059
this day.

00:53:37.059 --> 00:53:42.139
And I remember as I was in prison, there's a guy by the name of Joseph, in Hebrew, interpreted

00:53:42.139 --> 00:53:43.139
my dream.

00:53:43.139 --> 00:53:45.219
What does Pharaoh say at that point?

00:53:45.219 --> 00:53:47.259
Bring him to me.

00:53:47.259 --> 00:53:48.339
Bring him to me.

00:53:48.339 --> 00:53:53.539
So for two years he's forgotten in prison, but you see the timing of God.

00:53:53.539 --> 00:53:55.219
You see the hand of the Lord.

00:53:55.219 --> 00:54:00.259
Now here's the thing, and I understand this, and I hope that it just helps us.

00:54:00.259 --> 00:54:03.779
I understand that we're looking at a historical account.

00:54:03.779 --> 00:54:07.739
We're looking at the whole process and we're seeing the end.

00:54:07.739 --> 00:54:12.039
But for each one of us, we're living life moment by moment.

00:54:12.039 --> 00:54:15.219
We might be in the midst somewhere in those two years, right?

00:54:15.219 --> 00:54:19.499
And we just feel like we can't see anything positive.

00:54:19.499 --> 00:54:25.219
But we don't have to pretend to praise God in the time of adversity because we can have

00:54:25.219 --> 00:54:28.939
the knowledge that our God is working.

00:54:28.939 --> 00:54:35.979
And I may not have to know how He is working, but I can simply rejoice and then praise Him

00:54:35.979 --> 00:54:37.499
that He is working.

00:54:37.499 --> 00:54:40.299
Does that make sense?

00:54:40.299 --> 00:54:41.819
I hope that it helps some.

00:54:42.579 --> 00:54:46.699
It's helped me because there's some times that you deal with some things in your life

00:54:46.699 --> 00:54:49.859
and you say, what is going on?

00:54:49.859 --> 00:54:51.659
What is this all about?

00:54:51.659 --> 00:54:54.139
You say, God is working.

00:54:54.139 --> 00:54:58.019
I don't know about you, but during the whole COVID thing that we're still dealing with,

00:54:58.019 --> 00:55:03.459
there have been plenty of times that it's like, what is going on?

00:55:03.459 --> 00:55:07.819
Everything that you ever think about ministry has changed dramatically.

00:55:07.819 --> 00:55:13.219
I never have had to tell people, I'm sorry, you can't come to church until COVID.

00:55:13.219 --> 00:55:15.059
I was talking to a missionary friend the other day.

00:55:15.059 --> 00:55:20.859
I said, in fact, all of my years of ministry has been trying to get people to come to church.

00:55:20.859 --> 00:55:22.539
He said, yeah, pack a pew, brother.

00:55:22.539 --> 00:55:26.219
I was like, I wish we could just, yeah, it'd be great.

00:55:26.219 --> 00:55:28.139
You can't, right?

00:55:28.139 --> 00:55:29.139
Unless you're family.

00:55:29.139 --> 00:55:37.579
I got a phone call on Friday, pastor, I just want to share with you, so-and-so got saved.

00:55:38.339 --> 00:55:45.459
I would venture to say that if it were not for COVID,

00:55:45.459 --> 00:55:48.339
they probably never would have watched our services online.

00:55:52.699 --> 00:55:55.899
By the way, that's the fourth phone call I've gotten during this time

00:55:55.899 --> 00:55:57.979
of people that have gotten saved.

00:55:59.619 --> 00:56:04.779
When COVID came in, pastors were talking together how we were going to,

00:56:04.779 --> 00:56:08.539
I had pastors, I'm ready to go underground if I have to go underground.

00:56:08.539 --> 00:56:11.659
I mean, just do what we got to do, right?

00:56:11.659 --> 00:56:12.859
God's God.

00:56:12.859 --> 00:56:14.739
He's working.

00:56:14.739 --> 00:56:19.619
Somebody called me up just shortly after that phone call.

00:56:19.619 --> 00:56:21.979
Said, pastor, my heart's so overwhelmed.

00:56:21.979 --> 00:56:23.619
I just got to share it with somebody.

00:56:23.619 --> 00:56:24.419
It's going to burst.

00:56:24.419 --> 00:56:26.499
God answered a prayer.

00:56:26.499 --> 00:56:28.779
And they're just rejoicing.

00:56:28.779 --> 00:56:30.219
I mean, they were just so ecstatic.

00:56:30.219 --> 00:56:31.939
It was great.

00:56:31.939 --> 00:56:34.979
Those are pleasant phone calls, by the way.

00:56:34.979 --> 00:56:40.579
What I'm saying this morning is that we all are dealing with personally

00:56:40.579 --> 00:56:44.979
different scenarios and situations.

00:56:44.979 --> 00:56:48.699
And we have to have this understanding, praise him, praise him.

00:56:48.699 --> 00:56:49.819
Our God is worthy.

00:56:49.819 --> 00:56:52.139
We purpose, we resolve.

00:56:52.139 --> 00:56:55.699
I'm going to praise him at all times.

00:56:55.699 --> 00:56:57.819
His praise shall continually be in my mouth.

00:56:57.819 --> 00:57:02.459
Look up Hebrews 13 and verse number 15, that we're to offer our praise,

00:57:02.459 --> 00:57:08.259
the sacrifice of our lips, our praise given thanks to God continually.

00:57:08.259 --> 00:57:12.939
And we make that resolve, and then we regularly praise him.

00:57:12.939 --> 00:57:17.539
Privately, and it overflows into public.

00:57:17.539 --> 00:57:22.339
And then we're praising him in good times and in times that maybe we wouldn't

00:57:22.339 --> 00:57:25.539
describe as being good times.

00:57:25.539 --> 00:57:34.179
But we know, we know that in all things, our God is working.

00:57:34.179 --> 00:57:39.619
And the reality this morning is that when I have that knowledge that God is working,

00:57:39.619 --> 00:57:46.339
and I have that proper perspective, it helps me to praise him in the moment.

00:57:46.339 --> 00:57:52.019
Because I say, I don't know what God's doing, but God's a whole lot wiser than I am.

00:57:52.019 --> 00:57:52.339
Right?

00:57:52.339 --> 00:57:53.379
He transcends us.

00:57:53.379 --> 00:57:54.459
His ways are not our ways.

00:57:54.459 --> 00:57:56.419
His thoughts are not our thoughts.

00:57:56.419 --> 00:58:00.419
And we understand that truth, and we say, I don't understand all that God's doing,

00:58:00.419 --> 00:58:04.699
but I'm going to praise him because I know he's doing something good.

00:58:04.699 --> 00:58:13.339
He's doing something that he's doing for my good and for his glory.

00:58:13.379 --> 00:58:22.499
John chapter number 11, Lazarus is sick, and Jesus delays.

00:58:22.499 --> 00:58:25.219
Right?

00:58:25.219 --> 00:58:30.619
Martha and Mary find that Jesus is coming, but Lazarus is already dead.

00:58:30.619 --> 00:58:32.179
You know what they say?

00:58:32.179 --> 00:58:37.739
If you had been here, my brother had not died.

00:58:37.739 --> 00:58:41.739
And I believe that there was some absolute truth in what they said.

00:58:41.739 --> 00:58:46.459
They fully believed that if Jesus was there, that he could have healed that sickness.

00:58:46.459 --> 00:58:49.779
But Jesus said, I'm going to do greater works.

00:58:49.779 --> 00:58:54.739
And in fact, he told his disciples before he ever left, when he announced that Lazarus was dead,

00:58:54.739 --> 00:58:59.779
he said, I am glad for your sakes that I was not there.

00:58:59.779 --> 00:59:02.419
Why? Because God's working.

00:59:02.419 --> 00:59:09.539
And you know that even the Jewish people that were there to mourn the death of Lazarus,

00:59:09.539 --> 00:59:14.339
they even believed that Jesus could have done something if he was there.

00:59:14.339 --> 00:59:20.499
You read it, you'll see that they make the same comments about what Jesus is able to do.

00:59:20.499 --> 00:59:25.339
But then after Jesus stood there and said, Lazarus, come forth,

00:59:25.339 --> 00:59:30.859
there was a whole new level of understanding of what God is able to do.

00:59:30.859 --> 00:59:35.659
They saw something that they would not have seen otherwise.

00:59:35.699 --> 00:59:38.139
Can I tell you that this is real simple?

00:59:38.139 --> 00:59:43.899
Lazarus had to die in order for Jesus to raise him from the dead.

00:59:43.899 --> 00:59:47.379
That's basic, right?

00:59:47.379 --> 00:59:52.419
But there was some heartache in that whole process by Martha and Mary.

00:59:52.419 --> 00:59:54.859
But they got to see what God was able to do.

00:59:54.859 --> 00:59:56.459
Praise him, praise him.

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:58.139
He's worthy of it.

00:59:58.139 --> 00:59:59.859
I hope that we'd resolve this morning.

00:59:59.859 --> 01:00:05.219
praise Him, and that we'd regularly practice praising our God, for He is worthy.

01:00:05.219 --> 01:00:06.219
Let's pray.

01:00:06.219 --> 01:00:07.219
Father, we love You.

01:00:07.219 --> 01:00:08.339
We thank You for loving us.

01:00:08.339 --> 01:00:11.739
Thank You for the Word of God, the truth contained therein.

01:00:11.739 --> 01:00:22.779
God, we can see in Your Word the importance of resolving, as the psalmist did, to praise

01:00:22.779 --> 01:00:23.779
You.

01:00:23.779 --> 01:00:31.579
I thank You that You've put a new song in my heart to even praise unto my God.

01:00:31.579 --> 01:00:41.179
We understand that Your character and Your work, they demand our praise.

01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:43.099
You're worthy of it.

01:00:43.099 --> 01:00:50.659
God, as we think about some of the examples that we referenced this morning, I thank You

01:00:50.659 --> 01:00:53.099
for the instruction that they provide.

01:00:53.099 --> 01:01:03.379
And Lord, I know, however, that as we walk this journey called life, that there are some

01:01:03.379 --> 01:01:07.219
difficulties that we face.

01:01:07.219 --> 01:01:13.219
There are times in which it seems as if we just can't see what's going on.

01:01:13.219 --> 01:01:17.899
God, would You help us to rest in the truth of Your Word?

01:01:17.899 --> 01:01:26.059
Would You help us to praise You in the time of that difficulty, knowing, not thinking

01:01:26.059 --> 01:01:31.339
or assuming, but knowing that You're at work?

01:01:31.339 --> 01:01:36.739
Help us, Lord, to be a people that properly praise You.

01:01:36.739 --> 01:01:41.579
I pray that You'd have Your will and way over these next few moments of invitation, that

01:01:41.579 --> 01:01:44.059
decisions would be made that would please Thee.

01:01:44.059 --> 01:01:47.739
We'll certainly praise You for all that You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

01:01:47.739 --> 01:01:48.739
Just stand with me.

01:01:48.739 --> 01:01:49.739
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:51.099
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.
