1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,599
Psalm 62 this morning, Psalm 62, I'll be looking at the entirety of the psalm.

2
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:08,199
I just want to read a few verses by way of introduction, and then we'll get right into

3
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:09,199
the message this morning.

4
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:16,280
Here in Psalm 62, I'll give you a moment to turn there, and Psalm 62, I love the book

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,280
of Psalms.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,280
It's an encouraging book.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,579
It's a book in which we can go to and we can be encouraged and strengthened.

8
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:27,520
We learn many things about our God and about His character, His attributes that are revealed

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,520
to us through the book of Psalms.

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,799
I believe that as you read and study through the book of Psalms and maybe make it a part

11
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:37,459
of your daily routine, that as you're reading the scriptures, you're reading other portions

12
00:00:37,459 --> 00:00:41,680
of the scriptures, but maybe reading a portion from the book of Psalms as well, and it just

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,000
encourages you and strengthens you.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,819
We also have the unique privilege of being able to see the transparency of the psalmist,

15
00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:54,159
and I believe that's helpful for us because we find that the psalmist, though many of

16
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,959
the psalms are ascribed to David, he did not write all of them.

17
00:00:57,959 --> 00:01:02,479
We understand that it's scripture, so it's given by inspiration of God, but we understand

18
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,760
that as David, in many of the psalms, he would pour his heart out before the Lord, and he

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,440
would reveal to us his transparency, and I believe that it helps us in our daily walk

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,319
with the Lord as well.

21
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:19,199
And this morning, as we look at this psalm, notice in verse number one of Psalm 62, the

22
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:25,279
Bible says, "'Truly, my soul waiteth upon God.

23
00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:29,760
From Him cometh my salvation.'"

24
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,959
Notice this, "'He only.'"

25
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:38,400
Maybe that's an important word for you to underline or circle, "'He only is my rock

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,239
and my salvation.

27
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,839
He is my defense.

28
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:46,080
I shall not be greatly moved.'"

29
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:48,239
Skip down and look at verse number eight.

30
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:54,160
The Bible says, "'Trust in Him at all times, ye people.

31
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,199
Pour out your heart before Him.

32
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:03,199
God is a refuge for us, Selah.'"

33
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:08,160
I want you to notice that second phrase in verse number eight.

34
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:15,080
We'll use it as our title this morning, "'Pour out your heart before Him.

35
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,399
Pour out your heart before Him.'"

36
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:24,059
We do not know for sure the timing of the writing of this particular psalm.

37
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:27,000
We understand that the psalm is ascribed to David.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,679
If in your Bible you have little notations above the psalms, you'll notice that it says

39
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:32,880
a psalm of David.

40
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,679
It's historically been ascribed to David as the human penman of this particular psalm.

41
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:45,199
We find that the timing of some of the psalms is very easy to identify and see what circumstances

42
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:50,039
and what have you David may be dealing with and going through at the particular moment

43
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,600
of writing the particular psalm.

44
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:59,279
It's not crystal clear here in Psalm 62 as to exactly the timing in which David was writing

45
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,639
this particular psalm.

46
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,600
However, we believe that as you study the Scriptures and study through here, that it

47
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:11,080
would seem obvious or evident that the psalm was written during the time, the period if

48
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,000
you will, of Absalom's rebellion.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,639
You'll remember that Absalom is the son of David and that Absalom, because of some events

50
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,039
that had transpired and some things that had taken place, and he goes through a process

51
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,100
of really stealing the hearts of the people of God, and we find that in just a little

52
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:34,279
while after doing that and going through that process, there's a revolt that Absalom takes

53
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:40,600
and he's seeking to really dethrone his father and become the ruler of Israel.

54
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:46,240
We find that through that event or through those events that David flees and all that

55
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,919
takes place, and that's not really the thought of what we're going to be dealing with this

56
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,000
morning, but we can read of those accounts and the record of that in the book of 2 Samuel

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,199
and you can see all that transpires.

58
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,119
We understand that even if that is not the particular instance in which this psalm was

59
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:07,600
penned, we do know that there are plenty of times in the life of David in which he

60
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,399
dealt with adversity, that he dealt with difficulty.

61
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:18,359
You'll remember early on in his life as he was, after he had been selected by God and

62
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:23,760
anointed by Samuel the prophet to be the next king of Israel, you understand that he served

63
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:30,299
under the leadership of Saul, and God had rejected Saul from being king over his people.

64
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:34,779
But it was not yet time for David to become the king of Israel, and there was a period

65
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:38,940
of really proving and just development and all sorts of things that David was dealing

66
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:45,940
with, and during that time, during that season in David's life, he dealt with much opposition

67
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,859
and much adversity.

68
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:50,140
Saul himself tried to kill David.

69
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,260
Saul tried to employ his men to kill David.

70
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,760
He tried to use the Philistines to kill David.

71
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:00,179
He did everything he could to kill David, yet God spared his servant.

72
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:05,179
We find that David was a man that was acquainted with difficulty and adversity, and David

73
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:11,339
was a man that learned that in the middle of a storm, in the time of adversity and difficulty,

74
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:16,940
that God is dependable, that God is trustworthy, that we run to God.

75
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,779
And as we look here, of course, David was not perfect.

76
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:21,779
He's a human.

77
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:25,040
He didn't always do everything perfect.

78
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,820
We can read of sin in the life of David as it's recorded in the Word of God.

79
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:34,059
We can read in times in which he did not respond to adversity, maybe in the most appropriate

80
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:37,779
way, but I believe that through all of those circumstances, and even as we would learn,

81
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:42,380
remember, there was a time in which David went to the land of the Philistines.

82
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,179
Did he not?

83
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:53,179
I think David learned through that, and as he pens the words of this psalm, as we have

84
00:05:53,179 --> 00:05:57,859
the opportunity to see the heart of the psalmist, not only to see the heart of the psalmist

85
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,540
but the attributes of our God.

86
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,459
I believe that this psalm will help us this morning.

87
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:06,540
You say, pastor, I'm not dealing with a storm.

88
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:14,040
Just file it away, honestly, because I'm telling you that a storm will come in your life.

89
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,220
A period of difficulty will come in your life.

90
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,880
And we look here at this psalm, I want you to consider with me, first of all, the experience

91
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,619
of the psalmist.

92
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:28,100
Consider in the first seven verses how David is really just sharing his experience and

93
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,260
that which he had dealt with in his life, and the reality this morning is that many

94
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,019
of us have experiences.

95
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:39,660
We have lived life for a certain period of time, a certain number of years, and we have

96
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,140
certain experiences that we've dealt with in life.

97
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:48,459
And we find that in these first seven verses that as David is really rehearsing his experiences

98
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:53,299
and he's dealing with some of the troubles in which he dealt with in life, he's reminding

99
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:58,660
us how he trusted God, how he depended upon the Lord.

100
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:05,820
Notice in verse number one, truly, I like the way the psalmist starts, truly my soul

101
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,600
waiteth upon God.

102
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,179
Can I say this morning, that can be the hardest part of your storm.

103
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:14,179
The waiting.

104
00:07:14,179 --> 00:07:17,299
God, what are you trying to teach me?

105
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:19,260
How long is this going to last?

106
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,179
When is this going to end?

107
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:23,140
And we're waiting on God.

108
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:28,619
And we're waiting for God to show Himself real, what He's able to do and what His purpose

109
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:31,739
is in that time.

110
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:39,380
And the psalmist says, truly my soul waiteth upon God, from Him cometh my salvation.

111
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:45,100
Now you understand in the book of Psalms that oftentimes the word salvation is used in what

112
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,660
we would understand as deliverance.

113
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:53,940
Not so much always being dealt with of our soul's salvation, our redemption from the

114
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,660
penalty of sin, though there are times in which that's dealt with, but really as you

115
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,380
look at the psalm you'd understand that he's dealing with deliverance.

116
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,640
The deliverance that he receives from God.

117
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,899
And we understand from Him, from the Lord, from the Lord God Almighty, from Him cometh

118
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:12,820
my salvation, the deliverance.

119
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:18,100
Listen, we may not always see and understand exactly how He's delivering, but we understand

120
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,739
that as we look at our life and maybe as we look back at some events and some experiences

121
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:31,059
that we would be able to say with the psalmist, truly my soul waiteth upon God, from Him cometh

122
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:32,380
my salvation.

123
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:38,219
Notice verse 2, He only is my rock and my salvation.

124
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,099
He is my defense.

125
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,140
I shall not be greatly moved.

126
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,659
What of this morning?

127
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:55,099
Can we say in sincerity and honest this morning in verse number 2 that God is, He only is

128
00:08:55,099 --> 00:09:02,460
my rock, my salvation, He is my defense?

129
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,659
Notice what he says when he understands these realities, when he's understood this experience

130
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:08,659
that he's had.

131
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:12,780
He says, I shall not be greatly moved.

132
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,780
I believe that David through his experience and the many experiences that he had in life,

133
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,059
I believe that he had been strengthened by God.

134
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:25,780
What a joy to receive the strength that God gives His children.

135
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:30,500
See, we are weak, but He is strong.

136
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:37,140
Paul said after he'd besought the Lord thrice that God would deliver him from that thorn,

137
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,059
that God says, my grace is sufficient for thee.

138
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:43,580
You can read of that in 2 Corinthians chapter number 12, and he talks about God's strength

139
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,900
being made perfect in our weakness.

140
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,539
Think about the psalmist being strengthened.

141
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:53,820
See, the reality is that there are times in our lives in which we think about physical

142
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,820
strength.

143
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,900
But you know it's important that the inner man is strengthened.

144
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,860
Corinthians chapter number four the Bible talks about we faint not as you

145
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,460
read through that passage of Scripture and you deal with all of the

146
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,660
tribulations and distresses and trials and troubles that they dealt with that

147
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,780
Paul is referring to why does he say we faint not because our inner man is

148
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:19,420
strengthened it's renewed day by day see David was strengthened notice verse

149
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,260
number three how long will you imagine mischief against a man you shall be

150
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,540
slain all of you as a bowing wall shall you be in as a tottering fence you

151
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,460
notice the imagery that he uses with regard to those that would bring trouble

152
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,900
in his life at the end of verse number three he uses the the imagery of a

153
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,980
bowing wall in a tottering fence the the lack of stability the lanket lack of

154
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:49,940
strength the only excuse me look at verse number four they only consult to

155
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:57,820
cast him down from his excellency they delight in lies they bless with their

156
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:06,540
mouth but they curse inwardly see law you understand that the enemy is

157
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:12,060
relentless and ruthless and as he speaks here about some of that which is taking

158
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,940
place you notice in verse number four they only consult to cast him down from

159
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:23,300
his excellency they delight in lies the way in which we understand that truth is

160
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:31,300
no longer held in high esteem as it should be he says that they bless with

161
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:37,700
their mouth but they curse inwardly see law is what David experienced but notice

162
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,100
what he says in verse number five it's interesting how kind of he uses verses

163
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,100
one and two in verses five through seven as book ends if you will to what he says

164
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,020
in verses three and four with regard to some of the difficulty notice in verse

165
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:57,380
number five my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him you

166
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,460
know sometimes we got to have a little self-talk you don't know I'm saying

167
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:06,260
notice where he says in verse number six and verse number one truly my soul wait

168
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:13,860
if upon God and then he says in verse number five my soul wait thou only upon

169
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,620
God you ever want to take things in your own hands you ever want to try to

170
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,260
expedite the process and say let me get through this thing a little bit faster

171
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,700
let me help you Lord let me deal with this I can deal with this person faster

172
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,580
God than you seem to be dealing with this person and we can get this

173
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:36,020
situation resolved David has declared in verse number one that he's waiting upon

174
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,460
God but in verse number five he says my soul wait now only upon God listen we

175
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:46,580
need to remind ourselves to wait upon the Lord again it's not the easy thing

176
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:52,220
to do most of us this morning waiting is one of the things we least like about

177
00:12:52,220 --> 00:13:00,060
life they don't like to wait so these bells ringing anyone else hear that

178
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,900
sound like a church bell ringing amen we don't have a church bell but it's not

179
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,020
like a church bell was ringing listen for the trumpet amen whoo that'd be

180
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:16,460
exciting notice for my expectation is from him are you expecting God to work

181
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:24,060
honestly the psalmist says in Psalm 119 it is time for thee O Lord to walk it's

182
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,340
actually not with someone I teen it's a couple chapters before I can't remember

183
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,580
exactly what chapter right now but it's a couple chapters before but he says

184
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:35,780
it's time Lord for thee to work and let me actually read the verse I think it is

185
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:40,020
some night 119 and the Lord just brought on my mind let me see if I can find it

186
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,020
here look at verse number 126 you don't have to look there but just jot it down

187
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:50,940
Psalm 119 126 it is time for the Lord to work for they have made void thy law

188
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:57,580
are you expecting God to work he says my expectation is from him what are you

189
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,420
expecting God to do you understand this morning that as we pray we pray to a God

190
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:07,300
who's able to exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to

191
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:12,780
what we find in Ephesians 3 in verse number 20 he says to Jeremiah call unto

192
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:17,100
me and I will answer thee and show thee great mighty things which thou knowest

193
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:23,420
not the psalmist says as he would just reveal to us the experience that he's

194
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:30,380
had in life he says listen my expectation is from him by the way I

195
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:35,900
like it when God works I like it when God works in such a distinct way that

196
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,620
you cannot confuse it with the work of man that you cannot come to a place

197
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,100
where you'd say oh well that's how they figured this out and that's how they did

198
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,060
that in fact in Psalm 109 in verse number 26 the psalmist cries out and

199
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:54,700
says help me O Lord my God Oh save me according to thy mercy that they may

200
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:03,260
know that this is thy hand that thou Lord has done it oh man I love to see

201
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:11,460
God work are you expecting God to work in your life my expectation it's from

202
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:19,060
him notice verse 6 he says again what we read in verse number 2 he only is my

203
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:30,740
rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be moved verse 7 in God is my

204
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:38,500
salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God we

205
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,500
consider the experience of the psalmist we find not only was he strengthened I

206
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,340
believe that he was delivered you know that David experienced deliverance in

207
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,380
his life on a number of occasions we can read not only as we think about the

208
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,700
context perhaps of the writing of this particular psalm with the revolt of

209
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,940
Absalom but if you think over that's near the end of David's life if you look

210
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,100
over the entirety of David's life and you think about the way in which God

211
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:07,140
delivered him from the hand of the enemy the way that God miraculously delivered

212
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:13,660
him out of the the evil intent of Saul the way that God delivered him from the

213
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:19,540
Philistines I mean over and over you see that David experienced deliverance and

214
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,420
in 1st Samuel 17 when he goes to fight against Goliath what does he say he

215
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:30,060
says listen this is what the God that created all things the God of Israel he

216
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,660
is going to give victory he is going to give thy servant victory and you

217
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,540
understand that he David had experienced the deliverance of God Almighty I

218
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,820
believe that the psalmist as he would rehearse and recount his experience that

219
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,740
not only was he strengthened and delivered I believe that he was

220
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,620
encouraged you know it's encouraging when you see God work it's encouraging

221
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:58,580
when you're aware of what God is doing in your life and how God is is working

222
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,700
and moving it's encouraging to know that we serve a God who makes no mistakes

223
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,900
that we serve a God who is perfect and that we serve a God who has a plan and

224
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:12,460
it's a perfect plan it's a plan in which you and I will be developed as a plan

225
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:20,260
in which he will be glorified what a joy what a blessing I believe David was

226
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:29,860
helped we need to be helped you know the psalmist cries out help Lord I mean

227
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:34,220
you just see the transparency of the psalmist and you find that as we would

228
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,900
consider the experience of the psalmist that perhaps we can relate to some of

229
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,580
that which he dealt with I mean not to the same extreme in which David dealt

230
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,620
with but we can we can relate to troubles and trials and we can relate to

231
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:51,700
storms in our lives and we consider the experience of the psalmist but then

232
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,180
number two we consider the encouragement from the psalmist you know it's

233
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,860
interesting when when when the psalmist has an experience when he rehearses

234
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:05,140
these experiences that he has he now is in a unique position to offer

235
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:12,300
encouragement to other people you know God will use us he'll allow us to

236
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:17,580
experience some things and then use us to help others that we come in contact

237
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:22,820
with 2nd Corinthians chapter number one the Apostle Paul is speaking to these

238
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,900
believers in in Corinth and of course it's the second letter that he writes

239
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,900
to them but in verse number three of 2nd Corinthians chapter number one we find

240
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:36,180
that Paul is going to give some some really unique truth that is helpful for

241
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,380
us as the people of God in verse number three says blessed be God even the

242
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,660
father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies and the God of all

243
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,740
comfort aren't you thankful that he's the God of all comfort it says in verse

244
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:58,300
number four who comforted us in all our tribulation that we may be able to

245
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:05,380
comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are

246
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:11,380
comforted of God you know God will allow us to experience some things in

247
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:16,300
life and then as the psalmist here in Psalm 62 experience some things and

248
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,300
rehearses that now he's going to give some encouragement notice what he's

249
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:25,540
going to encourage in verse number eight he says trust in him all at all times

250
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:30,700
notices ye people so now he's not really dealing with his own experience he's now

251
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,700
giving this word of encouragement this word of admonition if you will to those

252
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,340
that would be the recipients those that would read the psalm those throughout

253
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,980
the centuries including us this morning that have preserved in the perfect Word

254
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:49,900
of God this psalm that we can go to and we can be helped in David as he would

255
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:58,180
encourage the people he says number one trust in him at all times we believe

256
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,020
that every word of God

257
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,620
God is pure.

258
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,480
Amen?

259
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,000
He could have just said, trust in Him.

260
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,140
But I like the fact that he says,

261
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,240
at all times.

262
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,640
At all times.

263
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,140
Because the reality is that there are

264
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,240
some times in our lives

265
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,040
where the difficulty can almost become

266
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,140
so overpowering,

267
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,640
so difficult what we're dealing with in life,

268
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,720
that we find that this truth

269
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,620
in the very words of Scripture

270
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,060
would remind us that at all times,

271
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,100
in every circumstance,

272
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,700
in every situation that you face in life,

273
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,180
trust in Him.

274
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,620
You know, our God is trustworthy.

275
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,160
He is faithful.

276
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,260
He is dependable.

277
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,420
We think about the faithfulness of our God

278
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,660
when we think about the way

279
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,460
in which He has proven His character

280
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,840
and His attributes over and over.

281
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,540
Our God wants us to trust Him.

282
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,680
He wants us to exercise faith.

283
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,220
He that cometh to God must believe that He is.

284
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,820
It says there right before that,

285
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,560
without faith it is impossible to please Him.

286
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,260
For he that cometh to God must believe that He is

287
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:22,180
and a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.

288
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:28,820
God asks Moses in the book of Numbers

289
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,620
after the spies go out

290
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,580
and they come back with that evil report

291
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,880
in Numbers 14,

292
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,080
God says to Moses,

293
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,800
how long will it be ere My people believe Me?

294
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,400
That they'll trust Me?

295
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,440
And you think about the way in which God

296
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,380
had proven Himself to that particular generation.

297
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,460
The mighty works that they saw

298
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,780
in the land of Egypt

299
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,880
and the mighty hand of God

300
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,740
in delivering His people from Egyptian bondage.

301
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,940
The miraculous deliverance across the Red Sea

302
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,240
and just the provision,

303
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,580
the manna and the water.

304
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,120
I mean, what amazing things

305
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,140
these people have experienced.

306
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,440
But when those ten spies say,

307
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,900
hey listen, the people that dwell in this land,

308
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,140
they're giants and the cities are fortified

309
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,300
and they have walls.

310
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,620
Well, we're not able to do it.

311
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,800
We begin to doubt.

312
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,320
God says how long will it be ere My people believe Me?

313
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,840
David here, as he would encourage the people,

314
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,000
and he says here,

315
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,480
trust in Him at all times.

316
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,560
You know, we are familiar with the truth

317
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,800
of Proverbs 3, verses 5 and 6

318
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,640
where the Bible says in that passage of Scripture,

319
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,920
trust in the Lord, how?

320
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,180
With all thine heart.

321
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,420
And it says lean not unto thine own understanding.

322
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,780
I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand,

323
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,020
but I would believe this morning

324
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,660
that if you would be honest,

325
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,860
leaning on our own understanding

326
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,580
is a challenge that we deal with.

327
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,900
We lean on our own understanding.

328
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,820
We try to analyze and figure things out

329
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,260
and we begin to lean on our own understanding

330
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,460
and so that's why we find in Proverbs,

331
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,960
trust in the Lord with all thine heart.

332
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,360
David says trust in Him at all times.

333
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,760
The good times.

334
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,960
The bad times.

335
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,840
See, life has a way of just kind of changing

336
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,880
and various things that happen

337
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,200
and circumstances that come our ways.

338
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,040
But who are we trusting?

339
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,720
Who are we trusting?

340
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,520
David says trust Him at all times.

341
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,720
Notice the encouragement,

342
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,360
not only trust in Him at all times,

343
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,360
but notice v. 8.

344
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,080
We've used it as our title this morning.

345
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:56,360
Pour out your heart before Him.

346
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,280
In your sanctified imagination,

347
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,440
in your mind's eye,

348
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,480
what do you see when you read those words?

349
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,180
Pour out your heart before Him.

350
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,680
I mean, you know,

351
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,080
God invites us to cast our burden upon Him.

352
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,280
God invites us to cast our care upon Him.

353
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,120
You look at Psalm 55 and v. 22.

354
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,440
You look at 1 Peter 5 and v. 7.

355
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,600
There's a reference in the Old and New Testament

356
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,200
about casting our burden,

357
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,400
casting our cares upon the Lord

358
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,440
knowing that He'll sustain us,

359
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,360
knowing that He cares for us.

360
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,440
And in my mind's eye when I read

361
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,880
pour out your heart before Him,

362
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,720
I see somebody that is just weeping

363
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,280
and pouring out their heart before God Almighty.

364
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,360
I mean, do you ever feel that way in life?

365
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,280
Do you ever feel like you just want to pour your heart out?

366
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,640
Sometimes we pour it out to the wrong people.

367
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,720
Sometimes we pick up the phone

368
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,680
and pour out our heart to a neighbor,

369
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,760
a family member, maybe to our spouse.

370
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,320
But I wonder this morning,

371
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,400
have we poured out our heart to God Almighty?

372
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,560
I mean, really just get into the quietness of our time.

373
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,000
Listen, God knows anyway.

374
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,720
But He wants us to verbalize it.

375
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,960
He wants us to come to Him

376
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,600
and to pour out our heart before Him.

377
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,440
See, God knows if you're struggling.

378
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,840
He knows if you're confused.

379
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,520
He knows if you just don't seem to

380
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,120
understand what He's doing.

381
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,320
He knows our frame.

382
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,200
He knows that we're but dust.

383
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,840
He says, pour out your heart.

384
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,880
Man, there are times that you can get alone with God.

385
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,400
Just pour out your heart.

386
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,000
And know that He loves you.

387
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,120
See, I can pour out my heart to Armando

388
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,320
and he might judge me.

389
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,080
Right?

390
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,680
Armando can pour out his heart to me

391
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,640
and he might be fearful that I'd use him

392
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,240
as an illustration from the pulpit,

393
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,320
which I never would do.

394
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,600
But you know there are pastors that do that kind of stuff.

395
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,880
What I'm saying is that we pour out our heart before God.

396
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,640
Man, if Armando pours out his heart to me

397
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,960
or I to him,

398
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,280
he's not going to be able to help me

399
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,760
and I can't help him the way that God

400
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,080
could help either one of us.

401
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,680
So the psalmist says,

402
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,400
pour out your heart before Him.

403
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:42,040
Notice in 1 Samuel 1.

404
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,800
It would have been easier to preach from Colossians 2

405
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,320
this morning, amen?

406
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,240
God just impressed this portion of Scripture

407
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,520
upon my heart this week.

408
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,680
I hope it helps somebody.

409
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,600
Verse 10 of 1 Samuel 1.

410
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,280
We're familiar with Hannah.

411
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:06,000
She was barren. She had no children.

412
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,600
If you understand some of the cultural implications

413
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,560
of that in this particular era,

414
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,480
it's a real heavy burden to have no children.

415
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,480
I mean, a major, major burden.

416
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,440
The Bible says in v. 10

417
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,800
that she was in bitterness of soul,

418
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,240
but look what it says,

419
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:33,000
and prayed unto the Lord and wept sore.

420
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,200
So much so that the Bible says in v. 11

421
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,480
that she vowed a vow and said,

422
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,480
O Lord of hosts,

423
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,120
if Thou wilt indeed look on the affliction

424
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,440
of Thine handmaid and remember me

425
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,120
and not forget Thine handmaid,

426
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,280
but will give unto Thine handmaid a man-child,

427
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,360
then I will give him unto the Lord

428
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,760
all the days of his life,

429
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,960
and there shall no razor come upon his head.

430
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,440
And it came to pass as she continued praying

431
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,080
before the Lord that Eli marked her mouth."

432
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,560
Eli sees she's praying here.

433
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:12,280
She's pouring out her heart before God.

434
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,320
Verse 13 says that now Hannah,

435
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,160
she spake in her heart,

436
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,480
only her lips moved,

437
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,200
but her voice was not heard.

438
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,560
Therefore, Eli thought she had been drunken.

439
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,800
He reached a wrong conclusion.

440
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,800
In v. 14, he says unto her,

441
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,119
How long wilt thou be drunken?

442
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:36,760
Put away thine wine from thee.

443
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,119
I wish he would have talked to his sons

444
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,480
the way that he talked to her.

445
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,000
That's a completely different subject matter.

446
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,400
But notice what she says in v. 15.

447
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,440
Hannah answered and said,

448
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,880
No, my Lord.

449
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,440
I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit.

450
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,640
I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink,

451
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:03,720
but have poured out my soul before the Lord.

452
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,160
You know what's amazing?

453
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,720
That v. 17 says that Eli answers her

454
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,040
and said, Go in peace.

455
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,520
The God of Israel grant thee thy petition

456
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,800
that thou hast asked of Him.

457
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,559
That's how far God is able to answer prayer.

458
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,480
He does answer prayer.

459
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,160
It's not just that He's able to answer prayer.

460
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,600
He does.

461
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,720
I've experienced in my life.

462
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,840
You've experienced in your life

463
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,200
how God answers prayer.

464
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,440
And here we find that Hannah,

465
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,160
she's pouring out her heart before the Lord,

466
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,480
and we find that in v. 20, it says,

467
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,679
Wherefore it came to pass,

468
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:41,880
when the time was come about

469
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,559
after Hannah had conceived

470
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:44,679
that she bear a son,

471
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:45,960
and called his name Samuel,

472
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,880
because I have asked him of the Lord.

473
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,720
She fulfilled her vow.

474
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,239
And I want you to just notice in v. 21,

475
00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:57,480
the Bible says that the Lord visited Hannah

476
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
so that she conceived and bare three sons

477
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,920
and two daughters.

478
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,580
The child Samuel grew before the Lord.

479
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,700
God blessed her.

480
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,420
She poured out her heart before God.

481
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:13,380
I wonder this morning, as we read Psalm 62,

482
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,460
as we have noted the experience of the psalmist,

483
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,140
but then we see how that he would encourage the people.

484
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,340
He says, listen, trust in him at all times, ye people.

485
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:28,700
Pour out your heart before him.

486
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,680
Maybe this morning, one or many of us,

487
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,680
we just need to pour out our heart before God.

488
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:41,300
I mean, just get along with God.

489
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,900
Just talk to Him about the troubles,

490
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,100
the difficulties that you're dealing with.

491
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,520
Maybe there's a trouble in your home.

492
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,220
Maybe it's a relational trouble

493
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,120
that no one else knows about,

494
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,100
but you know about it.

495
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,100
Maybe there's trouble with a spouse.

496
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,240
Maybe there's trouble with children.

497
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,900
I just don't know what to do with these kids.

498
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,880
You ever been there? Amen.

499
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,480
If I could just, and you don't fill in the blank, right?

500
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,040
Because you don't want to just whatever.

501
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,280
Lord, I need help.

502
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,280
God created your son and daughter.

503
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,060
He can give you wisdom.

504
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,280
Maybe there's some older folks

505
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,440
that maybe you've got a child that's just wayward.

506
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,500
They're just away from God.

507
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,300
That's heavy.

508
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,800
You say, man, my heart is burdened.

509
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,400
Maybe you've got a loved one that's lost.

510
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,900
You say, man, God, I just want them to be saved.

511
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,100
You know that God wants them to be saved

512
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,900
more than you want them to be saved.

513
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,300
He's not willing that any should perish,

514
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,800
but that all should come to repentance.

515
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,500
Maybe there's a problem in your job.

516
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,700
Maybe there's a financial crisis that you're facing.

517
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,500
Maybe there's a health crisis that you're dealing with.

518
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,700
I don't know, but God knows.

519
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,100
Just pour it out before Him.

520
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,600
The psalmist gives good encouragement.

521
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,300
It's an admonition really, instruction.

522
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,000
He's encouraging the people.

523
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,500
Trust God.

524
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,000
Pour out your heart before Him.

525
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,700
Notice, not only do we consider the experience

526
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,500
and the encouragement,

527
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,300
but consider the explanation from the psalmist.

528
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,700
He's going to explain really,

529
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,500
not only from his own experience why he does this,

530
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,300
why he trusts in the Lord at all times,

531
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,200
why he would pour out his heart before God,

532
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,900
but he reveals to us and gives us explanation

533
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,600
as to why we should do that as well.

534
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,400
Notice the end of verse number eight.

535
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:38,700
God is a refuge for us.

536
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,300
Selah.

537
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,500
We've noted already a couple of times in this psalm

538
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,300
that the word selah is used in verse number four,

539
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,800
and then here in verse number eight,

540
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,900
and we notice throughout the book of psalms

541
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,700
that the word selah will be used regularly.

542
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,600
We understand what it means.

543
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,100
Stop.

544
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,800
Chew on it.

545
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,400
Meditate upon it.

546
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,000
Allow it to sink into your heart and your soul.

547
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Understand the truth that God is revealing to you here.

548
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,800
Why should we trust in Him at all times?

549
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,100
Why should I pour out my heart before Him?

550
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,400
Well, number one, because He's a refuge for us.

551
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,700
I'm thankful that God was a refuge for David,

552
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,500
but God's a refuge for me and He's a refuge for you.

553
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,400
God is no respecter of persons.

554
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,600
He says that all throughout His Word.

555
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,900
And I'm so thankful that He's no respecter of persons

556
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,200
and that He, as we are His children,

557
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,400
as we have entered into a relationship

558
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,500
with the God of the universe

559
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,400
because of the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ

560
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,800
on the cross of Calvary,

561
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,800
and I'm His child,

562
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,600
and if you've been saved, you're His child.

563
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,200
God is a refuge for us.

564
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,900
A shelter.

565
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,600
Protection from danger or distress.

566
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,100
You get that imagery in your mind

567
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,300
of God being that shelter for you,

568
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,300
that refuge for you.

569
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,800
Oh, what a blessing.

570
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,000
What an encouragement for us.

571
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,700
And as we find the explanation,

572
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:08,200
as David is saying here in this passage of Scripture,

573
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,300
what he's experiencing and encouraging others

574
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,300
to follow in like suit,

575
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,300
he's saying to them,

576
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,800
listen, God is a refuge for us.

577
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,900
Don't forget that.

578
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,000
Don't neglect,

579
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,200
as you go through the trials and troubles

580
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,700
and storms of life,

581
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,900
don't forget that in the midst of that storm

582
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,600
that we have a refuge and His name is Jesus.

583
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,100
We run to Him.

584
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,300
We get help.

585
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:40,100
We get protection.

586
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,400
Not only does the psalmist share with us

587
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,600
that God is our refuge,

588
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,000
in verses 9 and 10,

589
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,400
he really tries to give us a little explanation

590
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,100
of things that we could trust in

591
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,900
and that we ought not trust in.

592
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,600
So he says,

593
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,400
trust in Him at all times in verse 8,

594
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,700
but look at verses 9 and 10.

595
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,700
Surely men of low degree are vanity

596
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,400
and men of high degree are a lie.

597
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,600
To be laid in the balance,

598
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,400
they are altogether lighter than vanity.

599
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,700
Trust not in oppression

600
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,500
and become not vain in robbery.

601
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,700
If riches increase,

602
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,000
set not your heart upon them.

603
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,700
Listen, we ought not trust in man.

604
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,600
We ought not trust in riches.

605
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
Amen?

606
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,900
And the reality is that we understand

607
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,400
that he says trust in Him at all times in verse 8,

608
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,000
and then in verses 9 and 10,

609
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,800
he really shares with us

610
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,300
and with his audience there

611
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,800
originally when it's written,

612
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,400
he helps us understand that listen,

613
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,000
it's easy sometimes for us to trust in other people.

614
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,300
It's easy for us to trust in riches.

615
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,000
We live in one of the wealthiest counties

616
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,100
in all of America.

617
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,800
It doesn't mean that we're the wealthiest

618
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,900
of all of America,

619
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,900
but we just happen to live

620
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,800
in one of the wealthiest counties

621
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,300
in all of America.

622
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,400
But you understand there's a lot of people

623
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,100
in our community that are trusting in riches.

624
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:50,900
A lot of people in our world

625
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,300
that are trusting in riches.

626
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,700
Right?

627
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,600
He says listen, don't trust in man.

628
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,400
The help of man is vain.

629
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,800
God is our refuge.

630
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,800
Don't put your trust in man.

631
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,900
Man will fail you.

632
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,000
Trust in Him.

633
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,900
Don't trust in riches.

634
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,200
You know that riches can fail.

635
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,400
They make wings.

636
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,800
They fly away.

637
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,500
That's what the Bible says.

638
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,700
We find here that He's helping us understand

639
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,700
God is our refuge.

640
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,700
Notice in verse number 11

641
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,400
as He will give some further explanation.

642
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,600
God hath spoken once,

643
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,800
twice have I heard this,

644
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,700
that power belongeth unto God.

645
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,200
Not only is He going to explain to us

646
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,300
why we should trust in Him at all times

647
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,700
and why we should pour our heart out before Him.

648
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,600
Number one, because God is our refuge.

649
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,900
Number two, because God is omnipotent.

650
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,000
Power belongeth unto God.

651
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,800
Aren't you thankful for the power of God?

652
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,000
You know it's amazing when you read

653
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
throughout the Word of God.

654
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,100
I mean, you don't get long into the first chapter

655
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,100
of the book of Genesis

656
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,400
and you read about the power of God Almighty.

657
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,300
And you read throughout the pages of Scripture

658
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,000
and you read about the ways

659
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,300
in which God Almighty has displayed His power.

660
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,000
He's demonstrated His power.

661
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Oh, it's a great joy and great benefit

662
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,900
that we have plenty of Scripture verses

663
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,000
that we can go to

664
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
to read how that God declares

665
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
that He has all power.

666
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,200
That there's nothing too difficult for Him

667
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,700
and He shares those truths with us,

668
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,900
but what a joy it is to not only know

669
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,000
that He's declared it,

670
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,500
but to know that He's proved it.

671
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,300
He's demonstrated it over and over and over.

672
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,300
You understand this morning

673
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,000
that the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

674
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
He reigns.

675
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,200
He has all power.

676
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,400
I don't know what to do.

677
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,000
I mean, this situation is too...

678
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,100
It's not too big for God.

679
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,500
It's not too hard for God

680
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,300
because nothing's too hard for God.

681
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,200
And so the psalmist says,

682
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,400
listen, God is our refuge.

683
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,000
Listen, God is omnipotent.

684
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,300
He has all power.

685
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,300
The thing that we can't seem to figure out,

686
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,500
that storm that we're enduring,

687
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,000
that storm that you might encounter,

688
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
you understand that God has power over that storm.

689
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,500
He has purpose in that storm.

690
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:30,000
We find that here we are reminded

691
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,300
of the power of God,

692
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,400
that power belongeth unto God.

693
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,300
Jesus said when He gave the Great Commission

694
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,900
as it's recorded in Matthew,

695
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,500
chapter number 28,

696
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,900
all power is given unto Me

697
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,900
in heaven and in earth.

698
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,000
Not some power,

699
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,100
not most power,

700
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:54,200
but all power is given unto Me.

701
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,700
Our God is the mighty God,

702
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,200
the all-powerful, omnipotent God.

703
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,700
We have the privilege of knowing Him

704
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,500
and serving Him and trusting Him

705
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,900
and watching Him work

706
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,600
in ways that can only be explained

707
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,400
that God did it.

708
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,600
Notice verse number 12.

709
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,500
Also unto Thee, O Lord,

710
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,100
belongeth mercy,

711
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,600
for Thou renderest to every man

712
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,600
according to his work.

713
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,400
I'm so thankful that our God is merciful.

714
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,900
Our God is merciful.

715
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,000
We read throughout the pages of Scripture

716
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,300
about the mercies of God.

717
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,400
We read as you would study

718
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,500
the Word of God,

719
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,000
and really in the book of Psalms

720
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,500
as we've mentioned already,

721
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,200
how that you have the opportunity

722
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,200
to read about the attributes of God

723
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,500
and also the transparency of the psalmist.

724
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,500
You'll find many times throughout

725
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,600
the book of Psalms that God talks about His mercy.

726
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,200
His mercy endureth forever.

727
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,200
I'm so thankful that our God is merciful.

728
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,740
It's here that in Lamentations chapter 3,

729
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:11,120
if you want to turn there,

730
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,640
it's kind of interesting if you note it

731
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,100
on our bulletin this morning,

732
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,260
those of you that are watching live stream.

733
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,880
Of course, you didn't get one.

734
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,180
But on the front it says,

735
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,440
His compassions fail not.

736
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,980
A reference to this portion of Scripture

737
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,000
in Lamentations chapter 3.

738
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,360
Lamentations right after the book of Jeremiah.

739
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,480
I always like it when those guest speakers

740
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,320
say it's after Genesis and before Revelation.

741
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,320
Very helpful for you to find the book

742
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,860
that they're referring to.

743
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:47,040
Lamentations right after the book of Jeremiah.

744
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,320
Notice what Jeremiah will say

745
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,440
in verse 21.

746
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,520
This I recall to my mind.

747
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,300
Therefore, have I hope.

748
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,680
That's kind of interesting.

749
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,000
If you're familiar with the book of Lamentations,

750
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,840
you understand that Jeremiah lamenting

751
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,460
over the destruction of Jerusalem

752
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,220
and the captivity by the Babylonians

753
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,640
of the nation of Judah.

754
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,060
You read through all of that

755
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,260
in the book of Jeremiah,

756
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,960
and you read all that takes place.

757
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,260
In fact, you read the first couple of chapters

758
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,720
of the book of Lamentations.

759
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,720
You can see the weeping and the lamenting

760
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,220
because of all of the things that have taken place,

761
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,440
but we find it in verse 21 of chapter 3

762
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,280
that he says, this I recall to my mind.

763
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,840
Therefore, have I hope.

764
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,860
Notice verse 22.

765
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,400
It is of the Lord's mercies

766
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,560
that we are not consumed

767
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,800
because His compassions fail not.

768
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,240
They are new every morning.

769
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,320
Great is thy faithfulness.

770
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,720
Aren't those some precious verses of God's Word?

771
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,200
He says, when I recall this to my mind,

772
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
I have hope.

773
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,120
I have this expectation.

774
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,360
I receive this comfort.

775
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,800
And we find this morning

776
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,880
that as David would rehearse for us

777
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,200
and he would share some of his experience

778
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,840
and then he would give some encouragement

779
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,120
that listen, when you're dealing

780
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,720
with some adversity, some trouble,

781
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,160
some storms in your life,

782
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,720
trust in Him at all times.

783
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,760
Pour out your heart before Him.

784
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,840
Why?

785
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,080
Because God is your refuge.

786
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,160
Why?

787
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,040
Because God has all power.

788
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,920
Why?

789
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,160
Because God is merciful.

790
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,760
I mean, those are three really good reasons

791
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,720
that would lead the people of God

792
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,200
to trust God

793
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,880
and to pour out my heart before Him.

794
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,520
And he gives them this explanation.

795
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,240
And I believe that as we think about

796
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,920
the explanation that he provides,

797
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,400
perhaps we could even call it evidence

798
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,800
as to why we should follow

799
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,560
in the same pattern in which David followed.

800
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,280
Why we should pour out our heart before Him.

801
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,920
This morning,

802
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,520
perhaps you're in the midst of a storm.

803
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,480
I said it in the beginning of the message.

804
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,240
I don't know who coined the phrase.

805
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,440
You're either in the middle of a storm,

806
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,640
you've come through a storm,

807
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,600
or there's a storm on the horizon.

808
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,720
And we know that in life,

809
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,040
there are storms that we encounter.

810
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,560
And it just may be that today,

811
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,960
you're in the midst of a storm.

812
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,560
I mean, maybe no one will even know it.

813
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,680
You come in to church,

814
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,440
we know how to put on,

815
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,320
kind of, you know what I mean?

816
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,840
Maybe you're dealing with something that,

817
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,920
man, maybe the people in your home

818
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,200
don't even know about it.

819
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,640
You're just carrying a burden.

820
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,200
Just struggling in the middle of a storm.

821
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,400
What do we do?

822
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,480
If we're overwhelmed by these circumstances of life,

823
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,760
if we are in the midst of a storm,

824
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,280
what do we do?

825
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,400
Trust Him at all times.

826
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,120
Know that God's way is perfect.

827
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,280
You say, well, pastor, you don't understand.

828
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,360
This thing that I'm dealing with.

829
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,360
No, no, no.

830
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,200
You don't understand God.

831
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:17,640
And I don't say that without sympathy or compassion.

832
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,560
I say that because there are some storms

833
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,560
that we deal with in life,

834
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,920
but it's not that we have to understand the storm.

835
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,840
We have to understand the God of the storm.

836
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,920
We have to understand that He has a purpose,

837
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,480
a plan.

838
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,840
He always does that which is right.

839
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,240
Always.

840
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,160
He never makes a mistake.

841
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,320
So trust Him.

842
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,320
But then can I encourage you?

843
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,920
Pour out your heart before Him.

844
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,200
I mean, honestly.

845
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,960
It'll do you well.

846
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,880
It really will.

847
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,960
To just get along with God.

848
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,240
It doesn't matter how long it takes.

849
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,800
God doesn't, aren't you thankful?

850
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,760
He's not like, Brother Michael, I'm sorry.

851
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,000
He's not like a lawyer.

852
00:44:59,000 --> 00:44:59,960
I'm sorry.

853
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,640
He doesn't start that clock.

854
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,800
You know, as soon as he picks up the phone,

855
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,320
the lawyer wants to start that little clock

856
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,320
to start billing you.

857
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,800
God doesn't put us on a timer.

858
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,120
Listen, if it takes you a few hours

859
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,560
to pour out your heart before Him,

860
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,040
it's okay.

861
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,040
It'll be good for you.

862
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,160
God knows all about it.

863
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,040
But I just believe that there's something

864
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:29,640
helpful for us as we pour out our heart before Him.

865
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,760
And just really get along with God.

866
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,120
This morning, I don't know what you're dealing with.

867
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,040
And to be real honest with you,

868
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,840
you don't know what I'm dealing with.

869
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,080
And I don't say that for anyone who gets in,

870
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,680
but I'm just saying we all deal with troubles.

871
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,000
We all have storms in life.

872
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,720
Amen?

873
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,560
What do we do?

874
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,120
How do we deal with it?

875
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,680
Psalm 61, the psalm just before

876
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,960
the psalm I preached from this morning.

877
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,200
It's interesting that you look at that particular psalm

878
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,120
and you can read some of the same things

879
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,760
that David is dealing with.

880
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,640
He says this in verse number two,

881
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,400
from the end of the earth will I cry unto thee

882
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,160
when my heart is overwhelmed.

883
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,200
Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

884
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,720
Oh man, sometimes our heart is overwhelmed.

885
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,360
He says in verse number one of that psalm,

886
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,840
I can hear my cry,

887
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,120
but he says in verse number eight,

888
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:20,160
so will I sing praise unto thy name.

889
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,040
There's actually several psalms that you can go to

890
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,840
and you can look at and you can see

891
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,240
how that really the psalmist in chapter number 13

892
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,760
is a great one as well,

893
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,080
where you go from sadness to singing.

894
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,600
In fact, in Psalm 13,

895
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,640
the psalmist is struggling in another psalm

896
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,720
that's ascribed to David,

897
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,400
and he says, how long wilt thou forget me, O Lord?

898
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,880
Forever?

899
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,240
Do you ever feel that way?

900
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,120
David felt that way.

901
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,680
I mean, he's overwhelmed,

902
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,520
but then he says, I will sing unto the Lord

903
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,320
because he hath dealt bountifully with me in verse six.

904
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,360
We just need to pour our heart before God.

905
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,040
This morning, would you let God help you?

906
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,800
He is a very present help in the time of trouble.

907
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,560
Amen, that's what the word of God says.

908
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,680
And he wants to help you, just as he helped David.

909
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,720
You've experienced this help

910
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,560
in other situations in your life.

911
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,040
In this time, in this storm, let him help you.

912
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,200
Pour out your heart before him, let's pray.

913
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,920
Father, thank you for your word.

914
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:32,560
Thank you for using your word to encourage me this week.

915
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,600
God, I believe,

916
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,800
I believe this morning that there are many amongst us

917
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,200
that are dealing with storms.

918
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,240
And God, I pray that you would help us

919
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:55,440
to follow the encouragement that we receive in your word,

920
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,000
that we would trust in you at all times,

921
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,280
and that we'd pour our heart out before you,

922
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,000
knowing that you are the Lord.

923
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,520
Knowing that you are our refuge.

924
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,120
Knowing that you are all-powerful.

925
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,760
Knowing that your mercies are new every morning,

926
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,720
that they fail not by compassions,

927
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,320
that you are a merciful God.

928
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,280
Your mercy endureth forever.

929
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,080
Thank you for the help that you offer to your people.

930
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,720
Perhaps there's one this morning

931
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,000
that's in the structure of heaven,

932
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,120
whether here or watching live stream,

933
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,960
they've never trusted Christ as their personal savior.

934
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,360
They don't have that relationship with you.

935
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,240
They're dead in their sins and their trespasses.

936
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,520
They're alienated from you, God.

937
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,360
I pray this morning they'd be saved

938
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,920
before it's eternally too late.

939
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,240
I pray that you'd help your people today.

940
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,520
Thank you for helping me.

941
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,000
I pray that you'd be glorified

942
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,400
at this time of invitation.

943
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,440
I pray that we would just let you have your way.

944
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,000
Be still in the moment.

945
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,600
Let you work.

946
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,720
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

947
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,080
Kimberly, would you please?
