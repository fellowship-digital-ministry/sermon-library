00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.599
Psalm 62 this morning, Psalm 62, I'll be looking at the entirety of the psalm.

00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:08.199
I just want to read a few verses by way of introduction, and then we'll get right into

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:09.199
the message this morning.

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:16.280
Here in Psalm 62, I'll give you a moment to turn there, and Psalm 62, I love the book

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.280
of Psalms.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.280
It's an encouraging book.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.579
It's a book in which we can go to and we can be encouraged and strengthened.

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:27.520
We learn many things about our God and about His character, His attributes that are revealed

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.520
to us through the book of Psalms.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.799
I believe that as you read and study through the book of Psalms and maybe make it a part

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:37.459
of your daily routine, that as you're reading the scriptures, you're reading other portions

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:41.680
of the scriptures, but maybe reading a portion from the book of Psalms as well, and it just

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.000
encourages you and strengthens you.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.819
We also have the unique privilege of being able to see the transparency of the psalmist,

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:54.159
and I believe that's helpful for us because we find that the psalmist, though many of

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.959
the psalms are ascribed to David, he did not write all of them.

00:00:57.959 --> 00:01:02.479
We understand that it's scripture, so it's given by inspiration of God, but we understand

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:07.760
that as David, in many of the psalms, he would pour his heart out before the Lord, and he

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.440
would reveal to us his transparency, and I believe that it helps us in our daily walk

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.319
with the Lord as well.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:19.199
And this morning, as we look at this psalm, notice in verse number one of Psalm 62, the

00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:25.279
Bible says, "'Truly, my soul waiteth upon God.

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:29.760
From Him cometh my salvation.'"

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.959
Notice this, "'He only.'"

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:38.400
Maybe that's an important word for you to underline or circle, "'He only is my rock

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.239
and my salvation.

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:42.839
He is my defense.

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:46.080
I shall not be greatly moved.'"

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:48.239
Skip down and look at verse number eight.

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:54.160
The Bible says, "'Trust in Him at all times, ye people.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.199
Pour out your heart before Him.

00:01:59.199 --> 00:02:03.199
God is a refuge for us, Selah.'"

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:08.160
I want you to notice that second phrase in verse number eight.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.080
We'll use it as our title this morning, "'Pour out your heart before Him.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.399
Pour out your heart before Him.'"

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:24.059
We do not know for sure the timing of the writing of this particular psalm.

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.000
We understand that the psalm is ascribed to David.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.679
If in your Bible you have little notations above the psalms, you'll notice that it says

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:32.880
a psalm of David.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.679
It's historically been ascribed to David as the human penman of this particular psalm.

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:45.199
We find that the timing of some of the psalms is very easy to identify and see what circumstances

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:50.039
and what have you David may be dealing with and going through at the particular moment

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:52.600
of writing the particular psalm.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.279
It's not crystal clear here in Psalm 62 as to exactly the timing in which David was writing

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:00.639
this particular psalm.

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.600
However, we believe that as you study the Scriptures and study through here, that it

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:11.080
would seem obvious or evident that the psalm was written during the time, the period if

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.000
you will, of Absalom's rebellion.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.639
You'll remember that Absalom is the son of David and that Absalom, because of some events

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.039
that had transpired and some things that had taken place, and he goes through a process

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:28.100
of really stealing the hearts of the people of God, and we find that in just a little

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.279
while after doing that and going through that process, there's a revolt that Absalom takes

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:40.600
and he's seeking to really dethrone his father and become the ruler of Israel.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.240
We find that through that event or through those events that David flees and all that

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.919
takes place, and that's not really the thought of what we're going to be dealing with this

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:55.000
morning, but we can read of those accounts and the record of that in the book of 2 Samuel

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.199
and you can see all that transpires.

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:03.119
We understand that even if that is not the particular instance in which this psalm was

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:07.600
penned, we do know that there are plenty of times in the life of David in which he

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.399
dealt with adversity, that he dealt with difficulty.

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:18.359
You'll remember early on in his life as he was, after he had been selected by God and

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.760
anointed by Samuel the prophet to be the next king of Israel, you understand that he served

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.299
under the leadership of Saul, and God had rejected Saul from being king over his people.

00:04:30.299 --> 00:04:34.779
But it was not yet time for David to become the king of Israel, and there was a period

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:38.940
of really proving and just development and all sorts of things that David was dealing

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:45.940
with, and during that time, during that season in David's life, he dealt with much opposition

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.859
and much adversity.

00:04:47.859 --> 00:04:50.140
Saul himself tried to kill David.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.260
Saul tried to employ his men to kill David.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.760
He tried to use the Philistines to kill David.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.179
He did everything he could to kill David, yet God spared his servant.

00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:05.179
We find that David was a man that was acquainted with difficulty and adversity, and David

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:11.339
was a man that learned that in the middle of a storm, in the time of adversity and difficulty,

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:16.940
that God is dependable, that God is trustworthy, that we run to God.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.779
And as we look here, of course, David was not perfect.

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:21.779
He's a human.

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:25.040
He didn't always do everything perfect.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.820
We can read of sin in the life of David as it's recorded in the Word of God.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.059
We can read in times in which he did not respond to adversity, maybe in the most appropriate

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:37.779
way, but I believe that through all of those circumstances, and even as we would learn,

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:42.380
remember, there was a time in which David went to the land of the Philistines.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.179
Did he not?

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:53.179
I think David learned through that, and as he pens the words of this psalm, as we have

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:57.859
the opportunity to see the heart of the psalmist, not only to see the heart of the psalmist

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:00.540
but the attributes of our God.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.459
I believe that this psalm will help us this morning.

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:06.540
You say, pastor, I'm not dealing with a storm.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:14.040
Just file it away, honestly, because I'm telling you that a storm will come in your life.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.220
A period of difficulty will come in your life.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.880
And we look here at this psalm, I want you to consider with me, first of all, the experience

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.619
of the psalmist.

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:28.100
Consider in the first seven verses how David is really just sharing his experience and

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.260
that which he had dealt with in his life, and the reality this morning is that many

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.019
of us have experiences.

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:39.660
We have lived life for a certain period of time, a certain number of years, and we have

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.140
certain experiences that we've dealt with in life.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:48.459
And we find that in these first seven verses that as David is really rehearsing his experiences

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:53.299
and he's dealing with some of the troubles in which he dealt with in life, he's reminding

00:06:53.299 --> 00:06:58.660
us how he trusted God, how he depended upon the Lord.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:05.820
Notice in verse number one, truly, I like the way the psalmist starts, truly my soul

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.600
waiteth upon God.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.179
Can I say this morning, that can be the hardest part of your storm.

00:07:13.179 --> 00:07:14.179
The waiting.

00:07:14.179 --> 00:07:17.299
God, what are you trying to teach me?

00:07:17.299 --> 00:07:19.260
How long is this going to last?

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.179
When is this going to end?

00:07:21.179 --> 00:07:23.140
And we're waiting on God.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:28.619
And we're waiting for God to show Himself real, what He's able to do and what His purpose

00:07:28.619 --> 00:07:31.739
is in that time.

00:07:31.739 --> 00:07:39.380
And the psalmist says, truly my soul waiteth upon God, from Him cometh my salvation.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:45.100
Now you understand in the book of Psalms that oftentimes the word salvation is used in what

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.660
we would understand as deliverance.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:53.940
Not so much always being dealt with of our soul's salvation, our redemption from the

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.660
penalty of sin, though there are times in which that's dealt with, but really as you

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:02.380
look at the psalm you'd understand that he's dealing with deliverance.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.640
The deliverance that he receives from God.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:10.899
And we understand from Him, from the Lord, from the Lord God Almighty, from Him cometh

00:08:10.899 --> 00:08:12.820
my salvation, the deliverance.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:18.100
Listen, we may not always see and understand exactly how He's delivering, but we understand

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.739
that as we look at our life and maybe as we look back at some events and some experiences

00:08:22.739 --> 00:08:31.059
that we would be able to say with the psalmist, truly my soul waiteth upon God, from Him cometh

00:08:31.059 --> 00:08:32.380
my salvation.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:38.219
Notice verse 2, He only is my rock and my salvation.

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:41.099
He is my defense.

00:08:41.099 --> 00:08:44.140
I shall not be greatly moved.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.659
What of this morning?

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:55.099
Can we say in sincerity and honest this morning in verse number 2 that God is, He only is

00:08:55.099 --> 00:09:02.460
my rock, my salvation, He is my defense?

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:07.659
Notice what he says when he understands these realities, when he's understood this experience

00:09:07.659 --> 00:09:08.659
that he's had.

00:09:08.659 --> 00:09:12.780
He says, I shall not be greatly moved.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:17.780
I believe that David through his experience and the many experiences that he had in life,

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:22.059
I believe that he had been strengthened by God.

00:09:22.059 --> 00:09:25.780
What a joy to receive the strength that God gives His children.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:30.500
See, we are weak, but He is strong.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:37.140
Paul said after he'd besought the Lord thrice that God would deliver him from that thorn,

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:40.059
that God says, my grace is sufficient for thee.

00:09:40.059 --> 00:09:43.580
You can read of that in 2 Corinthians chapter number 12, and he talks about God's strength

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.900
being made perfect in our weakness.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.539
Think about the psalmist being strengthened.

00:09:49.539 --> 00:09:53.820
See, the reality is that there are times in our lives in which we think about physical

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:54.820
strength.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.900
But you know it's important that the inner man is strengthened.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.860
Corinthians chapter number four the Bible talks about we faint not as you

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.460
read through that passage of Scripture and you deal with all of the

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.660
tribulations and distresses and trials and troubles that they dealt with that

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.780
Paul is referring to why does he say we faint not because our inner man is

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:19.420
strengthened it's renewed day by day see David was strengthened notice verse

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:24.260
number three how long will you imagine mischief against a man you shall be

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.540
slain all of you as a bowing wall shall you be in as a tottering fence you

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.460
notice the imagery that he uses with regard to those that would bring trouble

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.900
in his life at the end of verse number three he uses the the imagery of a

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:41.980
bowing wall in a tottering fence the the lack of stability the lanket lack of

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:49.940
strength the only excuse me look at verse number four they only consult to

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:57.820
cast him down from his excellency they delight in lies they bless with their

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:06.540
mouth but they curse inwardly see law you understand that the enemy is

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:12.060
relentless and ruthless and as he speaks here about some of that which is taking

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.940
place you notice in verse number four they only consult to cast him down from

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:23.300
his excellency they delight in lies the way in which we understand that truth is

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:31.300
no longer held in high esteem as it should be he says that they bless with

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:37.700
their mouth but they curse inwardly see law is what David experienced but notice

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:41.100
what he says in verse number five it's interesting how kind of he uses verses

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:46.100
one and two in verses five through seven as book ends if you will to what he says

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.020
in verses three and four with regard to some of the difficulty notice in verse

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:57.380
number five my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him you

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:01.460
know sometimes we got to have a little self-talk you don't know I'm saying

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:06.260
notice where he says in verse number six and verse number one truly my soul wait

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:13.860
if upon God and then he says in verse number five my soul wait thou only upon

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.620
God you ever want to take things in your own hands you ever want to try to

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.260
expedite the process and say let me get through this thing a little bit faster

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.700
let me help you Lord let me deal with this I can deal with this person faster

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.580
God than you seem to be dealing with this person and we can get this

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:36.020
situation resolved David has declared in verse number one that he's waiting upon

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:40.460
God but in verse number five he says my soul wait now only upon God listen we

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:46.580
need to remind ourselves to wait upon the Lord again it's not the easy thing

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:52.220
to do most of us this morning waiting is one of the things we least like about

00:12:52.220 --> 00:13:00.060
life they don't like to wait so these bells ringing anyone else hear that

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:04.900
sound like a church bell ringing amen we don't have a church bell but it's not

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.020
like a church bell was ringing listen for the trumpet amen whoo that'd be

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:16.460
exciting notice for my expectation is from him are you expecting God to work

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:24.060
honestly the psalmist says in Psalm 119 it is time for thee O Lord to walk it's

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.340
actually not with someone I teen it's a couple chapters before I can't remember

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.580
exactly what chapter right now but it's a couple chapters before but he says

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:35.780
it's time Lord for thee to work and let me actually read the verse I think it is

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:40.020
some night 119 and the Lord just brought on my mind let me see if I can find it

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.020
here look at verse number 126 you don't have to look there but just jot it down

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:50.940
Psalm 119 126 it is time for the Lord to work for they have made void thy law

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:57.580
are you expecting God to work he says my expectation is from him what are you

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:02.420
expecting God to do you understand this morning that as we pray we pray to a God

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:07.300
who's able to exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:12.780
what we find in Ephesians 3 in verse number 20 he says to Jeremiah call unto

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:17.100
me and I will answer thee and show thee great mighty things which thou knowest

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:23.420
not the psalmist says as he would just reveal to us the experience that he's

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:30.380
had in life he says listen my expectation is from him by the way I

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:35.900
like it when God works I like it when God works in such a distinct way that

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:40.620
you cannot confuse it with the work of man that you cannot come to a place

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:44.100
where you'd say oh well that's how they figured this out and that's how they did

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:49.060
that in fact in Psalm 109 in verse number 26 the psalmist cries out and

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:54.700
says help me O Lord my God Oh save me according to thy mercy that they may

00:14:54.700 --> 00:15:03.260
know that this is thy hand that thou Lord has done it oh man I love to see

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:11.460
God work are you expecting God to work in your life my expectation it's from

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:19.060
him notice verse 6 he says again what we read in verse number 2 he only is my

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:30.740
rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be moved verse 7 in God is my

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:38.500
salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God we

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.500
consider the experience of the psalmist we find not only was he strengthened I

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.340
believe that he was delivered you know that David experienced deliverance in

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.380
his life on a number of occasions we can read not only as we think about the

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.700
context perhaps of the writing of this particular psalm with the revolt of

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:58.940
Absalom but if you think over that's near the end of David's life if you look

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.100
over the entirety of David's life and you think about the way in which God

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:07.140
delivered him from the hand of the enemy the way that God miraculously delivered

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:13.660
him out of the the evil intent of Saul the way that God delivered him from the

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:19.540
Philistines I mean over and over you see that David experienced deliverance and

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:24.420
in 1st Samuel 17 when he goes to fight against Goliath what does he say he

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:30.060
says listen this is what the God that created all things the God of Israel he

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:35.660
is going to give victory he is going to give thy servant victory and you

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:40.540
understand that he David had experienced the deliverance of God Almighty I

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:44.820
believe that the psalmist as he would rehearse and recount his experience that

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.740
not only was he strengthened and delivered I believe that he was

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:52.620
encouraged you know it's encouraging when you see God work it's encouraging

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:58.580
when you're aware of what God is doing in your life and how God is is working

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:02.700
and moving it's encouraging to know that we serve a God who makes no mistakes

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.900
that we serve a God who is perfect and that we serve a God who has a plan and

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:12.460
it's a perfect plan it's a plan in which you and I will be developed as a plan

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:20.260
in which he will be glorified what a joy what a blessing I believe David was

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:29.860
helped we need to be helped you know the psalmist cries out help Lord I mean

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:34.220
you just see the transparency of the psalmist and you find that as we would

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:38.900
consider the experience of the psalmist that perhaps we can relate to some of

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.580
that which he dealt with I mean not to the same extreme in which David dealt

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:46.620
with but we can we can relate to troubles and trials and we can relate to

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:51.700
storms in our lives and we consider the experience of the psalmist but then

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:56.180
number two we consider the encouragement from the psalmist you know it's

00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:00.860
interesting when when when the psalmist has an experience when he rehearses

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:05.140
these experiences that he has he now is in a unique position to offer

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:12.300
encouragement to other people you know God will use us he'll allow us to

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:17.580
experience some things and then use us to help others that we come in contact

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:22.820
with 2nd Corinthians chapter number one the Apostle Paul is speaking to these

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:26.900
believers in in Corinth and of course it's the second letter that he writes

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.900
to them but in verse number three of 2nd Corinthians chapter number one we find

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:36.180
that Paul is going to give some some really unique truth that is helpful for

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:40.380
us as the people of God in verse number three says blessed be God even the

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:44.660
father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies and the God of all

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:48.740
comfort aren't you thankful that he's the God of all comfort it says in verse

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:58.300
number four who comforted us in all our tribulation that we may be able to

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:05.380
comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:11.380
comforted of God you know God will allow us to experience some things in

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:16.300
life and then as the psalmist here in Psalm 62 experience some things and

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.300
rehearses that now he's going to give some encouragement notice what he's

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:25.540
going to encourage in verse number eight he says trust in him all at all times

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:30.700
notices ye people so now he's not really dealing with his own experience he's now

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:35.700
giving this word of encouragement this word of admonition if you will to those

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:39.340
that would be the recipients those that would read the psalm those throughout

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:43.980
the centuries including us this morning that have preserved in the perfect Word

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:49.900
of God this psalm that we can go to and we can be helped in David as he would

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:58.180
encourage the people he says number one trust in him at all times we believe

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:01.020
that every word of God

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:02.620
God is pure.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.480
Amen?

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.000
He could have just said, trust in Him.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.140
But I like the fact that he says,

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.240
at all times.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.640
At all times.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.140
Because the reality is that there are

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.240
some times in our lives

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.040
where the difficulty can almost become

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.140
so overpowering,

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.640
so difficult what we're dealing with in life,

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.720
that we find that this truth

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.620
in the very words of Scripture

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:36.060
would remind us that at all times,

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.100
in every circumstance,

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.700
in every situation that you face in life,

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:46.180
trust in Him.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.620
You know, our God is trustworthy.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.160
He is faithful.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.260
He is dependable.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:55.420
We think about the faithfulness of our God

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.660
when we think about the way

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.460
in which He has proven His character

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.840
and His attributes over and over.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.540
Our God wants us to trust Him.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.680
He wants us to exercise faith.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.220
He that cometh to God must believe that He is.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.820
It says there right before that,

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.560
without faith it is impossible to please Him.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.260
For he that cometh to God must believe that He is

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:22.180
and a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:28.820
God asks Moses in the book of Numbers

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.620
after the spies go out

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.580
and they come back with that evil report

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.880
in Numbers 14,

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.080
God says to Moses,

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.800
how long will it be ere My people believe Me?

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.400
That they'll trust Me?

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.440
And you think about the way in which God

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.380
had proven Himself to that particular generation.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.460
The mighty works that they saw

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:51.780
in the land of Egypt

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.880
and the mighty hand of God

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.740
in delivering His people from Egyptian bondage.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.940
The miraculous deliverance across the Red Sea

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.240
and just the provision,

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.580
the manna and the water.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.120
I mean, what amazing things

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.140
these people have experienced.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.440
But when those ten spies say,

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.900
hey listen, the people that dwell in this land,

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.140
they're giants and the cities are fortified

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.300
and they have walls.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.620
Well, we're not able to do it.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.800
We begin to doubt.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.320
God says how long will it be ere My people believe Me?

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.840
David here, as he would encourage the people,

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.000
and he says here,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.480
trust in Him at all times.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.560
You know, we are familiar with the truth

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.800
of Proverbs 3, verses 5 and 6

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.640
where the Bible says in that passage of Scripture,

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.920
trust in the Lord, how?

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.180
With all thine heart.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.420
And it says lean not unto thine own understanding.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.780
I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand,

00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:59.020
but I would believe this morning

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.660
that if you would be honest,

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:01.860
leaning on our own understanding

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.580
is a challenge that we deal with.

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.900
We lean on our own understanding.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.820
We try to analyze and figure things out

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.260
and we begin to lean on our own understanding

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.460
and so that's why we find in Proverbs,

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.960
trust in the Lord with all thine heart.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:22.360
David says trust in Him at all times.

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.760
The good times.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.960
The bad times.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.840
See, life has a way of just kind of changing

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.880
and various things that happen

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.200
and circumstances that come our ways.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.040
But who are we trusting?

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.720
Who are we trusting?

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.520
David says trust Him at all times.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.720
Notice the encouragement,

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.360
not only trust in Him at all times,

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.360
but notice v. 8.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:50.080
We've used it as our title this morning.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:56.360
Pour out your heart before Him.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.280
In your sanctified imagination,

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.440
in your mind's eye,

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.480
what do you see when you read those words?

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:09.180
Pour out your heart before Him.

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:10.680
I mean, you know,

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:15.080
God invites us to cast our burden upon Him.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.280
God invites us to cast our care upon Him.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.120
You look at Psalm 55 and v. 22.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.440
You look at 1 Peter 5 and v. 7.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.600
There's a reference in the Old and New Testament

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.200
about casting our burden,

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.400
casting our cares upon the Lord

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.440
knowing that He'll sustain us,

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.360
knowing that He cares for us.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.440
And in my mind's eye when I read

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.880
pour out your heart before Him,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.720
I see somebody that is just weeping

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.280
and pouring out their heart before God Almighty.

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.360
I mean, do you ever feel that way in life?

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.280
Do you ever feel like you just want to pour your heart out?

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.640
Sometimes we pour it out to the wrong people.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.720
Sometimes we pick up the phone

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.680
and pour out our heart to a neighbor,

00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.760
a family member, maybe to our spouse.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.320
But I wonder this morning,

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:07.400
have we poured out our heart to God Almighty?

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.560
I mean, really just get into the quietness of our time.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.000
Listen, God knows anyway.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.720
But He wants us to verbalize it.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.960
He wants us to come to Him

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.600
and to pour out our heart before Him.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:27.440
See, God knows if you're struggling.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.840
He knows if you're confused.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.520
He knows if you just don't seem to

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.120
understand what He's doing.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.320
He knows our frame.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.200
He knows that we're but dust.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.840
He says, pour out your heart.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.880
Man, there are times that you can get alone with God.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:50.400
Just pour out your heart.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:55.000
And know that He loves you.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.120
See, I can pour out my heart to Armando

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:01.320
and he might judge me.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.080
Right?

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.680
Armando can pour out his heart to me

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.640
and he might be fearful that I'd use him

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.240
as an illustration from the pulpit,

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.320
which I never would do.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.600
But you know there are pastors that do that kind of stuff.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.880
What I'm saying is that we pour out our heart before God.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.640
Man, if Armando pours out his heart to me

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.960
or I to him,

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.280
he's not going to be able to help me

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.760
and I can't help him the way that God

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:29.080
could help either one of us.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.680
So the psalmist says,

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:35.400
pour out your heart before Him.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:42.040
Notice in 1 Samuel 1.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.800
It would have been easier to preach from Colossians 2

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.320
this morning, amen?

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.240
God just impressed this portion of Scripture

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.520
upon my heart this week.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.680
I hope it helps somebody.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.600
Verse 10 of 1 Samuel 1.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.280
We're familiar with Hannah.

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:06.000
She was barren. She had no children.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.600
If you understand some of the cultural implications

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.560
of that in this particular era,

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:15.480
it's a real heavy burden to have no children.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:19.480
I mean, a major, major burden.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.440
The Bible says in v. 10

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.800
that she was in bitterness of soul,

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.240
but look what it says,

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:33.000
and prayed unto the Lord and wept sore.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.200
So much so that the Bible says in v. 11

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.480
that she vowed a vow and said,

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.480
O Lord of hosts,

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.120
if Thou wilt indeed look on the affliction

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.440
of Thine handmaid and remember me

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.120
and not forget Thine handmaid,

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:50.280
but will give unto Thine handmaid a man-child,

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.360
then I will give him unto the Lord

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.760
all the days of his life,

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.960
and there shall no razor come upon his head.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.440
And it came to pass as she continued praying

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.080
before the Lord that Eli marked her mouth."

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.560
Eli sees she's praying here.

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:12.280
She's pouring out her heart before God.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.320
Verse 13 says that now Hannah,

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.160
she spake in her heart,

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.480
only her lips moved,

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.200
but her voice was not heard.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:25.560
Therefore, Eli thought she had been drunken.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:29.800
He reached a wrong conclusion.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.800
In v. 14, he says unto her,

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.119
How long wilt thou be drunken?

00:28:34.119 --> 00:28:36.760
Put away thine wine from thee.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.119
I wish he would have talked to his sons

00:28:38.119 --> 00:28:39.480
the way that he talked to her.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:43.000
That's a completely different subject matter.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.400
But notice what she says in v. 15.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.440
Hannah answered and said,

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.880
No, my Lord.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.440
I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.640
I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink,

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:03.720
but have poured out my soul before the Lord.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.160
You know what's amazing?

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.720
That v. 17 says that Eli answers her

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.040
and said, Go in peace.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.520
The God of Israel grant thee thy petition

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.800
that thou hast asked of Him.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.559
That's how far God is able to answer prayer.

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:23.480
He does answer prayer.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.160
It's not just that He's able to answer prayer.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.600
He does.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.720
I've experienced in my life.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.840
You've experienced in your life

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:32.200
how God answers prayer.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.440
And here we find that Hannah,

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.160
she's pouring out her heart before the Lord,

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.480
and we find that in v. 20, it says,

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.679
Wherefore it came to pass,

00:29:40.679 --> 00:29:41.880
when the time was come about

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.559
after Hannah had conceived

00:29:43.559 --> 00:29:44.679
that she bear a son,

00:29:44.679 --> 00:29:45.960
and called his name Samuel,

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.880
because I have asked him of the Lord.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.720
She fulfilled her vow.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.239
And I want you to just notice in v. 21,

00:29:55.239 --> 00:29:57.480
the Bible says that the Lord visited Hannah

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.480
so that she conceived and bare three sons

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.920
and two daughters.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.580
The child Samuel grew before the Lord.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.700
God blessed her.

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.420
She poured out her heart before God.

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:13.380
I wonder this morning, as we read Psalm 62,

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:16.460
as we have noted the experience of the psalmist,

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.140
but then we see how that he would encourage the people.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:23.340
He says, listen, trust in him at all times, ye people.

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:28.700
Pour out your heart before him.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:33.680
Maybe this morning, one or many of us,

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.680
we just need to pour out our heart before God.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:41.300
I mean, just get along with God.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.900
Just talk to Him about the troubles,

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.100
the difficulties that you're dealing with.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.520
Maybe there's a trouble in your home.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.220
Maybe it's a relational trouble

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.120
that no one else knows about,

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.100
but you know about it.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.100
Maybe there's trouble with a spouse.

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.240
Maybe there's trouble with children.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.900
I just don't know what to do with these kids.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.880
You ever been there? Amen.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.480
If I could just, and you don't fill in the blank, right?

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.040
Because you don't want to just whatever.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:11.280
Lord, I need help.

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.280
God created your son and daughter.

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:17.060
He can give you wisdom.

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:18.280
Maybe there's some older folks

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.440
that maybe you've got a child that's just wayward.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:25.500
They're just away from God.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.300
That's heavy.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.800
You say, man, my heart is burdened.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.400
Maybe you've got a loved one that's lost.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.900
You say, man, God, I just want them to be saved.

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:38.100
You know that God wants them to be saved

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.900
more than you want them to be saved.

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:41.300
He's not willing that any should perish,

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.800
but that all should come to repentance.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.500
Maybe there's a problem in your job.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.700
Maybe there's a financial crisis that you're facing.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.500
Maybe there's a health crisis that you're dealing with.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.700
I don't know, but God knows.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.100
Just pour it out before Him.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.600
The psalmist gives good encouragement.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.300
It's an admonition really, instruction.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.000
He's encouraging the people.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.500
Trust God.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.000
Pour out your heart before Him.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.700
Notice, not only do we consider the experience

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:12.500
and the encouragement,

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.300
but consider the explanation from the psalmist.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.700
He's going to explain really,

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.500
not only from his own experience why he does this,

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.300
why he trusts in the Lord at all times,

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.200
why he would pour out his heart before God,

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.900
but he reveals to us and gives us explanation

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.600
as to why we should do that as well.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.400
Notice the end of verse number eight.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:38.700
God is a refuge for us.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.300
Selah.

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.500
We've noted already a couple of times in this psalm

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.300
that the word selah is used in verse number four,

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.800
and then here in verse number eight,

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.900
and we notice throughout the book of psalms

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.700
that the word selah will be used regularly.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.600
We understand what it means.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.100
Stop.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:55.800
Chew on it.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.400
Meditate upon it.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:01.000
Allow it to sink into your heart and your soul.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Understand the truth that God is revealing to you here.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.800
Why should we trust in Him at all times?

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.100
Why should I pour out my heart before Him?

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:14.400
Well, number one, because He's a refuge for us.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.700
I'm thankful that God was a refuge for David,

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.500
but God's a refuge for me and He's a refuge for you.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.400
God is no respecter of persons.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.600
He says that all throughout His Word.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.900
And I'm so thankful that He's no respecter of persons

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.200
and that He, as we are His children,

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.400
as we have entered into a relationship

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.500
with the God of the universe

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:38.400
because of the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.800
on the cross of Calvary,

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.800
and I'm His child,

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.600
and if you've been saved, you're His child.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:45.200
God is a refuge for us.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.900
A shelter.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.600
Protection from danger or distress.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.100
You get that imagery in your mind

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.300
of God being that shelter for you,

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.300
that refuge for you.

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.800
Oh, what a blessing.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.000
What an encouragement for us.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.700
And as we find the explanation,

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:08.200
as David is saying here in this passage of Scripture,

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.300
what he's experiencing and encouraging others

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.300
to follow in like suit,

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.300
he's saying to them,

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:17.800
listen, God is a refuge for us.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.900
Don't forget that.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.000
Don't neglect,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.200
as you go through the trials and troubles

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.700
and storms of life,

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.900
don't forget that in the midst of that storm

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:32.600
that we have a refuge and His name is Jesus.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.100
We run to Him.

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:35.300
We get help.

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:40.100
We get protection.

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:42.400
Not only does the psalmist share with us

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.600
that God is our refuge,

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.000
in verses 9 and 10,

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.400
he really tries to give us a little explanation

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.100
of things that we could trust in

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.900
and that we ought not trust in.

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:51.600
So he says,

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.400
trust in Him at all times in verse 8,

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.700
but look at verses 9 and 10.

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:56.700
Surely men of low degree are vanity

00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.400
and men of high degree are a lie.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.600
To be laid in the balance,

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.400
they are altogether lighter than vanity.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.700
Trust not in oppression

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.500
and become not vain in robbery.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:05.700
If riches increase,

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:08.000
set not your heart upon them.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.700
Listen, we ought not trust in man.

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.600
We ought not trust in riches.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.600
Amen?

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.900
And the reality is that we understand

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.400
that he says trust in Him at all times in verse 8,

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.000
and then in verses 9 and 10,

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.800
he really shares with us

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.300
and with his audience there

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:25.800
originally when it's written,

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.400
he helps us understand that listen,

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:32.000
it's easy sometimes for us to trust in other people.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.300
It's easy for us to trust in riches.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.000
We live in one of the wealthiest counties

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.100
in all of America.

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:40.800
It doesn't mean that we're the wealthiest

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.900
of all of America,

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:42.900
but we just happen to live

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.800
in one of the wealthiest counties

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.300
in all of America.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:47.400
But you understand there's a lot of people

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.100
in our community that are trusting in riches.

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:50.900
A lot of people in our world

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:53.300
that are trusting in riches.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.700
Right?

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.600
He says listen, don't trust in man.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:03.400
The help of man is vain.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.800
God is our refuge.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.800
Don't put your trust in man.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.900
Man will fail you.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.000
Trust in Him.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:11.900
Don't trust in riches.

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.200
You know that riches can fail.

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.400
They make wings.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:16.800
They fly away.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.500
That's what the Bible says.

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:23.700
We find here that He's helping us understand

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:24.700
God is our refuge.

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:25.700
Notice in verse number 11

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:29.400
as He will give some further explanation.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.600
God hath spoken once,

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.800
twice have I heard this,

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:36.700
that power belongeth unto God.

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:40.200
Not only is He going to explain to us

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.300
why we should trust in Him at all times

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.700
and why we should pour our heart out before Him.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:47.600
Number one, because God is our refuge.

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.900
Number two, because God is omnipotent.

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:53.000
Power belongeth unto God.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.800
Aren't you thankful for the power of God?

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.000
You know it's amazing when you read

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
throughout the Word of God.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.100
I mean, you don't get long into the first chapter

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.100
of the book of Genesis

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.400
and you read about the power of God Almighty.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.300
And you read throughout the pages of Scripture

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.000
and you read about the ways

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.300
in which God Almighty has displayed His power.

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:17.000
He's demonstrated His power.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Oh, it's a great joy and great benefit

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.900
that we have plenty of Scripture verses

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:22.000
that we can go to

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
to read how that God declares

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
that He has all power.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.200
That there's nothing too difficult for Him

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.700
and He shares those truths with us,

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.900
but what a joy it is to not only know

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:34.000
that He's declared it,

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.500
but to know that He's proved it.

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:39.300
He's demonstrated it over and over and over.

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:41.300
You understand this morning

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:45.000
that the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
He reigns.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.200
He has all power.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.400
I don't know what to do.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.000
I mean, this situation is too...

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.100
It's not too big for God.

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:56.500
It's not too hard for God

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.300
because nothing's too hard for God.

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.200
And so the psalmist says,

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:05.400
listen, God is our refuge.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.000
Listen, God is omnipotent.

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:11.300
He has all power.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.300
The thing that we can't seem to figure out,

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.500
that storm that we're enduring,

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:19.000
that storm that you might encounter,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000
you understand that God has power over that storm.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.500
He has purpose in that storm.

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:30.000
We find that here we are reminded

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.300
of the power of God,

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:34.400
that power belongeth unto God.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.300
Jesus said when He gave the Great Commission

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:37.900
as it's recorded in Matthew,

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.500
chapter number 28,

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.900
all power is given unto Me

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:44.900
in heaven and in earth.

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:48.000
Not some power,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.100
not most power,

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:54.200
but all power is given unto Me.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.700
Our God is the mighty God,

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:01.200
the all-powerful, omnipotent God.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.700
We have the privilege of knowing Him

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.500
and serving Him and trusting Him

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.900
and watching Him work

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:11.600
in ways that can only be explained

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.400
that God did it.

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.600
Notice verse number 12.

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.500
Also unto Thee, O Lord,

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.100
belongeth mercy,

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:23.600
for Thou renderest to every man

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:26.600
according to his work.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:30.400
I'm so thankful that our God is merciful.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.900
Our God is merciful.

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.000
We read throughout the pages of Scripture

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.300
about the mercies of God.

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:39.400
We read as you would study

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.500
the Word of God,

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.000
and really in the book of Psalms

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.500
as we've mentioned already,

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.200
how that you have the opportunity

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.200
to read about the attributes of God

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.500
and also the transparency of the psalmist.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.500
You'll find many times throughout

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.600
the book of Psalms that God talks about His mercy.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:59.200
His mercy endureth forever.

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.200
I'm so thankful that our God is merciful.

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:05.740
It's here that in Lamentations chapter 3,

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:11.120
if you want to turn there,

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.640
it's kind of interesting if you note it

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.100
on our bulletin this morning,

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.260
those of you that are watching live stream.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.880
Of course, you didn't get one.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.180
But on the front it says,

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:23.440
His compassions fail not.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.980
A reference to this portion of Scripture

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:29.000
in Lamentations chapter 3.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.360
Lamentations right after the book of Jeremiah.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.480
I always like it when those guest speakers

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.320
say it's after Genesis and before Revelation.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.320
Very helpful for you to find the book

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.860
that they're referring to.

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:47.040
Lamentations right after the book of Jeremiah.

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:51.320
Notice what Jeremiah will say

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.440
in verse 21.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:57.520
This I recall to my mind.

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.300
Therefore, have I hope.

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.680
That's kind of interesting.

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:04.000
If you're familiar with the book of Lamentations,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.840
you understand that Jeremiah lamenting

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.460
over the destruction of Jerusalem

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.220
and the captivity by the Babylonians

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:10.640
of the nation of Judah.

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.060
You read through all of that

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:13.260
in the book of Jeremiah,

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.960
and you read all that takes place.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.260
In fact, you read the first couple of chapters

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.720
of the book of Lamentations.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.720
You can see the weeping and the lamenting

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.220
because of all of the things that have taken place,

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.440
but we find it in verse 21 of chapter 3

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:29.280
that he says, this I recall to my mind.

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.840
Therefore, have I hope.

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:34.860
Notice verse 22.

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:38.400
It is of the Lord's mercies

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.560
that we are not consumed

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:44.800
because His compassions fail not.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.240
They are new every morning.

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:52.320
Great is thy faithfulness.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.720
Aren't those some precious verses of God's Word?

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.200
He says, when I recall this to my mind,

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.200
I have hope.

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.120
I have this expectation.

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.360
I receive this comfort.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.800
And we find this morning

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.880
that as David would rehearse for us

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:12.200
and he would share some of his experience

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.840
and then he would give some encouragement

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:16.120
that listen, when you're dealing

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.720
with some adversity, some trouble,

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.160
some storms in your life,

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.720
trust in Him at all times.

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.760
Pour out your heart before Him.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:24.840
Why?

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.080
Because God is your refuge.

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.160
Why?

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.040
Because God has all power.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:30.920
Why?

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.160
Because God is merciful.

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:36.760
I mean, those are three really good reasons

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:38.720
that would lead the people of God

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.200
to trust God

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.880
and to pour out my heart before Him.

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:48.520
And he gives them this explanation.

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:51.240
And I believe that as we think about

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:52.920
the explanation that he provides,

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.400
perhaps we could even call it evidence

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.800
as to why we should follow

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.560
in the same pattern in which David followed.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:05.280
Why we should pour out our heart before Him.

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:06.920
This morning,

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:10.520
perhaps you're in the midst of a storm.

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.480
I said it in the beginning of the message.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:16.240
I don't know who coined the phrase.

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.440
You're either in the middle of a storm,

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.640
you've come through a storm,

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:22.600
or there's a storm on the horizon.

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.720
And we know that in life,

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:28.040
there are storms that we encounter.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.560
And it just may be that today,

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.960
you're in the midst of a storm.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.560
I mean, maybe no one will even know it.

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:35.680
You come in to church,

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.440
we know how to put on,

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.320
kind of, you know what I mean?

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:42.840
Maybe you're dealing with something that,

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:43.920
man, maybe the people in your home

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.200
don't even know about it.

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.640
You're just carrying a burden.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:51.200
Just struggling in the middle of a storm.

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:53.400
What do we do?

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.480
If we're overwhelmed by these circumstances of life,

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:56.760
if we are in the midst of a storm,

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.280
what do we do?

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:01.400
Trust Him at all times.

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.120
Know that God's way is perfect.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.280
You say, well, pastor, you don't understand.

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.360
This thing that I'm dealing with.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:09.360
No, no, no.

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.200
You don't understand God.

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:17.640
And I don't say that without sympathy or compassion.

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:20.560
I say that because there are some storms

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.560
that we deal with in life,

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.920
but it's not that we have to understand the storm.

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:27.840
We have to understand the God of the storm.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.920
We have to understand that He has a purpose,

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.480
a plan.

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.840
He always does that which is right.

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.240
Always.

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:38.160
He never makes a mistake.

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.320
So trust Him.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.320
But then can I encourage you?

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.920
Pour out your heart before Him.

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:47.200
I mean, honestly.

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.960
It'll do you well.

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.880
It really will.

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:52.960
To just get along with God.

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:54.240
It doesn't matter how long it takes.

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.800
God doesn't, aren't you thankful?

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.760
He's not like, Brother Michael, I'm sorry.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.000
He's not like a lawyer.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:44:59.960
I'm sorry.

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.640
He doesn't start that clock.

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:02.800
You know, as soon as he picks up the phone,

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.320
the lawyer wants to start that little clock

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:07.320
to start billing you.

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.800
God doesn't put us on a timer.

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.120
Listen, if it takes you a few hours

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:14.560
to pour out your heart before Him,

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.040
it's okay.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:18.040
It'll be good for you.

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.160
God knows all about it.

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:24.040
But I just believe that there's something

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:29.640
helpful for us as we pour out our heart before Him.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:31.760
And just really get along with God.

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:35.120
This morning, I don't know what you're dealing with.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.040
And to be real honest with you,

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:37.840
you don't know what I'm dealing with.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.080
And I don't say that for anyone who gets in,

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:40.680
but I'm just saying we all deal with troubles.

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.000
We all have storms in life.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.720
Amen?

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.560
What do we do?

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.120
How do we deal with it?

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.680
Psalm 61, the psalm just before

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.960
the psalm I preached from this morning.

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:55.200
It's interesting that you look at that particular psalm

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.120
and you can read some of the same things

00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.760
that David is dealing with.

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.640
He says this in verse number two,

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.400
from the end of the earth will I cry unto thee

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:06.160
when my heart is overwhelmed.

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:09.200
Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:12.720
Oh man, sometimes our heart is overwhelmed.

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:14.360
He says in verse number one of that psalm,

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.840
I can hear my cry,

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.120
but he says in verse number eight,

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:20.160
so will I sing praise unto thy name.

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.040
There's actually several psalms that you can go to

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.840
and you can look at and you can see

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:26.240
how that really the psalmist in chapter number 13

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.760
is a great one as well,

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:32.080
where you go from sadness to singing.

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:33.600
In fact, in Psalm 13,

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:36.640
the psalmist is struggling in another psalm

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:37.720
that's ascribed to David,

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:41.400
and he says, how long wilt thou forget me, O Lord?

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.880
Forever?

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.240
Do you ever feel that way?

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.120
David felt that way.

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.680
I mean, he's overwhelmed,

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.520
but then he says, I will sing unto the Lord

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.320
because he hath dealt bountifully with me in verse six.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:58.360
We just need to pour our heart before God.

00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:01.040
This morning, would you let God help you?

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:04.800
He is a very present help in the time of trouble.

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.560
Amen, that's what the word of God says.

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:10.680
And he wants to help you, just as he helped David.

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:12.720
You've experienced this help

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.560
in other situations in your life.

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:20.040
In this time, in this storm, let him help you.

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.200
Pour out your heart before him, let's pray.

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:25.920
Father, thank you for your word.

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:32.560
Thank you for using your word to encourage me this week.

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:36.600
God, I believe,

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:40.800
I believe this morning that there are many amongst us

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.200
that are dealing with storms.

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:51.240
And God, I pray that you would help us

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:55.440
to follow the encouragement that we receive in your word,

00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:00.000
that we would trust in you at all times,

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.280
and that we'd pour our heart out before you,

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.000
knowing that you are the Lord.

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:09.520
Knowing that you are our refuge.

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:14.120
Knowing that you are all-powerful.

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:19.760
Knowing that your mercies are new every morning,

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:22.720
that they fail not by compassions,

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:25.320
that you are a merciful God.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.280
Your mercy endureth forever.

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:33.080
Thank you for the help that you offer to your people.

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.720
Perhaps there's one this morning

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.000
that's in the structure of heaven,

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.120
whether here or watching live stream,

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.960
they've never trusted Christ as their personal savior.

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:46.360
They don't have that relationship with you.

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.240
They're dead in their sins and their trespasses.

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:53.520
They're alienated from you, God.

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.360
I pray this morning they'd be saved

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.920
before it's eternally too late.

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.240
I pray that you'd help your people today.

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.520
Thank you for helping me.

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.000
I pray that you'd be glorified

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.400
at this time of invitation.

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:09.440
I pray that we would just let you have your way.

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:11.000
Be still in the moment.

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:13.600
Let you work.

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.720
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.080
Kimberly, would you please?
