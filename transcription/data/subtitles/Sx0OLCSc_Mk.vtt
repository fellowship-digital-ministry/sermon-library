WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.119
Exodus chapter number 31, Exodus chapter number 31, and I'll be looking specifically for our

00:00:07.119 --> 00:00:14.279
text verses this evening at Exodus 31, verses 1 through 11, but we will go through many

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:19.879
pages of Scripture here in the book of Exodus, and I trust it'll be a blessing to you near

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:20.879
the end of the message.

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:26.079
We will go over to the New Testament, make some application for us as New Testament believers

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:27.079
today.

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:32.240
If I were to title the message this evening, I would simply entitle it this, Engaged in

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.680
the Work, Engaged in the Work.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.560
We understand that prior to Exodus chapter number 31, in fact, we will not take time,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.520
but if you went back to the 25th chapter of the book of Exodus and read through the 30th

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.200
chapter of the book of Exodus, that you will have the opportunity to read about the detailed

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:58.200
instruction that God gave to Moses with regard to the construction of the tabernacle.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.120
The detail that is contained in those chapters of Scripture is phenomenal.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.040
Every little detail, every minute detail is planned out and given specifically to Moses

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:18.080
with regard to not only the size of the pieces of furniture, but the very substance that

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.959
was to be used for each of those pieces of furniture.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.279
I mean, just great detail is provided in these chapters of Scripture, and we find that the

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:35.160
detail that is provided reminds us that our God is a God of order, that our God is a God

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:42.000
of details, and what a blessing to see as you study those chapters of Scripture the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
detail that God provides.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.639
It's very specific, very specific instruction, and then we come to this passage that we'll

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:53.160
use as our text passage this evening.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.760
And as we look at this passage of Scripture, we discover that not only did God give instruction

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:07.199
to Moses with regard to the construction of the tabernacle, but we find that God provided

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:12.360
the workers and He equipped the workers for this great work.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.160
The Bible says in verse number 1 of Exodus 31,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.960
And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:28.800
See, I have called by name Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur of the tribe of Judah,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:36.679
and I have filled him with the Spirit of God in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:44.759
and in all manner of workmanship, to devise cunning works, to work in gold and in silver

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:52.520
and in brass, and in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.199
in all manner of workmanship.

00:02:55.199 --> 00:03:02.460
And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahissamach of the tribe of Dan,

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.500
and in the hearts of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.860
that I have commanded thee, the tabernacle of the congregation, the ark of the testimony

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.580
and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle, and the

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:27.259
table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:32.419
and the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot,

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:36.339
and the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:42.339
his sons to minister in the priest's office, and the anointing oil and the sweet incense

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:44.339
for the holy place.

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:51.460
Notice this, according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:57.839
I believe that when Moses received this word from the Lord, that Moses was greatly encouraged.

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:02.020
No doubt as he received the instruction in these previous chapters with regard to all

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:09.179
of the detail, the materials that were to be used for each piece of furniture, the specific

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:13.699
dimensions and all of the detail, no doubt it could be overwhelming for an individual

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:15.660
to receive all of that information.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.980
How am I going to be able to do all of this work?

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:27.140
And we find that God now comes to Moses, and here in Exodus 31, and he says, I have provided

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.380
the workers as well.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.339
I have equipped them, and I've provided them, and it says here, according to all that I

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:38.339
have commanded thee shall they do.

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:43.220
Again, I've used the title for our message this evening, engaged in the work.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.779
And I want you to notice, first of all, from this passage of Scripture, that these individuals

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:50.140
were equipped for the work.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.380
They were equipped for the work.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.820
I want you to understand that there are two individuals that are named by name.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:03.299
The Bible says in verse number two, see, I have called by name, Bezalel.

00:05:03.299 --> 00:05:09.260
We find that it also tells us in verse number six, and I behold, I have given with him a

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.619
holy ab.

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:16.420
And so these two individuals in verse two and verse number six, Bezalel and a holy ab,

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.179
they are mentioned by name.

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:26.059
And these men, the Bible tells us, would be equipped for the work that God had given Moses

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:27.380
to complete.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:33.200
We find that he calls these individuals, it continues at the end of verse number six,

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:40.220
the latter phrase, it says, and in the hearts of all that are wisehearted, I have put wisdom

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.220
that they may make all that I have commanded thee.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.820
So we find that God had equipped the people for the work, and we find that the purpose

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.100
of this equipping was to do the work.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.140
It's very clear as we read the passage of Scripture in verse number three that God says,

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:05.299
I have filled him with the Spirit of God and wisdom and an understanding and a knowledge

00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:10.940
in all manner of workmanship to devise cunning works, to work in gold and in silver and in

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.899
brass and in cutting of stones to set them and in carving of timber to work in all manner

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:18.100
of workmanship.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.260
In these verses of Scripture, we find the purpose of this equipping was to do the work

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.540
of God.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:30.459
They were not Bezalel and a holy ab, and these wisehearted men that are referenced in this

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:38.980
passage of Scripture, they were not equipped by God to do this work in any other arena.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.140
They were equipped by God specifically for this work.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:48.739
And the Bible tells us that it was God that gave them the ability, that it was God that

00:06:48.739 --> 00:06:49.739
equipped them.

00:06:49.739 --> 00:06:57.459
We notice in verse number three, and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, it says

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:59.899
in verse number one, and the Lord spake unto Moses.

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:06.179
So we know that God, the Lord God Almighty, Jehovah, he is the one that has equipped these

00:07:06.179 --> 00:07:07.420
individuals.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:12.339
We find that the purpose is stated at the end of verse number six, that they may make

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:14.459
all that I have commanded thee.

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:19.100
It's again stated at the end of verse number 11, according to all that I have commanded

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.220
thee shall they do.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.739
Now we understand that the instruction had been given in these previous chapters, as

00:07:26.739 --> 00:07:28.899
I mentioned, by way of introduction.

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:34.140
And then we enter into this chapter in which we're studying this evening, and the people

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.140
are called and equipped for the work.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:43.380
Unfortunately, the 32nd chapter of the book of Exodus records for us the breaking of the

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.739
law, the sin of the people with the golden calf and Aaron and all of that.

00:07:47.739 --> 00:07:52.500
And many of us are familiar with that event and that passage of Scripture.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.820
We will not focus any of our time upon that this evening.

00:07:55.899 --> 00:08:03.579
The people then repent, the covenant is renewed, and we find that the construction would begin.

00:08:03.579 --> 00:08:07.739
And so it's important that we understand a few things as we kind of make our way here

00:08:07.739 --> 00:08:12.140
through these latter chapters of the book of Exodus, and we're going somewhere, we're

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:17.019
going to make application for us this evening as New Testament believers.

00:08:17.019 --> 00:08:21.820
But we find that they were equipped for the work, but then I notice as I continue to read

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:27.660
through the pages of Scripture that they were engaged in the work.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:32.900
It's important to understand that they were equipped, but how we should rejoice as we

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:41.380
read the pages of Scripture when the Bible tells us that they were engaged in the work.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:46.940
God equipped them, and they, as Paul would say, he wanted to be a good steward of the

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:53.739
manifold grace of God, and the reality is that these individuals and the two that are

00:08:53.739 --> 00:08:59.460
mentioned by name, Bezalel and Aholiab, they are equipped, but then they are engaged in

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.460
the work.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:04.099
And what joy that is as I study the Scriptures.

00:09:04.099 --> 00:09:09.099
Notice with me in verse number 30 of chapter number 35, the Bible says,

00:09:09.099 --> 00:09:15.059
And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the Lord hath called by name Bezalel,

00:09:15.059 --> 00:09:18.700
the son of Uriah, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:23.859
And he hath filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom and understanding and in knowledge

00:09:23.859 --> 00:09:29.500
and in all manner of workmanship, and to devise curious works, to work in gold and in silver

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:35.179
and in brass, and in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make

00:09:35.179 --> 00:09:37.719
any manner of cutting work.

00:09:37.719 --> 00:09:47.080
And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he and Aholiab, the son of Ahissamak,

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.119
of the tribe of Dan.

00:09:49.119 --> 00:09:55.320
Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver

00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:00.000
and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue and in purple.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.420
and scarlet, and in fine linen,

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.579
and of the weaver,

00:10:03.579 --> 00:10:05.300
even of them that do any work,

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.579
and of those that devise cunning work."

00:10:08.579 --> 00:10:11.619
Notice the first word of chapter 36.

00:10:11.619 --> 00:10:13.020
Then,

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.379
"...then wrought Bezalel and Aholiab,

00:10:16.379 --> 00:10:18.379
and every wise-hearted man

00:10:18.379 --> 00:10:20.940
in whom the Lord put wisdom and understanding

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.020
to know how to work all manner of work

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.299
for the service of the sanctuary,

00:10:26.479 --> 00:10:30.680
according to all the Lord had commanded."

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.599
We know that the offering is brought,

00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:35.700
and the offering was sufficient for the work.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.279
In fact, the people were restrained from bringing

00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:41.240
because they had more than sufficient.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.799
You read that in verses six and seven of chapter 36.

00:10:44.799 --> 00:10:46.479
But I want you to understand

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:49.360
that God had instructed Moses,

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.619
and he instructed Moses

00:10:51.619 --> 00:10:55.360
with regard to the construction of the tabernacle

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.259
and all of the pieces of furniture.

00:10:57.259 --> 00:10:58.200
And then God says,

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.159
I've equipped these individuals.

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:02.520
Moses then tells the congregation

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.979
in the passage that we just read

00:11:03.979 --> 00:11:05.980
at the end of chapter 35,

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.800
that it was God that had equipped these men,

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.919
these individuals,

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:13.919
for the work that has been instructed to them to do.

00:11:13.919 --> 00:11:18.239
And then we find that they wrought in the work.

00:11:18.239 --> 00:11:19.199
And what a blessing.

00:11:19.199 --> 00:11:23.800
I want to go through these next few chapters in Exodus.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.480
And I want you to read with me and follow along.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.239
And I want you to see how that you will find the phrase,

00:11:31.239 --> 00:11:35.199
and he made, or they made, or made.

00:11:35.199 --> 00:11:38.440
And you'll find that they are engaged in the work.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.879
God had equipped them for this work,

00:11:40.879 --> 00:11:43.319
and now they are engaged in the work.

00:11:43.319 --> 00:11:48.319
I understand that this work had to be a challenging work.

00:11:48.779 --> 00:11:51.319
No doubt, it was a lengthy work.

00:11:51.319 --> 00:11:53.239
It was a detailed work.

00:11:53.239 --> 00:11:55.760
But they had been equipped for such a purpose

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.760
and for such a reason.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.839
And we find that in verse number eight of chapter 36,

00:12:00.839 --> 00:12:01.680
the Bible says,

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.279
and every wisehearted man among them

00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:06.440
that wrought the work of the tabernacle,

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:11.440
notice, made 10 curtains of fine twined linen.

00:12:12.279 --> 00:12:13.399
In verse number 11,

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:16.639
and he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:19.080
from the salvage and the coupling.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.279
In verse number 13,

00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:22.679
and he made 50 tashes of gold.

00:12:22.679 --> 00:12:23.800
In verse number 14,

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.199
and he made curtains of goat's hair

00:12:26.199 --> 00:12:28.639
for the tent over the tabernacle.

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:30.479
Skip down to verse number 20.

00:12:30.479 --> 00:12:31.320
The Bible says,

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.460
and he made boards for the tabernacle of shittum wood,

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.580
standing up.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.839
In verse number 31,

00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:38.679
and he made bars of shittum wood.

00:12:38.679 --> 00:12:42.800
Five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.559
And so we see that the work is progressing,

00:12:46.559 --> 00:12:48.119
and they are doing the work.

00:12:48.119 --> 00:12:49.880
They are engaged in the work.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.360
In verse number 35,

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.720
and he made a veil of blue and purple and scarlet

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.199
and fine twined linen with cherubims,

00:12:57.199 --> 00:13:01.080
made he it of cunning work.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.160
Verse 37, excuse me,

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.600
verse number one of chapter 37,

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.440
and Bezalel made the ark of shittum wood.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.720
Notice in verse number three,

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.440
and he cast for it four rings of gold.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.199
Verse four of chapter 37,

00:13:16.199 --> 00:13:18.360
and he made staves of shittum wood

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.639
and overlaid them with gold.

00:13:19.679 --> 00:13:21.520
And he put the staves into the rings

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.360
by the sides of the ark to bear the ark.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.800
And he made the mercy seat of pure gold.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.039
Two cubits and a half was the length thereof

00:13:29.039 --> 00:13:31.520
and of one cubit and a half the breadth thereof.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.639
And he made two cherubims of gold,

00:13:33.639 --> 00:13:35.039
beaten out of one piece,

00:13:35.039 --> 00:13:38.960
made he them on the two ends of the mercy seat.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.039
As we skip through and we notice in verse number 10,

00:13:42.039 --> 00:13:43.080
the Bible says this,

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.759
and he made the table of shittum wood.

00:13:45.759 --> 00:13:48.360
Two cubits was the length thereof

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.479
and a cubit the breadth thereof

00:13:50.479 --> 00:13:52.800
and a cubit and a half the height thereof.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.279
Verse 15, and he made the staves of shittum wood.

00:13:56.279 --> 00:13:58.600
Verse 16, and he made the vessels

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.520
which were upon the table.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.399
Verse 17, and he made the candlestick of pure gold,

00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:08.199
of beaten work, made he the candlestick.

00:14:08.199 --> 00:14:10.800
His shaft and his branch, his bowls, his knobs,

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.080
his flowers were of the same.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.799
Verse 23, and he made his seven lamps

00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:20.959
and his snuffers and his snuff dishes of pure gold,

00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:23.119
of a talent of pure gold made he it

00:14:23.119 --> 00:14:25.399
and all the vessels thereof.

00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:30.200
Verse 25, and he made the incense altar of shittum wood.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.880
The length of it was a cubit and the breadth of it a cubit.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.559
It was four square and two cubits was the height of it.

00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:38.880
The horns thereof were of the same.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.880
We go down to chapter number 38

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.519
and the Bible says he made the altar

00:14:42.519 --> 00:14:45.519
of burnt offering of shittum wood.

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:48.720
Verse three, and he made all the vessels of the altar,

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.799
the pots, the shovels, the basins,

00:14:50.799 --> 00:14:52.760
the flesh hooks, the fire pans,

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:57.359
and all the vessels thereof made he of brass.

00:14:57.359 --> 00:14:58.880
He made the laver of brass,

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.079
according to verse number eight.

00:15:00.079 --> 00:15:02.320
In verse number nine, he made the court

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.799
on the south side, southward.

00:15:03.799 --> 00:15:06.440
The hangings of the court were of fine twine linen

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.279
and hundred cubits.

00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:11.799
And we read all of these verses of Scripture

00:15:11.799 --> 00:15:14.200
and we kind of quickly go through

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.359
and I hope you've been able to follow along

00:15:16.359 --> 00:15:19.279
and just to be encouraged to see

00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:22.720
how that they were engaged in the work.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.279
They were not just sitting on the sidelines.

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:27.799
They were not just equipped

00:15:27.799 --> 00:15:30.239
and just kind of sitting there saying,

00:15:30.239 --> 00:15:31.399
well, I know how to do this,

00:15:31.399 --> 00:15:33.119
or I know I've been equipped to do this.

00:15:33.119 --> 00:15:35.480
No, they were engaged in the work.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.480
They were doing what God had equipped them to do.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.559
And we find that it's so imperative

00:15:41.559 --> 00:15:44.559
that they are using their talents,

00:15:44.559 --> 00:15:46.920
their gifts, their abilities

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.320
that God gave them for the work of the Lord,

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.640
for the glory of God.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.440
In verse number 23, excuse me,

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.799
verse number 22 of Exodus 38,

00:15:57.799 --> 00:15:58.640
the Bible says,

00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.799
and Bezalel, the son of Uriah,

00:15:59.799 --> 00:16:01.920
the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:02.920
notice what it says,

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.920
made all that the Lord had commanded Moses.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.200
Isn't that precious?

00:16:11.239 --> 00:16:12.359
You might want to,

00:16:12.359 --> 00:16:16.399
I have underlined in my Bible that verse of Scripture.

00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:17.600
You may want to do that,

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.119
especially that last phrase,

00:16:19.119 --> 00:16:22.119
maybe even circle the word all,

00:16:22.119 --> 00:16:24.640
that the Bible says that he made all

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.480
that the Lord commanded Moses.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.239
Remember in our text, verse of Scripture,

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:31.079
where we started this evening

00:16:31.079 --> 00:16:33.239
in Exodus chapter number 31,

00:16:33.239 --> 00:16:37.399
that God told Moses that they may make all

00:16:37.399 --> 00:16:39.079
that I have commanded thee.

00:16:39.079 --> 00:16:40.720
God told Moses,

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.480
according to all that I have commanded thee,

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.079
shall they do.

00:16:46.079 --> 00:16:49.679
And here we find in verse 22 of chapter 38,

00:16:51.239 --> 00:16:56.239
that they made all that the Lord commanded Moses.

00:16:56.359 --> 00:16:58.200
What a blessing.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.279
We find that you can continue to read

00:17:01.279 --> 00:17:05.079
and you come to the end of chapter number 39.

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:07.959
And you notice in verse number 32,

00:17:07.959 --> 00:17:09.720
the Bible says this,

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:13.559
thus was all the work of the tabernacle

00:17:13.559 --> 00:17:17.079
of the tent of the congregation finished.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.720
Finished, it was completed.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.640
The children of Israel did according to all

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.959
that the Lord commanded Moses,

00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:30.279
so did they.

00:17:30.279 --> 00:17:32.720
And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses,

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.480
the tent, all his furniture,

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.399
his tashes, his boards, his bars,

00:17:38.399 --> 00:17:41.040
and his pillars and his sockets.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.160
And the covering of ramskins dyed red,

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.000
and the covering of badgerskins,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.079
and the veil of the covering,

00:17:48.079 --> 00:17:50.760
the ark of the testimony and the staves thereof

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.559
and the mercy seat,

00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:55.440
the table and all the vessels thereof

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.239
and the showbread,

00:17:57.239 --> 00:18:00.239
the pure candlestick with the lamps thereof,

00:18:00.239 --> 00:18:02.799
even with the lamps to be set in order

00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:05.399
and all the vessels thereof.

00:18:06.119 --> 00:18:08.959
And the oil for light and the golden altar

00:18:08.959 --> 00:18:12.679
and the anointing oil and the sweet incense

00:18:12.679 --> 00:18:15.559
and the hanging for the tabernacle door,

00:18:15.559 --> 00:18:18.920
the brazen altar and his grate of brass,

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:22.200
his staves and all his vessels,

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.440
the laver and his foot.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.000
Verse 40, the hangings of the court,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.679
his pillars and his sockets

00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:31.559
and the hanging of the court gate,

00:18:31.559 --> 00:18:34.440
his cords and his pins

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.760
and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.440
for the tent of the congregation,

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.719
the cloths of the service to do service in the holy place

00:18:44.719 --> 00:18:47.320
and the holy garments for Aaron the priest

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:52.239
and his son's garments to minister in the priest's office.

00:18:52.239 --> 00:18:56.799
According to all that the Lord commanded Moses,

00:18:56.799 --> 00:19:00.520
so the children of Israel made all the work.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.559
And Moses did look upon all the work.

00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:07.320
And behold, they had done it

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.520
as the Lord had commanded.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.479
Even so had they done it,

00:19:12.479 --> 00:19:16.840
and Moses blessed them."

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.719
It's an important passage of Scripture.

00:19:18.719 --> 00:19:20.960
I read the entirety of it

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.760
so that you could see that each particular item

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.000
is listed that they completed,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.840
that they constructed.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.919
As you go back to Exodus chapter 30 through 35

00:19:32.919 --> 00:19:34.200
and you read,

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.919
excuse me, Exodus chapter 25 through 30,

00:19:36.919 --> 00:19:39.640
and you read of all of the detailed instruction

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.799
that God gave to Moses,

00:19:41.799 --> 00:19:45.880
you will find in summary here at the end of chapter 39

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.359
that each of those pieces of furniture

00:19:48.359 --> 00:19:50.640
and every element that would be required

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.440
for the service of God in the tabernacle

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:57.479
was constructed just as God had said.

00:19:57.479 --> 00:20:00.520
I noticed some things about Bezalel and Aholian.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.260
and these wise-hearted men,

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.880
I noticed that they were willing

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.960
to be engaged in the work.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.420
I do not read anywhere within these pages of Scripture

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.140
where Moses had to pressure them

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.400
to get engaged in the work of the Lord.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.780
In fact, I believe that these men,

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.720
if I were to put it this way

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.900
in our vocabulary for today maybe,

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:29.460
that they felt that there was a distinct privilege

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.780
to be involved and to be engaged

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.260
in the work of the Lord,

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.180
that they would be used of God

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:38.580
to bring glory to God.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.540
I believe that as the songwriter said,

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.140
there is joy in serving Jesus

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.820
that for the length, the duration of the work

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.060
and however long it took for them

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.940
to make these elements that are listed

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.500
in all of the detail that had to go into it,

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.540
I believe that if again,

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.460
we could use today's vocabulary,

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:02.740
that there was joy in doing the work of God.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.980
They were engaged in the work.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.220
Chapter 40 of the book of Exodus

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:13.100
is a chapter in which it records for us

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.940
the momentous occasion in which

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.700
the tabernacle is reared up

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.420
and the glory of God filled the tabernacle.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:24.940
I mean, it's an amazing portion of Scripture.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.580
We do not have time this evening

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.820
to read the entirety of it,

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:32.860
but I want you to read the last few verses with me.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:37.700
In Exodus 40, in verse 33,

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.460
the Bible says this,

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.900
and he, speaking of Moses,

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.140
reared up the court round about the tabernacle

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.460
and the altar,

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.780
and set up the hanging of the court gate.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.900
So Moses finished the work.

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:58.060
Then, verse 34,

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:02.180
a cloud covered the tent of the congregation,

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:05.540
and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.580
And Moses was not able to enter

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.940
into the tent of the congregation

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.580
because the cloud abode thereon.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.220
The glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.780
When the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle,

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:23.380
the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.420
But if the cloud were not taken up,

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:29.660
then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:34.060
For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day,

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:36.540
and fire was on it by night.

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:39.020
And the sight of all the house of Israel

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:41.940
throughout all their journeys."

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:46.420
We made note that chapter number 36,

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.700
as we began reading and skipping through

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.820
these couple of chapters to read

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.580
about the work that was being done

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:56.700
and each piece of furniture that was being made,

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.980
we made note that the very first word of chapter 36 is,

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.540
then.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.260
After the instruction was given

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.620
and after it was understood that they were equipped,

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:09.100
then wrought Bezalel and Aholiab,

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.300
and they got engaged in the work.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.540
It's interesting to me that the very first word

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:19.500
of chapter number 40 and verse number 34 is, then.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.660
After the tabernacle was reared up,

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.100
after the work is finished,

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:27.700
then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.460
I wonder this evening,

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.820
if there is no then in chapter number 36,

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.620
there may not be a then in chapter number 40.

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.940
What do I mean by that?

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.020
Well, somebody had to get engaged in the work.

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.980
Somebody had to do the work of the Lord.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:44.340
Somebody had to do what God had instructed them to do.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:47.660
And these individuals, they had been equipped for the work,

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.180
but they got engaged in the work.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:53.260
They got involved in doing what God had commanded them to do.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.340
And God blessed, and the glory of the Lord

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.220
filled the tabernacle.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.740
I wonder this evening,

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:04.580
what it is that God might want to do in our midst.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.100
I wonder this evening,

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.660
what it is that God is able to do in our community

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.700
and in our region, in our state,

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.060
in our nation, in our world,

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:18.620
if the people of God would get engaged in the work of God.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.580
We've been equipped,

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:23.980
but oh, how we must get engaged

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.820
to see God do what only God can do.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.420
It's an amazing truth of Scripture

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:34.140
that God has chosen to use man.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:39.340
He's chosen to use people, individuals.

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:44.540
We read of great Bible records,

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.980
accounts that are given to us,

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.660
and as we read through the pages of Scripture,

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.380
we read of men and women

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.220
who were equipped,

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.460
who were yielded,

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.940
and who God used for His glory.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:06.700
In fact, as we studied on Sunday mornings in 2020

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.980
through the book of Hebrews,

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:11.260
we came to that great chapter,

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.380
Hebrews 11.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:17.380
We often refer to it as the hall of faith chapter.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:21.020
We see how those individuals that are listed,

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.900
what was accomplished through faith

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:28.100
as they were equipped and got engaged in the work

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:31.100
and how they believed God and followed God

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:34.500
and yielded themselves to God.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.380
We as New Testament believers

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:39.380
as we make application this evening,

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:44.700
I invite you to turn with me to the book of Ephesians.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.740
Turn with me to the book of Ephesians if you will.

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.980
As you look in the book of Ephesians

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.700
and the second chapter,

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.260
I want to make note to you

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.300
with regard to the importance

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.540
that we see here of yielding to God

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:02.740
and understanding the fact that we have been equipped.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.260
The Bible says we read this portion of Scripture

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.380
actually in our message this morning,

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.100
but I want to focus upon Ephesians 2

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.940
in verse 10.

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.220
Verses 8 and 9 talk to us about being born again,

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.780
being saved by the blood of the Lamb,

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:20.580
and the fact that we're saved not by our own works,

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:24.540
but we're saved through faith by grace.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.380
And he says this in verse 10,

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.940
for we are His workmanship,

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:35.660
created in Christ Jesus unto good works,

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:39.060
which God hath before ordained

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:45.220
that we should walk in them.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.380
As I consider the truth of Ephesians 2

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:51.940
in verse 10 in the context of the verse of Scripture,

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:55.660
and we think about this truth of good works,

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.020
and the many people today

00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:01.420
that have falsely taught some teaching

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:05.660
with regard to work salvation,

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.820
we find that there's no biblical foundation

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.460
for such a teaching.

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.140
It is a false teaching.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:15.620
You cannot be saved by good works.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.380
The Apostle Paul is not saying

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.620
to these believers in Ephesus

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.020
that they ought to be doing these good works

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.220
so that they can be saved.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.180
No, he's already established for them

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.220
that there's only one way to be saved,

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.540
and that's through the blood of Christ.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.500
You read in Ephesians 1,

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.740
the Bible provides us,

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.740
we won't take time to read all of it,

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.860
the Bible provides for us the plan of redemption,

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.260
the price of redemption,

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.420
the proof of redemption.

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:46.300
If you look through the first 14 verses of Ephesians 1,

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.660
you see that laid out quite plainly.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:51.300
No, Paul is not telling them

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.020
to get engaged in good works

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.860
so that they can be saved,

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:57.860
nor is he telling them to be engaged in good works

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.420
so that they can stay saved.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.780
Both of these teachings are false teachings

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.460
that are very prevalent today.

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.180
In fact, there are many denominations,

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.860
there are many cults that would teach

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:12.340
that you have to do good works

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.700
in order to be saved or to stay saved.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.620
And I understand the way in which

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.860
those false teachers

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:24.380
and those false denominations and cults

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:26.740
will use that teaching

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.860
in a manner in which they can have

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.140
a level of control upon their followers

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:34.780
and cause their followers to be engaged

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:37.260
in doing something.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.860
Because they tell them if you don't do these things,

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.420
you can't be saved.

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:42.500
If you don't do these things,

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.619
you can't stay saved.

00:28:45.619 --> 00:28:48.500
But the reality is that we cannot

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:52.059
violate the clear teaching of Scripture

00:28:52.059 --> 00:28:54.300
in order so that we might get some people

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.739
engaged in the work.

00:28:56.739 --> 00:28:59.140
It's not appropriate that we do that.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.020
No, rather, we understand the biblical teaching

00:29:02.059 --> 00:29:04.140
and the biblical truth

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:08.140
is that when we understand

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:12.179
who Christ is and what He's done for us,

00:29:12.179 --> 00:29:13.700
and how He saved our souls

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.780
and changed our eternal destination,

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.940
that we would understand that we are His workmanship,

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.940
that we are created in Christ Jesus

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.700
unto good works,

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.619
which God hath before ordained

00:29:26.619 --> 00:29:28.980
that we should walk in them.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.100
That we would simply say,

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.100
I desire to do good works

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:36.460
not so that I can get saved or stay saved,

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:38.739
but because I am saved.

00:29:38.739 --> 00:29:42.900
Because I get to work for the Lord.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.860
I often hear people say something like this,

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:50.059
why do we have to do this?

00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:52.020
Perhaps some have even said,

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:53.820
why do I have to go to church?

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.940
I've heard that.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.020
I would submit to those individuals,

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.500
you get to go to church.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.380
You get to serve God.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:04.900
What a privilege.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.139
What an opportunity.

00:30:08.139 --> 00:30:12.199
Turn over, if you will, to the book of 1 Peter.

00:30:12.199 --> 00:30:15.659
And 1 Peter 4 will conclude

00:30:15.659 --> 00:30:18.520
with this portion of Scripture this evening.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.620
We understand that we are His workmanship

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:24.020
created in Christ Jesus unto good works,

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:25.379
which He hath before ordained

00:30:25.379 --> 00:30:27.879
that we should walk in them.

00:30:27.879 --> 00:30:34.000
In 1 Peter 4, the Bible says in verse 10,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.319
as every man hath received the gift,

00:30:39.319 --> 00:30:43.319
even so minister the same one to another

00:30:43.319 --> 00:30:48.919
as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

00:30:48.919 --> 00:30:50.840
If any man speak,

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.080
let him speak as the oracles of God.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.040
If any man minister,

00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:00.439
let him do it as of the ability which God giveth

00:31:00.439 --> 00:31:03.000
that God in all things may be glorified

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.959
through Jesus Christ,

00:31:04.959 --> 00:31:07.000
to whom be praise and dominion

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.919
forever and ever.

00:31:09.919 --> 00:31:11.720
Amen.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.160
As we look at these two verses of Scripture

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:17.040
in 1 Peter 4, verses 10 and 11,

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.599
we find great truth that is given to us.

00:31:19.599 --> 00:31:21.000
Number one, he says,

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.800
as every man hath received the gift,

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.160
those that have been saved,

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.879
if you've been born again,

00:31:25.879 --> 00:31:27.720
the Holy Spirit of God has equipped you.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.080
He's given you a spiritual gift.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.480
We can read of that over in 1 Corinthians.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.279
You do not need to turn there.

00:31:34.279 --> 00:31:36.400
But in chapters 13 and 14

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.199
of the book of 1 Corinthians,

00:31:38.199 --> 00:31:40.480
you see much information given.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.400
Really in chapters 12, 13, and 14

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.080
of the book of 1 Corinthians,

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.559
you see many truths that are given to us

00:31:46.559 --> 00:31:49.160
with regard to spiritual gifts.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.120
And the Bible tells us

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.480
in this portion of Scripture,

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.959
in 1 Corinthians 12,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.519
I'll just read a few verses here.

00:31:56.519 --> 00:31:57.360
In verse 1,

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.120
Now concerning spiritual gifts,

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:01.800
brethren, I would not have you ignorant.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.279
You know that you were Gentiles

00:32:03.279 --> 00:32:04.919
carried away into these dumb idols

00:32:04.919 --> 00:32:06.639
even as you were led.

00:32:06.639 --> 00:32:08.440
Wherefore, I give you to understand

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.559
that no man speaking by the Spirit of God

00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:12.720
calleth Jesus accursed.

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.160
And that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord,

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.240
but by the Holy Ghost.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.639
Now, there are diversities of gifts,

00:32:20.639 --> 00:32:22.679
but the same Spirit.

00:32:22.679 --> 00:32:24.919
And there are differences of administrations,

00:32:25.759 --> 00:32:26.600
but the same Lord.

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.759
And there are diversities of operations,

00:32:28.759 --> 00:32:31.759
but it is the same God which worketh all in all.

00:32:31.759 --> 00:32:33.399
But the manifestation of the Spirit

00:32:33.399 --> 00:32:35.679
is given to every man to profit with all.

00:32:35.679 --> 00:32:38.320
That's a great truth in verse number seven,

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.000
that the Bible says that the manifestation

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.759
of the Spirit is given to every man.

00:32:42.759 --> 00:32:46.080
Again, we found in chapter four of 1 Peter 4

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:46.960
in verse number 10,

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.759
as every man hath received the gift,

00:32:49.759 --> 00:32:52.679
but the Bible says to profit with all.

00:32:52.679 --> 00:32:56.000
That God might be glorified.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.320
It says here, for to one is given by the Spirit

00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.199
the word of wisdom,

00:32:59.199 --> 00:33:01.160
to another the word of knowledge,

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.080
by the same Spirit,

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.679
to another faith by the same Spirit,

00:33:03.679 --> 00:33:06.360
to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit,

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.839
to another the working of miracles,

00:33:07.839 --> 00:33:08.800
to another prophecy,

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.039
to another discerning of spirits,

00:33:10.039 --> 00:33:11.800
to another diverse kinds of tongues,

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.000
to another interpretation of tongues.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
In verse 11, it says,

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.919
but all these worketh that one in the self,

00:33:17.919 --> 00:33:18.759
same Spirit,

00:33:19.199 --> 00:33:22.639
to every man severally as he will.

00:33:22.639 --> 00:33:24.880
And we understand that as we read these chapters

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.600
in 1 Corinthians 12, 13, and 14,

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:31.399
that it's very clear the teaching of spiritual gifts.

00:33:31.399 --> 00:33:33.279
We see it in the book of Romans as well.

00:33:33.279 --> 00:33:34.399
But here, as we find,

00:33:34.399 --> 00:33:36.559
the Bible says that every man hath received the gift.

00:33:36.559 --> 00:33:38.279
If you are born again,

00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:41.160
if you trust that Christ is your Savior,

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.320
you have been given a spiritual gift.

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.520
If you say, I have no idea what my spiritual gift is,

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.479
in fact, I never even knew there were spiritual gifts,

00:33:49.479 --> 00:33:50.520
please contact me.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.000
I would love to be able to sit down

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.639
and have a conversation with you,

00:33:53.639 --> 00:33:55.720
provide you with some information

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:59.720
that will help you discover what your spiritual gift is.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:03.199
And it is important that we acknowledge

00:34:03.199 --> 00:34:04.559
that we have been gifted,

00:34:04.559 --> 00:34:07.000
that we've been given this spiritual gift,

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
but it's imperative that we discover

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.279
what that spiritual gift is.

00:34:12.279 --> 00:34:15.399
And as we discover what that spiritual gift is,

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.440
then we can properly develop our spiritual gift

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:22.200
so that we can use it in the work of the Lord.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.519
We find that it says that every man

00:34:24.519 --> 00:34:25.760
hath received the gift,

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.679
notice, even so minister the same one to another.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:31.880
Notice this phrase at the end of verse number 10,

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:36.880
as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.040
I think in the beginning of the message,

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.720
I ascribed that statement to Paul,

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:42.320
and it's Peter actually that penned those words,

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.559
humanly speaking.

00:34:43.559 --> 00:34:44.880
But you think about the importance

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.880
of being a good steward of the manifold grace of God.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.640
The fact that I have been equipped by God,

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:52.679
that God's grace has been bestowed upon me,

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:55.600
His serving grace is what is in view here

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.880
in this passage of Scripture.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.440
It's not dealing with His saving grace.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.959
We understand for by grace are you saved through faith.

00:35:01.959 --> 00:35:04.760
Here, he's speaking about that serving grace

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.720
that we have been given the grace of God.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.880
We've been gifted by the Holy Spirit of God,

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.859
and we are to be good stewards

00:35:11.859 --> 00:35:13.679
of the manifold grace of God.

00:35:13.679 --> 00:35:15.480
Now, we know that a steward is one

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:18.679
that was responsible for the affairs of a home,

00:35:18.679 --> 00:35:23.359
and that man, that individual that would be a steward,

00:35:23.359 --> 00:35:25.600
they had to be faithful.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.019
And the Bible says that it's required in stewards

00:35:29.019 --> 00:35:30.600
that a man be found faithful.

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:35.040
And here, Peter says that if we wanna be good stewards

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.359
of the manifold grace of God,

00:35:37.359 --> 00:35:39.440
that we recognize, that we acknowledge

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.359
that God has gifted, He has equipped me

00:35:42.359 --> 00:35:45.799
for the work of the ministry, for the work of God.

00:35:45.799 --> 00:35:48.880
Bezalel, Aholiab, these wise-hearted men,

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:53.880
they had been equipped, but not for themselves,

00:35:54.679 --> 00:35:58.679
for the work, to get engaged,

00:35:58.679 --> 00:36:02.000
to use it for the glory of God.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.880
The next couple of statements in verse number 11,

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.899
he uses a couple of aspects of these gifts

00:36:08.899 --> 00:36:10.619
that individuals would receive.

00:36:10.619 --> 00:36:15.619
If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.420
If any man minister, let him do it

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.820
as of the ability which God giveth.

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.579
And here's the amazing truth

00:36:24.579 --> 00:36:27.880
that we must be mindful of this evening,

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:32.880
that God, in all things, may be glorified

00:36:33.059 --> 00:36:35.339
through Jesus Christ,

00:36:35.339 --> 00:36:40.339
to whom be praise and dominion forever and ever, amen.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:49.140
As we, as New Testament believers,

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.500
recognize that we have been equipped

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.980
for the work of the Lord,

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:58.940
as we then engage ourselves in the work of the Lord,

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:02.619
and we begin to use that spiritual gift

00:37:02.619 --> 00:37:07.299
in the church of God for the glory of God.

00:37:07.299 --> 00:37:08.799
It's not so that any one of us

00:37:08.799 --> 00:37:11.000
could receive some level of recognition,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.380
applause, or position.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:16.540
No, it's so that God would be glorified,

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:18.260
because we recognize that it's God

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.920
that's given us the gift.

00:37:20.779 --> 00:37:23.019
And if it's God that's given us the gift,

00:37:23.019 --> 00:37:25.579
if it's God that's given us the ability,

00:37:25.579 --> 00:37:27.500
it is not for us to glory in it,

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.660
it's for us to say, God enabled me,

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:32.019
He equipped me.

00:37:32.019 --> 00:37:35.100
Bezalel, Aholiab, those wise-hearted men,

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:38.820
they could not take credit for what they did,

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:43.220
for they had been specifically equipped by God.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:48.220
God said to Moses, I've called them, I've equipped them.

00:37:48.339 --> 00:37:51.820
Moses then tells the congregation of the children of Israel,

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.540
he says, God has called and equipped

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:58.619
these individuals for this work.

00:37:59.619 --> 00:38:04.619
This evening, as New Testament believers,

00:38:05.179 --> 00:38:09.279
we are mindful of our place in the work of God.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:14.059
We mentioned Ephesians 2, in verse number 10,

00:38:14.059 --> 00:38:17.059
in chapter four, in verses 11 and 12,

00:38:17.059 --> 00:38:21.059
the Bible says this, and He gave some apostles

00:38:21.059 --> 00:38:23.220
and some prophets and some evangelists

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.019
and some pastors and teachers

00:38:25.859 --> 00:38:29.299
for the perfecting of the saints,

00:38:29.299 --> 00:38:31.700
for the work of the ministry,

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.340
for the edifying of the body of Christ,

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:37.619
verse 13, till we all come in the unity of the faith

00:38:37.619 --> 00:38:39.940
and of the knowledge of the Son of God

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:43.500
unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:45.099
of the fullness of Christ.

00:38:46.099 --> 00:38:50.619
See, our God has a plan,

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:55.500
and in His plan, He has chosen to use His people,

00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:00.500
His children, and He has said, I have a work for you to do,

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:05.500
and I'm going to equip you for the ministry, for the work.

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:10.739
The equipping that we see for the children of God today,

00:39:10.739 --> 00:39:12.340
for New Testament believers is there

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.299
in 1 Peter 4, in verse number 10,

00:39:14.299 --> 00:39:15.739
as every man hath received the gift.

00:39:15.739 --> 00:39:18.859
The engaging is even so ministered.

00:39:18.859 --> 00:39:21.140
Let us all do this thing, and we understand

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:23.260
that the result is that God in all things

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.460
may be glorified through Jesus Christ.

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:31.500
In 2021, are you going to be engaged in the work?

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:36.460
I understand that things are different

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:42.340
in this new age of pandemic and all that's going on

00:39:43.659 --> 00:39:46.659
and the differences that we face,

00:39:47.539 --> 00:39:50.140
but I would submit to you that God still has a plan.

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.739
God has still equipped us.

00:39:53.739 --> 00:39:56.700
God still has a purpose for that equipping.

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:59.059
We must get engaged in the work of God.

00:39:59.059 --> 00:40:08.179
I wonder this evening, as we turn the calendar into a brand new year, something's always

00:40:08.179 --> 00:40:10.539
interesting about that.

00:40:10.539 --> 00:40:16.179
It gives us an opportunity to reflect upon the past year and what all took place, but

00:40:16.179 --> 00:40:20.299
more importantly, it gives us the opportunity to look forward to a new year.

00:40:20.299 --> 00:40:25.699
We do not presume upon the Lord that we will live all the days of this particular year.

00:40:26.219 --> 00:40:30.459
In fact, we know that our life is but a vapor, that it appears for a little time and then

00:40:30.459 --> 00:40:31.939
vanishes away.

00:40:31.939 --> 00:40:35.699
We understand that biblical truth.

00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:40.259
And with understanding the biblical truth of the brevity of life and also the truth

00:40:40.259 --> 00:40:46.019
of the imminent return of Christ, I would submit to you this evening that now is the

00:40:46.019 --> 00:40:49.659
time to get engaged in the work.

00:40:49.659 --> 00:40:53.979
We must not have an attitude of, I'll serve God later.

00:40:53.979 --> 00:40:57.139
I'll serve God at a more convenient season.

00:40:57.139 --> 00:41:02.339
I'll serve God when things slow down in my life because it's busy.

00:41:02.339 --> 00:41:04.939
I'll slow down when you fill in the blank.

00:41:04.939 --> 00:41:14.779
We're very good as human beings of offering various excuses as to why we would not be

00:41:14.779 --> 00:41:18.019
engaged in the work of God.

00:41:18.059 --> 00:41:25.099
But I want to encourage you this evening to let God have His way, to understand that you

00:41:25.099 --> 00:41:32.819
have been equipped and how imperative it is that you get engaged.

00:41:32.819 --> 00:41:35.899
Oh, that God would help us.

00:41:35.899 --> 00:41:44.659
Can you imagine if every child of God in every church across America, shall I say across

00:41:44.819 --> 00:41:52.379
the globe, got engaged in the work of the Lord in the manner in which they've been equipped?

00:41:52.379 --> 00:41:57.339
Can you imagine what God could do in this world?

00:41:57.339 --> 00:42:01.059
Can you imagine what God could do in our congregation?

00:42:01.059 --> 00:42:07.459
If every single individual would say, I'm not content being a spectator.

00:42:07.459 --> 00:42:08.819
I want to be a participator.

00:42:08.819 --> 00:42:10.339
I want to be a participant.

00:42:10.339 --> 00:42:13.539
I want to get engaged in the work.

00:42:13.539 --> 00:42:18.539
I don't know what area of service, I don't know how I can get engaged or where I can

00:42:18.539 --> 00:42:22.819
get engaged, but I want to get engaged.

00:42:22.819 --> 00:42:30.699
It's always encouraging to me as a pastor when someone comes to my office or sends me

00:42:30.699 --> 00:42:38.099
an email or calls me on the phone and says, is there something I can do for God?

00:42:38.099 --> 00:42:42.099
Is there something I can do at church?

00:42:42.139 --> 00:42:44.339
I want to get involved.

00:42:44.339 --> 00:42:47.059
Oh, that's encouraging.

00:42:47.059 --> 00:42:52.220
Sometimes it's challenging, but it's encouraging.

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:59.139
And I trust this evening that as we look at this Old Testament example and we rejoice

00:42:59.139 --> 00:43:05.539
in what took place in the tabernacle, that we must be mindful of the fact that there

00:43:05.539 --> 00:43:12.419
were some individuals that were equipped, but they got engaged.

00:43:12.419 --> 00:43:15.419
They got involved in the work.

00:43:15.419 --> 00:43:18.339
And as New Testament believers, we've been equipped.

00:43:18.339 --> 00:43:22.539
Oh, that God would help us to get engaged.

00:43:22.539 --> 00:43:24.860
Let us get engaged in the work of the Lord.

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.380
Father, we love you.

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:30.580
We thank you for loving us.

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.139
Thank you for equipping us.

00:43:33.139 --> 00:43:37.860
Thank you for giving us the opportunity to serve you.

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.339
What a blessing.

00:43:39.339 --> 00:43:41.080
What a joy.

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:46.339
We echo the words of the songwriter when he said, there is joy in serving Jesus.

00:43:46.339 --> 00:43:58.380
Oh, God, I pray that you would help each and every one of us to determine to use our spiritual

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:07.779
gifts for your honor, for your glory.

00:44:07.779 --> 00:44:10.099
Help us, Lord.

00:44:10.099 --> 00:44:13.099
I pray that you'd move as only you can.

00:44:13.099 --> 00:44:15.540
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
