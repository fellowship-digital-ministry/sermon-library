1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,559
verses 6 through 13, and of course, as you are aware, if you were here last week, we

2
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:09,840
looked at the first five verses of chapter number 8 last week, and so we'll finish up

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,399
chapter number 8 this morning and be looking at Hebrews 8, verses 6 through 13.

4
00:00:14,399 --> 00:00:18,239
Let me read verses 6 and 7 to you, then we'll get into the message this morning.

5
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,000
In Hebrews 8 and verse number 6, the Bible says, But now hath he, speaking of our great

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,239
high priest, he hath obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is the mediator

7
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:34,240
of a better covenant which was established upon better promises.

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,439
For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for

9
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,439
the second.

10
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:45,479
Notice in verse number 13, the Bible says, In that he saith, A new covenant he hath made

11
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:51,840
the first old, now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,599
As we look at this passage of Scripture, I've simply entitled our message this morning,

13
00:00:55,599 --> 00:00:56,599
A New Covenant.

14
00:00:56,599 --> 00:01:00,639
A New Covenant, and we'll be looking at Hebrews 8, verses 6 through 13.

15
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:05,480
As you know, the book of Hebrews has established that Christ is superior.

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,959
He's better.

17
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:07,959
He's greater.

18
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:11,559
We know that as we study the first three chapters of the book of Hebrews, that you see immediately

19
00:01:11,559 --> 00:01:15,879
that he deals with the fact that Christ is better than the prophets, he's better than

20
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,879
the angels, he's better than Moses.

21
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:22,440
We find in chapter number 6 that there's reference there to him being better and superior to

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:29,239
Abraham, but we find that in chapters 5 through really chapter number 10, the midst of what

23
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:33,919
we're studying in this section of the book of Hebrews, we find that the Bible has made

24
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:42,160
it clear, abundantly clear, and has provided us with much information to prove the superiority

25
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,879
of the priesthood of Christ.

26
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:50,440
Of course, as we look at the contrast between that which these recipients would have been

27
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,919
very familiar with, the Aaronic priesthood, or the Levitical priesthood, we find that

28
00:01:55,919 --> 00:02:02,360
the author of Hebrews, God, is giving the truth to these believers that we have a great

29
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
high priest.

30
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,440
No, he's not after the order of Aaron, after that Aaronic priesthood.

31
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,539
He's after the order of Melchizedek, that Messianic prophecy that we found in the book

32
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:14,539
of Psalms.

33
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:18,479
And we understand that throughout the book of Hebrews, there have been many references

34
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:24,679
to Old Testament prophecy that has found its proper fulfillment here in the book of Hebrews

35
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:28,119
in saying that Jesus is the Messiah.

36
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:30,720
He is the one that has fulfilled these prophecies.

37
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,279
Again, this morning as we look at this eighth chapter of the book of Hebrews, we'll find

38
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:41,119
reference to the Old Testament, we'll find that there's reference to the first tabernacle,

39
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:45,759
and of course we understand that even as we studied last week in the first five verses

40
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:52,679
of Hebrews, chapter number eight, that the Scriptures talk to us about the true tabernacle,

41
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:55,240
which the Lord pitched and not man.

42
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,240
And we find that as we would look at this new covenant that is being discussed, and

43
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,839
we'll look at several aspects of it in verses 6 through 13, but I want to remind you of

44
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:10,440
the first, or the old covenant, of which the recipients would have been very familiar.

45
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,899
We won't take time to go back to the book of Exodus, but I just want to share with you

46
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,460
kind of an overview of Exodus chapter number 20 through 40.

47
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,139
As we look at those 20 chapters that end the book of Exodus, of course if you look at the

48
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:26,940
first several chapters of the book of Exodus, you begin to deal with the call of Moses,

49
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,979
the plight of the children of Israel as they're in Egyptian bondage, and the power of God

50
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:37,500
that is revealed through all of the plagues, and of course the last being the death of

51
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,779
the firstborn, God's deliverance of his people out of Egypt, the miraculous crossing of the

52
00:03:43,779 --> 00:03:44,779
Red Sea.

53
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:48,580
I mean, there are so many powerful, wonderful truths that we find in the book of Exodus,

54
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:54,699
but as we look at chapters 20 through 40, and their really impact that this chapter

55
00:03:54,699 --> 00:04:00,440
has on that truth, again, that these believers that are being written to here, that these

56
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:06,100
Jewish believers would have had much knowledge and been very familiar with that portion of

57
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,139
Scripture.

58
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:11,740
You understand that it was in Exodus chapters 20 through 23 that we find that Moses would

59
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,300
receive the law.

60
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:18,079
In particular, in chapter number 20, we're aware of the 10 commandments that are given

61
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,940
there in Exodus chapter number 20, but it's in those three chapters that Moses would receive

62
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,940
the law.

63
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,100
It was in Exodus chapter number 24 that the law is ratified.

64
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:32,579
It's interesting that in that passage of Scripture, on two occasions, the children of Israel respond

65
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:40,100
to Moses and say, all the words which the Lord hath said will we do.

66
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,480
There was a commitment to obedience.

67
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,100
We see that in verse number 3, and again in verse number 7, where there, the Bible tells

68
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,500
us that he took the book of the covenant and read in the audience of the people, and they

69
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:56,739
said, all that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obedient.

70
00:04:56,739 --> 00:04:58,820
That's in Exodus chapter 24.

71
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,380
Immediately after that process, we find that Moses goes back to the mount, and it's in

72
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:09,980
Exodus chapters 25 through 31 that God gives Moses the instruction with regard to the tabernacle.

73
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:14,700
All of those details on the construction, all of the materials and the dimensions, and

74
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:21,820
all of the fine details, it's in that passage where God shows him the pattern of the true

75
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,820
tabernacle.

76
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,260
We understand, as we dealt with last week, how that tabernacle, which would soon become

77
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,140
a temple under the reign and rule of Solomon, king of Israel, and of course there was a

78
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:37,540
temple that was still standing here for these Jewish believers in Jerusalem, but we find

79
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:44,140
that all of that was a simple shadow, a picture of that true tabernacle, which is in heaven.

80
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,820
And so while Moses was there receiving all of that instruction and all of those details,

81
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:54,040
and God saying, very specifically, do not deviate at all.

82
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:00,160
There was very important that every detail would be followed just as it had been given.

83
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,619
And then we come to Exodus chapter number 32, and we find the record of Aaron and the

84
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:06,220
golden calf.

85
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:12,980
They had broken the very law that they had committed to obey.

86
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:18,579
They ratified, we use that word in chapter 24, where they say all that the Lord has said

87
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:21,739
we will do, we're going to be obedient.

88
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:24,980
And as Moses is up on the mountain receiving all that instruction, they say we don't know

89
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,100
about this guy Moses, we don't know what he's doing, and we don't know all that's going

90
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,140
on, and they make this golden calf.

91
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:38,500
How terrible to see how quickly the people had broken the very law that they committed

92
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,299
to obey.

93
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:47,220
And then we find that in chapters 33 and 34, we find that there's repentance and renewal

94
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:54,700
of that really just a commitment to obedience on the part of the children of Israel.

95
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,779
In chapters 33 and 34 of the book of Exodus, and then you read of, in chapters 35-39, the

96
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:03,459
instruction of the tabernacle, all those details, Bezalel and others that would be

97
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:10,220
take part in doing the work that God had commanded to be done, and you come to the 40th chapter

98
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,179
of the book of Exodus, and it's a culmination of all of those events, and you find that

99
00:07:14,179 --> 00:07:19,940
they did exactly as God had commanded, they obeyed the Lord, they followed the instruction,

100
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:26,140
and you read of the rearing up of the tabernacle and the glory of God filling that place.

101
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,779
What a blessing.

102
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:32,859
And as we consider those truths from the last part of the book of Exodus and really

103
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:37,299
kind of quickly overview those 20 chapters, we find that there will be reference to those

104
00:07:37,299 --> 00:07:41,579
things because the Bible talks about here this new covenant, but he makes reference

105
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:46,980
to the first covenant, and really we would simply refer to that as being the law.

106
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,700
And we find that as we look at the passage of scripture that is before us, again, I've

107
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:57,339
titled the message, A Better Covenant, A New Covenant, as we find in verse number 13, a

108
00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:02,260
new covenant, we find in verse number 8, where it is a better covenant, and we find

109
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,420
that this is a better covenant, excuse me, verse number 6, it says, by how much also

110
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,660
he is the mediator of a better covenant.

111
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,940
As we look at the passage of scripture, again, we'll make note of some Old Testament prophets

112
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,260
in the book of Jeremiah as we go through the passage, and notice if you're taking notes,

113
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,140
number one, the superiority of the new covenant.

114
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,380
Notice in verse number 6, I read it for you already, but you find that the Bible says,

115
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,179
but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry.

116
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:33,539
Now remember, he's speaking about the fact that we have a high priest.

117
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,260
He's been dealing with this subject matter, we really started in chapter number 5, we

118
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:43,979
get into the truth of the order of Melchizedek and the fact that that is fully developed

119
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,380
in chapter number 7, and you come here to chapter number 8, and you say, why is it we

120
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:54,500
have this high priest, and as we discussed last week, that he ministers in a better place,

121
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,219
and we find that he presented a better offering.

122
00:08:59,219 --> 00:09:00,219
What did he do?

123
00:09:00,219 --> 00:09:02,500
He offered himself.

124
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,380
The sinless, precious blood of God in flesh, the Lord Jesus Christ, and then we come as

125
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:14,140
we find it says, but now, in verse number 6, hath he obtained a more excellent ministry.

126
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:22,299
Notice by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established

127
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:24,619
upon better promises.

128
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:30,419
Again, we've mentioned the theme of the book of Hebrews, that Christ is better, he is superior,

129
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:35,700
and we find twice in verse number 6, how that it mentions a better covenant, which was established

130
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,239
upon better promises.

131
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:42,580
We find that he says in verse number 7, for if that first covenant had been faultless,

132
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,099
then should no place have been sought for the second, but finding fault, notice this

133
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:49,099
phrase, with them.

134
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:50,099
Who's them?

135
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:51,700
The children of Israel, right?

136
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,219
We mention how they broke the covenant and we find that he says finding fault with them,

137
00:09:57,219 --> 00:10:00,059
he saith, God says, behold…

138
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:06,699
Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant, notice this, with

139
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:12,259
the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not according to the covenant that

140
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:17,619
I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of

141
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:18,619
the land of Egypt.

142
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,359
Now, remember, that's found in the book of Exodus.

143
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:23,699
We just kind of reviewed that very quickly.

144
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:28,339
And then you notice the last phrase in verse number nine, because they, who's they?

145
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:35,019
Again, the children of Israel, they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not,

146
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:36,979
saith the Lord.

147
00:10:36,979 --> 00:10:40,659
It's interesting as we look at the superiority of this covenant, this new covenant that is

148
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:45,219
mentioned here in the passage of scripture, we would find that really there's two simple

149
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:47,419
reasons that it's a better covenant.

150
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:51,179
Number one, because Jesus is the surety for this covenant.

151
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:54,839
Notice back in chapter number seven, this was given to us in chapter seven and verse

152
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,059
number 22 about this better testament.

153
00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:01,299
The word testament and covenant can be used interchangeably.

154
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:08,299
You understand here that in verse number 22, it says this, by so much was Jesus made a

155
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:13,699
surety of a better testament, a better covenant.

156
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:20,860
We find that he paid for the sin of mankind with his precious blood, and Jesus is the

157
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,659
surety of this covenant.

158
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:26,500
Not only is he the surety of the covenant, but we find in verse number six that he is

159
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,180
the mediator of this covenant.

160
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:36,180
Mediator is one who takes two parties that are at variance, and these two parties that

161
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:42,899
are at variance, this mediator were interposed in order to bring reconciliation.

162
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:47,619
You find the work of the mediator, if you understand the Lord Jesus Christ in this particular

163
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:56,099
role, if you will, as mediator, he took man who was at enmity with God.

164
00:11:56,099 --> 00:12:03,019
We find that Jesus came and presented himself, and he allowed Jesus through his substitutionary

165
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:05,899
death, burial, and glorious resurrection.

166
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:11,580
We find that he is both the surety and the mediator of this new covenant, which allows

167
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,580
what?

168
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,899
It allows mankind to be reconciled to God.

169
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:21,099
Without the work of Christ on the cross of Calvary, we do not understand this great truth

170
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:25,139
of reconciliation, because we were at enmity with God.

171
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:31,660
You read Romans chapter number five, and you find here that the superiority of this new

172
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,459
covenant that is mentioned in our passage of Scripture, that it's because Jesus is not

173
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:39,899
only the surety, but he's also the mediator.

174
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:41,699
It's important for us to understand that.

175
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:44,539
It was with his precious blood.

176
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:47,059
He did not use anything.

177
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:51,220
We find that Peter mentions that we're not redeemed with silver and gold, but with the

178
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,739
precious blood of Christ.

179
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:59,739
What a joy to understand the superiority of this covenant.

180
00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:01,739
Notice he says in verse number seven,

181
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:05,539
For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for

182
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:06,539
the second.

183
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:08,500
What was the problem with the first covenant?

184
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,779
It was broken by them.

185
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:13,259
It says there in verse number eight,

186
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:17,239
For finding fault with them, speaking of the children of Israel.

187
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:24,119
You notice that as we look in verse number nine, it says they continued not in my covenant.

188
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:27,679
And it says that he therefore regarded them not, saith the Lord.

189
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:33,160
As we begin to look at the passage of Scripture, we find that God then mentions in verse number

190
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,559
eight, and this writer of the book of Hebrews is helping these Jewish believers to understand

191
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,559
the promises that had been given in the Old Testament.

192
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:46,599
Again, these Jewish believers would have a certain understanding of these Old Testament

193
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,000
truths, and what a blessing to see how the writer of Hebrews, under the inspiration of

194
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,160
the Holy Spirit of God, allows for these believers to understand the Old Testament truth and

195
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,759
properly apply it to the Lord Jesus Christ.

196
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,759
I've heard people say, the Old Testament really isn't important, we live in the New Testament

197
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:06,759
age.

198
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:10,119
Oh, the New Testament contradicts that.

199
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:13,720
Because the New Testament says that it was written for our benefit, for our admonition,

200
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,720
for our learning.

201
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,040
And so we can't ignore the Old Testament, we find great truth in the Old Testament that

202
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,880
helps us understand the fulfillment that we find here in the New Testament.

203
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,519
And so we find that he says this in verse number eight.

204
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,279
Notice the way in which he's leading into this new covenant, and we'll deal with it

205
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,519
in more details in verses 10 through 12, but notice what he says, behold, right in the

206
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:41,440
middle of verse number eight, the days come, saith the Lord.

207
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,079
This is referring to an Old Testament prophecy.

208
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:47,000
God is eternal, right?

209
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,880
He's Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and last.

210
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,679
And so he is able to speak about something that's going to come in the future, why?

211
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:57,480
Because he is eternal.

212
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,440
And he's able to bring it to pass, why?

213
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,440
Because he's eternal.

214
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,799
We see the knowledge and wisdom of God, we see the eternality of God here in the passage

215
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:11,040
of Scripture, and he says, behold, the days come, saith the Lord.

216
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,559
Notice these phrases, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and

217
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:19,480
with the house of Judah.

218
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,760
And so we find that right there in verse number eight, it begins to refer to this Old Testament

219
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,119
prophecy with regard to this new covenant, and we'll look at it in Jeremiah here in just

220
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:32,839
a few moments, but it's important that we understand that he says that he's going to

221
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:37,639
make this, it's going to be in days to come, and he will make this new covenant with the

222
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,600
house of Israel and with the house of Judah.

223
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,239
Of course, during the time of Jeremiah's prophecy, Israel had already been taken captive by the

224
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,139
Assyrians.

225
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:53,880
In fact, Judah was on the eve of captivity by the Babylonians.

226
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,339
They had already sieged the city.

227
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:00,480
You can find that Jeremiah speaks of that often with regard to the impending judgment

228
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,359
and doom of the city of Judah, the nation of Judah being carried away into Babylonian

229
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:06,359
captivity.

230
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:10,919
And so really in focus here is when he talks about the house of Israel and the house of

231
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:16,279
Judah is this one nation of Israel again that God's going to make this promise to, this

232
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,279
new covenant to.

233
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,519
Now, it's important that we understand there are individuals that have taken and had really,

234
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:28,239
in my opinion, a bad exegetical approach to understanding the Scriptures, and they said,

235
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:30,679
no, this new covenant has nothing to do with Israel.

236
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,519
It has everything to do with Israel.

237
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,839
They said, no, no, it's about the church, and the church becomes spiritual Israel.

238
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:40,679
As you start to do those kind of things with Scripture, you really kind of get yourself

239
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,600
twisted up and get yourself in a mess.

240
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,559
No doubt these Jewish believers that are the original recipients of this book of Hebrews,

241
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:54,720
when the writer says the house of Judah and the house of Israel, they would have understood

242
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,359
the nation.

243
00:16:56,359 --> 00:17:02,600
No doubt in Jeremiah's prophecy, in Jeremiah chapter number 31, that when that prophecy

244
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,639
is given with regard to the house of Judah and the house of Israel, it was understood

245
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:07,639
to be Israel.

246
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:09,600
There was no church at that time.

247
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,639
Amen?

248
00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:15,239
The church was known by God, but it was not known by the prophets.

249
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:19,279
We find that as we look at the passage of Scripture that is before us, and we understand

250
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,320
the superiority of the new covenant, then we look at number two, the specifics of the

251
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,359
new covenant.

252
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,160
We find, first of all, as we've mentioned here in verse number 8, and we'll get into

253
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,079
it in verses 10 through 12 as well, I want you to understand, number one, how it relates

254
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,079
to Israel.

255
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,559
How it relates to Israel.

256
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,200
Turn over, if you will, to Jeremiah 31.

257
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,639
Keep your place here in Hebrews chapter number 8, but turn to the book of Jeremiah.

258
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:45,839
Let's read this portion of Scripture in Jeremiah chapter number 31 with regard to this prophecy

259
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:51,320
that is being referenced in Hebrews chapter number 8.

260
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,119
In Jeremiah chapter number 31, we find that really beginning in verse number 31 down through

261
00:17:56,119 --> 00:18:01,359
verse number 34 will be the context in which we read here this morning of some of the promise

262
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,239
with regard to this new covenant.

263
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:06,119
Notice in verse number 31 of Jeremiah 31,

264
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:11,500
Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house

265
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,839
of Israel and with the house of Judah, not according to the covenant that I made with

266
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,919
their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land

267
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,919
of Egypt, which my covenant they break, although I was a husband unto them, saith the Lord.

268
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:26,119
Verse 33.

269
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:31,119
But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those

270
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:33,840
days, saith the Lord.

271
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,559
Remember that phrase, after those days, we're going to look at something with regard to

272
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,559
that in just a moment.

273
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,440
After those days, saith the Lord, let's look at what he's going to do.

274
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,619
I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their

275
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:52,580
God and they shall be my people and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor

276
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:57,500
and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord, for they shall all know me.

277
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,900
From the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord, for I will forgive their

278
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:06,380
iniquity and I will remember their sin no more.

279
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,279
So we're looking here at the specifics of the new covenant and understanding how this

280
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:13,219
relates to Israel as a nation.

281
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:19,219
Really the fullness of this prophecy that is given, the fullness of the blessings of

282
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:24,659
this new covenant, we understand that they'll be fully experienced by Israel during the

283
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:27,299
millennial reign of Christ.

284
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:33,580
That's when the fullness of this new covenant will be experienced by the house of Israel.

285
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:38,820
Notice that there, as I mentioned in verse number 33, when he said, after those days.

286
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,820
What's he speaking of?

287
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,979
Well, if you go back to chapter number 30 of the book of Jeremiah, notice what is said

288
00:19:44,979 --> 00:19:47,299
in verse number 7.

289
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:53,460
In Jeremiah 30 and verse number 7, the Bible says this, Alas, for that day is great so

290
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,380
that none is like it.

291
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:00,179
It is even, notice this phrase, the time of Jacob's trial.

292
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:04,699
Trouble, but he shall be saved out of it

293
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:07,339
You know he's talking about talking about the tribulation

294
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:14,299
Seven year period that we refer to as the day of Jacob's trouble. Who's Jacob? What was his name changed to?

295
00:20:14,699 --> 00:20:20,959
Israel right is the so we find that as we look here at the passage of Scripture in Jeremiah 30 in

296
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:28,419
View in verse number seven is the tribulation the time of Israel or Jacob's trouble as it's mentioned there

297
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:36,179
Specifically and so we see that that's the period of tribulation and then in Jeremiah chapter number 31 in verses 31 through 34

298
00:20:36,459 --> 00:20:38,579
He begins to talk about this new covenant

299
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:45,579
He gives us the timeline after those days that seven-year tribulation period there will be the millennial

300
00:20:45,939 --> 00:20:47,939
reign of Christ and

301
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:53,079
That's when the fullness of this new covenant will be

302
00:20:53,639 --> 00:20:59,779
Experienced by the house of Israel now the Bible is awesome. Go over to Romans chapter 11

303
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,599
Because really when we get to see all that's happening here. We begin to now keep your place in Hebrews

304
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:10,839
We're gonna get back there and I promise we're gonna look at the rest of the passage of Scripture

305
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:16,479
But it's important for us to understand the specifics of this new covenant and how it relates to Israel

306
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:20,239
but what happened so that Israel wasn't the

307
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:27,239
Immediate recipient of all of these things they resisted and rejected Messiah

308
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,759
Israel as a nation

309
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,239
Rejected Messiah. What did they say? We have no king

310
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:39,899
Right. What did they say crucify him, right?

311
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:46,359
So they said they rejected Messiah not every individual Jewish person rejected Messiah

312
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:48,399
But as a nation

313
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:52,039
Corporately or collectively the nation of Israel

314
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:57,479
Rejected their Messiah, by the way, there are still Jewish people that get saved today

315
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:03,559
But they have to be saved the way that we are saved through the gospel of Jesus Christ

316
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:09,919
There are false teachers that would proclaim that just because you're of Jewish descent that you're a child of God

317
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,639
And you don't have to worry about it

318
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:16,639
That is a heresy from the pit of hell that will condemn people to eternal damnation

319
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:18,959
Amen

320
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:23,799
the reality is that even to this very day as a

321
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:30,439
Nation the Jewish people reject that Jesus Christ is the Messiah

322
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:33,719
There are individuals that are getting saved today

323
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:37,959
You're seeing you there are Jewish believers and we're thankful for that

324
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:44,439
Remember the gospel is the power of God unto salvation to the Jew first and then also to the Greek right to the Gentile

325
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:50,159
And so as we look in Romans chapter 11, and I hope to package all this together for you this morning

326
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,159
It's a whole lot, but I trust we can get through it in verse number 16. We're gonna kind of start there

327
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:58,239
We could look at the entirety of the chapter, but for sake of time

328
00:22:58,239 --> 00:23:00,939
Let me jump in in verse number 16 of Romans 11

329
00:23:01,419 --> 00:23:06,619
It says for if the first fruit be holy the lump is also holy and if the root be holy

330
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:14,259
So are the branches and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild olive tree

331
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:19,819
work graft in among them and with them partake gist of the root and

332
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:22,699
fatness of the olive tree

333
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:25,419
Says in verse number 18 boasts not against the branches

334
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:28,179
But if thou boasts thou bearest not the root but the root thee

335
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:34,299
Thou will say then the branches were broken off that I might be graft in you say what in the world is he talking about?

336
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:39,699
He's talking about the house of Israel the Jewish people and the Gentiles

337
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:44,419
We find that the explanation is can I'm looking verse number 20 well

338
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:47,459
because of

339
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,539
unbelief

340
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:49,899
they

341
00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:54,459
Circle it underline it make sure you understand they were broken off

342
00:23:54,459 --> 00:23:57,959
What was he referring to earlier that were broken off the branches?

343
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:03,979
He's using this illustration of this olive tree and he's talking about the branches that are broken off

344
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:09,979
And then he says they the branches were broken off because why because of unbelief

345
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:14,739
Who's they that's the Jewish people Israel as a nation?

346
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:20,220
And so we find that it continues in verse number 20 and it says and thou

347
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:25,619
Standest by faith. So you see there's a contrast between they and thou

348
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:30,660
We then find at the end of verse number 20. It says be not high-minded

349
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:34,139
But fear

350
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:39,539
Verse 21 for if God spared not the natural branches

351
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,139
Take heed lest he also spare not thee

352
00:24:44,139 --> 00:24:46,539
This is the warning verse 22 behold

353
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:52,699
Therefore the goodness and severity of God on them which fell severity, but toward thee

354
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:59,419
goodness if thou continue in his goodness, otherwise thou also shall be cut off and

355
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:05,660
They also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be graft in for God is able to graft them in again

356
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:11,979
And so again in verse number 23 gives the provision for Jewish people to be saved even during this time that we call the church age

357
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:19,899
And we find here that it continues in verse 24 for if thou were cut out of the olive tree, which is by

358
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:27,220
Wild which is wild by nature and were graft contrary to nature into a good olive tree

359
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:33,619
How much more shall these which be the natural branches be graft into?

360
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:39,859
Their own olive tree it makes sense, right and he's using this he's going through he's given this explanation

361
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:47,019
and then you come to verses 25 and 26 and you see the fullness again of the truth of the millennial reign of Christ and

362
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:54,299
Understanding God's timeline. It says in verse number 25 for I would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery

363
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,699
God wants us to be informed. He doesn't want us to be ignorant. He doesn't want us to be in the dark

364
00:26:00,139 --> 00:26:05,940
He wants us to understand his plan for the ages and we find that as he's giving this instruction

365
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:08,579
That he mentions right within the text

366
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:13,179
I don't want you to be ignorant of this and we find that as he would speak about the mystery

367
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:15,019
remember the Apostle Paul uses the

368
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:16,220
phraseology of mystery

369
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,619
Paul's the human author here of the book of Romans in the book of Ephesians when he talks about the mystery

370
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:25,579
What's he talking about the church? That's gonna be made up of Jew and Gentile right in the church

371
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:29,299
Right, we're the church. What a blessing

372
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,220
We find that it says in verse number 25

373
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,419
It says lest he should be wise in your own conceits

374
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:44,820
Notice this that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles

375
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:47,820
become in

376
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,619
Do you remember John 9 the healing of the man that was born blind?

377
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:58,339
There's a great discourse that takes place there in John chapter 9. This man was born blind the disciples immediately say hey

378
00:26:58,339 --> 00:27:01,059
Who sinned his parents or him? I mean he was born blind. What's going on?

379
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:05,899
They go through this whole process. The man is healed and he's in just

380
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:11,380
Interrogated by the Jewish leaders of the day as to what happened. How did this happen?

381
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:16,339
He's like look I've told you I've told you and I've told you a man named Jesus. Here's what he did

382
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:21,179
He healed me and you go through the passage and you begin to see how that this man

383
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:26,839
Of course, he's excommunicated because he is gonna be a disciple of Jesus and he says if I tell you again

384
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:32,160
Are you gonna become his disciples and they're full with rage because we are the disciples of Moses, right?

385
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:36,399
I mean, they're not just having it right? They don't want anything to do with it and then

386
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,479
Some of the Jewish people say to Jesus are we blind also?

387
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:43,239
The answer was yes

388
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,759
Not that you're blind physically, but you're blind spiritually

389
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,199
Remember what it says to us in 2nd Corinthians chapter number 4 the God of this world have blinded the minds of them that believe

390
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:59,279
Lest the light of the glorious gospel should shine in unto them, right? The enemy is in the process of

391
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:03,679
Blinding and we find that he does that not just for Jews

392
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,699
But for Gentiles alike this this work that he does of blinding

393
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:13,380
But we find here the Bible says that blindness in part is happened to Israel into the fullness of the Gentiles become in

394
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,579
So because Israel rejected Messiah

395
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:22,100
The Church Age as we often refer to it as has been

396
00:28:22,459 --> 00:28:27,419
Established and here we are in this opportunity to receive the blessing

397
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:30,459
Notice it says into the fullness of the Gentiles become in

398
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:37,380
It talks about the blessing that we receive and what a blessing it is to know the Lord Jesus Christ is our personal Savior

399
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,979
And it says in verse number 26

400
00:28:38,979 --> 00:28:45,460
And so all Israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out a sign to deliver and shall turn away

401
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:52,500
Ungodliness from Jacob for this is my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins

402
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:54,659
What's the referring to the new covenant?

403
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:56,659
Here's where people get messed up

404
00:28:56,659 --> 00:29:00,739
They look at verse number 26 and it says so all Israel shall be saved and they say there you go seals the deal

405
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,299
No, no at the time of the Millennium

406
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:08,779
Because here's what's gonna happen if I can just kind of overview it very quickly

407
00:29:09,339 --> 00:29:15,099
At some point and I believe soon the trumpet of the Lord is gonna sound and we're gonna be raptured out of here

408
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:21,859
That is the next event on God's prophetic calendar. Amen the snatching away of the Saints the rapture

409
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:27,700
We can read of that in 1st Thessalonians chapter 4 and we can understand the truth that is contained therein

410
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:31,140
With regard to the rapture immediately following the rapture of the church

411
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,859
Immediately the timeline starts for the seven-year tribulation

412
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,700
You can read of that in Revelation. You can read of all of the

413
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:44,299
Judgments that will be unfolded and just I mean it is gonna be a terrible time upon earth

414
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:47,380
But here's what's happening if I can use this analogy

415
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:53,059
God for this period that we call the church age if we could pretend that there's a stove top here

416
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:59,739
He's taken Israel and he's put him on the back burner and he's dealing with the church right now as the church age

417
00:29:59,739 --> 00:30:06,739
But once the rapture takes place, the church is removed, amen, now Israel comes to the

418
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:09,819
front burner, if I can use that analogy.

419
00:30:09,819 --> 00:30:15,499
And what's happening is we see in Jeremiah 30, verse number 7, this is the time of Jacob's

420
00:30:15,499 --> 00:30:16,899
trouble.

421
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:21,019
That seven year period of time that we refer to as the tribulation, what is God doing?

422
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:24,679
He's dealing with Israel as a nation.

423
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:30,399
And as he's dealing with Israel as a nation, then comes at the end of the tribulation,

424
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,799
the return of Christ, the battle of Armageddon, you read of all of those things that take

425
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:39,039
place there throughout the book of Revelation, and then you find the millennial reign of

426
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,039
Christ.

427
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:44,559
And it's at that point that we see the fullness of this new covenant.

428
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,439
And so it's important that we understand the prophecy in Jeremiah, the truth in Romans

429
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:55,159
chapter 11, as we take and unfold that which is given to us here in Hebrews chapter number

430
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:56,239
8.

431
00:30:56,239 --> 00:31:00,359
Because the reality is that when we speak about this new covenant, and we think about

432
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:07,299
the specifics that it is with regard how it relates to Israel as a nation, is one aspect

433
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:08,719
of what we have to consider.

434
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:12,639
Now go back to Hebrews chapter number 8, we won't go back to the book of Jeremiah, you

435
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:16,839
might want to keep your place there in Romans 11, I may go back in just a moment, it depends

436
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:18,639
on how the time goes.

437
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:23,199
Let me mention here five aspects, if you will, that are given to us with regard to

438
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:28,119
the specifics of this new covenant in verses 10 down through verse number 12.

439
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:34,279
Notice, for this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those

440
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:36,519
days, saith the Lord.

441
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:40,159
Again, this is a quote from what we see in Jeremiah 31.

442
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:46,239
Notice it says, I will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts.

443
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:51,039
So that's the first aspect, specific, if you will, with regard to this new covenant,

444
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,039
and opposed to being a table of stone, which would have been the old covenant.

445
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,359
And you understand, really, this is through the work of the Holy Spirit.

446
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:03,839
We find that it continues in verse number 10, it says, I will be to them a God, and

447
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,039
they shall be to me a people.

448
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,759
And we'll look at some of these things here as we get through and begin to see not only

449
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:13,919
how it relates to Israel, but how it relates to us today.

450
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,499
Notice in verse number 11, they shall not teach every man his neighbor and every man

451
00:32:17,499 --> 00:32:23,039
his brother, saying, Know the Lord, for all shall know me from the least to the greatest.

452
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,519
Can I tell you, that's not the case today, right?

453
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,959
Do you know that that's not the case today?

454
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:33,559
And so therefore, we understand that this new covenant in its fullness, in its entirety,

455
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:35,839
we're not experiencing this yet.

456
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:42,239
Notice in verse number 12, for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and it says this

457
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:48,479
in really the fifth aspect, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.

458
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:54,279
As we begin to think about these aspects and the specifics of this new covenant as it's

459
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:58,959
given here in Hebrews chapter number 8, again, remember, he's writing and he's helping these

460
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:03,079
believers understand that we have a high priest.

461
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:09,399
He ministers in a better place, he has presented a better offering, he offered himself, and

462
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:13,159
then he begins to talk about the fact that he has obtained a more excellent ministry.

463
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:14,159
Why?

464
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,599
Because he's the mediator of a better covenant.

465
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:18,719
It begins to unfold this.

466
00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:24,039
Now, as we understand how the new covenant relates to Israel, it's also important for

467
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:28,159
us to understand how it relates to individual believers today.

468
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:33,359
Yes, it relates to Israel as a nation, we see it in its fullness as we've gone through

469
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,959
great lengths to deal with that this morning, but we must also understand that this new

470
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:42,119
covenant relates to individual believers today.

471
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:43,639
How do we know that?

472
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:49,319
Well, let me mention what Paul says in 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and verse number 6.

473
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:55,719
He says, who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament, the new covenant.

474
00:33:55,719 --> 00:34:02,679
So if God hath made us able ministers of this new covenant, we understand that there are

475
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:07,479
aspects of this new covenant that relate to us today as individual believers.

476
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:12,159
Again, we must understand the church is not spiritual Israel.

477
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,959
When you go down that path, you start really messing up all kinds of things, and it becomes

478
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:22,239
very challenging to interpret Scripture properly, and if you understand that Israel is a separate

479
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:28,759
entity in its entirety from the church, and the church now, as we look at the blessings

480
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:36,119
as how this new covenant relates to the individual believers, we can understand the blessings

481
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,799
of salvation.

482
00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:41,359
Remember in Romans chapter 11, as we looked at the passage of Scripture, it spoke about

483
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:46,279
the fact how we were graft in, and you understand that because of the rejection, because of

484
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:52,599
their unbelief, then we that were wild, that we were from that wild olive tree, that we

485
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:58,919
were graft in, and therefore we get to enjoy the blessings of salvation even today as individual

486
00:34:58,919 --> 00:35:00,599
believers.

487
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:06,160
Consider with me the Holy Spirit of God, how He works, and how He has given one of His

488
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,479
roles as being the divine teacher.

489
00:35:09,479 --> 00:35:11,079
He leads us into all truth.

490
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:15,279
It's one of the responsibilities and roles of the Holy Spirit of God.

491
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,359
Consider that there in Hebrews 8, it talks about the fact that I will be to them a God

492
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:19,959
and they shall be to me a people.

493
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:23,440
Aren't you thankful for the truth of John 1 in verse number 12, but as many as received

494
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,479
Him to them gave He power to become the sons of God.

495
00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:30,119
Aren't you thankful that you can say He is my God?

496
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:34,440
Deborah sang this morning about my shepherd, the Lord is my shepherd.

497
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:40,199
Aren't you thankful this morning that we as Gentiles, that we can understand the blessings

498
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:48,000
of this new covenant by way of salvation, because of what was accomplished at Calvary?

499
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:53,440
Again, the fullness of the new covenant will not be realized until the millennial reign

500
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,440
of Christ.

501
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,239
By the way, those of us that are saved will rule and reign with Christ during the millennial

502
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,239
reign of Christ.

503
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:02,639
We don't have time to get into all that this morning, but it's an amazing truth of the

504
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:04,279
Word of God.

505
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:11,519
And we find here that this new covenant that the writer of Hebrews is dealing with and

506
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:16,380
addressing and giving these details as we begin to interpret Scripture with Scripture,

507
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,699
we can rejoice really at this particular time in history.

508
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:26,500
We can rejoice in the plan that God has for the nation of Israel, but we also understand

509
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:31,299
that as individual believers today, we are the recipients of these blessings of the new

510
00:36:31,299 --> 00:36:35,699
covenant through Calvary, through what the Lord Jesus Christ accomplished on the cross

511
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:36,940
of Calvary.

512
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:40,819
The Apostle Paul often during his ministry in the book of Acts, you'll find that he preaches

513
00:36:40,819 --> 00:36:44,399
and teaches that this Jesus is Christ.

514
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:48,119
They knew who Jesus was as a human figure.

515
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:53,759
They understood, many of them in the book of Acts that Paul would minister to, especially

516
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:57,679
those that were within the synagogues that he would travel and go to those particular

517
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:00,599
regions and he would first go into the synagogue.

518
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:06,919
They would have a knowledge of Jesus, the man that was crucified.

519
00:37:06,919 --> 00:37:12,679
But he says this Jesus is the Christ, the Messiah, the Promised One.

520
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:18,239
He is the one that you've been looking for, but you missed it.

521
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:20,359
You rejected him.

522
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:29,759
You find that Paul has a great desire to see his brethren, his kinfolk, his Jewish counterparts

523
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:33,880
to come to the knowledge of salvation through the Lord Jesus Christ.

524
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:40,759
But we understand that Paul is often referred to himself as the Apostle to the Gentiles.

525
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:45,880
So we understand that there, as we look at this passage of Scripture and we can begin

526
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:52,759
to think about the prophecy that was given in Jeremiah chapter number 31, that prophecy

527
00:37:52,759 --> 00:37:59,000
still stands true that God is going to make this new covenant in its fullness with the

528
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,839
house of Israel and the house of Judah during the time of the millennial reign of Christ.

529
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:09,519
But today, as individual believers, we get to be partakers of these blessings.

530
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:10,519
Why?

531
00:38:11,279 --> 00:38:12,279
Because we are grafted in.

532
00:38:12,279 --> 00:38:17,319
It's a beautiful picture of what we find here for the church age and the blessings

533
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:19,479
that we get to receive.

534
00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:20,759
What a joy.

535
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:25,479
By the way, it's important for us to understand that God was not in the dark about any of

536
00:38:25,479 --> 00:38:26,479
these things.

537
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:27,720
He knew all of this was going to happen.

538
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,959
He knew that his people would reject him.

539
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:34,000
He understood all of these things and he made provision, therefore, as we find as the Bible

540
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,359
unfolds.

541
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:43,919
In this passage of Scripture, we find this truth with regard to the new covenant and

542
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:48,599
we need to understand what Paul said in that passage in 2 Corinthians 3.

543
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:49,599
In fact, let's turn back there.

544
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,399
Let me read that to you again because I want you to understand, okay, this is great that

545
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:59,159
we understand this new covenant and the fact that it's superior because why?

546
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:04,919
Because Jesus is the surety and Jesus is the mediator and we're rejoicing in that and we

547
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:08,399
understand that it's superior and we understand some of the specifics and we've gone through

548
00:39:08,399 --> 00:39:13,080
them somewhat quickly this morning, but we unfold and kind of peel back the pages of

549
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:17,279
Scripture and begin to see the plan that God has for the ages.

550
00:39:17,279 --> 00:39:21,559
But notice what Paul says here in 2 Corinthians 3.

551
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:28,200
It's interesting because he says in chapter 4, therefore seeing we have this ministry,

552
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,459
but notice how he introduces this in chapter 3.

553
00:39:31,459 --> 00:39:36,659
He says in verse number 4, and such trust have we through Christ to Godward, not that

554
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:41,099
we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of

555
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:49,940
God, who also hath made us able ministers to the New Testament, not of the letter, but

556
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,440
of the Spirit.

557
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,179
For the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.

558
00:39:56,179 --> 00:39:59,779
As you begin to understand what Paul is saying here, and even as you...

559
00:39:59,779 --> 00:40:01,859
Compare that with what Paul is giving

560
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:04,219
to the believers in the region of Galatia

561
00:40:04,219 --> 00:40:05,939
when he speaks about the law

562
00:40:05,939 --> 00:40:08,939
and how that it could not give life.

563
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:11,339
He says that if there had been a law

564
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:13,779
that was given which could have given life,

565
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:16,279
verily, righteousness should have been by the law.

566
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:17,779
But no, it couldn't give life.

567
00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:20,059
What did the law do? It condemned.

568
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:23,099
It said you're guilty.

569
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:24,099
Right?

570
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:27,339
It was a schoolmaster in Galatians 3.

571
00:40:27,339 --> 00:40:29,979
We find that here as we looked at that,

572
00:40:29,979 --> 00:40:33,059
why did we look at the overview of the book of Exodus

573
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:34,899
at the very beginning of the message?

574
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:36,659
Because we understand that as the law,

575
00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:38,459
that first covenant was given,

576
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:43,139
that it was broken straight away.

577
00:40:43,139 --> 00:40:47,339
Showing that the law condemns.

578
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:50,139
But here we find that Paul says

579
00:40:50,139 --> 00:40:51,859
that God hath made us.

580
00:40:51,859 --> 00:40:52,859
He is the One.

581
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:55,059
Our sufficiency is of God.

582
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:56,819
We don't go on our own power.

583
00:40:57,339 --> 00:41:00,059
We go as we're filled with the power of the Holy Spirit.

584
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:02,099
In Acts 1 and verse number 8,

585
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:04,699
we understand the truth of the responsibility

586
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:07,699
that has been given to us to go and to be a witness.

587
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:12,259
But he says that we are made able ministers

588
00:41:12,259 --> 00:41:15,139
of the New Testament, this new covenant.

589
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,819
So therefore we get to go out

590
00:41:16,819 --> 00:41:20,219
and we get to share the gospel of Jesus Christ

591
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:23,459
to let people understand what was accomplished

592
00:41:23,459 --> 00:41:25,979
by the substitutionary death, burial

593
00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:29,979
and glorious resurrection of Jesus Christ, our Savior.

594
00:41:29,979 --> 00:41:32,619
That these blessings are available

595
00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:35,419
as Paul would say there to the believers in Rome

596
00:41:35,419 --> 00:41:37,499
as he begins that great book.

597
00:41:37,499 --> 00:41:39,699
He says, speaking of the gospel,

598
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:41,739
of course he understood that he was a debtor,

599
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:42,579
that he was ready.

600
00:41:42,579 --> 00:41:45,419
He said, I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ

601
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:49,299
for it is the power of God unto salvation

602
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:51,459
to everyone that believeth,

603
00:41:51,459 --> 00:41:55,859
to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

604
00:41:55,979 --> 00:41:58,859
He says that God hath made us to be able ministers.

605
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:01,899
He says in 2 Corinthians 4 and verse number 1

606
00:42:01,899 --> 00:42:04,299
that we have this ministry.

607
00:42:05,299 --> 00:42:07,699
Therefore seeing we have this ministry

608
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:11,459
as we have received mercy, we faint not.

609
00:42:11,459 --> 00:42:13,659
Notice what he says in verse number...

610
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,539
Man, we should read the whole thing.

611
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:18,299
Verse number 3, if our gospel be hid,

612
00:42:18,299 --> 00:42:21,339
it is hid to them that are lost.

613
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:22,179
Right?

614
00:42:22,179 --> 00:42:23,779
Remember he said that he made us able ministers

615
00:42:23,779 --> 00:42:25,899
of this New Covenant, this New Testament,

616
00:42:25,899 --> 00:42:26,859
that we would go.

617
00:42:26,859 --> 00:42:29,059
We've received this ministry that we faint not.

618
00:42:29,059 --> 00:42:31,659
If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost

619
00:42:31,659 --> 00:42:32,979
in whom the God of this world

620
00:42:32,979 --> 00:42:35,379
hath blinded the minds of them which believe not.

621
00:42:35,379 --> 00:42:37,499
Lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ

622
00:42:37,499 --> 00:42:39,699
who is the image of God should shine unto them

623
00:42:39,699 --> 00:42:41,299
for we preach not ourselves,

624
00:42:41,299 --> 00:42:43,459
but Christ Jesus the Lord

625
00:42:43,459 --> 00:42:45,739
and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.

626
00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:47,059
Notice verse number 7.

627
00:42:47,059 --> 00:42:50,579
We have this treasure in earthen vessels

628
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:52,779
that the excellency of the power may be of God

629
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,219
and not of us.

630
00:42:54,219 --> 00:42:55,779
Notice verse 16.

631
00:42:55,779 --> 00:42:57,379
For which cause we faint not,

632
00:42:57,379 --> 00:42:58,939
but though our outward man perish,

633
00:42:58,939 --> 00:43:01,699
yet the inward man is renewed day by day

634
00:43:01,699 --> 00:43:04,019
for our light affliction, which is but for a moment,

635
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:05,979
worketh for us a far more exceeding

636
00:43:05,979 --> 00:43:07,939
and eternal weight of glory.

637
00:43:07,939 --> 00:43:09,619
While we look not at the things which are seen,

638
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:11,379
but at the things which are not seen,

639
00:43:11,379 --> 00:43:14,099
but the things which are not seen,

640
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:16,539
excuse me, for the things which are seen are temporal,

641
00:43:16,539 --> 00:43:20,139
but the things which are not seen are eternal.

642
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:24,019
So what's the understanding as we take away this morning

643
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:27,499
from this passage that there's a better covenant?

644
00:43:27,499 --> 00:43:28,939
The fact of the matter is that we understand

645
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,739
the details of it, and that's good.

646
00:43:31,659 --> 00:43:34,579
But it ought to motivate us to do something about it.

647
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:35,419
Amen?

648
00:43:35,419 --> 00:43:37,139
Yes, that we are the recipients

649
00:43:37,139 --> 00:43:39,419
of these blessings spiritually.

650
00:43:39,419 --> 00:43:42,459
We understand, again, the fullness of this new covenant

651
00:43:42,459 --> 00:43:43,859
during the millennial reign of Christ,

652
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:45,299
but as I have been a recipient

653
00:43:45,299 --> 00:43:47,659
of the gospel of Jesus Christ,

654
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:50,539
as I now have been able to be graft in

655
00:43:50,539 --> 00:43:53,579
and to experience those blessings of salvation,

656
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:55,459
I understand that I have been made,

657
00:43:55,459 --> 00:43:58,219
you have been made an able minister

658
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,619
of this new covenant, of this new testament,

659
00:44:00,619 --> 00:44:04,219
and if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.

660
00:44:04,219 --> 00:44:07,379
We have this treasure in earthen vessels.

661
00:44:07,379 --> 00:44:08,859
So it's not that we just go around

662
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:10,859
and theologically understand this thing

663
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:12,899
of a new covenant or a better covenant.

664
00:44:12,899 --> 00:44:14,819
It's that we actively go out and say,

665
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:19,139
listen, Jesus did this so that you could be saved.

666
00:44:20,139 --> 00:44:21,259
Amen?

667
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:23,859
The gospel is the power of God unto salvation.

668
00:44:23,859 --> 00:44:25,379
The Jew first, also the Greek.

669
00:44:25,379 --> 00:44:26,539
And so we understand, listen,

670
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:29,419
this is an amazing truth of God's word,

671
00:44:29,419 --> 00:44:31,819
this new covenant, this better covenant,

672
00:44:31,819 --> 00:44:35,259
but it's not a truth that we hold to ourselves.

673
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:37,739
It's a truth that we go and proclaim,

674
00:44:37,739 --> 00:44:39,379
that we go and send a light,

675
00:44:39,379 --> 00:44:43,139
as we have on our wall over here in our,

676
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:44,739
we have our missions board over here,

677
00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:48,179
and we go and proclaim this truth of send the light.

678
00:44:48,179 --> 00:44:51,779
And really, as we enter into the church house

679
00:44:51,779 --> 00:44:52,779
that God has given us,

680
00:44:52,779 --> 00:44:54,259
that we're reminded of the truth

681
00:44:54,259 --> 00:44:56,179
and the responsibility that we have

682
00:44:56,179 --> 00:44:59,419
to go and preach the gospel to every creature.

683
00:44:59,419 --> 00:45:02,899
Paul says he's made us able ministers.

684
00:45:02,899 --> 00:45:06,659
He says, go and preach the gospel to every creature.

685
00:45:06,659 --> 00:45:09,459
He says, I will be with you always.

686
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:10,859
Aren't you thankful for the promise

687
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:12,699
that God will be with us?

688
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:13,979
And so we understand the details

689
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:16,739
and what a great truth that is given

690
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:19,659
with regard to this new, better covenant,

691
00:45:19,659 --> 00:45:23,299
but we have to understand how it would impact us today.

692
00:45:23,299 --> 00:45:25,699
Yes, that we would be saved, that's wonderful.

693
00:45:27,419 --> 00:45:30,779
There's a world of lost people that need the gospel.

694
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:33,859
And the question is this,

695
00:45:33,859 --> 00:45:34,939
who's gonna tell them?

696
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:37,019
Who will tell them?

697
00:45:39,459 --> 00:45:42,299
It's gotta be somebody that knows the truth, right?

698
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,139
You know, there are a lot of people out there

699
00:45:44,139 --> 00:45:48,539
that are propagating false teaching, right?

700
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:51,419
A lot of people, a lot of false teachers.

701
00:45:51,419 --> 00:45:53,139
We understand that the Bible prophesies

702
00:45:53,139 --> 00:45:54,419
that that's gonna happen in the last days.

703
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,979
There's gonna be a lot of false teachers.

704
00:45:55,979 --> 00:45:57,379
Just as there have been false prophets,

705
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:58,539
so will there be false teachers.

706
00:45:58,539 --> 00:45:59,379
That's what Peter uses.

707
00:45:59,379 --> 00:46:01,779
He uses the example of the Old Testament, Israel,

708
00:46:01,779 --> 00:46:04,739
with all of the false prophets, and there were many.

709
00:46:04,739 --> 00:46:08,099
There are many false teachers, but we have the truth.

710
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,699
And so we don't walk away from a passage

711
00:46:09,699 --> 00:46:11,139
like Hebrews 8, saying, man, that's wonderful

712
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:13,339
to understand this theology and all that takes place

713
00:46:13,339 --> 00:46:18,059
and the eschatological, the timeline and the chart

714
00:46:18,059 --> 00:46:19,699
and all that's gonna happen in the end times

715
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:21,579
and the eschatology with regard to the rapture

716
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:22,699
and the tribulation and the millennial,

717
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:24,659
so on and so forth, and how this is all fulfilled.

718
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:26,459
That's great, and it's important to understand

719
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:28,479
and to have that foundation.

720
00:46:28,479 --> 00:46:30,499
But what does it do for us today?

721
00:46:30,499 --> 00:46:32,339
How's it motivate us today?

722
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:33,979
The trumpet of the Lord's gonna sound.

723
00:46:33,979 --> 00:46:36,239
I don't know when it's gonna sound.

724
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:38,779
But as I mentioned in previous messages,

725
00:46:38,779 --> 00:46:40,279
whenever that time happens,

726
00:46:40,279 --> 00:46:41,879
whenever that trumpet sounds,

727
00:46:41,879 --> 00:46:44,279
I preached a couple of Sunday nights ago,

728
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:46,319
this truth, go and tell.

729
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:50,239
The only time I have to go and tell anyone

730
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:52,559
is while I'm still here on earth.

731
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:53,919
Because during the millennial reign

732
00:46:53,919 --> 00:46:55,079
and during all of eternity,

733
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:56,719
I don't need to tell anybody about Jesus

734
00:46:56,719 --> 00:46:58,519
because they'll already know.

735
00:46:58,519 --> 00:46:59,679
Amen?

736
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:03,159
And so the moment is now, and if our gospel's hid,

737
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:04,979
it's hidden to them that are lost.

738
00:47:04,979 --> 00:47:06,099
A better covenant.

739
00:47:06,099 --> 00:47:08,319
Aren't you thankful for the truth of God's word?

740
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:09,159
Let's pray together.

741
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:12,039
We love you, we thank you for loving us.

742
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:15,439
We thank you for the passage that is before us this morning

743
00:47:15,439 --> 00:47:20,439
for the truth that this better covenant is superior

744
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:24,679
because the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

745
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:26,199
is the surety of this covenant,

746
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:28,159
is the mediator of this covenant.

747
00:47:29,999 --> 00:47:31,199
We thank you for the opportunity

748
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:33,379
of looking at the specifics of this new covenant,

749
00:47:33,379 --> 00:47:34,539
this better covenant,

750
00:47:35,459 --> 00:47:37,739
with how it relates to Israel as a nation.

751
00:47:38,659 --> 00:47:40,819
As we consider how it relates to us

752
00:47:40,819 --> 00:47:43,539
as individual believers today.

753
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:47,539
What a joy to understand that the gospel

754
00:47:47,539 --> 00:47:49,539
has now been made available to us

755
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:51,099
and we can be grafted in.

756
00:47:52,759 --> 00:47:54,299
Lord, I pray that you would help us

757
00:47:54,299 --> 00:47:58,979
to understand the blessings of this truth.

758
00:47:58,979 --> 00:48:02,779
It'd help us to be burdened to take this message

759
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:04,519
to a lost and dying world.

760
00:48:07,779 --> 00:48:11,099
We don't seek to set a date or any of those things

761
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:13,499
which you've forbidden us to do.

762
00:48:13,499 --> 00:48:14,939
But God, we acknowledge this morning

763
00:48:14,939 --> 00:48:16,819
that we're living in the last days.

764
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:21,099
You've told us that we're to redeem the time.

765
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:24,619
We're to be busy about the work that you've called us to do.

766
00:48:24,619 --> 00:48:27,139
We thank you that Paul recognized

767
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:28,939
and even as we would look at the passage

768
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:33,299
and understand the way in which it relates to us

769
00:48:33,299 --> 00:48:34,939
that you have made us able ministers

770
00:48:34,939 --> 00:48:37,459
of this new testament, of this new covenant.

771
00:48:38,179 --> 00:48:42,619
God, would you help us to boldly proclaim

772
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,619
the truth of your word

773
00:48:44,619 --> 00:48:46,899
that we would preach the gospel of Jesus Christ

774
00:48:46,899 --> 00:48:49,619
to those that you would give us opportunity

775
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:53,219
that would understand the blessings

776
00:48:54,739 --> 00:48:57,139
that accompany salvation.

777
00:48:57,139 --> 00:48:59,019
Lord, if there's one that's not sure of heaven,

778
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,899
I pray that today would be the day of their salvation.

779
00:49:01,899 --> 00:49:03,419
I pray that not one person would leave here

780
00:49:03,419 --> 00:49:06,579
without knowing for sure that heaven is their home.

781
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:08,979
I pray that during this time of invitation

782
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:10,379
that you alone would be glorified,

783
00:49:10,379 --> 00:49:12,699
that you'd work in hearts and lives.

784
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:16,819
Help us to have a spirit, a heart of thankfulness

785
00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:20,379
for the blessings that accompany salvation.

786
00:49:20,379 --> 00:49:22,059
Help us to have a heart of commitment

787
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:25,259
to go and to take this message to a lost and dying world.

788
00:49:26,139 --> 00:49:27,459
Well, thank you for all that you'll do

789
00:49:27,459 --> 00:49:29,339
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

790
00:49:29,339 --> 00:49:30,179
Would you stand with me?

791
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:32,099
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

792
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:33,859
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano

793
00:49:33,859 --> 00:49:35,459
and as she does, the altar's open.

794
00:49:35,459 --> 00:49:37,099
Have a time of invitation.

795
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,659
You're welcome to move around the auditorium

796
00:49:38,659 --> 00:49:40,259
and come up here to this old-fashioned altar

797
00:49:40,259 --> 00:49:42,019
or you can pray right there in your seat.

798
00:49:42,019 --> 00:49:43,819
Make your seat and altar.

799
00:49:43,819 --> 00:49:46,019
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
