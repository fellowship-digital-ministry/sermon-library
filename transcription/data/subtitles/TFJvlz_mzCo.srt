1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
Number eight, I know that America is not perfect.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,960
There is no nation that is perfect.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,000
We understand that to be the case,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,159
but I am so thankful that in God's providence,

5
00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:13,239
He allowed this nation to be founded.

6
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:15,319
And again, for as many of its wrongs,

7
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:16,959
there's so many rights.

8
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:20,879
And so thankful our land is under attack.

9
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:21,719
Amen.

10
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:25,280
And there are many that would love to see America destroyed,

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,639
not only from without, but from within.

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,000
And I am thankful for the way that God has used this nation

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,840
over the years in the history of our nation.

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,520
You think about the missionaries that have gone out

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,240
from America all across this globe,

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,880
preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ,

17
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,520
the freedom that we have had in this land

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,959
to assemble together, to proclaim the truth of the gospel.

19
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:51,119
And what a blessing.

20
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,040
You know, you can leave here this afternoon

21
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,040
and you can go out and you can find someone

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,880
and you can talk to them about Jesus.

23
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:58,520
And you don't have to be afraid.

24
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,279
You don't have to fear any kind of persecution.

25
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:03,000
You're not gonna be in prison for it.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,480
I understand they might not like it.

27
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,800
I know there are many people that do not like it,

28
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,480
but the reality is that we have freedom to do that.

29
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,760
And that is wonderful.

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,760
And I'm so thankful for that.

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,040
The freedom that we celebrate as Americans,

32
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,160
I believe is both unique and special.

33
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,239
And we think about that,

34
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,879
the truth that many around the globe today,

35
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:27,040
they do not know what it is to live

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,400
in a country such as ours.

37
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,440
They do not know what it is to have the freedoms

38
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,400
that we so regularly take for granted.

39
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,120
We understand there are many millions upon millions

40
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,279
of people around the globe that desire to come to America.

41
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:44,559
And what draws them here?

42
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:46,199
What is it that they're looking for?

43
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:47,800
And you think about those freedoms

44
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,800
that we just are so grateful to enjoy.

45
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:56,720
But the reality this morning is that as a child of God,

46
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,720
the freedom that we have in America pales

47
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,800
in comparison to the freedom that we have in Christ.

48
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,000
And I'm thankful for the freedom that we have in America.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,040
Don't get me wrong.

50
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,080
But the freedom that we have in Christ is so much greater.

51
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,839
And the reality this morning is that the freedom

52
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:17,559
that we have in Christ, that freedom is offered,

53
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:20,399
it is available to any human being

54
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:24,520
without regard of what their citizenship status might be.

55
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,839
You think about people all across this globe,

56
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:28,759
you think of some of the darkest,

57
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:32,720
some of the most strict nations upon the face of this earth,

58
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,199
they have no freedoms whatsoever,

59
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,600
but yet they can have freedom through Christ.

60
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,679
And that is precious, that is powerful.

61
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:45,919
And we ought to rejoice in that freedom that Christ offers.

62
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:48,839
In John chapter number eight, our text for this morning,

63
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:51,479
we'll look at a number of passages of scripture,

64
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,960
but we find that Jesus is speaking here

65
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,479
to some religious leaders, and often as the case was,

66
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,720
there'd be debate and dialogue.

67
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,919
And we find here in this text of scripture,

68
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,759
we'll pick up right in the middle, in verse number 32,

69
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,119
notice the proclamation of Jesus.

70
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:12,000
He says, and ye shall know the truth,

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,320
and the truth shall make you free.

72
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,880
They answered him, these religious leaders,

73
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,119
these men that he's speaking to, they say,

74
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,360
we be Abraham's seed,

75
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,759
and we're never in bondage to any man.

76
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:33,720
How sayest thou, ye shall be made free?

77
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,080
Jesus answered them, verily, verily, I say unto you,

78
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,080
whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.

79
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,000
And the servant abideth not in the house forever,

80
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:47,520
but the son abideth ever.

81
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,800
If the son therefore shall make you free,

82
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,639
ye shall be free indeed.

83
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,919
I've adopted the latter statement in verse number 32

84
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,679
for our title this morning.

85
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:03,839
The truth shall make you free.

86
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:06,800
As we find this word free that is used

87
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,720
in our text of scripture and other places in the scripture,

88
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,119
we'll look at a few of those verses here

89
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,399
by way of introduction.

90
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:15,479
We find that this word free means to set at liberty,

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,160
more specifically it means to set at liberty

92
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,880
from the dominion of sin.

93
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,760
And you find contextually as Jesus is speaking

94
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,239
to these religious leaders,

95
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:27,040
and he says, ye shall know the truth,

96
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,959
and the truth shall make you free,

97
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,320
they immediately respond by saying,

98
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,279
we're not in bondage to any man.

99
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,679
Now we'll deal with that in just a moment

100
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:35,920
because they had been deceived,

101
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,119
and we understand their error here

102
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:39,480
as they make this statement.

103
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,019
But you find that Jesus very appropriately

104
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:45,440
and very quickly, he deals with the fact

105
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,359
that he's speaking to them about the freedom

106
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:51,579
from the bondage, the dominion of sin.

107
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:53,679
We find that, and we'll be back in Romans

108
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:55,040
in John here in just a moment,

109
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,760
but turn to the book of Romans, if you will,

110
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,720
in chapter number six.

111
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,679
I just wanna look at a couple of other references

112
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:03,119
where we see this truth of freedom through Christ,

113
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:06,119
the freedom that he offers, this being free,

114
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:09,480
being set at liberty from the dominion of sin.

115
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,480
We find here in Romans chapter number six

116
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,440
in verse number 18, notice what the word of God says.

117
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,440
Being then made free from sin,

118
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,079
you became the servants of righteousness.

119
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:23,799
Now it's interesting because in verse number 17,

120
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:26,720
it says, but God be thanked that ye were

121
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,799
the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart

122
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:33,600
that form of doctrine which was delivered you.

123
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,839
Being then made free from sin,

124
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,019
you became the servants of righteousness.

125
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:39,880
I'd rather be a servant of righteousness

126
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,440
than a servant of sin, amen?

127
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,920
And the reality is that if we look at this passage

128
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,640
in Romans six and look at these two verses of scripture,

129
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,119
we understand that we're all servants.

130
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,760
You're either a servant of sin

131
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,640
or you're a servant of righteousness.

132
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,320
And we find that we've been delivered,

133
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,739
we've been made free if you've trusted Christ,

134
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:59,640
if you've obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine

135
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,720
which was delivered you.

136
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,920
What is that form of doctrine?

137
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,959
That's the gospel.

138
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:06,339
Remember, Paul says in Romans chapter one

139
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:08,519
that he was ready to preach the gospel

140
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,119
to them that are at Rome also.

141
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,559
He says, I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ,

142
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:14,959
for it is the power of God unto salvation

143
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,600
to everyone that believeth,

144
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,440
to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

145
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,519
And we find that he says you've obeyed,

146
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,959
you've believed the truth of the gospel,

147
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,119
you've placed your faith and trust

148
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:27,440
in the finished work of Christ at Calvary,

149
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,519
his death, his burial, his glorious resurrection,

150
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,679
and no longer are you a servant of sin,

151
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:34,980
but now you're a servant of righteousness.

152
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,799
Skip down a few verses and notice in verse number 22,

153
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:42,000
it says this, but now being made free from sin

154
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,720
and become servants to God,

155
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,399
ye have your fruit unto holiness

156
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,920
and the end everlasting life.

157
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,760
Aren't you thankful for the gift of God

158
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,000
which is everlasting life,

159
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,720
eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

160
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,920
In Romans chapter number eight,

161
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,980
just a couple of pages over,

162
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,399
we find that in verse number one,

163
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:04,279
he says there is therefore now no condemnation

164
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,720
to them which are in Christ Jesus

165
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,839
who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit.

166
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,959
Notice verse two, for the law of the spirit

167
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,040
is life in Christ Jesus, notice,

168
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:19,040
hath made me free from the law of sin and death.

169
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,880
And then of course we read in the book of Galatians,

170
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,559
in Galatians chapter number five,

171
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:27,799
in fact the book of Galatians deals much

172
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:30,059
with the liberty that we have in Christ

173
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:32,679
and the way in which these religious leaders,

174
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:35,100
these Judaizers in particular,

175
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,880
they were trying to bring them back under the law

176
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,359
but they've been set free,

177
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,279
and we find that in Galatians five in verse number one,

178
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,559
notice what Paul says to the churches

179
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:47,440
in the region of Galatia, he says,

180
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,799
stand fast therefore in the liberty

181
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:54,760
wherewith Christ hath made us free

182
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,339
and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.

183
00:07:58,339 --> 00:07:59,480
If you've been made free,

184
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,600
why do you wanna be entangled with the yoke of bondage?

185
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,299
But when we understand our freedom,

186
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:07,559
our liberty in Christ, we find that in verse number 13

187
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:10,119
of this same chapter that Paul goes on to say,

188
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:12,000
and he says this, for brethren,

189
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,559
ye have been called unto liberty,

190
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:18,720
only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh,

191
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,920
but by love serve one another.

192
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,760
You know the reality is that there are some in that day

193
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,640
and some to this day,

194
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,799
they speak about their Christian liberty

195
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,920
as if it's a license to live any way they wanna live.

196
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,479
But the reality is that liberty in our land,

197
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,200
liberty is not that you can live

198
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,719
any way that you wanna live,

199
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:40,320
and liberty in Christ is not that we can live

200
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,559
any way that we wanna live.

201
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:45,960
In fact, because I've been free from the bondage of sin,

202
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,479
the dominion of sin, sin no longer has dominion over me

203
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:53,239
because I have this liberty in truth,

204
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:56,239
the idea, the biblical truth of liberty

205
00:08:56,239 --> 00:09:00,479
is that now and only now can I actually serve God.

206
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:04,539
And yet we have people running around

207
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:06,619
pretending that they have liberty,

208
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:09,299
I'm not under the law, I can live however I wanna live,

209
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,780
I can do whatever I wanna do,

210
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,340
I can dress how I wanna dress,

211
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,539
I can live how I wanna live,

212
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:15,179
I can do what I wanna do,

213
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,739
and the reality is that this book

214
00:09:17,739 --> 00:09:21,020
is often ignored when we take that approach.

215
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,020
And oh, how important it is that we understand

216
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,619
the liberty and the freedom that we have in Christ,

217
00:09:25,619 --> 00:09:27,460
and we find that here,

218
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,340
that as Jesus is speaking to these religious leaders,

219
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,400
he tells them you shall know the truth

220
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,359
and the truth shall make you free.

221
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:37,479
Free from what?

222
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,960
It has that meaning of being set at liberty

223
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,340
specifically from the dominion of sin.

224
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,679
If you're taking notes this morning,

225
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,239
let me say this, number one,

226
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,599
there is a blinding from truth.

227
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:51,340
There's a blinding from truth.

228
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,479
You understand this morning that as we look

229
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:56,679
even at this passage of scripture in John chapter number eight

230
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,119
we find that truth has the power to make men free.

231
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:04,119
but because of the power of truth to make men free,

232
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:09,119
we find that Satan desires to blind mankind from the truth.

233
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,679
And we find that there's a blinding from truth.

234
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,959
Why is it that we see that in our text of Scripture

235
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,319
in John chapter number eight,

236
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:20,659
that when Jesus says that ye shall know the truth

237
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:22,799
and the truth shall make you free,

238
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,719
that the answer, the immediate response,

239
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:28,319
is we be Abraham's seed.

240
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:32,239
And we're never in bondage to any man.

241
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:36,999
How sayest thou, ye shall be made free?

242
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:39,119
They immediately start thinking of something

243
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:41,959
completely different than what Jesus is speaking of,

244
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:46,399
and even in their response, it shows their ignorance.

245
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,239
It shows that they are actually responding

246
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,399
to something different than what Jesus is speaking of,

247
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,999
and at the same time, they are being deceitful

248
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:58,479
about their history.

249
00:10:58,479 --> 00:11:00,319
They say we're of Abraham's seed,

250
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:01,939
we've never been in bondage.

251
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:02,779
Really?

252
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:04,979
Really.

253
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:08,719
Do you not remember the time in Egypt?

254
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,799
Were they not in bondage?

255
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:13,599
Did they not cry out to God,

256
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:15,799
the children of Israel while they're in Egypt,

257
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:18,799
did they not cry out to God for deliverance?

258
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,039
Did they not see God work miraculously and come,

259
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:25,839
and yes, his grace and his mercy was on display

260
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,459
to the Egyptians, for he showed them over and over

261
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:32,239
of his power through those plagues.

262
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:36,039
And eventually, he delivered his people

263
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:39,039
from the bondage in Egypt.

264
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:41,679
You look at the history of the nation of Israel,

265
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,759
not only the Egyptian bondage,

266
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,159
but you begin to think about the time,

267
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:47,719
the period of the judges, they're in great oppression

268
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:51,079
over and over by various people groups and nations.

269
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:53,319
You come to the 10 tribes of the north,

270
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:56,439
the nation of Israel, and they're taken captive

271
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:57,999
by the Assyrians.

272
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,039
Just a short time later, Judah,

273
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:04,919
the two tribes of the south are taken captive

274
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:09,919
and in bondage and captivity by the Babylonians.

275
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:12,919
You find that even at the very time of the writing,

276
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:15,099
the ministry of Jesus Christ,

277
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:18,559
as Jesus is speaking to these very religious leaders,

278
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,919
and they say we've never, we're never in bondage

279
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:25,080
to any man, it was the Romans that controlled them.

280
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,119
You see how they're blinded?

281
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:32,519
They're blinded from the real truth that Jesus is getting to

282
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,860
the fact that they're, the deliverance,

283
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,839
the freedom from the dominion of sin,

284
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,599
but we find that even in their blindness,

285
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:44,419
they're not acknowledging the fact even of their history.

286
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,559
And this morning, as we think about the spiritual

287
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,080
significance of this passage of scripture,

288
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,679
the freedom that Christ gives us,

289
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:55,199
being set at liberty from the dominion of sin,

290
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:58,259
we find that mankind continues to be blinded.

291
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:00,679
We find that as we would speak to people today

292
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,279
about the truth of the gospel,

293
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,839
the power of the gospel to save sinners,

294
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:10,080
the power of truth to deliver someone,

295
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,839
to set them at liberty from the dominion of sin,

296
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,699
you have individuals that have been blinded

297
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:18,519
that do not believe they have any problem.

298
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,519
But the reality is that sin is a universal condition.

299
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:28,279
Every single person upon the face of the earth

300
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,199
that is alive at this very moment has a problem with sin.

301
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:40,479
We've either been forgiven and we're bound for heaven,

302
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,440
or we're still dead in our trespasses and our sins.

303
00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:48,639
And we find this morning that Satan desires

304
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,839
to control the minds of mankind,

305
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,119
to blind them from the truth of the gospel.

306
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:57,519
Notice in the book of 2 Corinthians, if you will,

307
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,639
in chapter number four,

308
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,479
as we begin to think about the blinding from truth,

309
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:06,459
and we find that Paul is speaking here

310
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:08,000
to these believers in Corinth,

311
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,879
and he gives them this very just insightful truth

312
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:15,919
in verse number three, down really through verse number seven

313
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:18,559
with regard to the ministry that God has given us.

314
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,479
Notice what he says in verse number three,

315
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:25,479
but if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.

316
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,320
Can I say this this morning?

317
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,699
Our gospel has been hid for too long.

318
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,220
Our gospel has been hid for too long.

319
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:38,359
We find that there's this blinding from truth,

320
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:41,540
but there's responsibility on the part of the people of God

321
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,940
to proclaim the truth of the gospel,

322
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,940
and if our gospel is hid, it is hid to them that are lost.

323
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,679
This truth of the condition of our world today,

324
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:54,779
the condition of our nation today,

325
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:57,059
there are many times in which we can sit around

326
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:58,779
and we begin to point fingers

327
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:00,419
at what all of the causes are

328
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:03,019
for why we're in the condition that we're in,

329
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:05,619
and why we're facing the things that we're facing,

330
00:15:05,619 --> 00:15:07,579
but if we'd be honest about it this morning,

331
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:10,660
the church better stand up and take some responsibility.

332
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:13,339
Because if our gospel be hid,

333
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:15,559
it is hid to them that are lost.

334
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:18,660
Why would we expect lost people to act like saved people?

335
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,019
It's hard enough to get saved people

336
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,820
to act like saved people, amen?

337
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,940
But the reality is that lost people,

338
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,059
the Bible tells us, Paul says to the believers in Corinth,

339
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,179
that the natural man receiveth not the things

340
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,179
of the Spirit of God for their foolishness unto him,

341
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:32,820
neither can he know them, why?

342
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,220
Because they are spiritually discerned.

343
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,880
I cannot expect a lost person to behave,

344
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,540
to legislate like a saved person.

345
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,239
The reality is that our gospel in this nation

346
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:46,940
has been hid for way too long.

347
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,699
Notice what he says in verse number four.

348
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,919
In whom the God of this world, that's Satan,

349
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,880
in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds

350
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,839
of them which believe not,

351
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:05,440
lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ,

352
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,000
who is the image of God, should shine unto them.

353
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,799
For we preach not ourselves.

354
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,199
Aren't you thankful for that?

355
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,679
It'd be lousy if we preached ourselves.

356
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,199
But Christ Jesus the Lord, in ourselves your servants,

357
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,359
for Jesus' sake, for God who commanded the light

358
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:30,519
to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts

359
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:33,399
to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God

360
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:35,000
in the face of Jesus Christ.

361
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:38,880
But we have this treasure in earthen vessels

362
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,519
that the excellency of the power may be of God

363
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,040
and not of us.

364
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,720
And the reality this morning is that we're living

365
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,040
in a time, we're living in an age in which there's

366
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,559
this blinding from truth that's been so from the beginning

367
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:55,279
but we see it exponentially greater today.

368
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,679
And we see the God of this world is blinding the minds

369
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,660
of them which believe not.

370
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,359
We find that he uses a variety of means.

371
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:06,079
I believe this morning that organized religion

372
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,359
is one of the means in which the enemy uses

373
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,679
to blind people from the truth.

374
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,320
You think about the number of denominations

375
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,559
and the number of so-called churches

376
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,160
and all of these world religions and you begin

377
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,699
to look at all of these things that are going on

378
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:23,820
and all of the variety of teachings

379
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,959
and the approach that is given and you find

380
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,679
that mankind is left confused and frustrated.

381
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:36,399
And it's the enemy that's blinding the minds

382
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:37,760
of them which believe not.

383
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:41,339
There is a blinding from truth.

384
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,639
Notice not only is there a blinding from truth

385
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:46,479
but I would say this this morning,

386
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:48,839
there is a battle for truth.

387
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,479
There's a battle for truth.

388
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:52,639
We begin to think about what's taking place

389
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,040
and I've often mentioned from this pulpit

390
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,760
especially over the last several years

391
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,720
the fact that we are engaged not in cultural warfare

392
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,600
though people will seek to say that

393
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,679
and they'll seek to peddle that idea,

394
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,239
the reality is that we are engaged in spiritual warfare.

395
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:11,479
And as we're engaged in spiritual warfare

396
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:14,839
we find that there's a battle for truth.

397
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:17,739
I am thankful this morning that truth stands.

398
00:18:17,739 --> 00:18:20,959
I am thankful that truth, see oftentimes what happens

399
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:25,959
is the individuals that are attacking biblical truth,

400
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,199
biblical Christianity, the person of Jesus Christ,

401
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:30,760
the people that are attacking,

402
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,119
they're asking us to defend truth.

403
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:37,820
But so often what happens is we fail to cause them

404
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,299
to defend their positions.

405
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:43,099
And the reality is that truth stands.

406
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,640
And we find here this morning that as we look

407
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,960
at the word of God we find that there has been

408
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,960
a relentless attack on truth from the beginning.

409
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,520
You go all the way back to the Garden of Eden,

410
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,299
you go all the way back to the record

411
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:01,219
that God gives us in Genesis chapter number three

412
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:04,339
and you read in the first four verses of Genesis three

413
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:09,339
how that the truth that God had given to Adam and Eve

414
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,020
has been attacked and there has been a relentless attack.

415
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,239
Truth has been relentlessly attacked.

416
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:21,239
It's amazing to me how many attack Jesus Christ.

417
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:23,500
Why is Jesus always attacked?

418
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,739
Because he is truth.

419
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,460
Because he is truth.

420
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:31,679
Why is it that in a day and age in which we live

421
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,099
that it seems as if people really don't care

422
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:36,479
if you use the word God but if you start talking

423
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:39,359
about Jesus Christ now that's a different situation.

424
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:44,299
We find that in Genesis chapter number three,

425
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:45,820
turn over there quickly,

426
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,580
we're familiar with the text of scripture

427
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,419
but I want you to notice that here in Genesis chapter

428
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:53,020
number three we see the first assault if you will,

429
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,539
the battle for truth and we understand the simple command

430
00:19:56,539 --> 00:19:59,539
that God had given back in Genesis chapter number two

431
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:00,380
in verses.

432
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:05,500
16 and 17, the Lord said this, and the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree

433
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:11,220
of the garden thou mayest freely eat, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,

434
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:17,260
thou shalt not eat of it, for in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die."

435
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:23,580
It's a simple command with known consequences.

436
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,500
It's truth.

437
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,780
And we come to Genesis chapter number 3.

438
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:35,620
The Bible begins in verse number 1, and it says this, Now the serpent, that's the enemy,

439
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:41,220
that's Satan, now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord

440
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,220
God had made.

441
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:49,260
And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the

442
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,260
garden.

443
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:58,500
Do you notice how the initial attack on truth is simply by planting a seed of doubt?

444
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,540
Simply planting a seed of doubt.

445
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:04,500
Yea, hath God said?

446
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,980
And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden,

447
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,580
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall

448
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,540
not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.

449
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:21,380
And notice in verse number 4, an on, a full out assault on truth, And the serpent said

450
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:28,380
unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die.

451
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:37,660
But God said, In the day that ye eat thereof, thou shalt surely die.

452
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,900
Wonder why John 8 records where Jesus says that you're of your father the devil, that

453
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,640
he's a murderer and he's a liar from the beginning.

454
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:54,300
And we find here in Genesis chapter number 3 that the Bible then, Satan begins to, listen,

455
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,980
you understand he never denies the existence of God.

456
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,860
We've got a bunch of atheists running around today that deny the existence of God, but

457
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,340
Satan doesn't deny the existence of God.

458
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,460
In fact, James tells us that the devils, they believe in tremble.

459
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,940
You look at the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, when He walked upon the face of the

460
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,580
earth, when there were those that were demon-possessed that were in the presence of Jesus, they knew

461
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:20,460
who Jesus was, and they said, Have you come to torment us before our time?

462
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:26,460
Because not only do they know who Jesus is, but they know what their end is.

463
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:32,180
We find that here, Satan does not deny the existence of God, he questions the goodness

464
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,580
of God.

465
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:41,340
He says this in verse number 5, For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then

466
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:48,620
your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

467
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:54,100
God's holding something from you that's good for you, basically is what Satan is saying.

468
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:59,580
God knows that in the day you eat this, it's going to open your eyes, illuminate you.

469
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,779
And God's withholding something good from you.

470
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:06,460
Listen, today it just goes something like this, God wants you to be happy.

471
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,180
God wants you to just be you.

472
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,419
Do what makes you happy, because that's what God wants.

473
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:16,940
That's not what God says.

474
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:20,700
There is a battle for truth, and the battle rages.

475
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,380
Notice in the book of Romans, we've looked at several verses already in the book of Romans,

476
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:32,059
but notice in Romans chapter number 1, in Romans chapter number 1, I want you to notice

477
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:38,139
this morning as we're considering this truth, that truth, the truth shall make you free.

478
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:42,620
Yes, I'm thankful for the truth that we have as Americans, but if we'd be honest this morning,

479
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:48,220
that as the people of God, the freedom that I have in America pales in comparison to the

480
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,900
freedom that we have in Christ.

481
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:55,020
There are missionaries all across that missions board that we support that are living in places

482
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:59,300
all across this world that they do not have a Bill of Rights, they do not have a United

483
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,540
States Constitution, but they have freedom in Christ.

484
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:07,380
And by the way, many of those missionaries are doing a whole lot more for the cause of

485
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:12,540
Christ than Americans are, and we have freedom.

486
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,540
It's amazing.

487
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,220
Notice what he says here in Romans chapter number 1.

488
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,580
We don't have time to look at the entirety of the passage, but really if you look at

489
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:29,380
verse 18 down through verse number 32, you just see just amazing disobedience to the

490
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,580
illumination of who God is and what God has given them.

491
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,459
Notice in verse number 24, wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust

492
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:41,860
of their own hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves, who changed the

493
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:49,300
truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator,

494
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,119
who is blessed forever, amen.

495
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,540
Do we not see this in our land today?

496
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:02,220
That they changed the truth of God into a lie.

497
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:07,260
And still to this very day, there is a battle for truth.

498
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:11,480
They try to take the truth that God's given, they try to change it into a lie, tell us

499
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,200
something different.

500
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:20,080
The Bible tells us that they worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator.

501
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,320
We see that in our society, do we not?

502
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,679
Really as you look at the entirety of this section of Romans chapter number 1, you find

503
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,440
that they deny the existence of God because really they don't want to be accountable to

504
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,679
God.

505
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:38,899
We find that there's this battle for truth as we consider this morning the battle for

506
00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:44,700
truth that rages in our land, that's raged since Genesis chapter number 3.

507
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:50,660
We would find that the admonition that we read of from Jude in verses 3 and 4 is an

508
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:55,140
admonition that we need to apply in our lives today.

509
00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:01,300
Jude begins writing this short letter, and it's interesting because Jude is going to

510
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:08,020
write this letter and it tells us that he was going to write about the common salvation.

511
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:13,059
I mean, what a joyful subject to discuss the salvation that we have through the Lord Jesus

512
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:20,119
Christ, the unity that we have as brothers and sisters in Christ because of that salvation

513
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:24,739
through Christ, and he says in verse number 3, Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write

514
00:26:24,739 --> 00:26:29,500
unto you of the common salvation, notice it says it was needful for me to write unto you

515
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:35,179
and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto

516
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:36,179
the saints.

517
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,179
Why?

518
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:39,500
What's the need here, Jude?

519
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,899
Why do we need to earnestly contend for the faith?

520
00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:45,860
Why is it that we need to get involved in this battle for truth?

521
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,700
Why do we need to engage in the fight for truth?

522
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:55,339
Notice what he says in verse number 4, For there are certain men crept in unawares, who

523
00:26:55,339 --> 00:27:00,779
were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men, turning the grace of our God

524
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:07,220
into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.

525
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,220
It's interesting.

526
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,980
It's the truth that will make you free, the grace and mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ,

527
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:18,820
and here in verse number 4, it says of these men that crept in unawares, these false teachers,

528
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:26,220
that they're turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, unbridled lust.

529
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,700
Do what you want.

530
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,179
God wants you to be happy.

531
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:33,480
That's just not what the Word of God says.

532
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,820
He actually says this, If you love me, keep my commandments.

533
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,959
If you love me, keep my commandments.

534
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:45,739
He says this, flee from fornication.

535
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:51,179
That flies in the face of the society in which we live in today, does it not?

536
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:55,700
And we find that we go to the Word of God, listen, there's a blinding from truth, but

537
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,300
there's also a battle for truth.

538
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,940
And we must acknowledge those two things this morning, but finally this morning as we wrap

539
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,860
up our time, I want you to acknowledge this morning with me the blessing of truth.

540
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:13,420
I'm so thankful this morning for the passage of Scripture in John chapter number 8, where

541
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:19,660
Jesus is standing there before those religious leaders, and he's giving them this powerful

542
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,980
truth that this morning is our focus of our message.

543
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,899
He says, Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.

544
00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:31,420
Listen, this morning we must acknowledge the blessings of truth.

545
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:38,340
I am so thankful this morning that not only to live in a nation of freedom, but to have

546
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:43,419
the truth of God's Word, the freedom that His Word offers us.

547
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:48,179
You know, it'd be a horrible thing to live in a nation that has freedom void of the truth

548
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:51,260
of God's Word.

549
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,500
What does that freedom really get us?

550
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,299
Because the reality is that the Bible tells us that man goes to his long home.

551
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:04,099
I don't care how long you live here on the earth, it's a short time compared to eternity.

552
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:09,460
I'm going to live to be 100, man, compared to eternity, that's just that long, right?

553
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,799
I understand sometimes we think, man, that's a long time.

554
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,340
Sometimes a week can be a long time, right?

555
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:19,739
I mean, you get into the life and you're like, man, it just seems like it's dragging.

556
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:23,520
But in comparison to eternity, it's nothing.

557
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:32,580
And to live in a nation that has freedom void of the freedom that Christ offers, no thank

558
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,220
you.

559
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:41,200
I'd rather live in a land that has no freedom, but has the freedom that Christ offers.

560
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,059
And we find this truth this morning as we acknowledge the blessing, listen, we ought

561
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:51,299
to rejoice this morning because God has providentially preserved truth for us.

562
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:54,539
Notice he says, ye shall know the truth.

563
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:59,340
In John 17, here in just a few chapters, we find that Jesus would say this, sanctify them

564
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,340
through thy word.

565
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:00,340


566
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,780
word is truth. I'm thankful this morning that we can know the truth. I'm thankful

567
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,660
this morning that someone was faithful to deliver the truth to you, that

568
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,220
someone was faithful to deliver the truth to me. I'm thankful that we then

569
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:17,740
have the privilege and the opportunity to deliver the truth to someone else.

570
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:24,780
Because it is the truth that makes men free. And we find here this morning that

571
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:31,380
God has providentially preserved truth for us. I wonder this morning, when's the

572
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:39,500
last time you thanked God for His Bible, His Word? Every single day when I get

573
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:45,420
into this book I start by saying, God thank you for the Word of God. Thank you

574
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:52,100
for preserving this book so that I could read it. Thank you that I have it in my

575
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:58,460
language, that I can read it. Then I begin to pray, God would you teach me

576
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:03,260
out of this book? God would you help me to understand it? The Holy Spirit's the

577
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:08,260
teacher. Open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.

578
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:16,740
Speak Lord for thy servant heareth. Lord teach me thy truth and Lord help me to

579
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:22,660
walk in thy truth. That's our approach to the Bible. Listen, I am so thankful this

580
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:27,540
morning that God's given us a Bible. I honestly, I don't know where we'd be

581
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:35,700
without a Bible. There are people all across the world that do not have Bibles.

582
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:41,220
There are some that have Bibles that neglect them, that just sit on a table,

583
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:46,260
sit on a bookshelf. And yet there are people all across the globe that do not

584
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:51,220
have the Word of God. This morning we ought to thank God for the blessing of

585
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:57,660
truth, that He has providentially preserved His Word for us. He said to

586
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,860
these religious leaders, you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you

587
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:05,340
free. I'm thankful this morning that the truth has been preserved for us and that

588
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,540
as we've been given the truth of the gospel that we have been set free. If you

589
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:14,860
have obeyed, as Paul says there to the believers in Rome, if you've obeyed the

590
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,500
truth that was delivered, then you have been set at liberty, you have been made

591
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:23,740
free from the dominion of sin. We ought to rejoice in that. Number two, as we

592
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,380
think about acknowledging the blessing of truth, we ought to rejoice that Jesus

593
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:34,580
is truth, that He is truth. Of course, He stands in John 14, a verse that we often

594
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:40,740
would quote, and He says, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto

595
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:45,340
the Father but by me. You know today that there are statistics that are floating

596
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:51,620
around that say of those that are professed Christians, now I have an idea

597
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:56,340
of what that means in my head, and you probably do as well, but the next

598
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:03,220
statement causes me much confusion. They say that of professed Christians, about

599
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:10,220
one-third say that Jesus is the only way to heaven. That's perplexing to me. I

600
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:15,940
don't understand that, but yet I find that there was a church that

601
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:20,300
unfortunately had in its name Baptist, that was in New York City a number of

602
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:26,340
years ago, that the pastor stood up and said this idea as he's preaching, he says

603
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:32,180
the idea that Jesus is the only way to heaven is irrelevant and it's just not

604
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,180
true, and when he made the statement you could hear the applause of the

605
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:42,900
congregation. Unbelievable, I heard it with my own ears.

606
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:51,500
Unbelievable, because Jesus said I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man

607
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:57,220
cometh unto the Father but by me. Peter, who would have heard Jesus speak those

608
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:01,380
words, would stand before the religious leaders in Acts 4 and he'd say neither

609
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:06,420
is there salvation in any other. There's no other name under heaven given among

610
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:14,060
men whereby we must be saved. The name of Jesus. You read the book of Philippians

611
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:19,140
and you read how the Bible tells us about the Lord taking on the form of a

612
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,300
servant and going to the cross. He humbled himself, he became obedient unto

613
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:26,420
death, even the death of the cross, but God also hath highly exalted his name

614
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:31,060
and given him a name which is above every other name. And it's at the name of

615
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:38,100
Jesus that every tongue will confess, every knee is going to bow, that Jesus

616
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:48,220
Christ is Lord. It's not a question of if, it's a question of when, because every

617
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:53,700
knee will bow and every tongue will confess. And I will say this this morning,

618
00:34:53,700 --> 00:35:00,140
you've heard me say it before, when makes all the difference. You profess that

619
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:06,420
before you take your final breath here on earth, heaven is your home. If you deny

620
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:12,340
that truth and you enter into a Christless eternity, and I believe that at the Great

621
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:18,980
White Throne Judgment, you will acknowledge that Jesus is Lord. I hope this morning

622
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,540
that you've made that proclamation, you've understood, listen, the truth has

623
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:27,300
made us free. The truth is Jesus. Not only the truth being His Word, but the truth

624
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,100
is Jesus. Remember in the verse that we read there in Galatians 5, in verse

625
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,540
number 1, where the Word of God says this, He says,

626
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:40,540
Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and

627
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:45,820
be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. Finally this morning, as we

628
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,820
acknowledge the blessing of truth, as we rejoice that God's given us truth in His

629
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:55,140
precious Word, as we rejoice that Jesus Himself is truth, as we acknowledge this

630
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,900
morning that there's a blinding from truth, that there is a battle for truth,

631
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:10,020
we must purpose to proclaim the truth. As a nation, right or wrong, not part of this

632
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,500
discussion, but as a nation, as you look at the history of our nation, we've gotten

633
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:19,620
involved in conflicts all across the globe, and many times we've tried to give

634
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:26,980
them freedom. Could I say to you this morning that as the people of God, we

635
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:33,620
must have a burning zeal to deliver the message that we're speaking of this

636
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:42,900
morning, that Christ gives freedom. I appreciate the fact that we would want

637
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:48,140
other countries and other people groups to have freedom. I appreciate that, but if

638
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:52,100
they only have freedom from tyranny, if they only have freedom from some

639
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:56,700
dictator, if they only have freedom from some whatever-you-want-to-say-the-

640
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,340
condition-is-that-they're-dealing-with, but they do not have the freedom that

641
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:05,380
we're speaking of this morning, they will simply live, perhaps live a life of

642
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:11,620
pleasure, and then face a Christless eternity. That's the reality of it. And

643
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:17,500
this morning, as we understand the stakes and what's going on, and the

644
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:23,420
truth of what's before us this morning, we find that there are many today that

645
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:31,700
remain in bondage. There are many today that continue to be blinded from truth,

646
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:37,620
and they remain in bondage. They've not been set at liberty. They've not been

647
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:44,420
made free from the truth that God has given us. They've not been set free

648
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:51,340
from the bondage of sin. But this morning, I'm thankful to say that truth

649
00:37:51,340 --> 00:38:00,740
still works. Jesus still saves. The truth is still powerful. If our gospel be hid,

650
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:05,540
it is hid to them that are lost. Paul encouraged the believers in Ephesus in

651
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:11,820
Ephesians 4 and verse 15 to speak the truth in love. Paul gave the command, the

652
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:16,900
admonition, the charge, if you will, to Timothy in 2 Timothy chapter number 4. He

653
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:22,180
tells them to preach the word. Oh, he also let them know that there was going to

654
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:26,260
come a time when they weren't going to endure sound doctrine. But it did not

655
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:31,540
change the instruction. Paul didn't say to Timothy, hey, listen, Timothy, you preach

656
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:37,020
the word until they don't want to hear it. No, no, he just said preach the word. Be

657
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,180
instant, in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and

658
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:46,980
doubt. That's what he told them to do. This morning, we as the people of God, if

659
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:51,840
our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost. We sing the song with the kids.

660
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:58,300
Sometimes I think we ought to sing kids' songs more. Honestly, this little light of

661
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:05,740
mine, I'm going to let it shine. Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine. Don't

662
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:12,820
let Satan blow it out, hide it under a bushel, no. Let it shine till Jesus comes. I'm going

663
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:20,980
to let it shine. I have decided to follow Jesus. No turning back, no turning back. Though

664
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:29,340
none go with me, still I will follow. That's what we sing with the kids. But somehow along

665
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:36,700
the way, we become adults and we think, well, we forget some of those songs. This morning,

666
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:45,040
there's a blinding from truth. We see it in our world today. There's a battle for truth.

667
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,580
But this morning, we rejoice in the blessing of truth. The fact that we have truth, man,

668
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:55,860
we ought to rejoice. The fact that the truth has set us free, it's made us free, oh, we

669
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:00,260
ought to rejoice. But you know, if you have a neighbor...

670
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:09,220
a coworker, a relative, that they're still in bondage, wouldn't you like for them to

671
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,220
be made free?

672
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,220
Right?

673
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,220
Does that make sense?

674
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:20,940
You want them to be made free, and you have the truth that has the power to make them

675
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,940
free.

676
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,180
That's amazing.

677
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:28,440
And yet sometimes we just don't say it.

678
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,240
We just don't share it.

679
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,340
We just don't give it.

680
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,900
And they remain in bondage.

681
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:42,180
This morning, Jesus stood before those blinded religious leaders.

682
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:46,740
In fact, in chapter number nine, after the healing of the man that was born blind, they

683
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,860
say, are we blind also?

684
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,220
Yep, absolutely.

685
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,760
Spiritual blindness.

686
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:58,700
And spiritual blindness is a whole lot worse than physical blindness.

687
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:02,200
This morning, the truth shall make you free.

688
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:09,040
When you celebrate this weekend and you rejoice in being in the land of the free, and you

689
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,920
think about the freedoms that we have as Americans, you ought to be thankful for that.

690
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:22,280
But we must acknowledge this morning that those freedoms pale in comparison to the freedom

691
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,340
that we have in Christ.

692
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,340
Let me say this.

693
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:33,680
In my lifetime, some of my freedoms as an American might not be enjoyed any longer.

694
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,520
It's possible.

695
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:41,600
But nobody can take my freedom that I have in Christ.

696
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,120
It's powerful.

697
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:50,220
This morning, we need to proclaim, purpose to proclaim the truth, because the truth sets

698
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,220
men free.

699
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,220
Let's pray.

700
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,860
Father, we love You.

701
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,760
We thank You for loving us.

702
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:05,320
This morning, I'm so grateful to know You, the way, the truth, and the life.

703
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:13,280
As my personal Savior, I thank You that You've given us Thy Word, and Thy Word is truth.

704
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:20,620
And God, this morning as we acknowledge, it's nothing new that there's a blinding from truth.

705
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,240
Nothing new that there's a battle for truth.

706
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,880
We see it all around us.

707
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:36,900
God, I pray that as we rejoice in the blessing of truth, that we would not only be thankful

708
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:45,440
for what You've given to us, but that we would have a genuine concern for our neighbor, our

709
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,580
coworker, our relative.

710
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:55,220
So often, there are movements, even in our society today, of wanting to provide some

711
00:42:55,220 --> 00:43:02,000
level of opportunity or liberty to some people.

712
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:09,020
And yet, as Your people, as the children of God, sometimes we fail to recognize the importance

713
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:19,160
of giving truth that would set men free from the dominion of sin, that they might pass

714
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:28,120
from death unto life, no longer being the servant of sin, but the servant of righteousness,

715
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:35,040
no longer heading for a Christless eternity in the lake of fire, but having eternal life

716
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,440
in Your presence.

717
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:47,000
Oh, God, would You help us to have a renewed passion, help us to have a renewed vision,

718
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:54,280
not to get behind some cause, but to lift up the name of Christ.

719
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,000
We pray that You'd move and work in these moments of invitation.

720
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,180
If there's one that's not sure of heaven, oh, God, I pray that today would be the day

721
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,920
of their salvation.

722
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:11,020
Your people all across this auditorium this morning, Lord, would You work in our hearts.

723
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:14,320
We don't want to just be stirred, we want to be changed.

724
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,360
We don't want to just be hearers, we want to be doers.

725
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:21,080
I pray that You'd move and work in these moments of invitation, for it's in Christ's name we

726
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,080
pray.

727
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,080
Would You stand with me?

728
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,080
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

729
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,760
Holly's going to play quietly on the piano.

730
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,040
As she plays, the altar is open.
