00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
Number eight, I know that America is not perfect.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.960
There is no nation that is perfect.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.000
We understand that to be the case,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.159
but I am so thankful that in God's providence,

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:13.239
He allowed this nation to be founded.

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:15.319
And again, for as many of its wrongs,

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:16.959
there's so many rights.

00:00:16.959 --> 00:00:20.879
And so thankful our land is under attack.

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:21.719
Amen.

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:25.280
And there are many that would love to see America destroyed,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.639
not only from without, but from within.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.000
And I am thankful for the way that God has used this nation

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.840
over the years in the history of our nation.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.520
You think about the missionaries that have gone out

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.240
from America all across this globe,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.880
preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.520
the freedom that we have had in this land

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.959
to assemble together, to proclaim the truth of the gospel.

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:51.119
And what a blessing.

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:53.040
You know, you can leave here this afternoon

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.040
and you can go out and you can find someone

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.880
and you can talk to them about Jesus.

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:58.520
And you don't have to be afraid.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.279
You don't have to fear any kind of persecution.

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:03.000
You're not gonna be in prison for it.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.480
I understand they might not like it.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.800
I know there are many people that do not like it,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.480
but the reality is that we have freedom to do that.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.760
And that is wonderful.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.760
And I'm so thankful for that.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.040
The freedom that we celebrate as Americans,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.160
I believe is both unique and special.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.239
And we think about that,

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:24.879
the truth that many around the globe today,

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:27.040
they do not know what it is to live

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.400
in a country such as ours.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.440
They do not know what it is to have the freedoms

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.400
that we so regularly take for granted.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.120
We understand there are many millions upon millions

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.279
of people around the globe that desire to come to America.

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:44.559
And what draws them here?

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:46.199
What is it that they're looking for?

00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:47.800
And you think about those freedoms

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.800
that we just are so grateful to enjoy.

00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:56.720
But the reality this morning is that as a child of God,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.720
the freedom that we have in America pales

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.800
in comparison to the freedom that we have in Christ.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.000
And I'm thankful for the freedom that we have in America.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.040
Don't get me wrong.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.080
But the freedom that we have in Christ is so much greater.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.839
And the reality this morning is that the freedom

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:17.559
that we have in Christ, that freedom is offered,

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:20.399
it is available to any human being

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:24.520
without regard of what their citizenship status might be.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.839
You think about people all across this globe,

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:28.759
you think of some of the darkest,

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:32.720
some of the most strict nations upon the face of this earth,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.199
they have no freedoms whatsoever,

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:38.600
but yet they can have freedom through Christ.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.679
And that is precious, that is powerful.

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:45.919
And we ought to rejoice in that freedom that Christ offers.

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:48.839
In John chapter number eight, our text for this morning,

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:51.479
we'll look at a number of passages of scripture,

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:53.960
but we find that Jesus is speaking here

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.479
to some religious leaders, and often as the case was,

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:59.720
there'd be debate and dialogue.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.919
And we find here in this text of scripture,

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.759
we'll pick up right in the middle, in verse number 32,

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:08.119
notice the proclamation of Jesus.

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:12.000
He says, and ye shall know the truth,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.320
and the truth shall make you free.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.880
They answered him, these religious leaders,

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.119
these men that he's speaking to, they say,

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:25.360
we be Abraham's seed,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.759
and we're never in bondage to any man.

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:33.720
How sayest thou, ye shall be made free?

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.080
Jesus answered them, verily, verily, I say unto you,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.080
whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.000
And the servant abideth not in the house forever,

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:47.520
but the son abideth ever.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.800
If the son therefore shall make you free,

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.639
ye shall be free indeed.

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.919
I've adopted the latter statement in verse number 32

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.679
for our title this morning.

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:03.839
The truth shall make you free.

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:06.800
As we find this word free that is used

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.720
in our text of scripture and other places in the scripture,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.119
we'll look at a few of those verses here

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:12.399
by way of introduction.

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:15.479
We find that this word free means to set at liberty,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.160
more specifically it means to set at liberty

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.880
from the dominion of sin.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.760
And you find contextually as Jesus is speaking

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.239
to these religious leaders,

00:04:25.239 --> 00:04:27.040
and he says, ye shall know the truth,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.959
and the truth shall make you free,

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:31.320
they immediately respond by saying,

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.279
we're not in bondage to any man.

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:34.679
Now we'll deal with that in just a moment

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:35.920
because they had been deceived,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.119
and we understand their error here

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:39.480
as they make this statement.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.019
But you find that Jesus very appropriately

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:45.440
and very quickly, he deals with the fact

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:48.359
that he's speaking to them about the freedom

00:04:48.359 --> 00:04:51.579
from the bondage, the dominion of sin.

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:53.679
We find that, and we'll be back in Romans

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:55.040
in John here in just a moment,

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.760
but turn to the book of Romans, if you will,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.720
in chapter number six.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.679
I just wanna look at a couple of other references

00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:03.119
where we see this truth of freedom through Christ,

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:06.119
the freedom that he offers, this being free,

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:09.480
being set at liberty from the dominion of sin.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.480
We find here in Romans chapter number six

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.440
in verse number 18, notice what the word of God says.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.440
Being then made free from sin,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.079
you became the servants of righteousness.

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:23.799
Now it's interesting because in verse number 17,

00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:26.720
it says, but God be thanked that ye were

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.799
the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart

00:05:30.799 --> 00:05:33.600
that form of doctrine which was delivered you.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.839
Being then made free from sin,

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:38.019
you became the servants of righteousness.

00:05:38.019 --> 00:05:39.880
I'd rather be a servant of righteousness

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.440
than a servant of sin, amen?

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.920
And the reality is that if we look at this passage

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:46.640
in Romans six and look at these two verses of scripture,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.119
we understand that we're all servants.

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:49.760
You're either a servant of sin

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.640
or you're a servant of righteousness.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.320
And we find that we've been delivered,

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.739
we've been made free if you've trusted Christ,

00:05:55.739 --> 00:05:59.640
if you've obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.720
which was delivered you.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.920
What is that form of doctrine?

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:03.959
That's the gospel.

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:06.339
Remember, Paul says in Romans chapter one

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:08.519
that he was ready to preach the gospel

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:10.119
to them that are at Rome also.

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:12.559
He says, I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ,

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:14.959
for it is the power of God unto salvation

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:16.600
to everyone that believeth,

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.440
to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.519
And we find that he says you've obeyed,

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:22.959
you've believed the truth of the gospel,

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:25.119
you've placed your faith and trust

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:27.440
in the finished work of Christ at Calvary,

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.519
his death, his burial, his glorious resurrection,

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:32.679
and no longer are you a servant of sin,

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:34.980
but now you're a servant of righteousness.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.799
Skip down a few verses and notice in verse number 22,

00:06:37.799 --> 00:06:42.000
it says this, but now being made free from sin

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.720
and become servants to God,

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.399
ye have your fruit unto holiness

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:49.920
and the end everlasting life.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.760
Aren't you thankful for the gift of God

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.000
which is everlasting life,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.720
eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.920
In Romans chapter number eight,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.980
just a couple of pages over,

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.399
we find that in verse number one,

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:04.279
he says there is therefore now no condemnation

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:06.720
to them which are in Christ Jesus

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.839
who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit.

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:11.959
Notice verse two, for the law of the spirit

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:14.040
is life in Christ Jesus, notice,

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:19.040
hath made me free from the law of sin and death.

00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:22.880
And then of course we read in the book of Galatians,

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.559
in Galatians chapter number five,

00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:27.799
in fact the book of Galatians deals much

00:07:27.799 --> 00:07:30.059
with the liberty that we have in Christ

00:07:30.059 --> 00:07:32.679
and the way in which these religious leaders,

00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:35.100
these Judaizers in particular,

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.880
they were trying to bring them back under the law

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.359
but they've been set free,

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.279
and we find that in Galatians five in verse number one,

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:45.559
notice what Paul says to the churches

00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:47.440
in the region of Galatia, he says,

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.799
stand fast therefore in the liberty

00:07:50.799 --> 00:07:54.760
wherewith Christ hath made us free

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.339
and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.

00:07:58.339 --> 00:07:59.480
If you've been made free,

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.600
why do you wanna be entangled with the yoke of bondage?

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.299
But when we understand our freedom,

00:08:04.299 --> 00:08:07.559
our liberty in Christ, we find that in verse number 13

00:08:07.559 --> 00:08:10.119
of this same chapter that Paul goes on to say,

00:08:10.119 --> 00:08:12.000
and he says this, for brethren,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.559
ye have been called unto liberty,

00:08:14.559 --> 00:08:18.720
only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh,

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.920
but by love serve one another.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.760
You know the reality is that there are some in that day

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.640
and some to this day,

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.799
they speak about their Christian liberty

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:30.920
as if it's a license to live any way they wanna live.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.479
But the reality is that liberty in our land,

00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:36.200
liberty is not that you can live

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.719
any way that you wanna live,

00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:40.320
and liberty in Christ is not that we can live

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.559
any way that we wanna live.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:45.960
In fact, because I've been free from the bondage of sin,

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.479
the dominion of sin, sin no longer has dominion over me

00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:53.239
because I have this liberty in truth,

00:08:53.239 --> 00:08:56.239
the idea, the biblical truth of liberty

00:08:56.239 --> 00:09:00.479
is that now and only now can I actually serve God.

00:09:02.159 --> 00:09:04.539
And yet we have people running around

00:09:04.539 --> 00:09:06.619
pretending that they have liberty,

00:09:06.619 --> 00:09:09.299
I'm not under the law, I can live however I wanna live,

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:10.780
I can do whatever I wanna do,

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.340
I can dress how I wanna dress,

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.539
I can live how I wanna live,

00:09:13.539 --> 00:09:15.179
I can do what I wanna do,

00:09:15.179 --> 00:09:17.739
and the reality is that this book

00:09:17.739 --> 00:09:21.020
is often ignored when we take that approach.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.020
And oh, how important it is that we understand

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.619
the liberty and the freedom that we have in Christ,

00:09:25.619 --> 00:09:27.460
and we find that here,

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:31.340
that as Jesus is speaking to these religious leaders,

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.400
he tells them you shall know the truth

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.359
and the truth shall make you free.

00:09:36.359 --> 00:09:37.479
Free from what?

00:09:37.479 --> 00:09:39.960
It has that meaning of being set at liberty

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.340
specifically from the dominion of sin.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.679
If you're taking notes this morning,

00:09:44.679 --> 00:09:46.239
let me say this, number one,

00:09:46.239 --> 00:09:49.599
there is a blinding from truth.

00:09:49.599 --> 00:09:51.340
There's a blinding from truth.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.479
You understand this morning that as we look

00:09:53.479 --> 00:09:56.679
even at this passage of scripture in John chapter number eight

00:09:56.679 --> 00:10:00.119
we find that truth has the power to make men free.

00:10:00.119 --> 00:10:04.119
but because of the power of truth to make men free,

00:10:04.119 --> 00:10:09.119
we find that Satan desires to blind mankind from the truth.

00:10:10.319 --> 00:10:12.679
And we find that there's a blinding from truth.

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:15.959
Why is it that we see that in our text of Scripture

00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:17.319
in John chapter number eight,

00:10:17.319 --> 00:10:20.659
that when Jesus says that ye shall know the truth

00:10:20.659 --> 00:10:22.799
and the truth shall make you free,

00:10:22.799 --> 00:10:26.719
that the answer, the immediate response,

00:10:26.719 --> 00:10:28.319
is we be Abraham's seed.

00:10:29.319 --> 00:10:32.239
And we're never in bondage to any man.

00:10:33.999 --> 00:10:36.999
How sayest thou, ye shall be made free?

00:10:36.999 --> 00:10:39.119
They immediately start thinking of something

00:10:39.119 --> 00:10:41.959
completely different than what Jesus is speaking of,

00:10:41.959 --> 00:10:46.399
and even in their response, it shows their ignorance.

00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:50.239
It shows that they are actually responding

00:10:50.239 --> 00:10:53.399
to something different than what Jesus is speaking of,

00:10:53.399 --> 00:10:56.999
and at the same time, they are being deceitful

00:10:57.079 --> 00:10:58.479
about their history.

00:10:58.479 --> 00:11:00.319
They say we're of Abraham's seed,

00:11:00.319 --> 00:11:01.939
we've never been in bondage.

00:11:01.939 --> 00:11:02.779
Really?

00:11:04.139 --> 00:11:04.979
Really.

00:11:06.439 --> 00:11:08.719
Do you not remember the time in Egypt?

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:11.799
Were they not in bondage?

00:11:11.799 --> 00:11:13.599
Did they not cry out to God,

00:11:13.599 --> 00:11:15.799
the children of Israel while they're in Egypt,

00:11:15.799 --> 00:11:18.799
did they not cry out to God for deliverance?

00:11:18.799 --> 00:11:23.039
Did they not see God work miraculously and come,

00:11:23.039 --> 00:11:25.839
and yes, his grace and his mercy was on display

00:11:25.839 --> 00:11:29.459
to the Egyptians, for he showed them over and over

00:11:29.459 --> 00:11:32.239
of his power through those plagues.

00:11:33.099 --> 00:11:36.039
And eventually, he delivered his people

00:11:36.039 --> 00:11:39.039
from the bondage in Egypt.

00:11:39.039 --> 00:11:41.679
You look at the history of the nation of Israel,

00:11:41.679 --> 00:11:43.759
not only the Egyptian bondage,

00:11:43.759 --> 00:11:45.159
but you begin to think about the time,

00:11:45.159 --> 00:11:47.719
the period of the judges, they're in great oppression

00:11:47.719 --> 00:11:51.079
over and over by various people groups and nations.

00:11:51.079 --> 00:11:53.319
You come to the 10 tribes of the north,

00:11:53.319 --> 00:11:56.439
the nation of Israel, and they're taken captive

00:11:56.439 --> 00:11:57.999
by the Assyrians.

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:02.039
Just a short time later, Judah,

00:12:02.039 --> 00:12:04.919
the two tribes of the south are taken captive

00:12:04.919 --> 00:12:09.919
and in bondage and captivity by the Babylonians.

00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:12.919
You find that even at the very time of the writing,

00:12:12.919 --> 00:12:15.099
the ministry of Jesus Christ,

00:12:15.099 --> 00:12:18.559
as Jesus is speaking to these very religious leaders,

00:12:18.559 --> 00:12:21.919
and they say we've never, we're never in bondage

00:12:21.959 --> 00:12:25.080
to any man, it was the Romans that controlled them.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.119
You see how they're blinded?

00:12:29.119 --> 00:12:32.519
They're blinded from the real truth that Jesus is getting to

00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:34.860
the fact that they're, the deliverance,

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.839
the freedom from the dominion of sin,

00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:40.599
but we find that even in their blindness,

00:12:40.599 --> 00:12:44.419
they're not acknowledging the fact even of their history.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.559
And this morning, as we think about the spiritual

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:50.080
significance of this passage of scripture,

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.679
the freedom that Christ gives us,

00:12:52.679 --> 00:12:55.199
being set at liberty from the dominion of sin,

00:12:55.199 --> 00:12:58.259
we find that mankind continues to be blinded.

00:12:58.259 --> 00:13:00.679
We find that as we would speak to people today

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:03.279
about the truth of the gospel,

00:13:03.279 --> 00:13:06.839
the power of the gospel to save sinners,

00:13:06.839 --> 00:13:10.080
the power of truth to deliver someone,

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.839
to set them at liberty from the dominion of sin,

00:13:12.839 --> 00:13:15.699
you have individuals that have been blinded

00:13:15.699 --> 00:13:18.519
that do not believe they have any problem.

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:24.519
But the reality is that sin is a universal condition.

00:13:25.199 --> 00:13:28.279
Every single person upon the face of the earth

00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:34.199
that is alive at this very moment has a problem with sin.

00:13:36.319 --> 00:13:40.479
We've either been forgiven and we're bound for heaven,

00:13:40.479 --> 00:13:44.440
or we're still dead in our trespasses and our sins.

00:13:45.319 --> 00:13:48.639
And we find this morning that Satan desires

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:51.839
to control the minds of mankind,

00:13:51.839 --> 00:13:55.119
to blind them from the truth of the gospel.

00:13:55.119 --> 00:13:57.519
Notice in the book of 2 Corinthians, if you will,

00:13:57.519 --> 00:13:59.639
in chapter number four,

00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:03.479
as we begin to think about the blinding from truth,

00:14:03.479 --> 00:14:06.459
and we find that Paul is speaking here

00:14:06.459 --> 00:14:08.000
to these believers in Corinth,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.879
and he gives them this very just insightful truth

00:14:12.879 --> 00:14:15.919
in verse number three, down really through verse number seven

00:14:15.919 --> 00:14:18.559
with regard to the ministry that God has given us.

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:20.479
Notice what he says in verse number three,

00:14:20.479 --> 00:14:25.479
but if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.320
Can I say this this morning?

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.699
Our gospel has been hid for too long.

00:14:31.199 --> 00:14:34.220
Our gospel has been hid for too long.

00:14:35.119 --> 00:14:38.359
We find that there's this blinding from truth,

00:14:38.359 --> 00:14:41.540
but there's responsibility on the part of the people of God

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.940
to proclaim the truth of the gospel,

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:48.940
and if our gospel is hid, it is hid to them that are lost.

00:14:49.179 --> 00:14:52.679
This truth of the condition of our world today,

00:14:52.679 --> 00:14:54.779
the condition of our nation today,

00:14:54.779 --> 00:14:57.059
there are many times in which we can sit around

00:14:57.059 --> 00:14:58.779
and we begin to point fingers

00:14:58.779 --> 00:15:00.419
at what all of the causes are

00:15:00.419 --> 00:15:03.019
for why we're in the condition that we're in,

00:15:03.019 --> 00:15:05.619
and why we're facing the things that we're facing,

00:15:05.619 --> 00:15:07.579
but if we'd be honest about it this morning,

00:15:07.579 --> 00:15:10.660
the church better stand up and take some responsibility.

00:15:11.979 --> 00:15:13.339
Because if our gospel be hid,

00:15:13.339 --> 00:15:15.559
it is hid to them that are lost.

00:15:15.559 --> 00:15:18.660
Why would we expect lost people to act like saved people?

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.019
It's hard enough to get saved people

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:21.820
to act like saved people, amen?

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.940
But the reality is that lost people,

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.059
the Bible tells us, Paul says to the believers in Corinth,

00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:29.179
that the natural man receiveth not the things

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:31.179
of the Spirit of God for their foolishness unto him,

00:15:31.179 --> 00:15:32.820
neither can he know them, why?

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.220
Because they are spiritually discerned.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.880
I cannot expect a lost person to behave,

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.540
to legislate like a saved person.

00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:45.239
The reality is that our gospel in this nation

00:15:45.239 --> 00:15:46.940
has been hid for way too long.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.699
Notice what he says in verse number four.

00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:55.919
In whom the God of this world, that's Satan,

00:15:55.919 --> 00:16:00.880
in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.839
of them which believe not,

00:16:02.839 --> 00:16:05.440
lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ,

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.000
who is the image of God, should shine unto them.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.799
For we preach not ourselves.

00:16:11.799 --> 00:16:13.199
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:16:15.199 --> 00:16:17.679
It'd be lousy if we preached ourselves.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.199
But Christ Jesus the Lord, in ourselves your servants,

00:16:23.199 --> 00:16:26.359
for Jesus' sake, for God who commanded the light

00:16:26.359 --> 00:16:30.519
to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:33.399
to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God

00:16:33.399 --> 00:16:35.000
in the face of Jesus Christ.

00:16:35.559 --> 00:16:38.880
But we have this treasure in earthen vessels

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.519
that the excellency of the power may be of God

00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:43.040
and not of us.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.720
And the reality this morning is that we're living

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.040
in a time, we're living in an age in which there's

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.559
this blinding from truth that's been so from the beginning

00:16:51.559 --> 00:16:55.279
but we see it exponentially greater today.

00:16:55.279 --> 00:16:58.679
And we see the God of this world is blinding the minds

00:16:58.679 --> 00:17:00.660
of them which believe not.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.359
We find that he uses a variety of means.

00:17:03.359 --> 00:17:06.079
I believe this morning that organized religion

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:08.359
is one of the means in which the enemy uses

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:10.679
to blind people from the truth.

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.320
You think about the number of denominations

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.559
and the number of so-called churches

00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:19.160
and all of these world religions and you begin

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.699
to look at all of these things that are going on

00:17:21.699 --> 00:17:23.820
and all of the variety of teachings

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:26.959
and the approach that is given and you find

00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:31.679
that mankind is left confused and frustrated.

00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:36.399
And it's the enemy that's blinding the minds

00:17:36.399 --> 00:17:37.760
of them which believe not.

00:17:38.679 --> 00:17:41.339
There is a blinding from truth.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.639
Notice not only is there a blinding from truth

00:17:44.639 --> 00:17:46.479
but I would say this this morning,

00:17:46.479 --> 00:17:48.839
there is a battle for truth.

00:17:48.839 --> 00:17:50.479
There's a battle for truth.

00:17:50.479 --> 00:17:52.639
We begin to think about what's taking place

00:17:52.639 --> 00:17:55.040
and I've often mentioned from this pulpit

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.760
especially over the last several years

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.720
the fact that we are engaged not in cultural warfare

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.600
though people will seek to say that

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.679
and they'll seek to peddle that idea,

00:18:05.679 --> 00:18:09.239
the reality is that we are engaged in spiritual warfare.

00:18:09.239 --> 00:18:11.479
And as we're engaged in spiritual warfare

00:18:11.479 --> 00:18:14.839
we find that there's a battle for truth.

00:18:14.839 --> 00:18:17.739
I am thankful this morning that truth stands.

00:18:17.739 --> 00:18:20.959
I am thankful that truth, see oftentimes what happens

00:18:20.959 --> 00:18:25.959
is the individuals that are attacking biblical truth,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.199
biblical Christianity, the person of Jesus Christ,

00:18:29.199 --> 00:18:30.760
the people that are attacking,

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.119
they're asking us to defend truth.

00:18:34.119 --> 00:18:37.820
But so often what happens is we fail to cause them

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.299
to defend their positions.

00:18:40.299 --> 00:18:43.099
And the reality is that truth stands.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.640
And we find here this morning that as we look

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.960
at the word of God we find that there has been

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.960
a relentless attack on truth from the beginning.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.520
You go all the way back to the Garden of Eden,

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.299
you go all the way back to the record

00:18:58.299 --> 00:19:01.219
that God gives us in Genesis chapter number three

00:19:01.219 --> 00:19:04.339
and you read in the first four verses of Genesis three

00:19:04.339 --> 00:19:09.339
how that the truth that God had given to Adam and Eve

00:19:09.359 --> 00:19:13.020
has been attacked and there has been a relentless attack.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.239
Truth has been relentlessly attacked.

00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:21.239
It's amazing to me how many attack Jesus Christ.

00:19:21.779 --> 00:19:23.500
Why is Jesus always attacked?

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.739
Because he is truth.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.460
Because he is truth.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:31.679
Why is it that in a day and age in which we live

00:19:31.679 --> 00:19:34.099
that it seems as if people really don't care

00:19:34.099 --> 00:19:36.479
if you use the word God but if you start talking

00:19:36.479 --> 00:19:39.359
about Jesus Christ now that's a different situation.

00:19:42.339 --> 00:19:44.299
We find that in Genesis chapter number three,

00:19:44.299 --> 00:19:45.820
turn over there quickly,

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.580
we're familiar with the text of scripture

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.419
but I want you to notice that here in Genesis chapter

00:19:50.419 --> 00:19:53.020
number three we see the first assault if you will,

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.539
the battle for truth and we understand the simple command

00:19:56.539 --> 00:19:59.539
that God had given back in Genesis chapter number two

00:19:59.539 --> 00:20:00.380
in verses.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:05.500
16 and 17, the Lord said this, and the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:11.220
of the garden thou mayest freely eat, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:17.260
thou shalt not eat of it, for in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die."

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:23.580
It's a simple command with known consequences.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.500
It's truth.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.780
And we come to Genesis chapter number 3.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:35.620
The Bible begins in verse number 1, and it says this, Now the serpent, that's the enemy,

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:41.220
that's Satan, now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.220
God had made.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:49.260
And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.260
garden.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:58.500
Do you notice how the initial attack on truth is simply by planting a seed of doubt?

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.540
Simply planting a seed of doubt.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:04.500
Yea, hath God said?

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.980
And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden,

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:12.580
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.540
not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:21.380
And notice in verse number 4, an on, a full out assault on truth, And the serpent said

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:28.380
unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:37.660
But God said, In the day that ye eat thereof, thou shalt surely die.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:42.900
Wonder why John 8 records where Jesus says that you're of your father the devil, that

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:47.640
he's a murderer and he's a liar from the beginning.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:54.300
And we find here in Genesis chapter number 3 that the Bible then, Satan begins to, listen,

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.980
you understand he never denies the existence of God.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.860
We've got a bunch of atheists running around today that deny the existence of God, but

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.340
Satan doesn't deny the existence of God.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:07.460
In fact, James tells us that the devils, they believe in tremble.

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:10.940
You look at the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, when He walked upon the face of the

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:15.580
earth, when there were those that were demon-possessed that were in the presence of Jesus, they knew

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:20.460
who Jesus was, and they said, Have you come to torment us before our time?

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:26.460
Because not only do they know who Jesus is, but they know what their end is.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:32.180
We find that here, Satan does not deny the existence of God, he questions the goodness

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:35.580
of God.

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:41.340
He says this in verse number 5, For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:48.620
your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:54.100
God's holding something from you that's good for you, basically is what Satan is saying.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:59.580
God knows that in the day you eat this, it's going to open your eyes, illuminate you.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.779
And God's withholding something good from you.

00:23:01.779 --> 00:23:06.460
Listen, today it just goes something like this, God wants you to be happy.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:10.180
God wants you to just be you.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:13.419
Do what makes you happy, because that's what God wants.

00:23:13.419 --> 00:23:16.940
That's not what God says.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.700
There is a battle for truth, and the battle rages.

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:24.380
Notice in the book of Romans, we've looked at several verses already in the book of Romans,

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:32.059
but notice in Romans chapter number 1, in Romans chapter number 1, I want you to notice

00:23:32.059 --> 00:23:38.139
this morning as we're considering this truth, that truth, the truth shall make you free.

00:23:38.139 --> 00:23:42.620
Yes, I'm thankful for the truth that we have as Americans, but if we'd be honest this morning,

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:48.220
that as the people of God, the freedom that I have in America pales in comparison to the

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.900
freedom that we have in Christ.

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:55.020
There are missionaries all across that missions board that we support that are living in places

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:59.300
all across this world that they do not have a Bill of Rights, they do not have a United

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:03.540
States Constitution, but they have freedom in Christ.

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:07.380
And by the way, many of those missionaries are doing a whole lot more for the cause of

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:12.540
Christ than Americans are, and we have freedom.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.540
It's amazing.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.220
Notice what he says here in Romans chapter number 1.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.580
We don't have time to look at the entirety of the passage, but really if you look at

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:29.380
verse 18 down through verse number 32, you just see just amazing disobedience to the

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.580
illumination of who God is and what God has given them.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:37.459
Notice in verse number 24, wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust

00:24:37.459 --> 00:24:41.860
of their own hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves, who changed the

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:49.300
truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator,

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.119
who is blessed forever, amen.

00:24:53.119 --> 00:24:56.540
Do we not see this in our land today?

00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:02.220
That they changed the truth of God into a lie.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:07.260
And still to this very day, there is a battle for truth.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:11.480
They try to take the truth that God's given, they try to change it into a lie, tell us

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.200
something different.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:20.080
The Bible tells us that they worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.320
We see that in our society, do we not?

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:27.679
Really as you look at the entirety of this section of Romans chapter number 1, you find

00:25:27.679 --> 00:25:32.440
that they deny the existence of God because really they don't want to be accountable to

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.679
God.

00:25:34.679 --> 00:25:38.899
We find that there's this battle for truth as we consider this morning the battle for

00:25:38.899 --> 00:25:44.700
truth that rages in our land, that's raged since Genesis chapter number 3.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:50.660
We would find that the admonition that we read of from Jude in verses 3 and 4 is an

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:55.140
admonition that we need to apply in our lives today.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:26:01.300
Jude begins writing this short letter, and it's interesting because Jude is going to

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:08.020
write this letter and it tells us that he was going to write about the common salvation.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:13.059
I mean, what a joyful subject to discuss the salvation that we have through the Lord Jesus

00:26:13.059 --> 00:26:20.119
Christ, the unity that we have as brothers and sisters in Christ because of that salvation

00:26:20.119 --> 00:26:24.739
through Christ, and he says in verse number 3, Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write

00:26:24.739 --> 00:26:29.500
unto you of the common salvation, notice it says it was needful for me to write unto you

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:35.179
and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto

00:26:35.179 --> 00:26:36.179
the saints.

00:26:36.179 --> 00:26:37.179
Why?

00:26:37.339 --> 00:26:39.500
What's the need here, Jude?

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.899
Why do we need to earnestly contend for the faith?

00:26:41.899 --> 00:26:45.860
Why is it that we need to get involved in this battle for truth?

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:48.700
Why do we need to engage in the fight for truth?

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:55.339
Notice what he says in verse number 4, For there are certain men crept in unawares, who

00:26:55.339 --> 00:27:00.779
were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men, turning the grace of our God

00:27:00.779 --> 00:27:07.220
into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.220
It's interesting.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:12.980
It's the truth that will make you free, the grace and mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:18.820
and here in verse number 4, it says of these men that crept in unawares, these false teachers,

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:26.220
that they're turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, unbridled lust.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.700
Do what you want.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.179
God wants you to be happy.

00:27:31.179 --> 00:27:33.480
That's just not what the Word of God says.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:38.820
He actually says this, If you love me, keep my commandments.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.959
If you love me, keep my commandments.

00:27:40.959 --> 00:27:45.739
He says this, flee from fornication.

00:27:45.739 --> 00:27:51.179
That flies in the face of the society in which we live in today, does it not?

00:27:51.179 --> 00:27:55.700
And we find that we go to the Word of God, listen, there's a blinding from truth, but

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.300
there's also a battle for truth.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:02.940
And we must acknowledge those two things this morning, but finally this morning as we wrap

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:07.860
up our time, I want you to acknowledge this morning with me the blessing of truth.

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:13.420
I'm so thankful this morning for the passage of Scripture in John chapter number 8, where

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:19.660
Jesus is standing there before those religious leaders, and he's giving them this powerful

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.980
truth that this morning is our focus of our message.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:27.899
He says, Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.

00:28:27.899 --> 00:28:31.420
Listen, this morning we must acknowledge the blessings of truth.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:38.340
I am so thankful this morning that not only to live in a nation of freedom, but to have

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:43.419
the truth of God's Word, the freedom that His Word offers us.

00:28:43.419 --> 00:28:48.179
You know, it'd be a horrible thing to live in a nation that has freedom void of the truth

00:28:48.179 --> 00:28:51.260
of God's Word.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.500
What does that freedom really get us?

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.299
Because the reality is that the Bible tells us that man goes to his long home.

00:28:58.299 --> 00:29:04.099
I don't care how long you live here on the earth, it's a short time compared to eternity.

00:29:04.099 --> 00:29:09.460
I'm going to live to be 100, man, compared to eternity, that's just that long, right?

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:12.799
I understand sometimes we think, man, that's a long time.

00:29:12.799 --> 00:29:14.340
Sometimes a week can be a long time, right?

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:19.739
I mean, you get into the life and you're like, man, it just seems like it's dragging.

00:29:19.739 --> 00:29:23.520
But in comparison to eternity, it's nothing.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:32.580
And to live in a nation that has freedom void of the freedom that Christ offers, no thank

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.220
you.

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:41.200
I'd rather live in a land that has no freedom, but has the freedom that Christ offers.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:45.059
And we find this truth this morning as we acknowledge the blessing, listen, we ought

00:29:45.059 --> 00:29:51.299
to rejoice this morning because God has providentially preserved truth for us.

00:29:51.299 --> 00:29:54.539
Notice he says, ye shall know the truth.

00:29:54.539 --> 00:29:59.340
In John 17, here in just a few chapters, we find that Jesus would say this, sanctify them

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.340
through thy word.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:00.340


00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:04.780
word is truth. I'm thankful this morning that we can know the truth. I'm thankful

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.660
this morning that someone was faithful to deliver the truth to you, that

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:12.220
someone was faithful to deliver the truth to me. I'm thankful that we then

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:17.740
have the privilege and the opportunity to deliver the truth to someone else.

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:24.780
Because it is the truth that makes men free. And we find here this morning that

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:31.380
God has providentially preserved truth for us. I wonder this morning, when's the

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:39.500
last time you thanked God for His Bible, His Word? Every single day when I get

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:45.420
into this book I start by saying, God thank you for the Word of God. Thank you

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:52.100
for preserving this book so that I could read it. Thank you that I have it in my

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:58.460
language, that I can read it. Then I begin to pray, God would you teach me

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:03.260
out of this book? God would you help me to understand it? The Holy Spirit's the

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:08.260
teacher. Open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:16.740
Speak Lord for thy servant heareth. Lord teach me thy truth and Lord help me to

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:22.660
walk in thy truth. That's our approach to the Bible. Listen, I am so thankful this

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:27.540
morning that God's given us a Bible. I honestly, I don't know where we'd be

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:35.700
without a Bible. There are people all across the world that do not have Bibles.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:41.220
There are some that have Bibles that neglect them, that just sit on a table,

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:46.260
sit on a bookshelf. And yet there are people all across the globe that do not

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:51.220
have the Word of God. This morning we ought to thank God for the blessing of

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:57.660
truth, that He has providentially preserved His Word for us. He said to

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:00.860
these religious leaders, you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:05.340
free. I'm thankful this morning that the truth has been preserved for us and that

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:09.540
as we've been given the truth of the gospel that we have been set free. If you

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:14.860
have obeyed, as Paul says there to the believers in Rome, if you've obeyed the

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:18.500
truth that was delivered, then you have been set at liberty, you have been made

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:23.740
free from the dominion of sin. We ought to rejoice in that. Number two, as we

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:27.380
think about acknowledging the blessing of truth, we ought to rejoice that Jesus

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:34.580
is truth, that He is truth. Of course, He stands in John 14, a verse that we often

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:40.740
would quote, and He says, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:45.340
the Father but by me. You know today that there are statistics that are floating

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:51.620
around that say of those that are professed Christians, now I have an idea

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:56.340
of what that means in my head, and you probably do as well, but the next

00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:03.220
statement causes me much confusion. They say that of professed Christians, about

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:10.220
one-third say that Jesus is the only way to heaven. That's perplexing to me. I

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:15.940
don't understand that, but yet I find that there was a church that

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:20.300
unfortunately had in its name Baptist, that was in New York City a number of

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:26.340
years ago, that the pastor stood up and said this idea as he's preaching, he says

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:32.180
the idea that Jesus is the only way to heaven is irrelevant and it's just not

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:36.180
true, and when he made the statement you could hear the applause of the

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:42.900
congregation. Unbelievable, I heard it with my own ears.

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:51.500
Unbelievable, because Jesus said I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:57.220
cometh unto the Father but by me. Peter, who would have heard Jesus speak those

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:01.380
words, would stand before the religious leaders in Acts 4 and he'd say neither

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:06.420
is there salvation in any other. There's no other name under heaven given among

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:14.060
men whereby we must be saved. The name of Jesus. You read the book of Philippians

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:19.140
and you read how the Bible tells us about the Lord taking on the form of a

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:22.300
servant and going to the cross. He humbled himself, he became obedient unto

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:26.420
death, even the death of the cross, but God also hath highly exalted his name

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:31.060
and given him a name which is above every other name. And it's at the name of

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:38.100
Jesus that every tongue will confess, every knee is going to bow, that Jesus

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:48.220
Christ is Lord. It's not a question of if, it's a question of when, because every

00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:53.700
knee will bow and every tongue will confess. And I will say this this morning,

00:34:53.700 --> 00:35:00.140
you've heard me say it before, when makes all the difference. You profess that

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:06.420
before you take your final breath here on earth, heaven is your home. If you deny

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:12.340
that truth and you enter into a Christless eternity, and I believe that at the Great

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:18.980
White Throne Judgment, you will acknowledge that Jesus is Lord. I hope this morning

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:22.540
that you've made that proclamation, you've understood, listen, the truth has

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:27.300
made us free. The truth is Jesus. Not only the truth being His Word, but the truth

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:31.100
is Jesus. Remember in the verse that we read there in Galatians 5, in verse

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:34.540
number 1, where the Word of God says this, He says,

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:40.540
Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:45.820
be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. Finally this morning, as we

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:49.820
acknowledge the blessing of truth, as we rejoice that God's given us truth in His

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:55.140
precious Word, as we rejoice that Jesus Himself is truth, as we acknowledge this

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.900
morning that there's a blinding from truth, that there is a battle for truth,

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:10.020
we must purpose to proclaim the truth. As a nation, right or wrong, not part of this

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:14.500
discussion, but as a nation, as you look at the history of our nation, we've gotten

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:19.620
involved in conflicts all across the globe, and many times we've tried to give

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:26.980
them freedom. Could I say to you this morning that as the people of God, we

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:33.620
must have a burning zeal to deliver the message that we're speaking of this

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:42.900
morning, that Christ gives freedom. I appreciate the fact that we would want

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:48.140
other countries and other people groups to have freedom. I appreciate that, but if

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:52.100
they only have freedom from tyranny, if they only have freedom from some

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:56.700
dictator, if they only have freedom from some whatever-you-want-to-say-the-

00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:00.340
condition-is-that-they're-dealing-with, but they do not have the freedom that

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:05.380
we're speaking of this morning, they will simply live, perhaps live a life of

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:11.620
pleasure, and then face a Christless eternity. That's the reality of it. And

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:17.500
this morning, as we understand the stakes and what's going on, and the

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:23.420
truth of what's before us this morning, we find that there are many today that

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:31.700
remain in bondage. There are many today that continue to be blinded from truth,

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:37.620
and they remain in bondage. They've not been set at liberty. They've not been

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:44.420
made free from the truth that God has given us. They've not been set free

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:51.340
from the bondage of sin. But this morning, I'm thankful to say that truth

00:37:51.340 --> 00:38:00.740
still works. Jesus still saves. The truth is still powerful. If our gospel be hid,

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:05.540
it is hid to them that are lost. Paul encouraged the believers in Ephesus in

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:11.820
Ephesians 4 and verse 15 to speak the truth in love. Paul gave the command, the

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:16.900
admonition, the charge, if you will, to Timothy in 2 Timothy chapter number 4. He

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:22.180
tells them to preach the word. Oh, he also let them know that there was going to

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:26.260
come a time when they weren't going to endure sound doctrine. But it did not

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:31.540
change the instruction. Paul didn't say to Timothy, hey, listen, Timothy, you preach

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:37.020
the word until they don't want to hear it. No, no, he just said preach the word. Be

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:40.180
instant, in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:46.980
doubt. That's what he told them to do. This morning, we as the people of God, if

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:51.840
our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost. We sing the song with the kids.

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:58.300
Sometimes I think we ought to sing kids' songs more. Honestly, this little light of

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:05.740
mine, I'm going to let it shine. Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine. Don't

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:12.820
let Satan blow it out, hide it under a bushel, no. Let it shine till Jesus comes. I'm going

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:20.980
to let it shine. I have decided to follow Jesus. No turning back, no turning back. Though

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:29.340
none go with me, still I will follow. That's what we sing with the kids. But somehow along

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:36.700
the way, we become adults and we think, well, we forget some of those songs. This morning,

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:45.040
there's a blinding from truth. We see it in our world today. There's a battle for truth.

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:50.580
But this morning, we rejoice in the blessing of truth. The fact that we have truth, man,

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:55.860
we ought to rejoice. The fact that the truth has set us free, it's made us free, oh, we

00:39:55.860 --> 00:40:00.260
ought to rejoice. But you know, if you have a neighbor...

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:09.220
a coworker, a relative, that they're still in bondage, wouldn't you like for them to

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.220
be made free?

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.220
Right?

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:12.220
Does that make sense?

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:20.940
You want them to be made free, and you have the truth that has the power to make them

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:21.940
free.

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.180
That's amazing.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:28.440
And yet sometimes we just don't say it.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.240
We just don't share it.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.340
We just don't give it.

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.900
And they remain in bondage.

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:42.180
This morning, Jesus stood before those blinded religious leaders.

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:46.740
In fact, in chapter number nine, after the healing of the man that was born blind, they

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.860
say, are we blind also?

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.220
Yep, absolutely.

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.760
Spiritual blindness.

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:58.700
And spiritual blindness is a whole lot worse than physical blindness.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:02.200
This morning, the truth shall make you free.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:09.040
When you celebrate this weekend and you rejoice in being in the land of the free, and you

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:14.920
think about the freedoms that we have as Americans, you ought to be thankful for that.

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:22.280
But we must acknowledge this morning that those freedoms pale in comparison to the freedom

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.340
that we have in Christ.

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:25.340
Let me say this.

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:33.680
In my lifetime, some of my freedoms as an American might not be enjoyed any longer.

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:36.520
It's possible.

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:41.600
But nobody can take my freedom that I have in Christ.

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:43.120
It's powerful.

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:50.220
This morning, we need to proclaim, purpose to proclaim the truth, because the truth sets

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:51.220
men free.

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:52.220
Let's pray.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:53.860
Father, we love You.

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.760
We thank You for loving us.

00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:05.320
This morning, I'm so grateful to know You, the way, the truth, and the life.

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:13.280
As my personal Savior, I thank You that You've given us Thy Word, and Thy Word is truth.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:20.620
And God, this morning as we acknowledge, it's nothing new that there's a blinding from truth.

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:25.240
Nothing new that there's a battle for truth.

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.880
We see it all around us.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:36.900
God, I pray that as we rejoice in the blessing of truth, that we would not only be thankful

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:45.440
for what You've given to us, but that we would have a genuine concern for our neighbor, our

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.580
coworker, our relative.

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:55.220
So often, there are movements, even in our society today, of wanting to provide some

00:42:55.220 --> 00:43:02.000
level of opportunity or liberty to some people.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:09.020
And yet, as Your people, as the children of God, sometimes we fail to recognize the importance

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:19.160
of giving truth that would set men free from the dominion of sin, that they might pass

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:28.120
from death unto life, no longer being the servant of sin, but the servant of righteousness,

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:35.040
no longer heading for a Christless eternity in the lake of fire, but having eternal life

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.440
in Your presence.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:47.000
Oh, God, would You help us to have a renewed passion, help us to have a renewed vision,

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:54.280
not to get behind some cause, but to lift up the name of Christ.

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.000
We pray that You'd move and work in these moments of invitation.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.180
If there's one that's not sure of heaven, oh, God, I pray that today would be the day

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:03.920
of their salvation.

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:11.020
Your people all across this auditorium this morning, Lord, would You work in our hearts.

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:14.320
We don't want to just be stirred, we want to be changed.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:17.360
We don't want to just be hearers, we want to be doers.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:21.080
I pray that You'd move and work in these moments of invitation, for it's in Christ's name we

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.080
pray.

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.080
Would You stand with me?

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:24.080
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:26.760
Holly's going to play quietly on the piano.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.040
As she plays, the altar is open.
