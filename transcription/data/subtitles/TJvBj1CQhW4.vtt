00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880
A couple of weeks ago, we looked at Genesis 17, verse number one.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.260
Last week, we observed the Lord's Supper, and I preached from 1 Corinthians 11.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.559
But two weeks ago, our last study in the book of Genesis, we were here in Genesis 17, and

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:21.500
we noted the way in which the Lord appeared to Abram and really focused in that message

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.079
on the significance of the name El Shaddai.

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.639
In verse number one of Genesis 17, the Bible says, when Abram was 90 years old and nine,

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:36.479
the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him, I am the Almighty God.

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:39.520
Walk before me and be thou perfect.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.400
And we mentioned what God declared and then what God demanded, and El Shaddai is the Hebrew

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.360
of the Almighty God.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:55.520
And what a blessing to see and to note just the significance of who God is and to know

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.520
the Lord God Almighty.

00:00:56.959 --> 00:01:02.919
And as you look in the passage of Scripture, it's interesting to note the posture of Abram.

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:07.360
According to verse number three, the Bible says, and Abram fell on his face.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.360
And Abram fell on his face.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.000
It's interesting if you study through the Word of God and you see those that have had

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.580
opportunities to interact with God direct, you find that they would fall upon their face

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.480
and worship before the holiness of our God.

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:30.959
And what a blessing to understand that God was seeking to communicate truth to Abram

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:32.559
with regard to who He is.

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:37.040
As you read through this passage of Scripture in Genesis 17, you will note the declarative

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.919
statements of Almighty God.

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:44.319
I will is mentioned often as God is speaking to Abram.

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:50.519
And it's interesting as we would note that God first told Abraham who He is and then

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:54.160
revealed to Abraham what He would do.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.959
And when we know who God is, it goes a long way in trusting what He says He will do.

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:05.839
And He says, I am the Lord God Almighty, and then He says, I will do these things.

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:08.300
I will bring these things to pass.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.039
And so God reveals first to Abraham who He is, and then He will declare and reveal to

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:17.720
Abraham the things that He will do.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.080
You understand that as we look in the Word of God, as we study through the pages of Scripture,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.360
and as we find that God has revealed Himself to us, and He's used throughout the Old Testament

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.679
in particular a number of names that would help us to understand certain aspects about

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.720
the character and nature of God.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.720
And as we are mindful of those things, it helps us to understand that He indeed is able

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.479
to do all things, that nothing, nothing is too hard for our God.

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:56.360
And I'm so just thankful and overwhelmed with joy that God Almighty would reveal Himself

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.279
to us.

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:03.520
And then that we, because of the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ, can have a relationship

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.160
with the God of the universe, and that He's interested in our lives.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.520
And as we look at Abraham here, and we look at all that's going on, and we understand

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.639
that here God is going to once again discuss various aspects of the covenant.

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.880
We'd understand that this is not a new covenant, rather a reaffirmation of the covenant that

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.039
we've already discussed and studied.

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:28.399
You go back to Genesis chapter number 12 and Genesis chapter number 15, and you find that

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:32.800
it's there in those passages of Scripture that you find many details with regard to

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.600
what we often refer to as the Abrahamic covenant.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.479
Here again you'll find many aspects of that truth being revealed to us in Genesis 17.

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:43.119
Note with me in verse number 5, the Bible says,

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:49.320
"...neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.880
For a father of many nations have I made thee."

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.000
I've titled the message this evening, Thy Name Shall Be Abraham.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.199
The name Abram means exalted father, but the name Abraham means father of multitudes.

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:09.259
Exalted father, Abram, Abraham, father of multitudes.

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:12.779
As we look at the passage of Scripture, I want you to note, first of all, the plan.

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:17.700
In verses 2 through 16, God is speaking to Abraham, and we find that he begins, and we

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.019
find that it says that he appeared to Abram in verse number 1, and he says in verse number

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.399
2, "...and I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:31.619
And Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying..."

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:37.660
Now notice as we look at these next few verses, the plan of God that is being once again spoken

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.859
to Abraham with regard to these things that would come to pass with regard to this covenant

00:04:42.859 --> 00:04:47.940
that God is making with Abraham, and we find the first aspect of what God will deal with

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.779
is the seed.

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:54.140
We focused on this as we've studied in Genesis 12 and in Genesis 15, but you notice that

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:01.100
the Bible says this in verse number 4, "...as for me, behold, my covenant is with thee,

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.779
and thou shalt be a father of many nations.

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:09.459
Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham.

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:15.019
For a father of many nations have I made thee, and I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:19.459
I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:24.179
And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee in their

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:25.179
generations."

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:31.899
Notice, "...for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:32.899
thee."

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:37.500
We tend to think about the plan that God is revealing to Abraham, and we understand the

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.420
seed that is referenced, and we'd say this as we look at this portion of Scripture, there's

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:48.700
one aspect with regard to the physical or natural seed, the descendants of Abraham,

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.179
if you will, and we'd understand that here in this passage, and of course in a few chapters

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:58.820
in the book of Genesis, the record is given to us with regard to the birth of Isaac, the

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:05.260
result of Abraham and Sarah, and of course Isaac would be born, and the natural descendant,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.619
the physical descendant of Abraham.

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:11.459
Of course we're familiar, as we've studied in previous passages of Scripture, there in

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:17.019
chapter number 16, with regard to Abraham and Hagar, and the birth of Ishmael.

00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:22.260
And then we're also mindful that in Genesis chapter number 25, the Bible tells us that

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.779
Abraham took Ketorah to be his wife.

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:30.100
The Bible tells us that there are six sons that are born of Abraham and Ketorah there

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.420
in Genesis chapter number 25.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:38.660
And so we'd understand physical or natural descendants of Abraham, as we'd find here

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.459
in this passage of Scripture, and of course the focus of Scripture, just as we mentioned

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:50.179
after the Tower of Babel, and how that God zooms in upon Abraham, Abram at the time,

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:55.579
and how that God will focus in upon the lineage of the Lord Jesus Christ, and we'll see that

00:06:55.579 --> 00:06:59.299
to be the case also with regard to the birth of Isaac.

00:06:59.299 --> 00:07:06.100
We find, however, that more than just speaking of a physical or natural seed or descendants,

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:12.140
that God has revealed to us through His Word the spiritual seed, or the spiritual descendants.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.899
We understand when we speak about the seed, if you turn to the book of Galatians and hold

00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:23.380
your place there, that there is the physical, but there's also the spiritual aspect.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:30.179
In Galatians chapter number 3, when God is giving us truth here, as Paul is relaying

00:07:30.179 --> 00:07:35.500
these powerful truths to the believers in the region of Galatia, he says this in verse

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:40.179
number 16, "'Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made.

00:07:40.179 --> 00:07:47.619
He saith not, and to seeds, plural, as of many, but as of one, and to thy seed, which

00:07:47.619 --> 00:07:48.619
is Christ.'"

00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:53.700
So, again, as we look at the lineage of the Lord Jesus Christ throughout Scripture, and

00:07:53.700 --> 00:08:00.579
again, the zooming in of God upon the line of Abraham after the Tower of Babel, and then

00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:06.820
zooming in further upon that of Isaac, of course, the descendants of Isaac, of course,

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.859
going through Israel there, and His Twelve, and so on and so forth.

00:08:10.859 --> 00:08:16.140
And so we would find how that the lens of Scripture will focus upon the lineage of the

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.459
Lord Jesus Christ.

00:08:17.459 --> 00:08:22.019
It is interesting, however, to note in the same passage of Scripture in Galatians 3,

00:08:22.019 --> 00:08:28.779
the Bible says this in verse number 7, "'Know ye therefore that they which are of faith,

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:33.739
the same are the children of Abraham.'

00:08:33.739 --> 00:08:40.619
And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached

00:08:40.619 --> 00:08:48.260
before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:54.260
So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.'"

00:08:54.260 --> 00:09:00.299
And I'm thankful for the truth of the New Testament with regard to this spiritual descendant,

00:09:00.299 --> 00:09:05.219
if you will, or descendants, those that have come to the knowledge of the truth of the

00:09:05.219 --> 00:09:13.020
gospel, and those which are of faith are the same, the same are the children of Abraham.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:19.179
We'd find that all mankind needs to be redeemed, that there are but two categories of people

00:09:19.179 --> 00:09:20.179
in our world.

00:09:20.179 --> 00:09:23.539
There are those that have been born again, those that are saved, and there are those

00:09:23.539 --> 00:09:26.619
that are yet to be born again, those who are lost.

00:09:26.619 --> 00:09:31.700
And we'd find that all come by the way of the cross, and it does not matter what your

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:37.099
heritage or lineage is, it does not matter where you grew up or what your parents were.

00:09:37.099 --> 00:09:39.619
God, as one preacher said, has no grandchildren.

00:09:39.619 --> 00:09:42.140
He only has children.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:47.179
And I'm thankful for the truth that God gives us, and we think about the plan of God being

00:09:47.179 --> 00:09:52.500
revealed and the seed that is mentioned in verses 2-7, again back in Genesis 17, in verse

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:59.739
8, we'll find the focus now shifts to the land, to the land, and this again is truth

00:09:59.739 --> 00:10:04.899
been revealed to us already in Genesis 12 and 15, again, the reaffirmation of this covenant.

00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:05.899
Verse number 8, it says,

00:10:05.899 --> 00:10:11.099
Now I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger,

00:10:11.099 --> 00:10:17.699
all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession, and I will be their God.

00:10:17.699 --> 00:10:22.619
So God, once again, as He's giving this plan to Abraham, as He's speaking to Abraham, the

00:10:22.619 --> 00:10:27.899
Bible says that God talked with him, and Abraham, his posture is that he fell on his face, and

00:10:27.899 --> 00:10:33.299
Abraham is receiving this instruction from God, and God reminds him about the seed.

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:38.639
He reminds him about the land, and then we find that in verses 9 through 14, God gives

00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:44.659
and explains to Abraham the token of the covenant, that of circumcision.

00:10:44.659 --> 00:10:46.179
Notice in verse number 9, the Bible says,

00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:52.699
And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou and thy seed after

00:10:52.699 --> 00:10:54.899
thee in their generations.

00:10:54.899 --> 00:10:57.439
This is my covenant which ye shall keep.

00:10:57.439 --> 00:11:03.919
And me and you, and thy seed after thee, every man child among you shall be circumcised.

00:11:03.919 --> 00:11:10.239
And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be a token of the covenant

00:11:10.239 --> 00:11:13.559
betwixt me and you.

00:11:13.559 --> 00:11:18.759
And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations,

00:11:18.759 --> 00:11:22.799
he that is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:23.799
seed.

00:11:23.799 --> 00:11:29.199
And he that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money must needs be circumcised,

00:11:29.199 --> 00:11:33.159
and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.

00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:39.079
And the uncircumcised, verse 14, man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised,

00:11:39.079 --> 00:11:44.839
that soul shall be cut off from his people, he hath broken my covenant.

00:11:44.839 --> 00:11:49.759
As we begin to see this truth that is given here in verses 9 through 14, the token of

00:11:49.759 --> 00:11:55.639
the covenant, you see that word used specifically that it's a token of the covenant betwixt

00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:57.279
me and you.

00:11:57.279 --> 00:12:02.719
And that word, it really carries with it the idea of the sign, the covenant is given, this

00:12:02.719 --> 00:12:04.839
token of the covenant, the sign.

00:12:04.839 --> 00:12:09.039
The Bible tells us who, every man child, according to verse number 10.

00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:14.359
Again, according to verse number 12, the Bible says every man child shall be circumcised

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:15.359
among you.

00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:16.359
Why?

00:12:16.359 --> 00:12:17.359
Because it was a token.

00:12:17.359 --> 00:12:19.319
It was a sign of the covenant.

00:12:19.319 --> 00:12:20.319
And when?

00:12:20.319 --> 00:12:24.639
The Bible tells us specifically in verse number 12, and he that is eight days old.

00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:31.039
And so the Bible answers for Abraham very specifically who it is, why it is, and when

00:12:31.039 --> 00:12:32.599
it shall be done.

00:12:32.599 --> 00:12:37.219
We find that disobedience resulted in being cast out according to verse number 14.

00:12:37.219 --> 00:12:44.059
And we find that so as we look at this truth of what God is giving to Abraham with regard

00:12:44.059 --> 00:12:50.299
to the token of the covenant has many times been misunderstood throughout history.

00:12:50.299 --> 00:12:55.219
And what I mean by that is you'll find that even there in Acts chapter number 15, when

00:12:55.219 --> 00:12:59.859
they had the council at Jerusalem, there were those that were saying of the Jews that unless

00:12:59.859 --> 00:13:04.739
you're circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved.

00:13:04.739 --> 00:13:12.579
And so we find that this token of the covenant of circumcision, it did not, it was not something

00:13:12.579 --> 00:13:19.819
that Abraham did that caused him to be righteous before God.

00:13:19.819 --> 00:13:24.179
Notice with me in Romans chapter number 4, look at a couple of passages in the New Testament,

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:25.179
if you will.

00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:29.979
In Romans chapter number 4, and we've visited this passage of Scripture in the past, but

00:13:29.979 --> 00:13:37.939
I want you to notice that in Romans chapter number 4, in verse number 3, Paul is referring

00:13:38.019 --> 00:13:45.299
to an event that took place in the life of Abram in Genesis chapter number 15, well before

00:13:45.299 --> 00:13:50.859
the token of the covenant, that of circumcision, was ever explained to Abram.

00:13:50.859 --> 00:13:54.779
We find here in Romans chapter number 4, in verse number 3, the Bible says,

00:13:54.779 --> 00:14:01.779
For what sayeth the Scripture, Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.

00:14:01.779 --> 00:14:06.939
Again as we've studied, and I made note of this in Genesis chapter number 15, when God

00:14:06.939 --> 00:14:10.819
was speaking with Abram and that discussion is taking place, and Abram had mentioned about

00:14:10.819 --> 00:14:16.979
one born in his house was an heir, and it says that God reconfirms for him the promise,

00:14:16.979 --> 00:14:21.899
and it says he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness in Genesis

00:14:21.899 --> 00:14:24.579
15 in verse number 6.

00:14:24.579 --> 00:14:29.179
Again in Galatians 3, stay here in the book of Romans, but in Galatians 3 in verse number

00:14:29.179 --> 00:14:34.339
6, Paul refers to this same event that we just mentioned in Genesis 15, where the Bible

00:14:34.339 --> 00:14:40.979
says in Galatians 3 and 6, even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him

00:14:40.979 --> 00:14:42.380
for righteousness.

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:49.660
Again, that event in Genesis 15 predates the communication between God and Abraham that

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:56.179
we're studying in Genesis 17 with regard to the token of the covenant, that of circumcision.

00:14:56.179 --> 00:15:00.079
Look back in Romans 4 and look down at verse number 9, if you will.

00:15:00.079 --> 00:15:07.039
The Bible says this, "...cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:09.279
uncircumcision also?

00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:14.639
For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness."

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:16.940
How was it then reckoned?

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:23.079
When he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision?

00:15:23.079 --> 00:15:26.359
Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.

00:15:26.359 --> 00:15:27.359
Why?

00:15:27.639 --> 00:15:35.679
Again, Genesis 15 versus Genesis 17, the chronological order of these events in the life of Abraham,

00:15:35.679 --> 00:15:43.039
and again in verse number 11 it says, "...and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal

00:15:43.039 --> 00:15:50.199
of the righteousness of the faith which he had, yet being uncircumcised, that he might

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:55.619
be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised, that righteousness

00:15:55.699 --> 00:15:59.739
might be imputed unto them also."

00:15:59.739 --> 00:16:04.579
Paul, of course, as I mentioned already, the event in Acts chapter number 15, he dealt

00:16:04.579 --> 00:16:10.380
with it quite extensively in the book of Galatians, and we find that Paul would summarize it this

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:15.259
way in the book of Galatians, and he would say, "...for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision

00:16:15.259 --> 00:16:21.539
availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature."

00:16:21.539 --> 00:16:25.599
Of course, we're familiar with the passage of Scripture in 2 Corinthians 5 when Paul

00:16:25.599 --> 00:16:33.000
also was used by the Lord to append those words, "...if any man be in Christ, he is

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.639
a new creature.

00:16:34.639 --> 00:16:38.440
Old things are passed away, behold, all things are become new."

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:47.039
And so we find that Paul says, listen, "...circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:48.599
a new creature."

00:16:48.599 --> 00:16:51.679
These folks that were saying, running around saying, you had to be circumcised in order

00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:52.679
to be saved.

00:16:52.759 --> 00:16:57.359
No, salvation is through the work of Christ at Calvary.

00:16:57.359 --> 00:17:04.079
The truth of circumcision back in the book of Genesis with Abraham is with regard to

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:07.720
the token or the sign of the covenant.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:14.440
He believed God in chapter number 15, and it was counted, imputed to him for righteousness.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.000
So we see the plan back in Genesis chapter number 17.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Notice with me the plea.

00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:22.720
In verse 17, well, let me continue reading.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:27.839
In verse number 14, we read about those that disobeyed and did not follow in circumcision

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:29.039
and the consequence.

00:17:29.039 --> 00:17:34.599
In verse 15, "...and God said unto Abraham, Ask for Sarai thy wife.

00:17:34.599 --> 00:17:41.160
Thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:46.199
And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her, yea, I will bless her, and she

00:17:46.199 --> 00:17:49.479
shall be a mother of nations.

00:17:49.479 --> 00:17:53.440
Nations of people shall be of her."

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.160
So we find that God gave the plan.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.919
He spoke to Abraham about the seed, about the land.

00:17:58.919 --> 00:18:01.799
He changed Abram's name from Abram to Abraham.

00:18:01.799 --> 00:18:04.799
He changed Sarai's name from Sarai to Sarah.

00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:08.279
He gave him the token of the covenant, that of circumcision.

00:18:08.279 --> 00:18:14.919
And we find that God is, once again, interested in communicating to Abraham the plan.

00:18:14.919 --> 00:18:18.799
Now it's interesting to note, you could ask the question, why is it that God is rehearsing

00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:19.799
these things?

00:18:19.799 --> 00:18:23.079
Had God not already told Abraham that these things would happen?

00:18:23.079 --> 00:18:24.079
Absolutely.

00:18:24.079 --> 00:18:29.759
But there were some things that happened between Genesis 12, 15, and 17, and one of the most

00:18:29.759 --> 00:18:33.440
significant things that happened is what's recorded in chapter number 16 with the birth

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.000
of Ishmael.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.239
And we find that, as we've mentioned, that God has given to Abraham this promise all

00:18:40.239 --> 00:18:45.799
the way back in Genesis chapter number 12 about a seed, and yet now as we look at the

00:18:45.799 --> 00:18:50.359
passage in which we're in, remember, at the close of Genesis chapter number 16 until the

00:18:50.359 --> 00:18:54.880
beginning, the opening of Genesis chapter number 17, 13 years pass.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.119
Now 13 years is a long time.

00:18:58.119 --> 00:19:02.919
He was 86 when Ishmael was born, and he's 99 in verse number 1 when the Lord appears

00:19:02.919 --> 00:19:03.919
to him.

00:19:03.919 --> 00:19:04.919
Thirteen years.

00:19:04.919 --> 00:19:07.080
It's a lengthy period of time.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:11.839
So God is reaffirming that which He had promised, and we see the plan.

00:19:11.839 --> 00:19:12.839
Notice the plea.

00:19:12.839 --> 00:19:19.279
Verse 17, "'Then Abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart, Shall

00:19:19.279 --> 00:19:26.479
a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old, and shall Sarah that is ninety

00:19:26.479 --> 00:19:28.880
years old bear?'

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:36.640
Notice what Abraham says in verse 18, "'And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.640
live before thee.'"

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:49.279
There's much division perhaps is a good word, disagreement maybe is a better word actually.

00:19:49.279 --> 00:19:54.039
There's much disagreement amongst theologians with regard to Abraham laughing here in Genesis

00:19:54.039 --> 00:19:55.760
chapter number 17.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.320
There are some that will say that Abraham laughed out of joy.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:02.160
Yet, as you look at verse number 18 and you see what Abraham says, others would say that

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.240
he was laughing out of doubt.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:10.200
You find that he says, he asks the question, shall a child, in verse 17, be born unto him

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.800
that is a hundred years old, and shall Sarah that is ninety years old bear?

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:18.560
And Abraham said, oh, that Ishmael might live before thee.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.880
Ishmael's now thirteen years old.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.200
Ishmael's the son of Abraham.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:29.880
No doubt, as you'd understand Hebrew custom, he's now nearing the age of being a man.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.640
You'd find that Abraham is now pleading with, or making this plea before God.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:39.080
Twenty-four years has passed from the promise initially being given in Genesis chapter number

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.080
twelve.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.080
I mentioned that thirteen years is a long time, twenty-four years is even longer.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.920
Almost twice as long.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:50.400
In Genesis chapter number twelve, the Bible tells us in verse number four, well let me

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.960
just say this, in verse number one, it says that the Lord had said unto Abram, get thee

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.880
out of thy country, from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.600
I will show thee, and I will make of thee a great nation.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.400
I will bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.680
Verse four, so Abram departed as the Lord had spoken unto him, and Lot went with him,

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:12.440
and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:17.320
He's seventy-five when God tells him that He's going to make of him a great nation.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:21.600
And he's ninety-nine and he has no children.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.600
Twenty-four years.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:27.560
Remember, it was there in Genesis chapter number fifteen that Abram, again, is having

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:32.160
discussion with God, and as they're having this interaction, we know that God appears

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.120
to him and says to Abram, I am thy shield.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.920
He says, fear not, Abram, I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:44.460
And then we find that Abram would say to God, behold, in verse number three of Genesis fifteen,

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:54.400
to me thou hast given no seed, and lo, one born in my house is mine heir.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:01.460
No doubt what Abram was suggesting or presenting to God was his logical conclusion with regard

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.300
to the circumstances that he was facing.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:10.260
We find that God, again, in His grace and His mercy, He gives the word of the Lord,

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:18.100
comes to Abram and says in verse number four, very clearly, this shall not be thine heir.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:23.020
But he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:27.540
You come to chapter number sixteen and another ten years has passed between the events that

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:33.460
we've read already up to this point, and we find that the event is recorded of the situation

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.460
with Hagar and the birth of Ishmael.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:40.580
These twenty-four years have now passed and God is now speaking to Abraham and telling

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:44.980
Abraham that He's going to, again, give him a son and that a child shall be born.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:51.900
And Abraham says, oh, that Ishmael might live before thee.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:23:00.340
We see the response, if you will, the plea of Abraham in verses seventeen and eighteen.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:05.340
We find that God graciously, once again, responds and we find the promises that are

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:09.020
given in verses nineteen through twenty-two.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:12.940
You know, I'm so thankful that God is gracious and long-suffering with us.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:18.180
I'm so thankful that God would repeat Himself.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:21.020
Really it's kind of what He's doing with Abraham over and over here, is it not?

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:25.020
Over these last few chapters, the things that have evolved in the life of Abraham and the

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:30.300
things that he's dealt with in his own not being able to understand.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:34.260
And sometimes, even as I've mentioned when we've studied through these passages of Scripture

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:41.100
and the length of time that has gone on, many of us can't wait just a few minutes on God,

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.060
let alone years.

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.140
Years.

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:50.580
I've heard stories of individuals that have prayed for years and years and years for a

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.620
loved one to be saved.

00:23:53.620 --> 00:24:00.420
And their long-suffering and their persistence in prayer and how God would answer that prayer.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:08.300
But honestly, this evening, most of us, waiting is not like our best attribute.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.780
Most of us don't like to wait.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:15.380
I mentioned as I was preaching a couple of weeks ago about that, the way in which they've

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:21.980
calculated how many years totaled up of minutes in your life you'll spend doing certain things

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:25.820
and I mentioned about you'll spend two years waiting in line.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:28.899
And I said, for me, it's going to be longer because I always find the line that seems

00:24:28.899 --> 00:24:30.619
to take the longest.

00:24:30.619 --> 00:24:33.339
It just happened to me the other day, yesterday.

00:24:33.339 --> 00:24:34.339
Where's Joseph?

00:24:34.339 --> 00:24:35.339
He's back there.

00:24:35.339 --> 00:24:36.339
We get in line at Walmart.

00:24:36.339 --> 00:24:38.339
Joseph says, Daddy, this isn't a good line.

00:24:38.339 --> 00:24:39.339
They're kind of slow here.

00:24:39.339 --> 00:24:41.580
I know it's a speedy checkout, but they're not really speedy.

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.059
Isn't that what you told me?

00:24:43.059 --> 00:24:44.059
That's what he said.

00:24:44.059 --> 00:24:47.200
And I said, bud, there's only two people in front of us.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.580
The one person's got half of his things taken care of already and this lady, she's only

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:51.779
got about four or five things.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.700
He just had three things.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.899
He said, Daddy, I'm telling you, we were here just the other day and it's not speedy.

00:24:56.899 --> 00:25:00.580
And I said, but if we have to walk all the way down there, and we had to walk that way

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:04.860
to get out anyway, to go into the self-checkout line, I can see that there's a bunch of people

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:05.860
in line.

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:07.580
So, if we just wait, it'll be faster.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:12.179
Wouldn't you know that the last item of that guy in front of us had no price number, no

00:25:12.179 --> 00:25:13.179
barcode on it?

00:25:13.179 --> 00:25:16.020
I mean, it's just the way it works.

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:20.260
I mean, do you know how much this is?

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.700
I said to Joseph, let's go, and we went walking all the way down there, you know?

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:27.500
I should have listened to him in the first place.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:31.619
Waiting is something that most of us don't enjoy doing.

00:25:31.619 --> 00:25:33.740
Abraham was waiting on God.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:46.380
24 years, God had promised him a seed, a son, and yet there's no son with him and Sarah.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:50.980
So God, once again, is going to give these promises.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:58.260
Note, as we look at verses 19 through 22, note the clarity and the certainty.

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:05.899
I'm thankful that our God gives the clarity that Abraham needed.

00:26:05.899 --> 00:26:08.020
And God said, verse 19,

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:15.100
Sarah, thy wife, shall bear thee a son indeed.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.020
Isn't that encouraging?

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.580
Remember, who's speaking?

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:23.660
El Shaddai, the Almighty God.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:37.740
He says, Abraham, Sarah, thy wife, shall bear thee a son indeed, and thou shalt call his

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:40.899
name Isaac.

00:26:40.899 --> 00:26:47.779
And I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed

00:26:47.779 --> 00:26:50.100
after him.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:56.339
To the plea of Abraham and the cry in verse 18, oh, that Ishmael might live before thee,

00:26:56.339 --> 00:27:01.020
God repeats the promise that he's made, and he says, Sarah, thy wife, shall bear thee

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.619
a son indeed.

00:27:02.619 --> 00:27:04.179
His name shall be Isaac.

00:27:04.179 --> 00:27:09.619
And it's through him that I will establish my covenant, which is an everlasting covenant.

00:27:09.619 --> 00:27:13.460
We find that this would come to pass in Genesis 22.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:18.460
In fact, if you turn just a few pages over, excuse me, Genesis chapter 21, if you turn

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:23.300
over just a few pages, you find the Bible says in verse number one of Genesis 21, and

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:30.580
the Lord visited Sarah, notice these next words, as he had said.

00:27:30.899 --> 00:27:37.300
And the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.899
You know, God always does what he says he will do.

00:27:40.899 --> 00:27:42.700
God's never going to fail you.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:47.540
He always does what he says he will do.

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:51.860
We find that it came to pass in Genesis chapter 21.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:56.580
Notice in verse number 20, back in Genesis chapter number 17.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:05.020
I love how God says this in verse number 20, and as for Ishmael, we find that it's

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:09.619
Abraham that would cry and plead to God in verse 18, oh, that Ishmael might live before

00:28:09.619 --> 00:28:10.619
thee.

00:28:10.619 --> 00:28:15.140
And God will give the answer with regard to the birth of Isaac in verse 19.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:22.220
But in verse number 20, he says, and as for Ishmael, notice what God says, I have heard

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:23.220
thee.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.700
You understand that God hears us.

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:29.940
We say this often, but the reality is that there are times in our lives when maybe we

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:34.539
just kind of take these things for granted, or maybe they don't have as much of an impact

00:28:34.539 --> 00:28:37.500
in our lives, but God hears us.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.179
He says, I have heard thee, behold.

00:28:40.179 --> 00:28:44.260
Notice what the Bible says with regard to Ishmael in verse number 20.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:47.979
I have blessed him.

00:28:47.979 --> 00:28:56.419
God says of Ishmael, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply

00:28:56.419 --> 00:29:00.140
him exceedingly.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:07.100
Twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:10.340
That's what God says about Ishmael.

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:14.299
Abraham says, oh, that Ishmael might live before thee.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.539
God says with regard to the covenant, it's Isaac, not Ishmael.

00:29:18.539 --> 00:29:24.059
But I have heard thee, and as for Ishmael, I have blessed him, I will make him fruitful,

00:29:24.059 --> 00:29:29.619
I will multiply him exceedingly, twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great

00:29:29.619 --> 00:29:30.619
nation.

00:29:30.619 --> 00:29:35.059
If you turn over to Genesis chapter number 25 and look at verses 12 through 16, you will

00:29:35.059 --> 00:29:39.520
find the fulfillment of this prophecy as well.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:45.679
The Bible tells us in Genesis chapter number 25, beginning in verse number 12, now these

00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:51.799
are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar, the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid,

00:29:51.799 --> 00:29:53.479
bear unto Abraham.

00:29:53.479 --> 00:29:58.359
And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael by their names according to their generations.

00:29:58.359 --> 00:30:04.799
The firstborn of Ishmael, Nebuchadnezzar, and Kedar, and Adbil, and Mibsam, and Mishmah,

00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:11.119
and Duma, and Massah, Hedar, and Timah, Jator, Naphish, Kedemah.

00:30:11.119 --> 00:30:16.599
These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names by their towns and by their castles.

00:30:16.599 --> 00:30:17.759
What does it say?

00:30:17.759 --> 00:30:22.519
Twelve princes according to their nations.

00:30:22.519 --> 00:30:25.399
Is that not what God said in Genesis 17?

00:30:25.399 --> 00:30:31.279
He says at the end of the verse, twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great

00:30:31.279 --> 00:30:32.499
nation.

00:30:32.499 --> 00:30:39.239
We find that God answers what Abraham pleads for, and he says it's not with regard to the

00:30:39.239 --> 00:30:40.999
covenant, but I will bless him.

00:30:40.999 --> 00:30:45.039
I have blessed him is what God says in verse number 20.

00:30:45.039 --> 00:30:50.639
And once again in verse number 21, as we focus upon these promises that God gives, we find

00:30:50.679 --> 00:30:57.039
that the attention once again returns to the covenant and to the seed of Abraham and Sarah,

00:30:57.039 --> 00:30:58.039
that of Isaac.

00:30:58.039 --> 00:31:07.119
Notice verse 21, but my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee

00:31:07.119 --> 00:31:10.039
at this set time in the next year.

00:31:10.039 --> 00:31:15.039
Don't you like the end of verse number 21, a specified time?

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:18.279
How precious this must have been to Abraham.

00:31:18.279 --> 00:31:24.919
After waiting for 24 years, God up to this point, as many times as he has said to Abraham

00:31:24.919 --> 00:31:31.999
that I will multiply thee, that I will give you a seed, God never specified a time until

00:31:31.999 --> 00:31:35.399
right here in Genesis 17 in verse number 21.

00:31:35.399 --> 00:31:44.439
And God says to Abraham that she, Sarah, shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.

00:31:44.439 --> 00:31:49.879
You understand that as we study the scriptures that chapters 18 and 19 deal with Sodom and

00:31:49.879 --> 00:31:54.479
Gomorrah, and we'll study those over the next couple of weeks, and you deal with Abraham

00:31:54.479 --> 00:31:58.199
and Abimelech there in chapter 20, but it's in chapter 21 that you read about the birth

00:31:58.199 --> 00:31:59.199
of Isaac.

00:31:59.199 --> 00:32:03.959
And so as you would see the difference between chapters 16 and 17 being 13 years, at the

00:32:03.959 --> 00:32:08.319
end of chapter 17 until the chapter 21, there's a year.

00:32:08.319 --> 00:32:09.439
God says this is going to happen.

00:32:09.439 --> 00:32:16.959
And I believe that it gave Abraham just great joy of having this specified time that God

00:32:16.959 --> 00:32:21.559
was going to do this and God was going to bring to pass that which he had promised and

00:32:21.559 --> 00:32:23.399
he specifies this time.

00:32:23.399 --> 00:32:27.119
And then the Bible says in verse number 22, can you see with me what's happening?

00:32:27.119 --> 00:32:31.159
Now think about Abraham as we'd start in verse number one of chapter 17 and go down to verse

00:32:31.159 --> 00:32:32.159
22.

00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:33.159
And I want you to think about Abraham.

00:32:33.159 --> 00:32:38.199
For 13 years, as best we know, biblically speaking, there's no time in which God spoke

00:32:38.199 --> 00:32:41.999
to Abraham for these 13 years.

00:32:41.999 --> 00:32:47.159
And then suddenly on a certain day, God appears to Abraham as we find in verse number one

00:32:47.159 --> 00:32:51.079
when the Bible speaks of the age of Abraham and it says, the Lord appeared to Abram and

00:32:51.079 --> 00:32:55.419
said unto him, I am the almighty God.

00:32:55.419 --> 00:33:01.599
And then in verse number 22, it says, and he left off talking with him and God went

00:33:01.599 --> 00:33:04.359
up from Abraham.

00:33:04.359 --> 00:33:09.719
God came, he spoke, and then he departed.

00:33:09.719 --> 00:33:17.519
And we find that Abraham is there left with these great promises that God almighty had

00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:18.959
spoken to him.

00:33:18.959 --> 00:33:24.919
These I wills, these declarative statements that the Lord God almighty said, I will do

00:33:24.919 --> 00:33:28.879
this, and I will do that, and here's what I'm going to do, and here's how I'm going

00:33:28.879 --> 00:33:33.959
to do, and here's the token of the covenant, and here's the instruction.

00:33:34.559 --> 00:33:39.759
And Abraham has that moment of laughter in verse 17 and 18 when he says, shall a child

00:33:39.759 --> 00:33:45.599
be born unto him that is a hundred years old, and shall Sarah that is ninety years old bear?

00:33:45.599 --> 00:33:50.559
And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live, and God repeats the promises.

00:33:50.559 --> 00:33:57.879
We find that then God went up from Abraham, and Abraham's left there.

00:33:57.879 --> 00:34:00.479
And I would say this, it's a moment of decision.

00:34:00.479 --> 00:34:03.759
Abraham, what are you going to do?

00:34:03.759 --> 00:34:06.119
What are you going to do with what you've heard?

00:34:06.119 --> 00:34:08.039
God appeared to you.

00:34:08.039 --> 00:34:09.719
God said these things.

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:12.199
God gave you this instruction.

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:17.359
And we find, as we close this evening, if you're taking notes, number four, we looked

00:34:17.359 --> 00:34:20.759
at number one, the plan, number two, the plea, number three, the promises, number four, the

00:34:20.759 --> 00:34:21.759
obedience.

00:34:21.759 --> 00:34:23.679
I know it's not a P, but that's okay.

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:26.079
The obedience of Abraham.

00:34:26.079 --> 00:34:38.159
Notice in verse 23, it says this, and Abraham took Ishmael, his son, and all that were born

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:45.559
in his house and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's

00:34:45.559 --> 00:34:46.559
house.

00:34:46.559 --> 00:34:51.359
Now, just pause there for a moment because you'll understand that as we look at the passage

00:34:51.359 --> 00:34:56.839
of Scripture and see all that is taking place, that you'll recall with me that when Abraham

00:34:56.839 --> 00:35:01.719
dealt with the situation when his nephew Lot was taken captive in that war that was mentioned

00:35:01.719 --> 00:35:07.239
in Genesis 14 that we studied, the Bible tells us in verse number 14 of Genesis 14 that when

00:35:07.239 --> 00:35:11.599
Abraham heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his

00:35:11.599 --> 00:35:17.279
own house, 318, and pursued them unto Dan.

00:35:17.279 --> 00:35:20.319
Now, a number of years has passed.

00:35:20.319 --> 00:35:23.359
No doubt some have died, but some have been born.

00:35:23.359 --> 00:35:24.919
We don't know the exact number.

00:35:24.919 --> 00:35:29.000
We know that God said that those that are born in your house and those that are bought

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.519
with thy money, according to verses 12 and 13, when we answered the question who is to

00:35:34.519 --> 00:35:40.159
be circumcised, we find now that Abraham, according to verse number 23, that he took

00:35:40.159 --> 00:35:45.339
Ishmael, his son, all that were born in his house, all that were bought with his money,

00:35:45.339 --> 00:35:47.159
every male among the men of Abraham's house.

00:35:47.159 --> 00:35:52.319
Now, can you imagine Abraham going and gathering everybody up?

00:35:52.319 --> 00:35:56.039
And it says this at the end of the verse, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin

00:35:56.039 --> 00:36:01.000
in the self same day as God had said unto him.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.839
I want you to notice that phrase when it says in the self same day.

00:36:06.839 --> 00:36:09.759
You know what that is?

00:36:09.759 --> 00:36:12.759
That's immediate obedience.

00:36:12.759 --> 00:36:14.719
That's immediate obedience.

00:36:14.719 --> 00:36:16.599
Abraham obeyed the Lord.

00:36:16.599 --> 00:36:21.559
We find that obedience is a demonstration of our faith in God.

00:36:21.559 --> 00:36:23.319
Trust and obey.

00:36:23.319 --> 00:36:27.119
We have faith in what God has said, and we obey Him.

00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:33.159
The taking God at His word, the faith, and then the obedience that we find here that

00:36:33.159 --> 00:36:36.519
is revealed through the action of Abraham.

00:36:36.519 --> 00:36:40.799
And it says in the self same day, some have said, and I believe that it's worth repeating

00:36:40.799 --> 00:36:44.399
that delayed obedience is disobedience.

00:36:44.399 --> 00:36:49.319
Not now, but at some convenient time, at some other time, in some other place, in whatever

00:36:49.319 --> 00:36:51.039
the circumstances might be.

00:36:51.039 --> 00:36:56.000
But we find that Abraham, as he heard the message of God, and even after he had that

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.519
moment in verses 17 and 18 when he cries out before God, and God once again graciously

00:37:01.519 --> 00:37:11.839
says no Abraham, here is the plan, here are my promises, that Abraham responds in obedience.

00:37:11.839 --> 00:37:19.319
It says in verse number 24, Abraham was 90 years old and nine when he was circumcised

00:37:19.319 --> 00:37:23.439
in the flesh of his foreskin, and Ishmael his son was 13 years old when he was circumcised

00:37:23.439 --> 00:37:24.439
in the flesh of his foreskin.

00:37:24.439 --> 00:37:30.159
In the self same day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son, and all the men of his

00:37:30.159 --> 00:37:36.679
house born in the house and bought with money of the stranger were circumcised with him.

00:37:36.679 --> 00:37:41.799
This obedience of Abraham that we find in this passage of Scripture, and we'd understand

00:37:41.799 --> 00:37:48.719
that as we would look at the Scriptures and we'd understand here this token of circumcision,

00:37:48.719 --> 00:37:55.099
this token of the covenant that it revealed, remember, it came after the declaration when

00:37:55.099 --> 00:38:00.759
God said that he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness.

00:38:00.759 --> 00:38:07.000
But here was the outworking of Abraham's faith seen through the obedience, this action

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.679
that is taken in verses 23 through 27, and we'd find for us this evening the book of

00:38:12.679 --> 00:38:17.599
Hebrews in chapter number 8 deals with a better covenant.

00:38:17.599 --> 00:38:22.599
I preached a passage of Scripture there in Hebrews chapter number 8 last year, a message

00:38:22.599 --> 00:38:27.039
from that passage dealing with the subject matter of a better covenant, and it's interesting

00:38:27.039 --> 00:38:32.260
as you look throughout the Old Testament, you'd understand the way in which God would

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:37.399
talk about circumcising your heart, the circumcision of the heart.

00:38:37.399 --> 00:38:41.959
We think about this new covenant or the better covenant, we'd understand that as we would

00:38:41.959 --> 00:38:47.399
see the covenant that's being spoken of there in particular with regard to Moses and the

00:38:47.399 --> 00:38:51.859
law and what have you, not really with regard to this covenant that we're dealing with here,

00:38:51.859 --> 00:38:56.559
but we're mindful this evening of this truth that is given to us in the book of Genesis

00:38:56.579 --> 00:39:02.159
with regard to the response of Abraham and his obedience that is seen in verses 23 through

00:39:02.159 --> 00:39:03.880
27.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:07.399
And I wonder this evening, how quick are we to obey God?

00:39:07.399 --> 00:39:14.119
You say, well, if God appeared to me like He appeared to Abraham, man, I'd obey God.

00:39:14.119 --> 00:39:16.719
There's something interesting about that.

00:39:16.719 --> 00:39:23.640
There was a man that died and went to hell, and the book of Luke gives us the account,

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:32.719
and he said that he desired some water, and we're told that Lazarus could not pass to

00:39:32.719 --> 00:39:33.719
that rich man.

00:39:33.719 --> 00:39:39.479
There was a great gulf fixed between them, and the desire of the rich man that was in

00:39:39.479 --> 00:39:47.640
hell was that Lazarus would go back to his house and tell his brethren, he had five brothers.

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.779
You know what the Bible tells us?

00:39:50.779 --> 00:39:54.539
They have Moses and the prophets.

00:39:54.539 --> 00:39:55.940
You know what he's saying?

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:56.979
They have the Word of God.

00:39:56.979 --> 00:40:02.179
If they won't believe the Word of God, they're not going to believe, though one be raised

00:40:02.179 --> 00:40:03.179
from the dead.

00:40:03.179 --> 00:40:05.539
That's what the passage tells us.

00:40:05.539 --> 00:40:09.499
So for those that would say, well, if God would appear to me like He appeared to Abraham,

00:40:09.499 --> 00:40:11.139
then I'd obey.

00:40:11.139 --> 00:40:16.739
I'd say to you in the words of Scripture that God gives us there in Luke chapter number

00:40:16.739 --> 00:40:17.739
16.

00:40:17.739 --> 00:40:19.739
If you want to go back and look at it, I just paraphrased through the passage.

00:40:19.739 --> 00:40:26.739
If you're going to go back and read it, you'll see exactly that that's what happens.

00:40:26.739 --> 00:40:32.179
And you'll not believe if you won't believe this book.

00:40:32.179 --> 00:40:38.099
Because when we take this book as being the Word of God, as it is, remember the believers

00:40:38.099 --> 00:40:43.179
in Thessalonica, they received it, what, the Word of God as it was in truth, being the

00:40:43.179 --> 00:40:44.579
Word of God.

00:40:44.579 --> 00:40:50.459
And when God speaks to us through His Word, how quick are we to obey?

00:40:50.459 --> 00:40:55.659
How quick are we to do that which God has instructed us to do?

00:40:55.659 --> 00:40:58.939
We understand, we say often from the book of James, that we're to be doers of the Word

00:40:58.939 --> 00:41:01.979
and not hearers only.

00:41:01.979 --> 00:41:07.619
Abraham's obedience at the end of Genesis chapter number 17 is on full display.

00:41:07.619 --> 00:41:11.779
And you see that there, according to what we have in the pages of Scripture, there's

00:41:11.779 --> 00:41:13.859
no discussion, no debating.

00:41:13.859 --> 00:41:16.059
There's no, do we really have to do this?

00:41:16.059 --> 00:41:18.099
Is this necessary?

00:41:18.099 --> 00:41:20.219
This is going to be uncomfortable.

00:41:20.219 --> 00:41:22.899
People aren't going to like it.

00:41:22.899 --> 00:41:27.259
There's none of that that's recorded for us in the pages of Scripture.

00:41:27.259 --> 00:41:34.299
But we find that Abraham obeyed and he did that which God had commanded him to do.

00:41:34.299 --> 00:41:40.899
See God appeared to Abraham at the beginning of Genesis 17, I am the Lord God Almighty.

00:41:40.899 --> 00:41:47.019
When we understand who He is, it helps us to understand what He's able to do, but it

00:41:47.019 --> 00:41:52.139
also helps us to respond properly to what He commands, because we understand who He

00:41:52.139 --> 00:41:53.139
is.

00:41:53.139 --> 00:41:59.419
And I think sometimes, broadly speaking in Christendom, if I could use that term this

00:41:59.419 --> 00:42:04.619
evening, that there's a small view of who God is.

00:42:04.619 --> 00:42:15.859
There's a missing element amongst the believers today as to who God really is, and how holy,

00:42:15.899 --> 00:42:19.019
and how mighty He is.

00:42:19.019 --> 00:42:24.779
When God appears to Abraham in the way that He does in Genesis 17, 1, it helps Abraham

00:42:24.779 --> 00:42:29.779
to understand that He's able to do that which He says He's going to do, because He first

00:42:29.779 --> 00:42:33.459
reveals who He is, and then what He's going to do.

00:42:33.459 --> 00:42:37.939
And when we understand who He is and what He's capable of doing, it also impacts how

00:42:37.939 --> 00:42:44.259
I respond to Him, because He's God, He's the Almighty God.

00:42:44.259 --> 00:42:50.459
We understand the New Testament truth with regard to, we're bought with a price, so we

00:42:50.459 --> 00:42:54.419
truly grasp that truth of the Scriptures.

00:42:54.419 --> 00:42:58.419
It causes us to have a completely different perspective in life.

00:42:58.419 --> 00:43:05.259
No longer will we roam this earth saying, it's my life, I get to do what I want to do.

00:43:05.259 --> 00:43:09.579
No, no, I'm bought with a price.

00:43:09.579 --> 00:43:15.459
Abraham's obedience is on full display, and I believe it's directly correlated to him

00:43:15.459 --> 00:43:18.659
understanding who God is and what God said.

00:43:18.659 --> 00:43:24.019
And this evening, oh, that God would help us to get a glimpse of who He really is.

00:43:24.019 --> 00:43:28.659
He's revealed it to us in the pages of Scripture, but sometimes we don't really know who He

00:43:28.659 --> 00:43:34.179
is because we don't spend enough time in this book, and we're missing what God wants us

00:43:34.179 --> 00:43:35.179
to know.

00:43:35.979 --> 00:43:41.819
And the Lord God Almighty, He says, thy name shall be called Abraham.

00:43:41.819 --> 00:43:46.139
And He reaffirms this great covenant that we speak so often, biblically, throughout

00:43:46.139 --> 00:43:49.539
the pages of Scripture, you see so many references to these truths.

00:43:49.539 --> 00:43:55.259
The seed, the land, repeated often, and in just a few weeks, we'll be able to see the

00:43:55.259 --> 00:43:59.139
fulfillment of this promise with the birth of Isaac.

00:43:59.139 --> 00:44:00.139
Let's pray.

00:44:00.139 --> 00:44:01.359
Father, we love You.

00:44:01.359 --> 00:44:03.059
Thank You for loving us.

00:44:03.059 --> 00:44:08.259
Thank You for revealing who You are in Your Word.

00:44:08.259 --> 00:44:21.699
I pray that You would help us to believe You, the promises that we can claim in the Scriptures

00:44:21.699 --> 00:44:28.339
with regard to Your provision and Your protection in our lives.

00:44:28.339 --> 00:44:32.339
Thank You that You are our shepherd.

00:44:32.339 --> 00:44:47.139
You're a good shepherd, that as our shepherd, You care, You provide, You lead, You protect.

00:44:47.139 --> 00:44:55.299
Help us to be mindful, as Abraham was in this passage, of who You really are and what You're

00:44:55.299 --> 00:44:57.659
capable of doing.

00:44:57.659 --> 00:45:07.659
Help us, Lord, as we open the pages of Scripture and are confronted with direction that You

00:45:07.659 --> 00:45:11.019
would provide, commandments that You would give.

00:45:11.019 --> 00:45:14.579
Would You help us to live a life of obedience?

00:45:14.579 --> 00:45:24.979
Would You help us to truly say, I surrender all and my life is Yours to control.

00:45:24.979 --> 00:45:26.899
I'll do what You want me to do.

00:45:26.899 --> 00:45:28.179
I'll go where You want me to go.

00:45:28.179 --> 00:45:33.219
I'll say what You want me to say.

00:45:33.219 --> 00:45:34.419
Thank You for Your Word.

00:45:34.419 --> 00:45:37.059
Thank You for the example of Abraham.

00:45:37.059 --> 00:45:40.019
I pray, God, that You'd have Your will in the lives of Your people, and we'll thank

00:45:40.019 --> 00:45:41.019
You for what You'll do.

00:45:41.019 --> 00:45:42.259
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:45:42.259 --> 00:45:42.899
Would You stand with me?
