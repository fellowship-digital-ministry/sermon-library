1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,759
number thirty-five this evening, Genesis chapter number thirty-five,

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:08,199
and we'll be looking at verses one through fifteen this evening, Genesis chapter thirty-five

3
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:11,939
verses one through fifteen. It's hard to believe we've been in the study of the

4
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:16,000
book of Genesis here on Sunday evenings for quite some time. This is the seventy-fifth

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,239
message

6
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:20,959
that I have preached from the book of Genesis and we're in chapter thirty-five

7
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:22,479
and uh... there's only

8
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:25,600
uh... fifty chapters so maybe we'll, I think we'll make it to a hundred

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,840
messages on the book of Genesis

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,159
and uh... my uh... my uh... notebook that I have on my iPad for this sermon

11
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,119
series

12
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,119
I handwrite my notes and then use the iPad for them. I'm on page

13
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:41,400
number two hundred and twenty-six

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,639
uh... of notes and so uh... if you keep notes just on Sunday night you'll fill up

15
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:49,400
a sermon notebook that we pass out for just the book of Genesis

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,360
uh... but we're thankful for this wonderful book, a book of foundations

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,759
a book that is so important, a book that's constantly, especially the first

18
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:59,759
eleven chapters, constantly under attack

19
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,760
and I'm thankful for the record that God has given us. As Jacob, you'll remember

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,519
from back in Genesis chapter number twenty-eight, Jacob fled from his homeland

21
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,680
of course there were a number of circumstances surrounding his departure

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,360
from his homeland. Esau said he was going to kill him because of the

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,959
uh... the blessing and so on and so forth but we find that as he left his homeland

24
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:24,599
that he had an encounter with God

25
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:26,400
at Bethel.

26
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,639
We find that God

27
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:31,440
records for us as he would leave his homeland, as he would journey

28
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,519
to head to Paddan Aram, that he has that encounter with God

29
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,400
and uh... if you look at Genesis chapter twenty-eight, we're not going to look there this

30
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,800
evening specifically

31
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,120
but you might want to note it down to reference back to verses ten through

32
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,239
twenty-two

33
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,120
and you'll see that encounter

34
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,000
that that Jacob had with God at Bethel.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,760
We find that Jacob spent several years in Paddan Aram, of course we know

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,080
that there are all sorts of events that take place there and uh... initially his

37
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,319
mother said go back to that place for just a few days until your brother's

38
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,199
anger

39
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:07,639
is subsided and then returned and it was years later

40
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:11,720
when he finally receives word from God as it's recorded in Genesis chapter

41
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,880
thirty-one

42
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,800
that he is to return to the land

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,279
of his fathers.

44
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:21,240
We find that Jacob was obedient to that instruction that God gave in Genesis

45
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,720
chapter thirty-one

46
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,520
and as he obeys the Lord we find and we've studied over the last several

47
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,399
weeks

48
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:32,559
uh... that eventually he would have that reunion and a wonderful reunion it

49
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:33,479
was

50
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,440
with his brother Esau.

51
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,839
There was a great concern leading up to the reunion and of course the

52
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:43,839
uh... circumstances surrounding the original departure were still fresh in

53
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:44,919
the mind and

54
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:48,639
Jacob was concerned that Esau would kill him and the family and so on and so

55
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,679
forth and

56
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:51,440
of course when he found out that

57
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,199
uh... he sent those messengers ahead and they said well Esau's coming towards you

58
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,080
he's got four hundred men with them

59
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,559
and uh... that just increased his anxiety level

60
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:04,000
and uh... but what a wonderful reunion that God

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,440
uh... gives us the account of

62
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,559
and we find that

63
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:11,600
uh... as Jacob returned and has that reunion

64
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,960
uh... prior to before he actually meets with Esau we find that he's at a place

65
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,520
called Mahanaim

66
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:20,479
and he's there at that place and then after the reunion

67
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,919
he goes to a place called Succoth and eventually to Shalem

68
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,960
which is the city of Shechem. Of course last week we studied Genesis chapter

69
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,039
thirty-four

70
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,800
and we dealt with the unfortunate events that are recorded for us there in Genesis

71
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,919
thirty-four

72
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,000
and we find after those unfortunate events

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,940
the Bible picks up in Genesis thirty-five

74
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:46,399
and God speaks to Jacob and notice what God says in verse number one

75
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:48,080
of Genesis thirty-five

76
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,880
and God said unto Jacob

77
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,279
Arise

78
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:55,000
go up to Bethel

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,600
and dwell there

80
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,960
and make there an altar unto God that appeared unto thee when thou

81
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,919
fleddest from the face of Esau

82
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,279
thy brother

83
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:08,600
I've titled the message this evening Returning

84
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,880
to Bethel

85
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,240
I want you to think about all of the things that had taken place in the life

86
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,320
of Jacob and we've studied

87
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,239
those events from chapter twenty-eight now to chapter thirty-five

88
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:23,920
and so many events, so many circumstances have taken place in the life of Jacob

89
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,000
but now God appears to Jacob and God speaks to Jacob

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,600
and says arise and go up to Bethel

91
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,359
and dwell there. If you're taking notes this evening I want you to notice with

92
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,760
me first of all the preparation

93
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,880
for the journey

94
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,519
the preparation for the journey. If you're gonna take a trip you prepare for

95
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:46,079
a trip. Typically we got some folks that are traveling this week. We have some

96
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:51,480
folks that due to the nature of their travels they made certain preparations

97
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,799
in preparing to depart for all that would take place

98
00:04:56,799 --> 00:05:00,440
and we find here that in the text of scripture that God gives us

99
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,760
a record of the preparation

100
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,399
for the journey. Notice in verse number two after

101
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:08,559
Jacob receives word from God he hears

102
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,600
very distinctly what God says. There's no

103
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,600
difficulty on interpreting verse number one of Genesis thirty-five

104
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,760
arise

105
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,720
go up to Bethel

106
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,000
and dwell there

107
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,279
and pretty straightforward instruction that God gives

108
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,359
and we find that he tells him to make there an altar unto God

109
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:31,640
and he says that appeared unto thee when thou fled us from the face of Esau thy

110
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,519
brother

111
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:37,040
then notice what Jacob does as we note the preparation in verses two

112
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,119
three and four

113
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:40,600
the Bible says in verse number two

114
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,100
then Jacob said unto his household

115
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,000
and to all that were with him

116
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,559
put away the strange gods that are among you

117
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:52,079
and be clean and change your garments. As we think about the preparation for the

118
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:52,799
journey

119
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:57,160
I would note first of all what Jacob requested. We see this in verse number two

120
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,720
the request is made

121
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,679
it's very interesting that Jacob says to his household notice first of all what

122
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:03,559
he says

123
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:04,799
put away

124
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,720
the strange gods

125
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,200
that are among you

126
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,959
I want you to think about if you would

127
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:12,600
take and turn back to chapter number thirty-one

128
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,200
and you remember that as they would depart from Paddan Aram after

129
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,279
Jacob received that word from the Lord that he was to return to his

130
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,079
kindred and to his

131
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,040
the land of his fathers we understand that that departure was met with some

132
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,720
adverse circumstances

133
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,959
but the Bible told us in that portion of scripture

134
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,320
that Rachel stole

135
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,760
the idols

136
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,480
the Bible tells us in verse number nineteen and Laban went to shear his sheep

137
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,519
and Rachel had stolen the images

138
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,760
that were her father's

139
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,119
as you look down in verse number thirty-one

140
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:49,279
the Bible says that Jacob answered and said to Laban because I was afraid for I

141
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,880
said peradventure thou wouldest take by force

142
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,320
thy daughters from me verse thirty-two with whomsoever

143
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,480
thou findest thy gods

144
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,920
let him not live

145
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,239
it seems pretty obvious from that statement

146
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:06,640
that Jacob had no knowledge that Rachel had stolen the idols

147
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,519
he loved Rachel no doubt in my mind that if he would have known

148
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:14,679
that Rachel had those idols he would not have said this to Laban

149
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:18,679
but we find that he says to Laban with whomsoever thou findest thy gods let him

150
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:21,160
not live before our brethren discern thou

151
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,959
what is thine with me and take it to thee

152
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:26,799
for Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them

153
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:31,320
and Laban went to Jacob's tent, to Leah's tent, and to the two maidservants' tents

154
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,880
notice it says but he found them not

155
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:40,880
then went he out of Leah's tent notice it says and entered into Rachel's tent

156
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:46,600
she knew what was in her tent

157
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,040
she was well aware

158
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,380
she devises a story, a plan

159
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,559
in order to keep hidden from Laban what she had stolen

160
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:56,679
by the way you might be able to hide something from someone else but you

161
00:07:56,679 --> 00:08:00,440
can't hide anything from God

162
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,519
God's telling us about what took place

163
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,279
in his record the Bible

164
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:09,720
it says now Rachel had taken the images and put them in the camel's furniture

165
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,079
and sat upon them

166
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:14,679
and Laban searched all the tent but found them not she said to her father

167
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:16,640
let it not displease my Lord

168
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,239
that I cannot rise up before thee for the custom of women is upon me

169
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:22,760
and he searched but found not

170
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,480
the images

171
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,559
they were there he just didn't find them

172
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:30,000
now we come to chapter thirty five

173
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,920
we read about these

174
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,679
strange gods that are among you

175
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,719
it seems pretty obvious to me that

176
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,440
the idols that were taken

177
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,880
are now at some point after Laban had searched and after the

178
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,119
the journey that had taken place and I've kind of outlined by way of introduction

179
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:50,039
the places in which Jacob and his family have been

180
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,520
up to this point in Genesis thirty five

181
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,760
after departing from Paddan Aram and

182
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,559
at some point perhaps those idols made their way out into the family and

183
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:05,200
perhaps also with the people of the land that there was some interaction

184
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,280
with that they picked up some idols some false gods

185
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,239
this is tragic

186
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:18,059
but first order of business in preparing for this journey

187
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:22,200
to go to Bethel was Jacob saying put away the strange gods

188
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,419
that are among you

189
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:26,359
if I could criticize Jacob for just a moment

190
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:30,119
I would say that he should have told them to put the strange gods away

191
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:36,200
before God ever gave him instruction to go to Bethel

192
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,320
it's unfortunate that as he would

193
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,320
take the strange gods that were provided

194
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,239
that he did not destroy them

195
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:47,039
we'll note that in just a moment

196
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,640
but I find that it's commendable as much as I would criticize him for not doing

197
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,599
it prior it's commendable that in preparation for going to Bethel

198
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,559
he recognizes there's some things that need to happen

199
00:09:59,559 --> 00:09:59,960
the first

200
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,560
order of business is we need to get rid of these strange gods. We need to get rid of

201
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,880
these idols. And we understand that today and we think about the images that were there

202
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,200
that were stolen by Rachel, as it's said in Genesis chapter 31, and we can think of

203
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:21,280
lots of different examples of idols. But we find that the sin of idolatry is so common

204
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,800
within the Old Testament and we often see this snare, if you will, with the children

205
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,240
of Israel. But, you know, the Bible tells in the New Testament, it says this, keep yourselves

206
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:39,120
from idols. As John is writing in the epistle of John, he says, keep thyself from idols

207
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,400
in 1 John 5. And the reality is that we understand this evening that in the book of Colossians

208
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:52,440
God tells us this, that in all things the Lord Jesus Christ is to have the preeminence.

209
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,360
An idol doesn't have to be some little image that someone burns incense to or bows down

210
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,120
to. That's what our mind thinks of. That's what comes into our mind's eye when we think

211
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:11,640
about an image or an idol. But the reality is an idol is anything that takes God's place.

212
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:22,640
An idol can be a workplace. How many have made money in idol? Position? Power? Sports?

213
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,040
Oh, there's many idols today. We don't like so much talking about idols. We like to think

214
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,160
about maybe some Eastern religions and the way that they have idols and criticizing, but

215
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,960
the reality is that even here in the United States there are plenty that have idols. And

216
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,080
Jacob says before we go to Bethel, the first thing we need to do in preparation is we need

217
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,360
to put away the strange gods that are among you. I want you to notice that he also made

218
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:59,960
this request in verse number 2. The Bible says this, and be clean and change your garments.

219
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:06,760
Isn't that interesting? You understand that here as we're looking in the book of Genesis,

220
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,880
this is before the law, this is before all of the instruction that we read in the book

221
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,560
of Leviticus and all of those things with regard to approaching God and worshipping

222
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:24,680
God and all of the particulars with regard to how you would approach God and the sacrifices

223
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,040
and all of those things. And we find that Jacob says not only do we need to put away

224
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,640
the strange gods that are among you, but he says be clean and change your garments. Why

225
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:42,320
is it that he would make reference to being clean and changing their garments? Well here's

226
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,600
why. You know what Bethel is? It's the house of God. That's what it means. That's what

227
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,080
the word Bethel means. And basically what Jacob is saying as we look at verse number

228
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:00,800
2 is we're going to the house of God and we need to get rid of some idols and you need

229
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:08,200
to get clean and you need to change your garments. So often today people would criticize

230
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,840
and say that you're pharisaical and legalistic and so on and so forth if you have any measure

231
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,800
of standards. And the reality is that you can come just as you are. No one would ever

232
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,040
turn your way. Isn't that an amazing thing that we would understand that we're coming

233
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:29,360
into the presence of God? We're going to worship God. And as I'm coming to a holy place where

234
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,840
I preached this morning on Moses there in the book of Exodus in the third chapter, that

235
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,240
ground was not holy ground because Moses was there. It was not holy ground because it was

236
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,840
a bush that was burning. It was holy ground because God's presence was there. We come

237
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:49,760
to worship God. Jacob says you need to get rid of those idols and you need to get cleaned

238
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,200
up and you need to change your garments. That's powerful because we're going to the house

239
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:03,280
of God. See, notice as we look here at this request we then see that he makes, he reveals

240
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,240
some truth to his family. I'm not sure how much of this he had revealed to them prior

241
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,600
to this particular record but we find that as he tells them what to do in this preparation,

242
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,520
he makes this request, that then he reveals some truth in verse number three. The Bible

243
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,880
says, and let us arise and go up to Bethel and I will make there an altar unto God. What's

244
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,920
the purpose of making the altar? It's to worship God. That's why we're going there. Why do

245
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:35,920
we go to church? I understand that this isn't the church here in Genesis chapter 35 but

246
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,720
I understand this evening that we assemble together. The church is a called out assembly.

247
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:48,280
It's a body of believers and we come for the purpose of worship. Church isn't a club. Amen?

248
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,840
It's not a club. I understand. I'm thankful that we're a family and I'm thankful that

249
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:57,920
we can have fellowship one with another but the reality is that church is to worship God,

250
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,880
to have an encounter with God Almighty. When I come to church, I want to come to church

251
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,280
to hear from God. I want to come to church so that God would step on my toes and change

252
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,240
me and help me to be conformed to the image of his dear son. I want to come to worship

253
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:20,240
him, to bless his holy name because he's wonderful and he's worthy of our praise. That's why

254
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:27,000
we come to church, to worship. You come to church and say, man, I got to see so and so.

255
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,240
I got to have fellowship with so and so. We did this. We did that. But if you didn't worship,

256
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:37,800
you missed the whole purpose. You missed the whole purpose. And we find here that he reveals

257
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,040
that here's where we're going but notice what he says. He says, and I will make there an

258
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:48,040
altar unto God. Notice what he says, who answered me in the day of my distress. Jacob did not

259
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,240
forget that God heard him and that God answered him. And he says that God answered me in the

260
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:01,000
day of my distress. And I'm looking at this portion and I'm thinking about how Jacob is

261
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,800
revealing this truth to his family. Again, I'm not sure had he revealed this earlier

262
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,320
and how much he had revealed to his family. But he says now as they're preparing to go

263
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:17,100
to Bethel, he says, listen, I'm going to make a request. You need to prepare for getting

264
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:22,380
to the house of God, for worshiping God. But I want you to know that this God that we're

265
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,660
going to worship, my God that we're going to worship, you see he's not like those idols.

266
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,500
What the Bible says about idols, you can read in the Psalms, you can read in other portions

267
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:36,340
of Scripture, that they're made by man's hands. They have ears but they hear not. That's what

268
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:43,100
the Bible says. You think about the situation with Elijah there on Mount Carmel. He says,

269
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:48,940
you can call out to your gods, the God that answers my fire, let him be the true God.

270
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:54,000
Those worshipers of Baal, they cried out and they cried out and they cut themselves and

271
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,000
they did all sorts of things but Baal never answered. Why? Because Baal is a false god.

272
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:08,260
And here we have Jacob that says, he answered me in the day of my distress. Not only that,

273
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:14,940
he says, and was with me in the way which I went. God's presence is made known at the

274
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:19,860
end of verse number 3. Jacob says, not only did he answer me, but he was with me. Aren't

275
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:26,140
you thankful for God's presence? What a joy to think about how Jacob is revealing this

276
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,140
truth. See, the reality is that as we look at Genesis chapter 35, see Jacob has already

277
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:37,920
been to Bethel before. And now he's returning to Bethel. He knew what it was to be in Bethel.

278
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,760
He knew what happened in that place. If you look at Genesis 28, we don't have the time

279
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:48,320
this evening but in verses 10-22 and you see the time when he's in Bethel and you look

280
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,240
at what's taking place there and I'll just read, I'll reference one verse of scripture.

281
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,640
The Bible says this, that Jacob awaked out of that dream that he had and he said this

282
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:04,640
in verse number 16, surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not. Listen, what

283
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:11,760
happened in Bethel, Jacob was never going to forget. And now he's going back to Bethel.

284
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,520
And as he's returning back to Bethel, he's telling his family, hey listen, we need to

285
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,440
prepare for worship. We need to get rid of these idols. We need to get cleaned up. We

286
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,320
need to change our garments because we're going to worship and the God that we're going

287
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,440
to worship, he answered me. He heard me when I prayed and he answered me and he was with

288
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:37,440
me. Wow, precious. We find the response in verse number 4. By the way, I'm thankful they

289
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,520
responded the way that they did. It says in verse number 4, and they gave unto Jacob all

290
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,920
the strange gods which were in their hand and all their earrings which were in their

291
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:57,840
ears and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. He should have destroyed them.

292
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:05,480
You know what they did in Ephesus? They took all those books and they burned them. You

293
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,559
know, some of the kings of Israel, they took, as you would have a bad, excuse me, the kings

294
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,080
of Judah, not of Israel because there's no good kings in Israel after the divided kingdom.

295
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,520
But after the divided kingdom, you had some good kings in Judah. You'd have a good king

296
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,080
that would rise up and he'd clean out the house of the Lord from all the idols and sometimes

297
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,480
they'd just kind of put them to the side. And then there'd rise another wicked king

298
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,440
and they'd take all those idols and put them back into the house of God. But there's times

299
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:39,440
in which they burned them and they caused them to be made into dust and got rid of them.

300
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Listen, it doesn't do any good to keep an idol around. Destroy it, get rid of it, burn

301
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:56,800
it. But we find that they respond to the request that Jacob makes in verse 2. They respond

302
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,040
in obedience.

303
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,040
in verse number four.

304
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,280
So now they're ready for the journey.

305
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,320
They're ready to depart.

306
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,400
And we find that it begins verse number five

307
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,920
and says, and they journeyed.

308
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,640
The preparation phase was complete.

309
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,480
You take a trip, you make all the preparation,

310
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,480
and then at some point you depart.

311
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,360
There's a departure time.

312
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,680
We find that the preparation for the journey is completed.

313
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,880
If you're taking notes, number two,

314
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,480
I want you to see the protection for the journey,

315
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,040
the protection for the journey.

316
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,960
Notice in just in verse number five,

317
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,200
we see this, the Bible says this, and they journeyed.

318
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,400
And notice what it says, and the terror of God

319
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,720
was upon the cities that were round about them,

320
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,720
and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.

321
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,160
Just a single verse of scripture,

322
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:56,160
but it reveals to us the protection of Almighty God.

323
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,520
I'm so thankful.

324
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,840
As you think about Jacob,

325
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,680
he's a man that's often concerned about things.

326
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,600
He's a fearful man.

327
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,680
He's constantly operating and functioning

328
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,920
and making decisions based upon fear.

329
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,520
In fact, in Genesis chapter 34 and verse number 30,

330
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,320
remember after the unfortunate circumstances there

331
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,800
of what happened in Shechem,

332
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,760
the Bible says this in verse 30 of Genesis 34.

333
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,880
And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi,

334
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,200
you have troubled me to make me to stink

335
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,440
among the inhabitants of the land,

336
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,560
among the Canaanites and the Perizzites,

337
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,520
and I being few in number.

338
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,400
Now, keep that in mind.

339
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,920
It says, and I being few in number,

340
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,280
they shall gather themselves together against me

341
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:39,280
and slay me, and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.

342
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,480
The children of Israel at this particular time,

343
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,720
it's not the million that leave,

344
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,600
the large quantity that leave the exodus,

345
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,240
just a small group of people.

346
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,720
Jacob says that we're few in number,

347
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,800
but we find here that the Bible says

348
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,800
that the terror of God was upon the cities

349
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,760
that were round about them.

350
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,760
This is God's divine protection.

351
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,760
Jacob, because of what he recognized

352
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,760
about the power of the people groups there

353
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,600
in the land that he was dwelling in and all that took,

354
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,840
he felt like he was vulnerable.

355
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,440
He felt like there was a lack of defense

356
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,920
that they had themselves,

357
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,920
but the reality is that God can provide divine protection.

358
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,080
We often speak about,

359
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,880
and I mentioned even on Wednesday evening,

360
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,800
that the Bible says that the horse is prepared

361
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,960
for the day of battle, but safety is of the Lord.

362
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,440
Listen, I believe in taking the preventative measures

363
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,120
necessary to provide for safety and what have you,

364
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,800
and I believe in making good decisions,

365
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,360
but ultimately, safety is of the Lord.

366
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,960
We find here that the Bible says

367
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,120
that the terror of God was upon the cities

368
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,960
that were round about them.

369
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,880
Isn't that amazing how God worked?

370
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,760
So much so that the Bible says they did not pursue

371
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,080
after the sons of Jacob.

372
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,440
Though they were departing

373
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,960
and though they were few in number

374
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,240
and though maybe from a human perspective

375
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,080
they were vulnerable to attack,

376
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,760
we find that God moved and God worked.

377
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,240
God is able.

378
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,240
God is able.

379
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,720
And I rejoice in this single verse of Scripture

380
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,240
in Genesis 35 because it helps us to understand

381
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,920
and to rest in the fact that our God is able to protect us.

382
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,720
Sometimes we can go through such great measures,

383
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,520
trying so many things, but fail even to just pray

384
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,320
and ask God.

385
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,360
Think about the truth of praying a hedge

386
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,960
of protection upon someone.

387
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,440
We have not had the opportunity recently

388
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,120
in recent time to sing the song,

389
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,440
but I think Holly and the girls sang the song many times,

390
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,640
a wall of prayer, a wall of prayer.

391
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,680
You think about how God can provide

392
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,800
that protection that we need.

393
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,120
Listen, you need protection.

394
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,840
I need protection.

395
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,600
The people in the land there,

396
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,160
there was a very possible scenario

397
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,960
that they would be attacked given all of the circumstances,

398
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,680
but God protected.

399
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,440
Listen, we live in a crazy world.

400
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,880
We really do.

401
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,160
Craziness.

402
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,080
People that are taking advantage of the elderly.

403
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,360
Videos all of the time that you see on the news nowadays

404
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,040
of some elderly individual leaving a place of business

405
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,480
and being knocked in the head from behind and so on.

406
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,360
It's nonsense.

407
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,680
There was a time in America

408
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,000
where young people respected the elderly.

409
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,880
They'd never think, it never crossed their mind

410
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,440
to do something like that.

411
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,480
We live in a world that's lost its mind,

412
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,920
but God is able to protect us.

413
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,840
We need to pray for God's protection daily.

414
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,960
We see how God works.

415
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,920
I've read of missionary stories,

416
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,120
accounts that missionaries have given from the field

417
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:26,400
of people that set out to destroy the missionariness family

418
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,360
to come and burn down their house and kill them.

419
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,400
When they arrive, they said we could do nothing

420
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,040
because there were armed men all around your property.

421
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,480
Missionaries say, what are you talking about, armed men?

422
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,400
I believe they're angels.

423
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,400
Sometimes you have the opportunity to hear

424
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,720
the other end of the account where there was someone

425
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,640
that God awakened in the middle of the night

426
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,720
to pray for a specific missionary.

427
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,440
Listen, if God ever prompts you to pray for a missionary,

428
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,200
man, you ought to pray for that missionary.

429
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,080
So I don't know what I'm praying for.

430
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,760
God knows why.

431
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,520
He's praying God put a hedge of protection about them.

432
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,200
God take care of them, meet their needs,

433
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,200
whatever the situation is.

434
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,560
God is able, God is able.

435
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,240
We see the preparation for the journey.

436
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,000
We see the protection for the journey,

437
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,640
but I want you to see finally this evening

438
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,200
the purpose for the journey, the purpose for the journey.

439
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,280
When God calls and gives direction,

440
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,960
you can rest assured that he has a purpose in it.

441
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,920
The purpose is revealed to us in the text of scripture.

442
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,720
It wasn't just that God thought,

443
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,120
well, Jacob, you've been there long enough,

444
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,360
it's time to move to another place,

445
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,400
and so let me get, no, there's a purpose.

446
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,320
We find that our God always moves with purpose.

447
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,280
He always gives his children direction

448
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,160
on purpose and with purpose.

449
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,360
As we had the opportunity last year,

450
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,040
Holly and I for a couple of weeks to be there in Israel,

451
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,920
it was amazing to me to stand in the places

452
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,600
where we stood and to have the opportunities

453
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,600
and to rehearse in my mind the biblical accounts

454
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,840
that I knew that took place in these particular areas

455
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,440
that we stood and to have it all come together

456
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,240
and say, that's why Jesus did that here.

457
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,920
I get the purpose now.

458
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,920
I could see it, I could understand it.

459
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,360
And this evening, as we look at this portion of scripture,

460
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,880
we find that God reveals to us the purpose.

461
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,080
We notice already in verse number one

462
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,360
that he says, go to Bethel and dwell there,

463
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,520
and he says, and make there an altar unto God.

464
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,400
So notice with me in verse number six,

465
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,600
the Bible says, so Jacob came to Luz,

466
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,000
which is in the land of Canaan, that is Bethel.

467
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,520
He and all the people that were with him,

468
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,640
and he built there an altar.

469
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,680
He obeyed what God told him to do.

470
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:53,120
God said, go to Bethel, dwell there, and build an altar.

471
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,480
And the Bible tells us in verse six that they arrived,

472
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,720
they had safe traveling mercies,

473
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,000
they had protection along the way,

474
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,840
and they get to the place, they reach their destination,

475
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,000
and as they reach their destination,

476
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,280
we find that he builds there an altar.

477
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,120
It's exactly what God told him to do.

478
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,520
The Bible says that he called it, notice,

479
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,680
he called the place El, Bethel,

480
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,320
because there God appeared unto him

481
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,280
when he fled from the face of his brother.

482
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,560
Now, I'm not sure if you've ever visited a place

483
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:35,240
that something significant took place in your life

484
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,040
at that location.

485
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,320
I mean, it's a location where there was something

486
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,280
that was just life-altering type of an event

487
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,640
that took place.

488
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,800
That's what happened at Bethel the first time.

489
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:52,280
And now Jacob is back in that place.

490
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,480
Can you imagine with me the memories

491
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,560
that would flood his mind of that time

492
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,960
that he was there in Bethel?

493
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,920
It had been a couple of decades since he's been there,

494
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,000
and we think about that time that has transpired

495
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,600
between the first time it was at Bethel

496
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,700
and now the second time,

497
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,840
perhaps there's some changes in the landscape,

498
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,440
perhaps there's some things that have shifted

499
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,800
and some things that are different,

500
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,640
but I think about Jacob being in that place,

501
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,840
and I think about maybe him thinking about

502
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,440
where he pillowed his head when he had that dream

503
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,040
and where he poured out that offering

504
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,160
and all that took place,

505
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,720
and we find that he's now back in Bethel,

506
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,560
and he put that altar, and he called it El Bethel,

507
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,600
and it says, because there God appeared unto him

508
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,920
when he fled from the face of his brother.

509
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,880
God gives us in verse number eight

510
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,160
the record of the death of Deborah, Rebekah's nurse.

511
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,920
It says that Deborah, Rebekah's nurse,

512
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,160
died and was buried beneath Bethel under an oak.

513
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,160
The name of it is called Alan Bakuth.

514
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,660
But notice as the dialogue continues back

515
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,580
to the situation of Jacob and the family there in Bethel,

516
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,980
it says in verse number nine.

517
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:06,540
And God appeared unto Jacob again when he came out of Paddan Aram and blessed him.

518
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:12,060
So we know, as we begin to put all of this together this evening, we know that God appeared

519
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:17,440
to Jacob at Bethel before he went to Paddan Aram.

520
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,580
We read that.

521
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:25,380
We referenced it already in Genesis chapter 28, and we know that Jacob had that encounter

522
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:31,700
with God, but now the Bible specifically says that God appeared unto Jacob again when he

523
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,500
came out of Paddan Aram and blessed him.

524
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:41,100
And so we find that God is appearing to him, so we look at the purpose of the journey.

525
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,220
He built that altar.

526
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,220
What's the purpose?

527
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,220
Worship.

528
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,220
Worship.

529
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,780
Singularly stated, the purpose is worship.

530
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:55,260
We find that as he is there and he's built this altar and there's worship that is taking

531
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:00,900
place and God then appears, and notice it says at the end of verse number 9, and blessed

532
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,900
him.

533
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:06,580
Think about the blessings of God.

534
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:12,420
In verse number 10 it says, and God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob.

535
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:17,900
Thy name shall not be called anymore Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name.

536
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,420
And he called his name Israel.

537
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:24,340
That's a reference back to Genesis chapter 32, the night that he wrestled with the angel

538
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:30,180
of the Lord, and we read and studied that weeks ago, and we find that there's a confirmation

539
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,780
here with regard to not only the name change, but as we continue to move forward to the

540
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,380
Abrahamic covenant.

541
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:40,380
Notice in verse number 11, and God said unto him, I am God Almighty.

542
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,860
Be fruitful and multiply.

543
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:46,420
A nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins

544
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,860
in the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac.

545
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:57,200
To thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.

546
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:04,120
Think about the confirmation that God gives to Jacob, the blessing that is received.

547
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,980
You note with me this confirmation of the Abrahamic covenant, and he says to him here

548
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:14,420
in this portion of scripture, he says in verse 11, I am God Almighty.

549
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:24,060
You know, that name for God is El Shaddai, and the first time God ever used that name

550
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:28,500
in the book of Genesis is when he's speaking to Abraham in Genesis chapter 17 in verse

551
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,060
number 1.

552
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:35,540
And as God appears to Abraham in that particular text of scripture, he says, I am the Almighty

553
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,540
God.

554
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:43,980
And after God revealed himself to Abram as being the Almighty God, he would then shortly

555
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:50,020
thereafter ask Abraham, this question, is anything too hard for the Lord?

556
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:53,500
No, nothing's too hard for God.

557
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:59,460
And it's interesting to me that as we look at this confirmation of the Abrahamic covenant,

558
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:05,460
that the seed is in view in verse number 11, the land is in view in verse number 12, and

559
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:10,100
we find that the Bible tells us that God went up from him in the place where he talked with

560
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,100
him.

561
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,660
And notice, and Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar

562
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:19,900
of stone, and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon, and Jacob called

563
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,660
the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.

564
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,940
I want you to think about the worship.

565
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:30,620
As we look at this portion of scripture, and we think of all that's taken place in the

566
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:35,780
life of Jacob, we see in verse number, there at the end there in verse number 14, this

567
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,500
drink offering again.

568
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:43,700
This is prior to the book of Leviticus and all of the requirements with regard to offerings

569
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:51,700
and so on and so forth, but we find that Jacob, he pours out this oil there, this drink offering,

570
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:56,820
again, understanding worship.

571
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,420
God is worthy of our worship.

572
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,780
He is worthy of our worship.

573
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:06,060
Begin to think about God being worthy of our worship and looking at what's taking place

574
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:12,140
here in Genesis chapter 35, I'm reminded of just the amazing aspect of what takes place

575
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,220
in Jacob's life.

576
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:20,180
In Genesis 28, he's at Bethel, and now again in Genesis chapter 35, he's at Bethel.

577
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:24,940
There's a lot of things that happened in between, a lot of circumstances that took place in

578
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:31,020
his life and difficulties and troubles and all sorts of things that take place, but we

579
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:37,780
find in Genesis 28, now here in Genesis 35, that he's at Bethel and he's worshiping God.

580
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,940
He's worshiping God.

581
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,340
We find that God alone is worthy of our worship.

582
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:51,940
So we're going to think about Bethel and being the name Bethel, meaning the house of God.

583
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,580
We're going to think about how we worship God.

584
00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:02,180
The Bible says in John chapter 4 that they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit

585
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,460
and in truth.

586
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,900
All that is called worship today is not really worship.

587
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,180
You understand that, right?

588
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:18,380
All that is called worship today is not really worship because it must align with God's Word.

589
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,980
See, some people have the idea that I can approach God any way I want.

590
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,980
You're wrong.

591
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,860
There's only one way to approach God and it's the way that He said.

592
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:34,660
God is God and He's the one that has determined how mankind would approach Him.

593
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:41,460
I'm thankful that He took the first step and He provided the sacrifice because man must

594
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,940
come by the way of the cross.

595
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,940
We sing the song.

596
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,540
You've got to come by the way of the cross.

597
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,540
There's no other way.

598
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,540
There's no other way.

599
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:54,100
If we're going to worship God, we must worship Him in spirit and in truth.

600
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:59,940
We must recognize that He is a thrice holy God and as we enter His presence, as we look

601
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:05,300
at the pages of Scripture and we observe those that worship God, that have an encounter with

602
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,980
God, they're always broken.

603
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:16,140
There's a sense of soberness amongst the people as they enter into the presence of God.

604
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:21,220
Worship doesn't...today it's almost like these people have the idea that worship requires

605
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:25,180
dimming lights and doing all sorts of crazy things.

606
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,220
No, no, no, no, no, no.

607
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:34,260
They that worship God must worship Him in spirit and in truth.

608
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:42,220
And we must approach God on His terms.

609
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,900
Jacob worships God.

610
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,740
There was preparation.

611
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:52,060
I've referenced throughout the message this evening about the journey.

612
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:57,940
I finished with the purpose for the journey and I want to focus our attention as we close

613
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:06,020
this evening to this idea of worship and understanding that there was preparation for worship.

614
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:12,980
The whole purpose of the journey was to go to a place that's called the house of God

615
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:17,060
and to set up an altar to worship God.

616
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:21,300
That was the whole purpose.

617
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:26,860
When I think about coming to and looking at New Testament biblical Christianity, looking

618
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:33,220
in 2023 and we have a service schedule, we call it a morning worship service, an evening

619
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:42,660
worship service, I wonder this evening how much preparation takes place in our lives

620
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,380
to worship God.

621
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:52,580
Yesterday, Tim and I prayed right here after the men's prayer breakfast and Tim and I both

622
00:37:52,580 --> 00:38:00,140
prayed that we would have prepared hearts for the services today.

623
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,140
Tim prayed first.

624
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,820
I was impressed to hear a young man pray that way.

625
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,820
I was.

626
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,260
I hope I'm not embarrassing you.

627
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:14,740
I was impressed by it because, you know, on Saturday evenings there should take a time

628
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:23,100
where we kind of wind down a little bit, begin to focus our minds on tomorrow's the day,

629
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,180
the Lord's day.

630
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,220
And I want to be ready to worship God.

631
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:32,020
I want to be ready to worship God.

632
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,260
We do our best.

633
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:37,860
We were much better at it when we were younger and had younger kids.

634
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,540
But Saturday evenings we'd lock it down like after 6 o'clock.

635
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,900
Why?

636
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:50,780
I don't want to be dragging my kids tired into church because it's the Lord's day.

637
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,780
There was some…

638
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,940
We talked about the word of preparation, to prepare.

639
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,900
It's in advance, right?

640
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,180
That's what the word means.

641
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,140
It's the understanding.

642
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,140
There's preparation.

643
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,460
And how am I preparing?

644
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:08,460
See, when I'm preparing to worship, it begins, I would say, for us today as New Testament

645
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:12,060
believers on Saturday evening.

646
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:16,380
I don't want to drag in the church on Sunday morning, tired, and I understand you got kids

647
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,140
and something happens and there's whatever, but I want to protect my calendar.

648
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,620
I want to protect my schedule.

649
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:26,500
I don't want to be out until 11, 12, 1 o'clock on Saturday evening and then be like, yeah,

650
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,020
you know, I think I'm going to skip this and maybe I'll just…

651
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,020
No, no.

652
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,940
I want to worship.

653
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,820
This is worthy of our worship.

654
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:41,180
And when I come to the house of God, I want to be ready to worship.

655
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:46,180
Some of that preparation, get clean.

656
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,540
Take a shower, sure, but get clean, get a clean heart.

657
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,860
God, I want to enter your presence.

658
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,980
I want to worship you in spirit and in truth.

659
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:59,940
I want you to be pleased with my sacrifice, with my offering that when we…

660
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,960
We come to the house of, you know, giving is part of worship.

661
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:09,140
We prepare our hearts to give unto the Lord.

662
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:15,340
And there's all this preparation, and we see it in the beginning of Genesis 35.

663
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:23,620
And I hope that as we look at this text of Scripture that we see that worship takes place.

664
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,500
But oh, how important that preparation is.

665
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,300
Oh, how important that preparation is.

666
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:39,540
I trust that God would help us in 2023 to see God for who He is, to understand that

667
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:47,500
He is worthy of our worship, and that we would be prepared when we enter into the house of

668
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:53,540
God to meet with God and to worship God.

669
00:40:53,540 --> 00:41:00,580
I hope that when you drive here on Sunday morning, when you drive here on Sunday night,

670
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:09,860
you have this heart of expectation, anticipation, we're gonna meet with God, we're gonna meet

671
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,860
with God.

672
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:19,260
And I want God to challenge me and speak to me and meet with me, that preparation.

673
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,620
Why do we pray before our services the way that we do?

674
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:27,100
Well, the Bible says the house of God is to be a house of prayer.

675
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:33,380
That time of prayer, those couple of minutes of corporate prayer, has been implemented

676
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,700
so that we would pray that God would meet with us.

677
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,420
It's not to pray for some sick relative.

678
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,020
Now, I'm not criticizing you if you've done that.

679
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:50,980
What I'm saying is that that is specific prayer time for God meet with us.

680
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:58,140
God work in my life first, and then in the lives of those that are gathered.

681
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,180
We have come to worship.

682
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,180
Let's pray together.

683
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,340
Father, we love you.

684
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,840
We thank you for loving us.

685
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:13,060
Thank you for a place called Bethel, the house of God.

686
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:20,940
I believe this evening that this place was special to Jacob.

687
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:31,940
God, as we look at this Old Testament account of this man and his family as they journeyed,

688
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:39,860
God, I pray that you'd help us in our own lives, that we would worship you in spirit

689
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,860
and in truth.

690
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,180
God, we'd understand that you're a holy God.

691
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:48,180
You're worthy of our worship.

692
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:54,340
I hope this evening that we would prepare to worship you.

693
00:42:54,340 --> 00:43:03,580
We'd make the decisions necessary, maybe even difficult decisions, in that process of preparation,

694
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,900
so that we would be ready to worship.

695
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:13,740
I pray that you'd move and work in these moments of invitation as only you can.

696
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:17,820
I pray, God, that decisions would be made that would please me.

697
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:20,900
We'll thank you for all that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

698
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,260
Would you stand?
