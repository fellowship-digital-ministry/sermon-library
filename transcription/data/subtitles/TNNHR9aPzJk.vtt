WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.759
number thirty-five this evening, Genesis chapter number thirty-five,

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:08.199
and we'll be looking at verses one through fifteen this evening, Genesis chapter thirty-five

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:11.939
verses one through fifteen. It's hard to believe we've been in the study of the

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:16.000
book of Genesis here on Sunday evenings for quite some time. This is the seventy-fifth

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.239
message

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:20.959
that I have preached from the book of Genesis and we're in chapter thirty-five

00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:22.479
and uh... there's only

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:25.600
uh... fifty chapters so maybe we'll, I think we'll make it to a hundred

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.840
messages on the book of Genesis

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.159
and uh... my uh... my uh... notebook that I have on my iPad for this sermon

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:35.119
series

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:39.119
I handwrite my notes and then use the iPad for them. I'm on page

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:41.400
number two hundred and twenty-six

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.639
uh... of notes and so uh... if you keep notes just on Sunday night you'll fill up

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:49.400
a sermon notebook that we pass out for just the book of Genesis

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.360
uh... but we're thankful for this wonderful book, a book of foundations

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.759
a book that is so important, a book that's constantly, especially the first

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:59.759
eleven chapters, constantly under attack

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:04.760
and I'm thankful for the record that God has given us. As Jacob, you'll remember

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.519
from back in Genesis chapter number twenty-eight, Jacob fled from his homeland

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:13.680
of course there were a number of circumstances surrounding his departure

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.360
from his homeland. Esau said he was going to kill him because of the

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.959
uh... the blessing and so on and so forth but we find that as he left his homeland

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:24.599
that he had an encounter with God

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:26.400
at Bethel.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.639
We find that God

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:31.440
records for us as he would leave his homeland, as he would journey

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.519
to head to Paddan Aram, that he has that encounter with God

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:38.400
and uh... if you look at Genesis chapter twenty-eight, we're not going to look there this

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.800
evening specifically

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.120
but you might want to note it down to reference back to verses ten through

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.239
twenty-two

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:46.120
and you'll see that encounter

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.000
that that Jacob had with God at Bethel.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.760
We find that Jacob spent several years in Paddan Aram, of course we know

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.080
that there are all sorts of events that take place there and uh... initially his

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.319
mother said go back to that place for just a few days until your brother's

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:04.199
anger

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:07.639
is subsided and then returned and it was years later

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:11.720
when he finally receives word from God as it's recorded in Genesis chapter

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.880
thirty-one

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.800
that he is to return to the land

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.279
of his fathers.

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:21.240
We find that Jacob was obedient to that instruction that God gave in Genesis

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.720
chapter thirty-one

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.520
and as he obeys the Lord we find and we've studied over the last several

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.399
weeks

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:32.559
uh... that eventually he would have that reunion and a wonderful reunion it

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:33.479
was

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:35.440
with his brother Esau.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.839
There was a great concern leading up to the reunion and of course the

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:43.839
uh... circumstances surrounding the original departure were still fresh in

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:44.919
the mind and

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:48.639
Jacob was concerned that Esau would kill him and the family and so on and so

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:49.679
forth and

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:51.440
of course when he found out that

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.199
uh... he sent those messengers ahead and they said well Esau's coming towards you

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:57.080
he's got four hundred men with them

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.559
and uh... that just increased his anxiety level

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:04.000
and uh... but what a wonderful reunion that God

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.440
uh... gives us the account of

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.559
and we find that

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:11.600
uh... as Jacob returned and has that reunion

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.960
uh... prior to before he actually meets with Esau we find that he's at a place

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.520
called Mahanaim

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:20.479
and he's there at that place and then after the reunion

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:23.919
he goes to a place called Succoth and eventually to Shalem

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:27.960
which is the city of Shechem. Of course last week we studied Genesis chapter

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.039
thirty-four

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:32.800
and we dealt with the unfortunate events that are recorded for us there in Genesis

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.919
thirty-four

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:38.000
and we find after those unfortunate events

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.940
the Bible picks up in Genesis thirty-five

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.399
and God speaks to Jacob and notice what God says in verse number one

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:48.080
of Genesis thirty-five

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.880
and God said unto Jacob

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.279
Arise

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:55.000
go up to Bethel

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.600
and dwell there

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.960
and make there an altar unto God that appeared unto thee when thou

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.919
fleddest from the face of Esau

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.279
thy brother

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:08.600
I've titled the message this evening Returning

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.880
to Bethel

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.240
I want you to think about all of the things that had taken place in the life

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.320
of Jacob and we've studied

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.239
those events from chapter twenty-eight now to chapter thirty-five

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.920
and so many events, so many circumstances have taken place in the life of Jacob

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.000
but now God appears to Jacob and God speaks to Jacob

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.600
and says arise and go up to Bethel

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.359
and dwell there. If you're taking notes this evening I want you to notice with

00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:37.760
me first of all the preparation

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.880
for the journey

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.519
the preparation for the journey. If you're gonna take a trip you prepare for

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:46.079
a trip. Typically we got some folks that are traveling this week. We have some

00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:51.480
folks that due to the nature of their travels they made certain preparations

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.799
in preparing to depart for all that would take place

00:04:56.799 --> 00:05:00.440
and we find here that in the text of scripture that God gives us

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.760
a record of the preparation

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.399
for the journey. Notice in verse number two after

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:08.559
Jacob receives word from God he hears

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:11.600
very distinctly what God says. There's no

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.600
difficulty on interpreting verse number one of Genesis thirty-five

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.760
arise

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.720
go up to Bethel

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.000
and dwell there

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.279
and pretty straightforward instruction that God gives

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:27.359
and we find that he tells him to make there an altar unto God

00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:31.640
and he says that appeared unto thee when thou fled us from the face of Esau thy

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.519
brother

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:37.040
then notice what Jacob does as we note the preparation in verses two

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.119
three and four

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:40.600
the Bible says in verse number two

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.100
then Jacob said unto his household

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.000
and to all that were with him

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.559
put away the strange gods that are among you

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:52.079
and be clean and change your garments. As we think about the preparation for the

00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:52.799
journey

00:05:52.799 --> 00:05:57.160
I would note first of all what Jacob requested. We see this in verse number two

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.720
the request is made

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.679
it's very interesting that Jacob says to his household notice first of all what

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:03.559
he says

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:04.799
put away

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:06.720
the strange gods

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.200
that are among you

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.959
I want you to think about if you would

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:12.600
take and turn back to chapter number thirty-one

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.200
and you remember that as they would depart from Paddan Aram after

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.279
Jacob received that word from the Lord that he was to return to his

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:22.079
kindred and to his

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:26.040
the land of his fathers we understand that that departure was met with some

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.720
adverse circumstances

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.959
but the Bible told us in that portion of scripture

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:33.320
that Rachel stole

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.760
the idols

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.480
the Bible tells us in verse number nineteen and Laban went to shear his sheep

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.519
and Rachel had stolen the images

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:43.760
that were her father's

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.119
as you look down in verse number thirty-one

00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:49.279
the Bible says that Jacob answered and said to Laban because I was afraid for I

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:51.880
said peradventure thou wouldest take by force

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.320
thy daughters from me verse thirty-two with whomsoever

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.480
thou findest thy gods

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.920
let him not live

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.239
it seems pretty obvious from that statement

00:07:02.239 --> 00:07:06.640
that Jacob had no knowledge that Rachel had stolen the idols

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.519
he loved Rachel no doubt in my mind that if he would have known

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:14.679
that Rachel had those idols he would not have said this to Laban

00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:18.679
but we find that he says to Laban with whomsoever thou findest thy gods let him

00:07:18.679 --> 00:07:21.160
not live before our brethren discern thou

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.959
what is thine with me and take it to thee

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:26.799
for Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them

00:07:26.799 --> 00:07:31.320
and Laban went to Jacob's tent, to Leah's tent, and to the two maidservants' tents

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.880
notice it says but he found them not

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:40.880
then went he out of Leah's tent notice it says and entered into Rachel's tent

00:07:41.119 --> 00:07:46.600
she knew what was in her tent

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.040
she was well aware

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.380
she devises a story, a plan

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.559
in order to keep hidden from Laban what she had stolen

00:07:53.559 --> 00:07:56.679
by the way you might be able to hide something from someone else but you

00:07:56.679 --> 00:08:00.440
can't hide anything from God

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.519
God's telling us about what took place

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:06.279
in his record the Bible

00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:09.720
it says now Rachel had taken the images and put them in the camel's furniture

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.079
and sat upon them

00:08:11.079 --> 00:08:14.679
and Laban searched all the tent but found them not she said to her father

00:08:14.679 --> 00:08:16.640
let it not displease my Lord

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.239
that I cannot rise up before thee for the custom of women is upon me

00:08:20.239 --> 00:08:22.760
and he searched but found not

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.480
the images

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.559
they were there he just didn't find them

00:08:27.559 --> 00:08:30.000
now we come to chapter thirty five

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.920
we read about these

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.679
strange gods that are among you

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.719
it seems pretty obvious to me that

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:38.440
the idols that were taken

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.880
are now at some point after Laban had searched and after the

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.119
the journey that had taken place and I've kind of outlined by way of introduction

00:08:47.119 --> 00:08:50.039
the places in which Jacob and his family have been

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:52.520
up to this point in Genesis thirty five

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.760
after departing from Paddan Aram and

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.559
at some point perhaps those idols made their way out into the family and

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:05.200
perhaps also with the people of the land that there was some interaction

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.280
with that they picked up some idols some false gods

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.239
this is tragic

00:09:14.239 --> 00:09:18.059
but first order of business in preparing for this journey

00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:22.200
to go to Bethel was Jacob saying put away the strange gods

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.419
that are among you

00:09:23.419 --> 00:09:26.359
if I could criticize Jacob for just a moment

00:09:26.359 --> 00:09:30.119
I would say that he should have told them to put the strange gods away

00:09:30.119 --> 00:09:36.200
before God ever gave him instruction to go to Bethel

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.320
it's unfortunate that as he would

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.320
take the strange gods that were provided

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.239
that he did not destroy them

00:09:44.239 --> 00:09:47.039
we'll note that in just a moment

00:09:47.039 --> 00:09:50.640
but I find that it's commendable as much as I would criticize him for not doing

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.599
it prior it's commendable that in preparation for going to Bethel

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.559
he recognizes there's some things that need to happen

00:09:59.559 --> 00:09:59.960
the first

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.560
order of business is we need to get rid of these strange gods. We need to get rid of

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:08.880
these idols. And we understand that today and we think about the images that were there

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.200
that were stolen by Rachel, as it's said in Genesis chapter 31, and we can think of

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:21.280
lots of different examples of idols. But we find that the sin of idolatry is so common

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.800
within the Old Testament and we often see this snare, if you will, with the children

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.240
of Israel. But, you know, the Bible tells in the New Testament, it says this, keep yourselves

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:39.120
from idols. As John is writing in the epistle of John, he says, keep thyself from idols

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:45.400
in 1 John 5. And the reality is that we understand this evening that in the book of Colossians

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:52.440
God tells us this, that in all things the Lord Jesus Christ is to have the preeminence.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:58.360
An idol doesn't have to be some little image that someone burns incense to or bows down

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:03.120
to. That's what our mind thinks of. That's what comes into our mind's eye when we think

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:11.640
about an image or an idol. But the reality is an idol is anything that takes God's place.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:22.640
An idol can be a workplace. How many have made money in idol? Position? Power? Sports?

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:29.040
Oh, there's many idols today. We don't like so much talking about idols. We like to think

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:34.160
about maybe some Eastern religions and the way that they have idols and criticizing, but

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:40.960
the reality is that even here in the United States there are plenty that have idols. And

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:46.080
Jacob says before we go to Bethel, the first thing we need to do in preparation is we need

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.360
to put away the strange gods that are among you. I want you to notice that he also made

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:59.960
this request in verse number 2. The Bible says this, and be clean and change your garments.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:06.760
Isn't that interesting? You understand that here as we're looking in the book of Genesis,

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.880
this is before the law, this is before all of the instruction that we read in the book

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.560
of Leviticus and all of those things with regard to approaching God and worshipping

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:24.680
God and all of the particulars with regard to how you would approach God and the sacrifices

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.040
and all of those things. And we find that Jacob says not only do we need to put away

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:35.640
the strange gods that are among you, but he says be clean and change your garments. Why

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:42.320
is it that he would make reference to being clean and changing their garments? Well here's

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:48.600
why. You know what Bethel is? It's the house of God. That's what it means. That's what

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:54.080
the word Bethel means. And basically what Jacob is saying as we look at verse number

00:12:54.080 --> 00:13:00.800
2 is we're going to the house of God and we need to get rid of some idols and you need

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:08.200
to get clean and you need to change your garments. So often today people would criticize

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.840
and say that you're pharisaical and legalistic and so on and so forth if you have any measure

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:17.800
of standards. And the reality is that you can come just as you are. No one would ever

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:23.040
turn your way. Isn't that an amazing thing that we would understand that we're coming

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:29.360
into the presence of God? We're going to worship God. And as I'm coming to a holy place where

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.840
I preached this morning on Moses there in the book of Exodus in the third chapter, that

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.240
ground was not holy ground because Moses was there. It was not holy ground because it was

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.840
a bush that was burning. It was holy ground because God's presence was there. We come

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:49.760
to worship God. Jacob says you need to get rid of those idols and you need to get cleaned

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:55.200
up and you need to change your garments. That's powerful because we're going to the house

00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:03.280
of God. See, notice as we look here at this request we then see that he makes, he reveals

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.240
some truth to his family. I'm not sure how much of this he had revealed to them prior

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:13.600
to this particular record but we find that as he tells them what to do in this preparation,

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.520
he makes this request, that then he reveals some truth in verse number three. The Bible

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:22.880
says, and let us arise and go up to Bethel and I will make there an altar unto God. What's

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:28.920
the purpose of making the altar? It's to worship God. That's why we're going there. Why do

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:35.920
we go to church? I understand that this isn't the church here in Genesis chapter 35 but

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.720
I understand this evening that we assemble together. The church is a called out assembly.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:48.280
It's a body of believers and we come for the purpose of worship. Church isn't a club. Amen?

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.840
It's not a club. I understand. I'm thankful that we're a family and I'm thankful that

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:57.920
we can have fellowship one with another but the reality is that church is to worship God,

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.880
to have an encounter with God Almighty. When I come to church, I want to come to church

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:08.280
to hear from God. I want to come to church so that God would step on my toes and change

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:13.240
me and help me to be conformed to the image of his dear son. I want to come to worship

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:20.240
him, to bless his holy name because he's wonderful and he's worthy of our praise. That's why

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:27.000
we come to church, to worship. You come to church and say, man, I got to see so and so.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.240
I got to have fellowship with so and so. We did this. We did that. But if you didn't worship,

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:37.800
you missed the whole purpose. You missed the whole purpose. And we find here that he reveals

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.040
that here's where we're going but notice what he says. He says, and I will make there an

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:48.040
altar unto God. Notice what he says, who answered me in the day of my distress. Jacob did not

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:55.240
forget that God heard him and that God answered him. And he says that God answered me in the

00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:01.000
day of my distress. And I'm looking at this portion and I'm thinking about how Jacob is

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.800
revealing this truth to his family. Again, I'm not sure had he revealed this earlier

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.320
and how much he had revealed to his family. But he says now as they're preparing to go

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:17.100
to Bethel, he says, listen, I'm going to make a request. You need to prepare for getting

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:22.380
to the house of God, for worshiping God. But I want you to know that this God that we're

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:26.660
going to worship, my God that we're going to worship, you see he's not like those idols.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.500
What the Bible says about idols, you can read in the Psalms, you can read in other portions

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:36.340
of Scripture, that they're made by man's hands. They have ears but they hear not. That's what

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:43.100
the Bible says. You think about the situation with Elijah there on Mount Carmel. He says,

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:48.940
you can call out to your gods, the God that answers my fire, let him be the true God.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:54.000
Those worshipers of Baal, they cried out and they cried out and they cut themselves and

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:01.000
they did all sorts of things but Baal never answered. Why? Because Baal is a false god.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:08.260
And here we have Jacob that says, he answered me in the day of my distress. Not only that,

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:14.940
he says, and was with me in the way which I went. God's presence is made known at the

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:19.860
end of verse number 3. Jacob says, not only did he answer me, but he was with me. Aren't

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:26.140
you thankful for God's presence? What a joy to think about how Jacob is revealing this

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:31.140
truth. See, the reality is that as we look at Genesis chapter 35, see Jacob has already

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:37.920
been to Bethel before. And now he's returning to Bethel. He knew what it was to be in Bethel.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:42.760
He knew what happened in that place. If you look at Genesis 28, we don't have the time

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:48.320
this evening but in verses 10-22 and you see the time when he's in Bethel and you look

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.240
at what's taking place there and I'll just read, I'll reference one verse of scripture.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.640
The Bible says this, that Jacob awaked out of that dream that he had and he said this

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:04.640
in verse number 16, surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not. Listen, what

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:11.760
happened in Bethel, Jacob was never going to forget. And now he's going back to Bethel.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.520
And as he's returning back to Bethel, he's telling his family, hey listen, we need to

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:20.440
prepare for worship. We need to get rid of these idols. We need to get cleaned up. We

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.320
need to change our garments because we're going to worship and the God that we're going

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:30.440
to worship, he answered me. He heard me when I prayed and he answered me and he was with

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:37.440
me. Wow, precious. We find the response in verse number 4. By the way, I'm thankful they

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:48.520
responded the way that they did. It says in verse number 4, and they gave unto Jacob all

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.920
the strange gods which were in their hand and all their earrings which were in their

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:57.840
ears and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. He should have destroyed them.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:05.480
You know what they did in Ephesus? They took all those books and they burned them. You

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:10.559
know, some of the kings of Israel, they took, as you would have a bad, excuse me, the kings

00:19:10.559 --> 00:19:15.080
of Judah, not of Israel because there's no good kings in Israel after the divided kingdom.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:19.520
But after the divided kingdom, you had some good kings in Judah. You'd have a good king

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.080
that would rise up and he'd clean out the house of the Lord from all the idols and sometimes

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:27.480
they'd just kind of put them to the side. And then there'd rise another wicked king

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:32.440
and they'd take all those idols and put them back into the house of God. But there's times

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:39.440
in which they burned them and they caused them to be made into dust and got rid of them.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:48.800
Listen, it doesn't do any good to keep an idol around. Destroy it, get rid of it, burn

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:56.800
it. But we find that they respond to the request that Jacob makes in verse 2. They respond

00:19:59.679 --> 00:20:00.040
in obedience.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.040
in verse number four.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.280
So now they're ready for the journey.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.320
They're ready to depart.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.400
And we find that it begins verse number five

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.920
and says, and they journeyed.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.640
The preparation phase was complete.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.480
You take a trip, you make all the preparation,

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.480
and then at some point you depart.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.360
There's a departure time.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.680
We find that the preparation for the journey is completed.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.880
If you're taking notes, number two,

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.480
I want you to see the protection for the journey,

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.040
the protection for the journey.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.960
Notice in just in verse number five,

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.200
we see this, the Bible says this, and they journeyed.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.400
And notice what it says, and the terror of God

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.720
was upon the cities that were round about them,

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.720
and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.160
Just a single verse of scripture,

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:56.160
but it reveals to us the protection of Almighty God.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.520
I'm so thankful.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.840
As you think about Jacob,

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.680
he's a man that's often concerned about things.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.600
He's a fearful man.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.680
He's constantly operating and functioning

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.920
and making decisions based upon fear.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:10.520
In fact, in Genesis chapter 34 and verse number 30,

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.320
remember after the unfortunate circumstances there

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.800
of what happened in Shechem,

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.760
the Bible says this in verse 30 of Genesis 34.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.880
And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi,

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.200
you have troubled me to make me to stink

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.440
among the inhabitants of the land,

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.560
among the Canaanites and the Perizzites,

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.520
and I being few in number.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.400
Now, keep that in mind.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.920
It says, and I being few in number,

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.280
they shall gather themselves together against me

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:39.280
and slay me, and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.480
The children of Israel at this particular time,

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.720
it's not the million that leave,

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.600
the large quantity that leave the exodus,

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.240
just a small group of people.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.720
Jacob says that we're few in number,

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.800
but we find here that the Bible says

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.800
that the terror of God was upon the cities

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.760
that were round about them.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.760
This is God's divine protection.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.760
Jacob, because of what he recognized

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.760
about the power of the people groups there

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.600
in the land that he was dwelling in and all that took,

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.840
he felt like he was vulnerable.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.440
He felt like there was a lack of defense

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.920
that they had themselves,

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:26.920
but the reality is that God can provide divine protection.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.080
We often speak about,

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.880
and I mentioned even on Wednesday evening,

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.800
that the Bible says that the horse is prepared

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.960
for the day of battle, but safety is of the Lord.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:40.440
Listen, I believe in taking the preventative measures

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.120
necessary to provide for safety and what have you,

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.800
and I believe in making good decisions,

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.360
but ultimately, safety is of the Lord.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.960
We find here that the Bible says

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.120
that the terror of God was upon the cities

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:54.960
that were round about them.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.880
Isn't that amazing how God worked?

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.760
So much so that the Bible says they did not pursue

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:04.080
after the sons of Jacob.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.440
Though they were departing

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.960
and though they were few in number

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.240
and though maybe from a human perspective

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.080
they were vulnerable to attack,

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:15.760
we find that God moved and God worked.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.240
God is able.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.240
God is able.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.720
And I rejoice in this single verse of Scripture

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.240
in Genesis 35 because it helps us to understand

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.920
and to rest in the fact that our God is able to protect us.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.720
Sometimes we can go through such great measures,

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:41.520
trying so many things, but fail even to just pray

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.320
and ask God.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.360
Think about the truth of praying a hedge

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.960
of protection upon someone.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.440
We have not had the opportunity recently

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.120
in recent time to sing the song,

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.440
but I think Holly and the girls sang the song many times,

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:04.640
a wall of prayer, a wall of prayer.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.680
You think about how God can provide

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.800
that protection that we need.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.120
Listen, you need protection.

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.840
I need protection.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.600
The people in the land there,

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.160
there was a very possible scenario

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.960
that they would be attacked given all of the circumstances,

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.680
but God protected.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.440
Listen, we live in a crazy world.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.880
We really do.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.160
Craziness.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:36.080
People that are taking advantage of the elderly.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.360
Videos all of the time that you see on the news nowadays

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:44.040
of some elderly individual leaving a place of business

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.480
and being knocked in the head from behind and so on.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.360
It's nonsense.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.680
There was a time in America

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.000
where young people respected the elderly.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.880
They'd never think, it never crossed their mind

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.440
to do something like that.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.480
We live in a world that's lost its mind,

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.920
but God is able to protect us.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.840
We need to pray for God's protection daily.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.960
We see how God works.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.920
I've read of missionary stories,

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.120
accounts that missionaries have given from the field

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:26.400
of people that set out to destroy the missionariness family

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.360
to come and burn down their house and kill them.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.400
When they arrive, they said we could do nothing

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.040
because there were armed men all around your property.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.480
Missionaries say, what are you talking about, armed men?

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.400
I believe they're angels.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.400
Sometimes you have the opportunity to hear

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:51.720
the other end of the account where there was someone

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.640
that God awakened in the middle of the night

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.720
to pray for a specific missionary.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.440
Listen, if God ever prompts you to pray for a missionary,

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.200
man, you ought to pray for that missionary.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.080
So I don't know what I'm praying for.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.760
God knows why.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:07.520
He's praying God put a hedge of protection about them.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.200
God take care of them, meet their needs,

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.200
whatever the situation is.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.560
God is able, God is able.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.240
We see the preparation for the journey.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.000
We see the protection for the journey,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.640
but I want you to see finally this evening

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.200
the purpose for the journey, the purpose for the journey.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.280
When God calls and gives direction,

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.960
you can rest assured that he has a purpose in it.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.920
The purpose is revealed to us in the text of scripture.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.720
It wasn't just that God thought,

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.120
well, Jacob, you've been there long enough,

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.360
it's time to move to another place,

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.400
and so let me get, no, there's a purpose.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:43.320
We find that our God always moves with purpose.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.280
He always gives his children direction

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.160
on purpose and with purpose.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.360
As we had the opportunity last year,

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:55.040
Holly and I for a couple of weeks to be there in Israel,

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.920
it was amazing to me to stand in the places

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.600
where we stood and to have the opportunities

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.600
and to rehearse in my mind the biblical accounts

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.840
that I knew that took place in these particular areas

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.440
that we stood and to have it all come together

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:14.240
and say, that's why Jesus did that here.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.920
I get the purpose now.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.920
I could see it, I could understand it.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.360
And this evening, as we look at this portion of scripture,

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.880
we find that God reveals to us the purpose.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.080
We notice already in verse number one

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.360
that he says, go to Bethel and dwell there,

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.520
and he says, and make there an altar unto God.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.400
So notice with me in verse number six,

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.600
the Bible says, so Jacob came to Luz,

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.000
which is in the land of Canaan, that is Bethel.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.520
He and all the people that were with him,

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.640
and he built there an altar.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.680
He obeyed what God told him to do.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:53.120
God said, go to Bethel, dwell there, and build an altar.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.480
And the Bible tells us in verse six that they arrived,

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.720
they had safe traveling mercies,

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.000
they had protection along the way,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.840
and they get to the place, they reach their destination,

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.000
and as they reach their destination,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.280
we find that he builds there an altar.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.120
It's exactly what God told him to do.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.520
The Bible says that he called it, notice,

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.680
he called the place El, Bethel,

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:22.320
because there God appeared unto him

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.280
when he fled from the face of his brother.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.560
Now, I'm not sure if you've ever visited a place

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:35.240
that something significant took place in your life

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.040
at that location.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.320
I mean, it's a location where there was something

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:43.280
that was just life-altering type of an event

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.640
that took place.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.800
That's what happened at Bethel the first time.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:52.280
And now Jacob is back in that place.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.480
Can you imagine with me the memories

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.560
that would flood his mind of that time

00:28:58.600 --> 00:28:59.960
that he was there in Bethel?

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.920
It had been a couple of decades since he's been there,

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.000
and we think about that time that has transpired

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.600
between the first time it was at Bethel

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.700
and now the second time,

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.840
perhaps there's some changes in the landscape,

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.440
perhaps there's some things that have shifted

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.800
and some things that are different,

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.640
but I think about Jacob being in that place,

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.840
and I think about maybe him thinking about

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.440
where he pillowed his head when he had that dream

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.040
and where he poured out that offering

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.160
and all that took place,

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.720
and we find that he's now back in Bethel,

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:32.560
and he put that altar, and he called it El Bethel,

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.600
and it says, because there God appeared unto him

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.920
when he fled from the face of his brother.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.880
God gives us in verse number eight

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:44.160
the record of the death of Deborah, Rebekah's nurse.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.920
It says that Deborah, Rebekah's nurse,

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.160
died and was buried beneath Bethel under an oak.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.160
The name of it is called Alan Bakuth.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.660
But notice as the dialogue continues back

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:58.580
to the situation of Jacob and the family there in Bethel,

00:29:58.580 --> 00:29:59.980
it says in verse number nine.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:06.540
And God appeared unto Jacob again when he came out of Paddan Aram and blessed him.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:12.060
So we know, as we begin to put all of this together this evening, we know that God appeared

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:17.440
to Jacob at Bethel before he went to Paddan Aram.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.580
We read that.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:25.380
We referenced it already in Genesis chapter 28, and we know that Jacob had that encounter

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:31.700
with God, but now the Bible specifically says that God appeared unto Jacob again when he

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:35.500
came out of Paddan Aram and blessed him.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:41.100
And so we find that God is appearing to him, so we look at the purpose of the journey.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.220
He built that altar.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.220
What's the purpose?

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.220
Worship.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.220
Worship.

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:49.780
Singularly stated, the purpose is worship.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:55.260
We find that as he is there and he's built this altar and there's worship that is taking

00:30:55.260 --> 00:31:00.900
place and God then appears, and notice it says at the end of verse number 9, and blessed

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:01.900
him.

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:06.580
Think about the blessings of God.

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:12.420
In verse number 10 it says, and God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob.

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:17.900
Thy name shall not be called anymore Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name.

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.420
And he called his name Israel.

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:24.340
That's a reference back to Genesis chapter 32, the night that he wrestled with the angel

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:30.180
of the Lord, and we read and studied that weeks ago, and we find that there's a confirmation

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:34.780
here with regard to not only the name change, but as we continue to move forward to the

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.380
Abrahamic covenant.

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:40.380
Notice in verse number 11, and God said unto him, I am God Almighty.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.860
Be fruitful and multiply.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:46.420
A nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.860
in the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac.

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:57.200
To thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:04.120
Think about the confirmation that God gives to Jacob, the blessing that is received.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:08.980
You note with me this confirmation of the Abrahamic covenant, and he says to him here

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:14.420
in this portion of scripture, he says in verse 11, I am God Almighty.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:24.060
You know, that name for God is El Shaddai, and the first time God ever used that name

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:28.500
in the book of Genesis is when he's speaking to Abraham in Genesis chapter 17 in verse

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.060
number 1.

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:35.540
And as God appears to Abraham in that particular text of scripture, he says, I am the Almighty

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:36.540
God.

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:43.980
And after God revealed himself to Abram as being the Almighty God, he would then shortly

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:50.020
thereafter ask Abraham, this question, is anything too hard for the Lord?

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.500
No, nothing's too hard for God.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:59.460
And it's interesting to me that as we look at this confirmation of the Abrahamic covenant,

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:05.460
that the seed is in view in verse number 11, the land is in view in verse number 12, and

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:10.100
we find that the Bible tells us that God went up from him in the place where he talked with

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.100
him.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:14.660
And notice, and Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:19.900
of stone, and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon, and Jacob called

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.660
the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:25.940
I want you to think about the worship.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:30.620
As we look at this portion of scripture, and we think of all that's taken place in the

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:35.780
life of Jacob, we see in verse number, there at the end there in verse number 14, this

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.500
drink offering again.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:43.700
This is prior to the book of Leviticus and all of the requirements with regard to offerings

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:51.700
and so on and so forth, but we find that Jacob, he pours out this oil there, this drink offering,

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:56.820
again, understanding worship.

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:59.420
God is worthy of our worship.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:01.780
He is worthy of our worship.

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:06.060
Begin to think about God being worthy of our worship and looking at what's taking place

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:12.140
here in Genesis chapter 35, I'm reminded of just the amazing aspect of what takes place

00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:13.220
in Jacob's life.

00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:20.180
In Genesis 28, he's at Bethel, and now again in Genesis chapter 35, he's at Bethel.

00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:24.940
There's a lot of things that happened in between, a lot of circumstances that took place in

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:31.020
his life and difficulties and troubles and all sorts of things that take place, but we

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:37.780
find in Genesis 28, now here in Genesis 35, that he's at Bethel and he's worshiping God.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:41.940
He's worshiping God.

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:45.340
We find that God alone is worthy of our worship.

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:51.940
So we're going to think about Bethel and being the name Bethel, meaning the house of God.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.580
We're going to think about how we worship God.

00:34:55.580 --> 00:35:02.180
The Bible says in John chapter 4 that they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:05.460
and in truth.

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:09.900
All that is called worship today is not really worship.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.180
You understand that, right?

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:18.380
All that is called worship today is not really worship because it must align with God's Word.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:21.980
See, some people have the idea that I can approach God any way I want.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:22.980
You're wrong.

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:27.860
There's only one way to approach God and it's the way that He said.

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:34.660
God is God and He's the one that has determined how mankind would approach Him.

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:41.460
I'm thankful that He took the first step and He provided the sacrifice because man must

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:42.940
come by the way of the cross.

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:43.940
We sing the song.

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:46.540
You've got to come by the way of the cross.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:47.540
There's no other way.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:48.540
There's no other way.

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:54.100
If we're going to worship God, we must worship Him in spirit and in truth.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:59.940
We must recognize that He is a thrice holy God and as we enter His presence, as we look

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:05.300
at the pages of Scripture and we observe those that worship God, that have an encounter with

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.980
God, they're always broken.

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:16.140
There's a sense of soberness amongst the people as they enter into the presence of God.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:21.220
Worship doesn't...today it's almost like these people have the idea that worship requires

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:25.180
dimming lights and doing all sorts of crazy things.

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:28.220
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:34.260
They that worship God must worship Him in spirit and in truth.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:42.220
And we must approach God on His terms.

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:45.900
Jacob worships God.

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.740
There was preparation.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:52.060
I've referenced throughout the message this evening about the journey.

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:57.940
I finished with the purpose for the journey and I want to focus our attention as we close

00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:06.020
this evening to this idea of worship and understanding that there was preparation for worship.

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:12.980
The whole purpose of the journey was to go to a place that's called the house of God

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:17.060
and to set up an altar to worship God.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:21.300
That was the whole purpose.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:26.860
When I think about coming to and looking at New Testament biblical Christianity, looking

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:33.220
in 2023 and we have a service schedule, we call it a morning worship service, an evening

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:42.660
worship service, I wonder this evening how much preparation takes place in our lives

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:45.380
to worship God.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:52.580
Yesterday, Tim and I prayed right here after the men's prayer breakfast and Tim and I both

00:37:52.580 --> 00:38:00.140
prayed that we would have prepared hearts for the services today.

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.140
Tim prayed first.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.820
I was impressed to hear a young man pray that way.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:05.820
I was.

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:07.260
I hope I'm not embarrassing you.

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:14.740
I was impressed by it because, you know, on Saturday evenings there should take a time

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:23.100
where we kind of wind down a little bit, begin to focus our minds on tomorrow's the day,

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:26.180
the Lord's day.

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.220
And I want to be ready to worship God.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:32.020
I want to be ready to worship God.

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.260
We do our best.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:37.860
We were much better at it when we were younger and had younger kids.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:41.540
But Saturday evenings we'd lock it down like after 6 o'clock.

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:42.900
Why?

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:50.780
I don't want to be dragging my kids tired into church because it's the Lord's day.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:51.780
There was some…

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:54.940
We talked about the word of preparation, to prepare.

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:56.900
It's in advance, right?

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.180
That's what the word means.

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.140
It's the understanding.

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.140
There's preparation.

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:02.460
And how am I preparing?

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:08.460
See, when I'm preparing to worship, it begins, I would say, for us today as New Testament

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:12.060
believers on Saturday evening.

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:16.380
I don't want to drag in the church on Sunday morning, tired, and I understand you got kids

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:20.140
and something happens and there's whatever, but I want to protect my calendar.

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:21.620
I want to protect my schedule.

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:26.500
I don't want to be out until 11, 12, 1 o'clock on Saturday evening and then be like, yeah,

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:29.020
you know, I think I'm going to skip this and maybe I'll just…

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:30.020
No, no.

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:31.940
I want to worship.

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:35.820
This is worthy of our worship.

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:41.180
And when I come to the house of God, I want to be ready to worship.

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:46.180
Some of that preparation, get clean.

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:49.540
Take a shower, sure, but get clean, get a clean heart.

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.860
God, I want to enter your presence.

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.980
I want to worship you in spirit and in truth.

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:59.940
I want you to be pleased with my sacrifice, with my offering that when we…

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:03.960
We come to the house of, you know, giving is part of worship.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:09.140
We prepare our hearts to give unto the Lord.

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:15.340
And there's all this preparation, and we see it in the beginning of Genesis 35.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:23.620
And I hope that as we look at this text of Scripture that we see that worship takes place.

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:26.500
But oh, how important that preparation is.

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:30.300
Oh, how important that preparation is.

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:39.540
I trust that God would help us in 2023 to see God for who He is, to understand that

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:47.500
He is worthy of our worship, and that we would be prepared when we enter into the house of

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:53.540
God to meet with God and to worship God.

00:40:53.540 --> 00:41:00.580
I hope that when you drive here on Sunday morning, when you drive here on Sunday night,

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:09.860
you have this heart of expectation, anticipation, we're gonna meet with God, we're gonna meet

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:10.860
with God.

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:19.260
And I want God to challenge me and speak to me and meet with me, that preparation.

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:22.620
Why do we pray before our services the way that we do?

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:27.100
Well, the Bible says the house of God is to be a house of prayer.

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:33.380
That time of prayer, those couple of minutes of corporate prayer, has been implemented

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:36.700
so that we would pray that God would meet with us.

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:39.420
It's not to pray for some sick relative.

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:42.020
Now, I'm not criticizing you if you've done that.

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:50.980
What I'm saying is that that is specific prayer time for God meet with us.

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:58.140
God work in my life first, and then in the lives of those that are gathered.

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:01.180
We have come to worship.

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.180
Let's pray together.

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:03.340
Father, we love you.

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:05.840
We thank you for loving us.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:13.060
Thank you for a place called Bethel, the house of God.

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:20.940
I believe this evening that this place was special to Jacob.

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:31.940
God, as we look at this Old Testament account of this man and his family as they journeyed,

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:39.860
God, I pray that you'd help us in our own lives, that we would worship you in spirit

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:41.860
and in truth.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.180
God, we'd understand that you're a holy God.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:48.180
You're worthy of our worship.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:54.340
I hope this evening that we would prepare to worship you.

00:42:54.340 --> 00:43:03.580
We'd make the decisions necessary, maybe even difficult decisions, in that process of preparation,

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:07.900
so that we would be ready to worship.

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:13.740
I pray that you'd move and work in these moments of invitation as only you can.

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:17.820
I pray, God, that decisions would be made that would please me.

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:20.900
We'll thank you for all that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:21.260
Would you stand?
