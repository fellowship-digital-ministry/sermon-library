1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
started last Sunday morning. Last Sunday morning we're in Colossians 3 and we're looking at

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:10,159
verses 5-7. This morning we'll be looking at verses 8-9 and of course as we noted last

3
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:18,040
week we said that Paul understood the danger of the flesh and therefore he provided the

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:23,440
believers in Colossians. Of course we have the word of God preserved for us this morning

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:29,920
and therefore for us as well with direct and detailed instruction. We find that in

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,680
this particular section that we'll begin studying this morning and really we'll look at it next

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,400
week as well, that we find that the Apostle Paul begins this section in instructing the

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:46,799
believers to put off and put on. And you'll notice the terminology that is being used

9
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:52,000
in the portion of Scripture and we of course would understand that Paul really is relating

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,479
to something that each of us are very familiar with. The reality is that we wear garments

11
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:04,360
and our garments get dirty. And when our garments get dirty, what do we do? We put them off.

12
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,400
We take them off, they need to be laundered, they need to be cleaned, and then we put on

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,559
some clean garments. And as Paul would use that analogy if you will, something that would

14
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:20,480
be very familiar to us, we find that as believers we have been changed. Amen? I mean listen,

15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,959
we're not what we used to be. Some of y'all need to sing again this morning. Amen? Some

16
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,519
of y'all brought some burdens this morning and I hope that the Lord will help you and

17
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:38,519
help me. But listen, we're not the same. We're different. Amen? And we have been born again,

18
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:45,279
we've been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ and we no longer are to walk in darkness

19
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:50,160
but we're to walk as children of the light. We're not to live under the circumstances.

20
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,040
Amen? We're to live with our eyes upon our Savior, looking unto Jesus, the author and

21
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,080
finisher of our faith. And I'm so thankful that he has a plan and his plan is perfect.

22
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,879
And I understand that we deal with difficulties and we deal with troubles and as we deal with

23
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:10,720
those things in life that sometimes we can get under it so to speak. I will lift up mine

24
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,720
eyes unto the hills. From whence cometh my help? My help cometh from the Lord, remember,

25
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:26,240
which made heaven and earth. Is anything too hard for him? No. My problems aren't too big

26
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,600
for God. Your problems aren't too big for God. We find that as Paul is addressing these

27
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,160
believers he's saying listen, you're different now. You've been born again. Your life has

28
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,399
been changed. I'm thankful that the Bible says if any man be in Christ he's a new creature.

29
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:50,399
Amen? And what a blessing to understand all that took place at Calvary. Now as we think

30
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:54,800
about the fact that we no longer walk in darkness but we're to walk as children of light, we

31
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,720
also remember that our flesh was not eradicated at salvation. It would have been a wonderful

32
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:06,600
thing, amen? But it wasn't. And we understand that the flesh lusteth against the Spirit

33
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,740
and we dealt with much of that last week as we started this particular passage of Scripture

34
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:17,839
but as we think about the truth that the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, we must understand

35
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:24,639
this morning that we have to be proactive. We have to be proactive. Remember in verse

36
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:30,479
number 5 he says, mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth. Crucify your flesh

37
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,839
was the message that I preached last Sunday morning. To put to death, to deprive of power

38
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:40,440
and now in this particular section we find that Paul begins in verse number 8 and he

39
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:48,360
says this, but now ye also put off all these. Notice the end of verse number 9, seeing that

40
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:56,520
ye have put off the old man with his deeds. As we think about the admonition from Paul

41
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,279
to these believers and to us this morning, we are to mortify our members and we are to

42
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:09,199
put off all these. That requires some work. That requires for us to be proactive in this

43
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:17,480
endeavor and I'm thankful that through the help of God that we can be victorious. Listen,

44
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,440
you're not going to mortify your members in your own power, you're not going to put off

45
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,600
all these in your own power, but as you walk in the Spirit, as you rely upon the power

46
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,720
of the resurrected Christ, then you can mortify your members which are upon the earth, you

47
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:38,579
can put off all these, you can have victory. Aren't you thankful for that this morning?

48
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:42,480
We don't have to live a defeated life. Listen, I don't like to lose. Do you like to lose?

49
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,600
I know we're living in a weird society today where they don't want to call anyone winners

50
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,760
and losers. Listen, we play to win, amen? That's just what's in me. And the reality

51
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:58,359
is that I don't want to be defeated by the enemy. And victory is possible through the

52
00:04:58,359 --> 00:05:03,320
Lord Jesus Christ. As we look at this particular section this morning, remember last week I

53
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,720
said to you a couple of times that if you were pretty comfortable with the list that

54
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,959
was provided in verse number five and said, man, I dodged those bullets, that doesn't

55
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,640
apply to me, just come back this week and you came back. And that's wonderful, amen?

56
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,200
But the reality is that this particular portion of Scripture, some of you might be familiar

57
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,600
with a preacher of yesteryear, Dr. G. Campbell Morgan. And Dr. G. Campbell Morgan, as he

58
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,880
was referring to this portion of Scripture, he referred to the list that is mentioned

59
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,320
in verse eight and to start verse number nine this way. He said, these are the sins in good

60
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:45,119
standing. These are the sins in good standing. What do you mean by that? Well, these are

61
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:49,600
things that we really don't want to talk about a whole lot, and we've just allowed to kind

62
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,959
of become part of our lives. We've just become comfortable with it. They are, in his words,

63
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:05,480
sins in good standing. Now, the reality is I believe somewhere, somehow, along the way,

64
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:15,839
believers have just failed to understand the evil and wickedness of sin. And somehow, somewhere

65
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:24,040
along the way, individuals, in fact, perhaps in my life and in your life, we have gotten

66
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:31,000
comfortable with the old man. We've just kind of allowed some of these things to just go.

67
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,239
We don't really think about it in the way that we should. I don't want to have any sins

68
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:46,399
that are in good standing. Amen? And I understand that sin hinders my fellowship with God. Have

69
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,559
you learned that to be the case? I believe it was John Moody. He said this. He said,

70
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:59,839
this book will keep you from sin, or sin will keep you from this book. What do you mean

71
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,079
by that? Well, as I'm in the Word of God and I'm feasting upon the Word of God and I'm

72
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:09,839
studying and I'm applying, then God's Word helps me to have victory over the old man,

73
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:17,480
over the flesh, and to sin less. Amen? But if I'm in a state of sinfulness, if I'm in

74
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,399
a state of sinning and I've gotten comfortable with it, the reality is that I don't want

75
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:27,440
to read something that's going to convict me. So therefore, sin will keep me from this

76
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,959
book. I think it was a very appropriate statement that Brother Moody made with regard to that.

77
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,399
This morning as we look at this portion of Scripture, I've simply entitled the message

78
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:43,640
from verse number 8, put off all these. I'm going to examine the list that is provided

79
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,760
here and then at the end of the message I just want to give three simple thoughts that

80
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,720
I trust will help you and help me as we seek to obey the Word of God. I believe that the

81
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,200
portion of Scripture in which we're looking at this morning has got some sister passages.

82
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,679
I'm not going to read them, but perhaps you want to jot these down in your notes. Galatians

83
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:10,679
5, verses 19-21, in that portion of Scripture, God details what the works of the flesh are.

84
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:16,440
They're manifested in this way, and you find a long, detailed list of how the works of

85
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,839
the flesh are manifested, and you'll see that in Galatians 5, verses 19-21. But then also

86
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:30,640
in Ephesians chapter number 4, verses 17-32. In Ephesians 4, verses 17-32, again Paul will

87
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:37,840
use the same terminology, similar terminology, as he uses here in Galatians, Colossians 3,

88
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:43,760
with regard to put off and put on. And that passage of Scripture would be a great help

89
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,520
to you. I believe that as we think about this passage that is before us and those sister

90
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,919
passages that I mentioned before just a moment ago, I believe that really this is the outworking

91
00:08:54,919 --> 00:09:00,599
of the truth that Peter gives in 1 Peter chapter number 1. If you want to hold your place

92
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:06,000
there in Colossians, let me just read a few verses to you in 1 Peter chapter number 1,

93
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,599
and then we'll jump right back over there to Colossians chapter number 3 and deal with

94
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:16,640
this portion of Scripture. We find here that in 1 Peter chapter number 1, in verse number

95
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,400
13, notice what Peter says,

96
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:25,440
Wherefore, gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace

97
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,320
that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. Notice this, as obedient

98
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:40,799
children, and then notice this phrase, not fashioning yourselves according to the former

99
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:48,359
lusts in your ignorance. And not to behave like I used to behave, right? We sing the

100
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:51,760
song with the kids, the things I used to do, I don't do them anymore. The place I used

101
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,760
to go, I don't go there anymore. All of that, we go through that. Why? Because there's been

102
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,280
a great change since I've been born again.

103
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,600
It's easy for us to sing it.

104
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,160
It's an entirely different thing for us to live it.

105
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
Amen?

106
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,960
So he says, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust and your ignorance, but

107
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,320
as He which hath called you is holy.

108
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,360
Aren't you thankful that God is holy?

109
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,780
The psalmist says that we're to give thanks, the remembrance of His holiness, and we serve

110
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:25,320
a God that is holy, holy, holy.

111
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,560
And the Bible says that as He which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of

112
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,040
conversation because it is written, be holy for I am holy.

113
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,680
Again, in this portion of Scripture in Colossians 3, even as we noted last week in verses 5

114
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:48,340
through 7, again in verses 8 and 9, we will find that Paul will continue to be very direct

115
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,560
and very detailed.

116
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,560
Notice the list with me, if you will.

117
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,240
Beginning in Colossians 3 and verse number 8, the Bible says this, but now ye also put

118
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:08,880
off all these, anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.

119
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:17,080
Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds.

120
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,200
Put off all these.

121
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,040
Let's look at the list that is provided to us, the detail.

122
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,760
Of course, he was direct in saying, put off all these.

123
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,520
He's detailed in providing us with this list.

124
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,480
Notice number one that is given to us in verse number 8, anger, anger.

125
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,000
Anger can be defined as an agitation of the soul.

126
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,360
Anger is an emotion that we each deal with, amen?

127
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,400
Anger is something that we deal with that we can, the Bible tells us in Ephesians 4,

128
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,040
be angry and sin not, amen?

129
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,080
God created us as emotional people and we have emotions.

130
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,920
By the way, there are some things that ought to cause us to have a holy anger, that ought

131
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:03,080
to cause us to have a holy indignation for sin and for wickedness and so on and so forth,

132
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,080
but that's not what Paul is dealing with here in this portion of Scripture.

133
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,600
In fact, as we would think about the anger that is mentioned in verse number 8 and then

134
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,400
note the next few words that are provided to us, we find that he's dealing with an anger

135
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:23,120
that is not a holy anger, but is an inappropriate anger, an anger in which we're giving place

136
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,640
to our own flesh, an anger in which even in that portion of Scripture in Ephesians 4,

137
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:34,960
when God tells the believers in Ephesus, be angry and sin not, and then he says, let not

138
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:42,420
the sun go down upon your wrath, neither give place to the devil.

139
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:47,900
You know, the reality is that we can have this agitation of the soul, we can have this

140
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:55,940
anger that when not handled properly leads us down a terrible path of digression.

141
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,980
It really is not progression, because it's not getting any better, but it's a digression.

142
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,260
It is something that will cause us to have regrets.

143
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,460
Have you ever been angry and you've said something that you regret?

144
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,580
You've done something that you regret?

145
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,980
And maybe you say something like this, man, the anger got the better part of me.

146
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,020
I mean, I just, I don't know what happened, I just got so angry in that moment.

147
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,220
It's an emotion.

148
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:27,700
It's this agitation of the soul, and I believe that it's an emotion that can be very dangerous,

149
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,860
and it's an emotion that we must hold in check.

150
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,740
Again, there's some things that we ought to be angry about.

151
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,740
But oftentimes that's not the problem for God's people.

152
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,740
Amen?

153
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,060
It really isn't the problem.

154
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,900
That's not what Paul's dealing with here.

155
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,620
We note that because of the progression that is listed here in these words.

156
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,660
Notice he says next, number two, wrath, wrath.

157
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:56,460
The word wrath carries with it the idea of violent or passionate anger.

158
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,140
It's really the idea of someone losing their temper.

159
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,620
Really the idea of wrath is the effects of anger.

160
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,660
It's fierceness, it's indignation.

161
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:13,300
And no doubt we have observed someone that has had a meltdown, maybe we'd call it, but

162
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,420
they've lost their temper.

163
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:21,060
And they have just absolutely had this violent or passionate anger.

164
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:27,700
This emotion that is mentioned first, anger, leads to wrath if not held in check, if not

165
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,060
dealt with properly.

166
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:35,260
And we find this wrath, listen, it ought not be said of us as the people of God that we

167
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,500
are angry people, that we are wrathful people.

168
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,980
We ought not lose our temper.

169
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,400
We ought to not give place to the enemy.

170
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,140
We ought not to be in a place where we just kind of excuse it.

171
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,660
And I'll get to some of that in just a moment.

172
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:53,260
But the reality this morning is that this wrath, again, as I mentioned, a digression

173
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:58,340
that is mentioned, and really as we follow these phrases, this digression from anger

174
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,300
to wrath, and then we see malice.

175
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,180
Malice, again, in verse number 8, he says,

176
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:10,400
But now ye also put off all these anger, wrath, malice.

177
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:16,180
So anger that's not properly dealt with can turn to wrath, that loss of temper, the effects

178
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:22,060
of anger, the violent or passionate outrage, if you will, that then leads to malice, which

179
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,220
really is revenge or spite.

180
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,780
Malice is bitterness toward someone else.

181
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,220
It's ill will towards another individual.

182
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:38,980
As we think about this ill will, this bitterness towards someone, this revenge, this spite,

183
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:45,380
and you can find that there are people, unfortunately, in our world, and perhaps we think about our

184
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,940
old nature and our old man, and that's why we need to put these things off, because some

185
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:54,300
of us have dealt with some of these emotions.

186
00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:00,940
Some of us know the terrible effects of these things.

187
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,380
To have ill will towards someone, to have bitterness toward another.

188
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:11,420
Someone appropriately said this about bitterness, that it destroys the vessel within its held

189
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,660
more than the vessel in which it's poured.

190
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,140
And there's so much truth to that.

191
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:21,260
Listen, we need to be careful not to get to this place of malice in our lives.

192
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:26,380
Other accounts I've heard evangelists, in fact, Brother Mershon told a story, I believe

193
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,820
it was the last time he was here, of a church in which he preached in, and he went to this

194
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,820
church.

195
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,940
It had been a number of years since he had been there, but it was a church that he was

196
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,860
familiar with, and he went to that particular church to have a revival meeting, and as he

197
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:42,980
went in, he noticed that there was just a feeling in that place of just something just

198
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,780
not being right.

199
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:49,900
And he found out through the time that he was there that there were some folks in the

200
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:56,780
church that had such just animosity one for another that best could be described as malice,

201
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:01,020
that for years they went to the same church and would not even communicate with one another.

202
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,380
I mean, had ill will towards one another.

203
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,380
Those things ought not be.

204
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:12,300
I'm glad that he testified that in that meeting that those men got right with God.

205
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,020
They got it right with God.

206
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:21,700
We find that he then deals with number four in this list, anger, wrath, malice.

207
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,700
Notice blasphemy.

208
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:27,220
Often, when we think about the word blasphemy, we're familiar with the idea of the blasphemy

209
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,860
of the Holy Spirit, the blasphemy of the Lord, but really this word in its basest sense,

210
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,540
and not being connected to the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit, just in its basest sense

211
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:42,300
that is given here in verse number eight, really carries with it the idea of slander.

212
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,580
Speaking ill towards someone else.

213
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,700
In other words, tearing someone down with our words.

214
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,260
Now do you see how this is digressing?

215
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,260
Do you see what happens?

216
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,260
We have anger.

217
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,900
We have this agitation of the soul.

218
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,900
Something happens.

219
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,020
Someone wrongs us.

220
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,420
Someone says something and it just doesn't sit well with us and we don't deal with it.

221
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:07,540
And after we don't deal with it, it just continues to agitate us and it continues to simmer and

222
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,980
kind of build up.

223
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,620
As that builds up, eventually, it's going to overflow, right?

224
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,340
It's just what's going to happen because we're not dealing with it properly and we're allowing

225
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,340
it to simmer.

226
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,940
Remember Haman, he had a great hatred for Mordecai, did he not?

227
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,180
What was the hatred about?

228
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,140
Because Mordecai wouldn't stand up and give him respect.

229
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:33,700
And it led to the place in which not only did Haman desire to kill Mordecai, but we

230
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:39,940
see that it absolutely consumed everything about that man, did it not?

231
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,580
You read the book of Esther and you find that in that book of Esther that Haman, though

232
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:49,380
he was rejoicing greatly because he was invited to a banquet with the queen and it was just

233
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:55,060
going to be he and the king and the queen and he was up on a high place in his life,

234
00:18:55,060 --> 00:19:00,100
but he left the place and he saw Mordecai and Mordecai didn't stand.

235
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:08,100
And immediately that joy that he had was just anger, bitterness consumed him.

236
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,420
Eventually it destroyed him, did it not?

237
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:17,300
We find that for us, that anger, it just begins to simmer and we don't deal with it.

238
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,720
We don't deal with it properly.

239
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,540
We don't crucify the old man.

240
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:25,640
We don't come to the place where you say, listen, it's okay for someone to offend me.

241
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,420
It's okay for someone to do something ill towards me.

242
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:34,180
I'm not going to allow myself to get in the flesh and to respond in like kind.

243
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,180
Amen?

244
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:44,660
Because I'd rather have the joy of the Lord and I'd rather have the sweet fellowship with God.

245
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:50,800
And we find that that wrath then leaves to malice where we have that bitterness and that

246
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,800
ill will.

247
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:57,120
And when that person deals with a difficulty inside, maybe not outwardly, but we begin

248
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,280
to have a rejoicing, if you will.

249
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,620
that they're dealing with some kind of hardship

250
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,920
and some kind of difficulty.

251
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,080
Why? Because I have ill will toward them.

252
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,320
I have malice in my heart.

253
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,640
And I'm to a place where I can't rejoice

254
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,120
with them that rejoice.

255
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,880
No, rather, I look at something

256
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,480
that's happened in their life

257
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,640
that's been a tragic situation,

258
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,920
a bad situation,

259
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,720
and it causes me to have some level

260
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,820
of just gratification.

261
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,520
Man, that's not the way it's supposed to be

262
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,220
as a believer. Amen?

263
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,280
And then it leads to blasphemy.

264
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,260
Slander.

265
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,940
Tearing someone down with our words.

266
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,340
Speaking ill of another.

267
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,280
Where we have such,

268
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,180
this anger has gone unchecked

269
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,300
that it's resulted in wrath and malice

270
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,260
that now at the opportunity

271
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,700
that would be afforded me,

272
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,300
when that person's name comes up,

273
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,820
I may make a comment or two

274
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,240
that's a negative comment,

275
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,460
something that's not even based in full truth,

276
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,240
but just because I have such hatred

277
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,040
and wrath and malice.

278
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,760
It's a terrible digression.

279
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,400
Listen, Paul understood that our flesh is dangerous.

280
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,480
Amen?

281
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,560
Our flesh is dangerous.

282
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,540
So he's direct.

283
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,200
And he's detailed.

284
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,240
And he says, listen,

285
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,200
there's some things that as the people of God,

286
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,240
yes, he dealt with fornication

287
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,700
and uncleanness and inordinate affection

288
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,180
and evil concupiscence and covetousness

289
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,260
in verse number five,

290
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,580
but now he comes and he starts dealing

291
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,220
with anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy.

292
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,160
Number five, filthy communication.

293
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,900
Filthy communication.

294
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,420
Foul speaking.

295
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,360
Low and obscene speech.

296
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,400
One of the parts of that song

297
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,680
that we sing with the children

298
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,680
are the things I used to say,

299
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,160
I don't say them anymore.

300
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,540
We all know that there are some words

301
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,580
that we ought not say.

302
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,300
We ought to set a gate before our mouth.

303
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,540
Amen?

304
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,700
Listen, there's some things,

305
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,780
and it's important that we understand.

306
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,860
Listen, the reality is that there are times

307
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,440
in which depending on where you are in life

308
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,020
and what your work condition is

309
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,000
and so on and so forth,

310
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,940
that you're gonna hear that stuff.

311
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,380
And it would be acceptable, if you will,

312
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,100
for you to speak in like manner.

313
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,700
I remember when I worked in the corporate world

314
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,040
and I'm not suggesting that everybody

315
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,760
has the ability to do this.

316
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,640
But I remember when I worked in the corporate world,

317
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,280
every once in a while I'd get into a meeting,

318
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,440
every once in a while I'd have someone

319
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,760
call me on the phone and they would just

320
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,580
go into a list of all sorts of profanity.

321
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,280
And I would simply say this,

322
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
if that's how you're gonna speak,

323
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,120
I'm gonna leave.

324
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,280
I'm not gonna listen to it.

325
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,160
I don't wanna speak it,

326
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,800
but I don't wanna hear it either.

327
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,400
I understand that not everybody has

328
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,740
that ability to do that sort of thing.

329
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,360
To be able to remove ourselves.

330
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,880
But the reality is that it ought not ever

331
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,800
been said of us that we speak in that fashion.

332
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,920
I remember a situation,

333
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,000
it was a really, really difficult situation

334
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,280
that we're dealing with at Sikorsky.

335
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,720
It was a very high level.

336
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,580
I mean, the guys at corporate were involved

337
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,360
and it was just a bad situation

338
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,240
and they were just casting the blame.

339
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,520
You know how people like to blame other people?

340
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,400
No one will take the responsibility.

341
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,820
And so eventually,

342
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,500
after everyone dealt with the situation,

343
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,520
the blame came to me.

344
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,360
It was my fault.

345
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,180
Now, it wasn't my fault.

346
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,580
Now, there are certain things that I did

347
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,460
that were my fault,

348
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,100
but in this particular situation,

349
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,900
it wasn't my fault.

350
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,340
And so we had to have conversations,

351
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,660
meetings, and so on and so forth.

352
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,580
And someone said this.

353
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:47,540
They said because of the intensity of the meeting,

354
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,100
they said to another coworker,

355
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,240
you better put on your seatbelt

356
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,840
because we might hear him curse for the first time.

357
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,120
But they didn't.

358
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,360
They didn't.

359
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,360
Why?

360
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,360
Because it's not necessary to speak that way.

361
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,700
It's not necessary to speak that way.

362
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,540
I've said to people,

363
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,860
if those are the only adjectives that you know,

364
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,640
you need to get a better vocabulary.

365
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,960
Amen?

366
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,800
Because there's some people

367
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,920
that have very few adjectives that they know

368
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,720
and they're all bad.

369
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,040
Let's just be real this morning, amen?

370
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,700
Listen, when it says here this filthy communication,

371
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,800
listen, it ought not be that we speak

372
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,020
like we used to speak

373
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,640
or that we speak like a lost person speaks.

374
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,060
We find here that he says,

375
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,900
filthy communication out of your mouth.

376
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,740
Put it off.

377
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,260
All of these, anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy,

378
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,060
filthy communication out of your mouth.

379
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,140
You know what's interesting to me

380
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,900
is when you think about this filthy communication

381
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,560
that's listed at the end of verse number eight,

382
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,420
you know sometimes what leads us to saying things

383
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,660
we ought not say?

384
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,400
Anger, right?

385
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,560
You see the digression that's listed here.

386
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,900
And we find, listen, Paul says this

387
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,080
to the believers in Ephesus in Ephesians 4.

388
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,920
You don't need to turn there,

389
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,400
but in verse 29 he says,

390
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,560
let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth,

391
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,280
but that which is good to the use of edifying

392
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,180
that it may minister grace unto the hearers.

393
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,640
The book of Proverbs says much about our speech.

394
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,320
The reality is that with your tongue and with my tongue,

395
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,560
with the words that we speak,

396
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,180
we can tear down or we can build up.

397
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,580
Turn over to the book of James if you will,

398
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,420
just for a moment.

399
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,660
Keep your hand here in Colossians,

400
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,060
but look at the book of James.

401
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,740
We know that it's in this book as well

402
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,740
that God deals much with the tongue.

403
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,740
I want to draw your attention to James chapter number three.

404
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,100
There's much that could be said from the book of James,

405
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,340
many verses that we could read,

406
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,380
but we're just going to read a few

407
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,220
to prove the point this morning and then move on.

408
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,560
But notice in verse number 10 of James three,

409
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,480
notice what the Bible says,

410
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,480
out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing.

411
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,120
Now notice the next phrase.

412
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,120
My brethren, these things ought not so to be.

413
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,980
My brethren, these things ought not so to be.

414
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,720
What is it that he's referring to?

415
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,400
That out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing.

416
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,520
Notice in verse number 11, he uses an analogy.

417
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,460
He says, doth a fountain send forth

418
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,100
at the same place sweet water and bitter?

419
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,020
Another illustration, verse 12,

420
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,140
can the fig tree, my brethren,

421
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,300
bear olive berries, either a vine, figs?

422
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,940
So can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.

423
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,980
Listen, our speech is important.

424
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,720
And here, Paul says that we need to put off

425
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,760
this filthy communication,

426
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,480
this foul speaking, low and obscene speech.

427
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,960
Listen, it's not right for believers

428
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,740
to tell off-color jokes.

429
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,720
Amen?

430
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,920
You know what an off-color joke is?

431
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,080
If you don't, praise God, you don't know.

432
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,960
But for most of us in the room this morning,

433
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,240
we know what an off-color joke is.

434
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,940
Can I tell you that we ought not be sharing those?

435
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,720
We ought not be speaking those.

436
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,160
That's the flash.

437
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,000
That's the old man.

438
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,080
We're to put off all these.

439
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,140
Notice verse number nine.

440
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,120
Number six, if you're looking at the details

441
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,560
that are provided, anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy,

442
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,780
filthy communication, and then,

443
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,900
verse number nine, I've just said lying

444
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,860
because he says this, lie not one to another.

445
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,660
Lie not one to another.

446
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,340
We know what it is to lie.

447
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,060
Children know what it is to lie.

448
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,420
There's some children down in the nursery

449
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,940
that yet can't do a whole lot of things,

450
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,940
but they know how to lie.

451
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,780
Right?

452
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,060
It's part of the old man.

453
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,900
The devil is a liar and the father of it.

454
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,260
John 8, verse 44.

455
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,420
The ninth commandment,

456
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,980
bear ye not false witness.

457
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,880
Right?

458
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,460
Stop lying.

459
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,900
You know what's interesting about lying?

460
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,880
For some reason in our culture today,

461
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,800
in our society today,

462
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,160
there's not really been a premium set on truth.

463
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,680
And lying is just something that has just become

464
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,380
so common in our society.

465
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,440
You know the reality is that there are times

466
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,680
in which you're hearing something,

467
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,920
you're listening to something,

468
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,760
and as you're listening and hearing it,

469
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,000
you expect that you're being lied to.

470
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,380
You know you're being lied to.

471
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,220
Right?

472
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,480
We hear it all the time.

473
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,640
Brother Mark hears it, I'm sure.

474
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,920
He doesn't pull as many people over as he used to,

475
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,760
but I'm sure.

476
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,080
You know, how many of you ever got pulled over

477
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,920
and the police officer said,

478
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,760
do you know why I pulled you over?

479
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,960
You say, I have no idea.

480
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,320
But you knew exactly why you got pulled over.

481
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,600
Right?

482
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,920
I remember somebody saying this when they got pulled over

483
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,320
and they were asked, do you know why I pulled you over?

484
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,160
And they said, well,

485
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,320
it depends how long you've been following me.

486
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,600
Where shall I start?

487
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,520
There's some honesty, right?

488
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,080
But listen, we live in a place in which a time,

489
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,560
for some reason in our culture,

490
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,080
that truth-telling is just not as important as it once was.

491
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,400
Can I tell you as the believers

492
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,360
that we can't be influenced by our culture?

493
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,440
I understand our culture's trying to influence us,

494
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,040
but it has always been the plan of God,

495
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,480
that the church of God influenced the culture,

496
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,640
not the other way around.

497
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,560
We're to be truth-tellers.

498
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,320
We're to speak the truth.

499
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,940
I use another illustration

500
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,980
from my days working in the corporate world.

501
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,540
And it's good to be,

502
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,700
I'm not trying to pat myself on the back.

503
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,660
I'm just trying to be transparent with you.

504
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,140
This morning, it's good to be known

505
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,700
as someone that tells the truth.

506
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,700
I bought a piece of equipment while I worked at Sikorsky

507
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,740
and it was just, had purchased it over the weekend.

508
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:01,420
As we were talking on Monday, someone asked me about the weekend,

509
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,780
what did you do, so on and so forth.

510
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,300
And I told him I got a great deal on this piece of workout equipment.

511
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,820
And I was really excited about it.

512
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,380
I didn't use it a whole lot, but I did get a great deal on it.

513
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,100
And I got a great deal on this piece of workout equipment.

514
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,820
And he began to inquire because he said, man, I've been looking for one of those as well.

515
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,580
And it was a treadmill.

516
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,860
I had purchased it from Sears.

517
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,140
You know, Sears used to exist.

518
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,740
Hard to find them now.

519
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,700
But I purchased it from Sears, a great deal.

520
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:29,180
And I shared it with the individual, gave him the model number, so on and so forth.

521
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,940
And that night, that co-worker went to Sears to buy one.

522
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,380
The price was several hundred dollars more than what I paid on Saturday.

523
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:44,220
And so the co-worker says to the person at the counter, he's like, but I got a friend,

524
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,620
a co-worker that, man, he said he bought it for this much.

525
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,540
And they said, well, he's not telling you the truth.

526
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,540
Now, I didn't know this guy that well.

527
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,580
We were just co-workers.

528
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,660
And here's what he said.

529
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,660
On my behalf to the worker at Sears, he said, no, no, you don't understand.

530
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,700
This guy tells the truth.

531
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,420
He came back to work Tuesday morning, told me what happened.

532
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,700
I said, I'll give you the receipt if you want it.

533
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,900
He said, I don't need the receipt.

534
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,740
He just believed me.

535
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,940
I would have given him the receipt happily.

536
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,100
Why?

537
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,700
Because I wasn't lying to him.

538
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,620
There was no reason.

539
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,300
There was no motivation for me to lie.

540
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:23,900
And so we find that here, as we think about this lying, deliberate falsehoods,

541
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,820
a misrepresentation of the truth.

542
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,740
Think of this in Proverbs chapter 6.

543
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,460
We won't take time to turn there because I want to look at Acts 5.

544
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,420
But in Proverbs chapter 6 and verses 16 through 19,

545
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:37,500
God gives us things that are an abomination, things that he hates.

546
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,580
And you know that lying falls on that list twice out of seven items.

547
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,900
Lying is on the list twice.

548
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,140
Listen, God is serious about telling the truth.

549
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,020
Amen.

550
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:54,220
He is the way, the truth, and the life.

551
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:59,340
And so how best for us as the people of God to represent God is by speaking truth.

552
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:04,140
You know, the reality is that we ought to be so willing to share the truth and speak the truth,

553
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,820
that even if it is going to result in our own harm,

554
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,260
in our own difficulty,

555
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,620
where we're going to face some level of punishment,

556
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:18,060
we're going to face some level of negative recourse,

557
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,340
to speak the truth.

558
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,020
To speak the truth.

559
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,460
Why is it that the child lies?

560
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,940
Because he wants to avoid whatever the consequences are.

561
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,660
So why is it that we as adults lie?

562
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,820
Because we want to avoid whatever the consequence is.

563
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,900
He says, put it off.

564
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,020
Put off all these.

565
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,460
Notice in Acts chapter number 5,

566
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,980
we're familiar with the passage of Scripture,

567
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,220
but I want to take time to read it this morning.

568
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,660
And I want you to think about this.

569
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,220
Many times we think about this particular section of Acts,

570
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,060
and we think about all that's taking place,

571
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,620
and we think about the moving of God.

572
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:55,340
And, you know, the reality is that God is not working,

573
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,500
dealing with sin in this same fashion today.

574
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,700
But I wonder if he did,

575
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,820
what kind of an effect it would have upon us as the people of God.

576
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,980
In Acts 5, the Bible tells us of a particular account.

577
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,180
It says this in verse number 1,

578
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,660
but a certain man named Ananias with Sapphira, his wife,

579
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,180
sold a possession and kept back part of the price.

580
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,540
His wife also being privy to it,

581
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,180
and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles' feet.

582
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,300
But Peter said, Ananias,

583
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,500
why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost

584
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,380
and to keep back part of the price of the land?

585
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,260
Notice in verse number 4, it says this,

586
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,060
whilst it remained, was it not thine own?

587
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,540
And after it was sold, was it not in thine own power?

588
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,700
So you understand that it was not some requirement

589
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,540
that was placed upon Ananias and Sapphira,

590
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,860
that number one, they even sell the possession,

591
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,020
but number two, after they sold the possession,

592
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,140
there was no requirement that they give all to the church.

593
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,180
What was it that would motivate them to say we've brought it all?

594
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,780
Well, man, they're going to look good, aren't they?

595
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,140
It's pride.

596
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,100
It's look at us, man, we sold this possession

597
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,500
and we've brought all of it.

598
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,860
Peter says, why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart?

599
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,300
Notice, thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.

600
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:21,900
And Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and gave up the ghost.

601
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,340
It means he died.

602
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:24,940
He was smitten.

603
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,160
He died.

604
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,860
It says, great fear came on all them that heard these things.

605
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,740
Would it not bring great fear to you as well?

606
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,360
Right?

607
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,900
What happened to Ananias?

608
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,860
He lied.

609
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,500
He lied?

610
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,500
And he died?

611
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:44,720
Yeah.

612
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,160
Yeah.

613
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,620
Listen, sin is serious.

614
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,060
And there are times in our lives in which we experience

615
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,060
the long-suffering of God and we mistake that with God being okay with it.

616
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,140
God is never okay with sin, not even lying.

617
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:00,700
You know what we do?

618
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,140
We say, it was just a little white lie.

619
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,600
No, no.

620
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:04,940
Call it what it is.

621
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,300
Amen?

622
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,740
That just tries to make us feel better about what we did and what we said.

623
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:15,180
Notice verse 6, and the young man arose, wound him up, and carried him out and buried him.

624
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,900
It was about the space of three hours after when his wife, not knowing what was done,

625
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,380
came in.

626
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:24,300
And Peter answered, said unto her, tell me whether you sold the land for so much.

627
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,020
And she said, yea, for so much.

628
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,500
She didn't know what happened to her husband.

629
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:34,620
Then Peter said unto her, verse 9, how is it that you've agreed together to tempt the

630
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,420
spirit of the Lord?

631
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,980
Behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry

632
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,780
thee out.

633
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,820
Then fell she down, straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost.

634
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:49,020
And the young man came in and found her dead, and carrying her forth, buried her by her

635
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,500
husband.

636
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:55,100
And notice the result in verse number 11, great fear came upon all the church and upon

637
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,540
as many as heard these things.

638
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:07,420
See, sometimes we don't see the justice and judgment of God, and we think we've gotten

639
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,460
away with something.

640
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,980
We think that God's okay with something.

641
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:16,620
We think, as G. Campbell Morgan said, that these are sins in good standing.

642
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:20,380
That we really don't think about them too much because it's just become common practice.

643
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,820
We've gotten comfortable with the old man.

644
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:24,540
We've gotten comfortable behaving in this manner.

645
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,300
It no longer grieves us.

646
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,820
It no longer convicts us because we've just gotten used to it.

647
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,980
And Paul says, put off all these.

648
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,380
Now, I told you that we'd go through the list, and I want to give you three thoughts

649
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,740
for consideration this morning.

650
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:45,100
Three thoughts for consideration as we consider these particular items that are listed in

651
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,660
Colossians chapter number three.

652
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:51,900
And of course, we took into consideration what was mentioned last week in verse five.

653
00:36:51,900 --> 00:37:00,300
And now as we look at the verse in eight and nine, number one, learn to identify sin

654
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,020
in your life.

655
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,220
Learn to identify sin in your life.

656
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:09,260
You know that I did not say learn to identify sin in someone else's life.

657
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,380
It's easy for us to identify sin in somebody else's life.

658
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,060
How many of you like it when somebody lies to you?

659
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:17,820
Anyone?

660
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,540
No, we don't like it when somebody lies to us.

661
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,860
It bothers us.

662
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:29,340
In fact, if we just see someone lying to somebody else, it can bother us, right?

663
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,580
But yet, for some reason, I can lie to someone and it never even bothers me.

664
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:39,340
You know the beam and moat truth that Jesus gave, right?

665
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:44,860
We need to learn to identify sin in our lives personally.

666
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,100
Can I tell you this, give you a secret?

667
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:51,340
The Word of God, the Bible, will help you to identify sin.

668
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,100
It will.

669
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,020
As you dig into the Word of God and you read.

670
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,820
And listen, I understand that there's times that, well, I don't want to read all of that

671
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,660
about don't do these things and so on and so forth.

672
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:07,180
But that's what teaches us what doesn't please God.

673
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:12,540
You know, there are people in blindness and darkness all around the world today that have

674
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:19,420
absolutely no idea what God's Word says with regard to what pleases Him and what displeases

675
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:19,660
Him.

676
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,820
You know that we can look at various countries around the world.

677
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,820
We could speak to some of our missionaries today and speak to them about some of the

678
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,180
experiences that they've had.

679
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:33,020
And we can look at some people that behave in certain manners.

680
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,060
And we could look at them and say, why would they do that?

681
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,980
I mean, that's crazy that they would behave that way.

682
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,940
You know why they do that?

683
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,620
They don't have this book.

684
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,700
They don't know the truth.

685
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,060
The truth has not yet set them free.

686
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:54,140
And so when we dig into the Word of God and we have that proper relationship with God

687
00:38:54,140 --> 00:39:00,140
and His Word, it is through that relationship that God will help us in our lives to identify

688
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,820
sin in our lives.

689
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,740
And we need to learn to identify sin in our lives.

690
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:12,860
Number two, we need to refuse to excuse sin in our lives.

691
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:20,060
Just make a decision that we're going to refuse to excuse sin in our lives.

692
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,820
You know that it's easy to excuse sin?

693
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:31,420
I mean, in the old man, right, the flesh, it is easy for us to excuse sin.

694
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:39,900
And in fact, unfortunately, sometimes we can get good at it of excusing sin.

695
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,020
Why did you do that?

696
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,980
Well, I wouldn't have done that if they didn't do this and dah, dah, dah, dah, right?

697
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,620
I knew someone many years ago who was in Pennsylvania.

698
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,260
And I lived there a number of years.

699
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,460
We were there for about 10 years.

700
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,380
And so it was someone that I knew in Pennsylvania.

701
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,300
And they had a real problem with anger.

702
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,580
I mean, just.

703
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:05,740
really with wrath, with just losing their temper. You know what they did? I mean, 99%

704
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:14,340
of the time, they said, well, it's just common for my ethnicity to behave that way. I just

705
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:21,180
have a violent temper. It's just what we are. You know what that is? That's an excuse for

706
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:29,900
sin. And kindly, graciously, what I tried to tell that individual was, yes, that's your

707
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:39,540
nationality, but in Christ, we're a new creature, right? See, they didn't like that whole in

708
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:45,540
Christ, I'm a new creature because they liked being able to excuse their sin. They enjoyed

709
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:52,900
being able to excuse their wrath and their losing their temper on, this is my nationality,

710
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:59,700
and this is just common for us. It's possible that we just, well, if you'd stop pushing

711
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:07,460
my buttons, I wouldn't, you understand, the context of anger and wrath and malice. When

712
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:11,620
we apologize, have you ever heard somebody apologize to someone and say, I'm sorry, but

713
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:15,140
if you wouldn't have done blah, blah, blah, blah, then I wouldn't have, is that an apology?

714
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:19,860
Is it not an apology? It's always confusing, right? And so what I'm saying this morning

715
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:25,180
is that when we learn to identify sin in our lives, then we need to, number two, refuse

716
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:31,840
to excuse sin in our lives. There's no excuse for this. There's no justification for this.

717
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:36,060
This is a time in which I gave place to my flesh, that I walked in the flesh as opposed

718
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:42,580
to the spirit, and then we come to number three of these three thoughts for consideration

719
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:50,380
is that we then determine to confess and forsake sin in our lives. You know, it is an absolute

720
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:58,220
joy to know that we have the promise of forgiveness. Amen? 1 John 1 and verse number 9. If we confess

721
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:04,980
our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

722
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,820
You read the Old Testament and you find that some of the attributes that are revealed to

723
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,860
us of God in the Old Testament, the Bible tells us that he's gracious and merciful and

724
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:18,340
we can enjoy and appreciate those attributes. But the Bible says this with regard to forgiveness,

725
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:23,820
with thee is forgiveness, but then the Bible tells us that our God is ready to pardon.

726
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:30,740
He is ready to forgive. Listen, there are times in which we cover, we seek to cover

727
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:36,500
our sin. Do you understand that he that covereth his sin shall not prosper? It's what the

728
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:43,780
Word of God says. And so when we've learned to identify sin and we refuse to excuse sin,

729
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:49,060
then we come to the place where we confess and forsake that sin and we have that forgiveness

730
00:42:49,060 --> 00:43:00,480
that God provides us with. This morning, is God omniscient? Does he know everything? Absolutely.

731
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,480
So when you confess your sin, does it surprise God? Or did he already know it? He already

732
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:14,440
knew it. And so you're not telling God something he doesn't already know. He knows your thoughts,

733
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:25,920
right? He knows my thoughts. Let that sink in for a second. And so why if God knows everything

734
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:34,400
and if sin hinders my fellowship with God, and if God promises to forgive, why would

735
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:45,240
we try to cover it? Because of our flesh. Why did Adam and Eve try to cover their nakedness?

736
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:54,200
They were ashamed. They tried to hide themselves, did they not? See, we can't hide from God.

737
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:59,800
Adam couldn't hide from God. When God asked Adam what happened, God already knew what

738
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:07,080
happened. It wasn't a surprise to God. So for us this morning, this idea of confession

739
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:12,920
and forsaking is so important in our lives. It's not to a point where we say, well, I

740
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:17,680
just keep doing this, I keep doing this. I'm thankful that God promises to forgive. We

741
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:25,480
forsake it. We say, God, help me to have victory over this. Give no place to the devil.

742
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:32,880
Walk in the Spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. Last week, when I preached

743
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,680
the message from verses five through seven, I titled the message, Crucify Your Flesh.

744
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,400
The reason that I titled the message that, as I told you last week, is because it's a

745
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:49,560
personal responsibility. Only you can crucify your flesh and only I can crucify my flesh.

746
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:55,000
I can't crucify your flesh and you can't crucify my flesh. It's a decision that you have to

747
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,720
make. But I've used the same idea in these three thoughts this morning that we're to

748
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:06,360
learn to identify sin in your life, personally. God, help me to, I'm not interested in trying

749
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:11,800
to worry about identifying the sin in somebody else's life. I can't do anything about that.

750
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:17,760
I want to know what's the sin in my life so that I can then refuse to make an excuse

751
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,880
for it. I understand that there are times in which it's easy for us to make excuses

752
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:30,400
and we can become good at it. But when we understand that it's costing us sweet fellowship

753
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:37,240
with our God, it's hindering that closeness with God because I'm regarding this iniquity

754
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:43,920
in my heart and it will lead me to a place where I want to confess and forsake it. I

755
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,240
don't want sin in my life. Now, the reality is that we're never going to reach a place

756
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:55,240
of sinless perfection until we get to heaven. Until this mortal shall put on immortality,

757
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:01,560
we're going to deal with sin. But we've got to deal with it. Deal with it. And so this

758
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:07,000
morning as we look at this list that is provided, again, understanding that Paul is being

759
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:15,000
direct, put off all these. He's being detailed. Anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication,

760
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,320
lie not one to another. We look at those six things and we say, listen, these are things

761
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:25,520
that ought not be present in my life, in our lives as the people of God. We need to put

762
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:31,040
off. And then we're going to look next week about how we put on because we're new creatures

763
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,160
in Christ. Old things are passed away. Behold, all things are become new. I'm not what I

764
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:40,440
used to be. I now belong to Jesus and Jesus belongs to me. The Holy Spirit of God lives

765
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:44,400
within me and he gives me the opportunity to have victory. And as I look at a list such

766
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,360
as this, I say, I want to learn. God, help me to learn to identify sin in my life. I

767
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:54,840
hope that that would be your prayer this morning as well. Help me to identify sin in my life.

768
00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:01,280
And then help me not to excuse it. Help me to confess it and forsake it, knowing that

769
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:08,400
you've promised to forgive. Put off all these. Oh, that it would not be said as G. Campbell

770
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:17,800
Morgan said that these are sins in good standing. No, they're sins and they must be dealt with.

771
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:26,440
Jesus died for sin, right? He died for sin. And sometimes we look at big sin, little sin,

772
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:38,880
we fail to recognize that the wages of sin is death and that Jesus died for sin. And

773
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:45,160
sin will hinder my fellowship with God. I've often heard people say this to me when I've

774
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:50,200
asked them if they're a sinner. I never murdered anybody. Well, I'm glad that you've not murdered

775
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:56,240
anyone. I mean, it's a really good thing. Put that at the top of your resume. Amen?

776
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:03,240
Never killed anyone. But when you drill in and drill down, have you ever lied? Well,

777
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:10,040
yeah, everybody does. I agree. All men are liars. That's what the word of God says. But

778
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:15,440
we've been born again. So these things we need to deal with. Amen? Put off all these.

779
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:22,440
Let's pray. Father, how we love you. We thank you for giving us a list such as this. We

780
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:33,240
pray that you would help us this morning to do business with you. Thank you that you're

781
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:41,720
a God that's ready to pardon and ready to forgive. Help us to identify sin in our lives.

782
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:50,160
Help us to refuse to excuse it. God, help us to confess and forsake it. That we might

783
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:57,280
have, as David said, restore unto me the joy of thy salvation. We have that clean heart.

784
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,240
Have that sweet fellowship with you again. We pray that you'd move and work in lives

785
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:08,040
this morning as only you can. We'll give you the honor and glory for all that's done. For

786
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,200
it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

787
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,840
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano. Maybe you need to visit the altar this morning.

788
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:20,440
Maybe you need to make your pew an altar this morning. Maybe you want to make a commitment

789
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:26,400
to God. As the Holy Spirit has moved in your heart and life, would you respond to the Lord

790
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:33,400
as Kimberly plays?
