WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
started last Sunday morning. Last Sunday morning we're in Colossians 3 and we're looking at

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.159
verses 5-7. This morning we'll be looking at verses 8-9 and of course as we noted last

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:18.040
week we said that Paul understood the danger of the flesh and therefore he provided the

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.440
believers in Colossians. Of course we have the word of God preserved for us this morning

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.920
and therefore for us as well with direct and detailed instruction. We find that in

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.680
this particular section that we'll begin studying this morning and really we'll look at it next

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.400
week as well, that we find that the Apostle Paul begins this section in instructing the

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:46.799
believers to put off and put on. And you'll notice the terminology that is being used

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:52.000
in the portion of Scripture and we of course would understand that Paul really is relating

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.479
to something that each of us are very familiar with. The reality is that we wear garments

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:04.360
and our garments get dirty. And when our garments get dirty, what do we do? We put them off.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.400
We take them off, they need to be laundered, they need to be cleaned, and then we put on

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.559
some clean garments. And as Paul would use that analogy if you will, something that would

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:20.480
be very familiar to us, we find that as believers we have been changed. Amen? I mean listen,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.959
we're not what we used to be. Some of y'all need to sing again this morning. Amen? Some

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:31.519
of y'all brought some burdens this morning and I hope that the Lord will help you and

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:38.519
help me. But listen, we're not the same. We're different. Amen? And we have been born again,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.279
we've been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ and we no longer are to walk in darkness

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:50.160
but we're to walk as children of the light. We're not to live under the circumstances.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.040
Amen? We're to live with our eyes upon our Savior, looking unto Jesus, the author and

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.080
finisher of our faith. And I'm so thankful that he has a plan and his plan is perfect.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.879
And I understand that we deal with difficulties and we deal with troubles and as we deal with

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:10.720
those things in life that sometimes we can get under it so to speak. I will lift up mine

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.720
eyes unto the hills. From whence cometh my help? My help cometh from the Lord, remember,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:26.240
which made heaven and earth. Is anything too hard for him? No. My problems aren't too big

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.600
for God. Your problems aren't too big for God. We find that as Paul is addressing these

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.160
believers he's saying listen, you're different now. You've been born again. Your life has

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.399
been changed. I'm thankful that the Bible says if any man be in Christ he's a new creature.

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:50.399
Amen? And what a blessing to understand all that took place at Calvary. Now as we think

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:54.800
about the fact that we no longer walk in darkness but we're to walk as children of light, we

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.720
also remember that our flesh was not eradicated at salvation. It would have been a wonderful

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.600
thing, amen? But it wasn't. And we understand that the flesh lusteth against the Spirit

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.740
and we dealt with much of that last week as we started this particular passage of Scripture

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.839
but as we think about the truth that the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, we must understand

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:24.639
this morning that we have to be proactive. We have to be proactive. Remember in verse

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:30.479
number 5 he says, mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth. Crucify your flesh

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:35.839
was the message that I preached last Sunday morning. To put to death, to deprive of power

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:40.440
and now in this particular section we find that Paul begins in verse number 8 and he

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:48.360
says this, but now ye also put off all these. Notice the end of verse number 9, seeing that

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:56.520
ye have put off the old man with his deeds. As we think about the admonition from Paul

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.279
to these believers and to us this morning, we are to mortify our members and we are to

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:09.199
put off all these. That requires some work. That requires for us to be proactive in this

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:17.480
endeavor and I'm thankful that through the help of God that we can be victorious. Listen,

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.440
you're not going to mortify your members in your own power, you're not going to put off

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.600
all these in your own power, but as you walk in the Spirit, as you rely upon the power

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.720
of the resurrected Christ, then you can mortify your members which are upon the earth, you

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.579
can put off all these, you can have victory. Aren't you thankful for that this morning?

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:42.480
We don't have to live a defeated life. Listen, I don't like to lose. Do you like to lose?

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.600
I know we're living in a weird society today where they don't want to call anyone winners

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.760
and losers. Listen, we play to win, amen? That's just what's in me. And the reality

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:58.359
is that I don't want to be defeated by the enemy. And victory is possible through the

00:04:58.359 --> 00:05:03.320
Lord Jesus Christ. As we look at this particular section this morning, remember last week I

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.720
said to you a couple of times that if you were pretty comfortable with the list that

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.959
was provided in verse number five and said, man, I dodged those bullets, that doesn't

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:15.640
apply to me, just come back this week and you came back. And that's wonderful, amen?

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.200
But the reality is that this particular portion of Scripture, some of you might be familiar

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.600
with a preacher of yesteryear, Dr. G. Campbell Morgan. And Dr. G. Campbell Morgan, as he

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.880
was referring to this portion of Scripture, he referred to the list that is mentioned

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:37.320
in verse eight and to start verse number nine this way. He said, these are the sins in good

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:45.119
standing. These are the sins in good standing. What do you mean by that? Well, these are

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:49.600
things that we really don't want to talk about a whole lot, and we've just allowed to kind

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.959
of become part of our lives. We've just become comfortable with it. They are, in his words,

00:05:56.959 --> 00:06:05.480
sins in good standing. Now, the reality is I believe somewhere, somehow, along the way,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:15.839
believers have just failed to understand the evil and wickedness of sin. And somehow, somewhere

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:24.040
along the way, individuals, in fact, perhaps in my life and in your life, we have gotten

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:31.000
comfortable with the old man. We've just kind of allowed some of these things to just go.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.239
We don't really think about it in the way that we should. I don't want to have any sins

00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:46.399
that are in good standing. Amen? And I understand that sin hinders my fellowship with God. Have

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:51.559
you learned that to be the case? I believe it was John Moody. He said this. He said,

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:59.839
this book will keep you from sin, or sin will keep you from this book. What do you mean

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:04.079
by that? Well, as I'm in the Word of God and I'm feasting upon the Word of God and I'm

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:09.839
studying and I'm applying, then God's Word helps me to have victory over the old man,

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:17.480
over the flesh, and to sin less. Amen? But if I'm in a state of sinfulness, if I'm in

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:22.399
a state of sinning and I've gotten comfortable with it, the reality is that I don't want

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:27.440
to read something that's going to convict me. So therefore, sin will keep me from this

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:33.959
book. I think it was a very appropriate statement that Brother Moody made with regard to that.

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:37.399
This morning as we look at this portion of Scripture, I've simply entitled the message

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:43.640
from verse number 8, put off all these. I'm going to examine the list that is provided

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.760
here and then at the end of the message I just want to give three simple thoughts that

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:53.720
I trust will help you and help me as we seek to obey the Word of God. I believe that the

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.200
portion of Scripture in which we're looking at this morning has got some sister passages.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.679
I'm not going to read them, but perhaps you want to jot these down in your notes. Galatians

00:08:02.679 --> 00:08:10.679
5, verses 19-21, in that portion of Scripture, God details what the works of the flesh are.

00:08:10.679 --> 00:08:16.440
They're manifested in this way, and you find a long, detailed list of how the works of

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.839
the flesh are manifested, and you'll see that in Galatians 5, verses 19-21. But then also

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:30.640
in Ephesians chapter number 4, verses 17-32. In Ephesians 4, verses 17-32, again Paul will

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:37.840
use the same terminology, similar terminology, as he uses here in Galatians, Colossians 3,

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:43.760
with regard to put off and put on. And that passage of Scripture would be a great help

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.520
to you. I believe that as we think about this passage that is before us and those sister

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:54.919
passages that I mentioned before just a moment ago, I believe that really this is the outworking

00:08:54.919 --> 00:09:00.599
of the truth that Peter gives in 1 Peter chapter number 1. If you want to hold your place

00:09:00.599 --> 00:09:06.000
there in Colossians, let me just read a few verses to you in 1 Peter chapter number 1,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.599
and then we'll jump right back over there to Colossians chapter number 3 and deal with

00:09:10.599 --> 00:09:16.640
this portion of Scripture. We find here that in 1 Peter chapter number 1, in verse number

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.400
13, notice what Peter says,

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:25.440
Wherefore, gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:31.320
that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. Notice this, as obedient

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:40.799
children, and then notice this phrase, not fashioning yourselves according to the former

00:09:40.799 --> 00:09:48.359
lusts in your ignorance. And not to behave like I used to behave, right? We sing the

00:09:48.359 --> 00:09:51.760
song with the kids, the things I used to do, I don't do them anymore. The place I used

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.760
to go, I don't go there anymore. All of that, we go through that. Why? Because there's been

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.280
a great change since I've been born again.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.600
It's easy for us to sing it.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.160
It's an entirely different thing for us to live it.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.160
Amen?

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.960
So he says, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust and your ignorance, but

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.320
as He which hath called you is holy.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.360
Aren't you thankful that God is holy?

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.780
The psalmist says that we're to give thanks, the remembrance of His holiness, and we serve

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:25.320
a God that is holy, holy, holy.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:31.560
And the Bible says that as He which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:37.040
conversation because it is written, be holy for I am holy.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.680
Again, in this portion of Scripture in Colossians 3, even as we noted last week in verses 5

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:48.340
through 7, again in verses 8 and 9, we will find that Paul will continue to be very direct

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.560
and very detailed.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.560
Notice the list with me, if you will.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.240
Beginning in Colossians 3 and verse number 8, the Bible says this, but now ye also put

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:08.880
off all these, anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:17.080
Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.200
Put off all these.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.040
Let's look at the list that is provided to us, the detail.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.760
Of course, he was direct in saying, put off all these.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.520
He's detailed in providing us with this list.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:32.480
Notice number one that is given to us in verse number 8, anger, anger.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.000
Anger can be defined as an agitation of the soul.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.360
Anger is an emotion that we each deal with, amen?

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.400
Anger is something that we deal with that we can, the Bible tells us in Ephesians 4,

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.040
be angry and sin not, amen?

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.080
God created us as emotional people and we have emotions.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.920
By the way, there are some things that ought to cause us to have a holy anger, that ought

00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:03.080
to cause us to have a holy indignation for sin and for wickedness and so on and so forth,

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.080
but that's not what Paul is dealing with here in this portion of Scripture.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.600
In fact, as we would think about the anger that is mentioned in verse number 8 and then

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.400
note the next few words that are provided to us, we find that he's dealing with an anger

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:23.120
that is not a holy anger, but is an inappropriate anger, an anger in which we're giving place

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:28.640
to our own flesh, an anger in which even in that portion of Scripture in Ephesians 4,

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:34.960
when God tells the believers in Ephesus, be angry and sin not, and then he says, let not

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:42.420
the sun go down upon your wrath, neither give place to the devil.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:47.900
You know, the reality is that we can have this agitation of the soul, we can have this

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:55.940
anger that when not handled properly leads us down a terrible path of digression.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.980
It really is not progression, because it's not getting any better, but it's a digression.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.260
It is something that will cause us to have regrets.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.460
Have you ever been angry and you've said something that you regret?

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.580
You've done something that you regret?

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.980
And maybe you say something like this, man, the anger got the better part of me.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:19.020
I mean, I just, I don't know what happened, I just got so angry in that moment.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.220
It's an emotion.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:27.700
It's this agitation of the soul, and I believe that it's an emotion that can be very dangerous,

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.860
and it's an emotion that we must hold in check.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:33.740
Again, there's some things that we ought to be angry about.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.740
But oftentimes that's not the problem for God's people.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:37.740
Amen?

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.060
It really isn't the problem.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.900
That's not what Paul's dealing with here.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.620
We note that because of the progression that is listed here in these words.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:49.660
Notice he says next, number two, wrath, wrath.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:56.460
The word wrath carries with it the idea of violent or passionate anger.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.140
It's really the idea of someone losing their temper.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.620
Really the idea of wrath is the effects of anger.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.660
It's fierceness, it's indignation.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:13.300
And no doubt we have observed someone that has had a meltdown, maybe we'd call it, but

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.420
they've lost their temper.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:21.060
And they have just absolutely had this violent or passionate anger.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:27.700
This emotion that is mentioned first, anger, leads to wrath if not held in check, if not

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.060
dealt with properly.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:35.260
And we find this wrath, listen, it ought not be said of us as the people of God that we

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.500
are angry people, that we are wrathful people.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.980
We ought not lose our temper.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.400
We ought to not give place to the enemy.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.140
We ought not to be in a place where we just kind of excuse it.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.660
And I'll get to some of that in just a moment.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:53.260
But the reality this morning is that this wrath, again, as I mentioned, a digression

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:58.340
that is mentioned, and really as we follow these phrases, this digression from anger

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.300
to wrath, and then we see malice.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.180
Malice, again, in verse number 8, he says,

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:10.400
But now ye also put off all these anger, wrath, malice.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:16.180
So anger that's not properly dealt with can turn to wrath, that loss of temper, the effects

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:22.060
of anger, the violent or passionate outrage, if you will, that then leads to malice, which

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:26.220
really is revenge or spite.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.780
Malice is bitterness toward someone else.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.220
It's ill will towards another individual.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:38.980
As we think about this ill will, this bitterness towards someone, this revenge, this spite,

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:45.380
and you can find that there are people, unfortunately, in our world, and perhaps we think about our

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:49.940
old nature and our old man, and that's why we need to put these things off, because some

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:54.300
of us have dealt with some of these emotions.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:16:00.940
Some of us know the terrible effects of these things.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:05.380
To have ill will towards someone, to have bitterness toward another.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:11.420
Someone appropriately said this about bitterness, that it destroys the vessel within its held

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.660
more than the vessel in which it's poured.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.140
And there's so much truth to that.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:21.260
Listen, we need to be careful not to get to this place of malice in our lives.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:26.380
Other accounts I've heard evangelists, in fact, Brother Mershon told a story, I believe

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.820
it was the last time he was here, of a church in which he preached in, and he went to this

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:30.820
church.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.940
It had been a number of years since he had been there, but it was a church that he was

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.860
familiar with, and he went to that particular church to have a revival meeting, and as he

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:42.980
went in, he noticed that there was just a feeling in that place of just something just

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.780
not being right.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:49.900
And he found out through the time that he was there that there were some folks in the

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:56.780
church that had such just animosity one for another that best could be described as malice,

00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:01.020
that for years they went to the same church and would not even communicate with one another.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.380
I mean, had ill will towards one another.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.380
Those things ought not be.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:12.300
I'm glad that he testified that in that meeting that those men got right with God.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.020
They got it right with God.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:21.700
We find that he then deals with number four in this list, anger, wrath, malice.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:22.700
Notice blasphemy.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:27.220
Often, when we think about the word blasphemy, we're familiar with the idea of the blasphemy

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:32.860
of the Holy Spirit, the blasphemy of the Lord, but really this word in its basest sense,

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:37.540
and not being connected to the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit, just in its basest sense

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:42.300
that is given here in verse number eight, really carries with it the idea of slander.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.580
Speaking ill towards someone else.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.700
In other words, tearing someone down with our words.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.260
Now do you see how this is digressing?

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.260
Do you see what happens?

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:52.260
We have anger.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.900
We have this agitation of the soul.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:55.900
Something happens.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.020
Someone wrongs us.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:01.420
Someone says something and it just doesn't sit well with us and we don't deal with it.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:07.540
And after we don't deal with it, it just continues to agitate us and it continues to simmer and

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:08.980
kind of build up.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:14.620
As that builds up, eventually, it's going to overflow, right?

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:18.340
It's just what's going to happen because we're not dealing with it properly and we're allowing

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:19.340
it to simmer.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.940
Remember Haman, he had a great hatred for Mordecai, did he not?

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.180
What was the hatred about?

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:28.140
Because Mordecai wouldn't stand up and give him respect.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:33.700
And it led to the place in which not only did Haman desire to kill Mordecai, but we

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:39.940
see that it absolutely consumed everything about that man, did it not?

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:44.580
You read the book of Esther and you find that in that book of Esther that Haman, though

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:49.380
he was rejoicing greatly because he was invited to a banquet with the queen and it was just

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:55.060
going to be he and the king and the queen and he was up on a high place in his life,

00:18:55.060 --> 00:19:00.100
but he left the place and he saw Mordecai and Mordecai didn't stand.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:08.100
And immediately that joy that he had was just anger, bitterness consumed him.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.420
Eventually it destroyed him, did it not?

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:17.300
We find that for us, that anger, it just begins to simmer and we don't deal with it.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.720
We don't deal with it properly.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.540
We don't crucify the old man.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:25.640
We don't come to the place where you say, listen, it's okay for someone to offend me.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.420
It's okay for someone to do something ill towards me.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:34.180
I'm not going to allow myself to get in the flesh and to respond in like kind.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.180
Amen?

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:44.660
Because I'd rather have the joy of the Lord and I'd rather have the sweet fellowship with God.

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:50.800
And we find that that wrath then leaves to malice where we have that bitterness and that

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.800
ill will.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:57.120
And when that person deals with a difficulty inside, maybe not outwardly, but we begin

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.280
to have a rejoicing, if you will.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.620
that they're dealing with some kind of hardship

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:02.920
and some kind of difficulty.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.080
Why? Because I have ill will toward them.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.320
I have malice in my heart.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.640
And I'm to a place where I can't rejoice

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.120
with them that rejoice.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.880
No, rather, I look at something

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.480
that's happened in their life

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.640
that's been a tragic situation,

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.920
a bad situation,

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.720
and it causes me to have some level

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.820
of just gratification.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.520
Man, that's not the way it's supposed to be

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.220
as a believer. Amen?

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.280
And then it leads to blasphemy.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.260
Slander.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.940
Tearing someone down with our words.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.340
Speaking ill of another.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.280
Where we have such,

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.180
this anger has gone unchecked

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.300
that it's resulted in wrath and malice

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.260
that now at the opportunity

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.700
that would be afforded me,

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.300
when that person's name comes up,

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.820
I may make a comment or two

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.240
that's a negative comment,

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.460
something that's not even based in full truth,

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.240
but just because I have such hatred

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.040
and wrath and malice.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.760
It's a terrible digression.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.400
Listen, Paul understood that our flesh is dangerous.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.480
Amen?

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.560
Our flesh is dangerous.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.540
So he's direct.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.200
And he's detailed.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.240
And he says, listen,

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.200
there's some things that as the people of God,

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.240
yes, he dealt with fornication

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.700
and uncleanness and inordinate affection

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.180
and evil concupiscence and covetousness

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.260
in verse number five,

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.580
but now he comes and he starts dealing

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.220
with anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.160
Number five, filthy communication.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.900
Filthy communication.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.420
Foul speaking.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:47.360
Low and obscene speech.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.400
One of the parts of that song

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.680
that we sing with the children

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.680
are the things I used to say,

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.160
I don't say them anymore.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.540
We all know that there are some words

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.580
that we ought not say.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.300
We ought to set a gate before our mouth.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.540
Amen?

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:04.700
Listen, there's some things,

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.780
and it's important that we understand.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.860
Listen, the reality is that there are times

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.440
in which depending on where you are in life

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.020
and what your work condition is

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:15.000
and so on and so forth,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.940
that you're gonna hear that stuff.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:20.380
And it would be acceptable, if you will,

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:23.100
for you to speak in like manner.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.700
I remember when I worked in the corporate world

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.040
and I'm not suggesting that everybody

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.760
has the ability to do this.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.640
But I remember when I worked in the corporate world,

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.280
every once in a while I'd get into a meeting,

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.440
every once in a while I'd have someone

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.760
call me on the phone and they would just

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.580
go into a list of all sorts of profanity.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.280
And I would simply say this,

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.200
if that's how you're gonna speak,

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.120
I'm gonna leave.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.280
I'm not gonna listen to it.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.160
I don't wanna speak it,

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.800
but I don't wanna hear it either.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.400
I understand that not everybody has

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.740
that ability to do that sort of thing.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.360
To be able to remove ourselves.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.880
But the reality is that it ought not ever

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.800
been said of us that we speak in that fashion.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.920
I remember a situation,

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.000
it was a really, really difficult situation

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.280
that we're dealing with at Sikorsky.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.720
It was a very high level.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.580
I mean, the guys at corporate were involved

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.360
and it was just a bad situation

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.240
and they were just casting the blame.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.520
You know how people like to blame other people?

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.400
No one will take the responsibility.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.820
And so eventually,

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.500
after everyone dealt with the situation,

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.520
the blame came to me.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.360
It was my fault.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.180
Now, it wasn't my fault.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.580
Now, there are certain things that I did

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:31.460
that were my fault,

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.100
but in this particular situation,

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.900
it wasn't my fault.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.340
And so we had to have conversations,

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.660
meetings, and so on and so forth.

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:41.580
And someone said this.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:47.540
They said because of the intensity of the meeting,

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.100
they said to another coworker,

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.240
you better put on your seatbelt

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.840
because we might hear him curse for the first time.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.120
But they didn't.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.360
They didn't.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.360
Why?

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.360
Because it's not necessary to speak that way.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.700
It's not necessary to speak that way.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:05.540
I've said to people,

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:06.860
if those are the only adjectives that you know,

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.640
you need to get a better vocabulary.

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.960
Amen?

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:11.800
Because there's some people

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.920
that have very few adjectives that they know

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.720
and they're all bad.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.040
Let's just be real this morning, amen?

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.700
Listen, when it says here this filthy communication,

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.800
listen, it ought not be that we speak

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.020
like we used to speak

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.640
or that we speak like a lost person speaks.

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.060
We find here that he says,

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.900
filthy communication out of your mouth.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:35.740
Put it off.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:38.260
All of these, anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy,

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.060
filthy communication out of your mouth.

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.140
You know what's interesting to me

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.900
is when you think about this filthy communication

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.560
that's listed at the end of verse number eight,

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.420
you know sometimes what leads us to saying things

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.660
we ought not say?

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.400
Anger, right?

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.560
You see the digression that's listed here.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.900
And we find, listen, Paul says this

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.080
to the believers in Ephesus in Ephesians 4.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:58.920
You don't need to turn there,

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.400
but in verse 29 he says,

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.560
let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth,

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.280
but that which is good to the use of edifying

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.180
that it may minister grace unto the hearers.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.640
The book of Proverbs says much about our speech.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.320
The reality is that with your tongue and with my tongue,

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.560
with the words that we speak,

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:20.180
we can tear down or we can build up.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:23.580
Turn over to the book of James if you will,

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:24.420
just for a moment.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.660
Keep your hand here in Colossians,

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.060
but look at the book of James.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.740
We know that it's in this book as well

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.740
that God deals much with the tongue.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.740
I want to draw your attention to James chapter number three.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.100
There's much that could be said from the book of James,

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.340
many verses that we could read,

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.380
but we're just going to read a few

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:44.220
to prove the point this morning and then move on.

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:47.560
But notice in verse number 10 of James three,

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.480
notice what the Bible says,

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:54.480
out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing.

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.120
Now notice the next phrase.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:02.120
My brethren, these things ought not so to be.

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:08.980
My brethren, these things ought not so to be.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.720
What is it that he's referring to?

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.400
That out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:16.520
Notice in verse number 11, he uses an analogy.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.460
He says, doth a fountain send forth

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:23.100
at the same place sweet water and bitter?

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.020
Another illustration, verse 12,

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.140
can the fig tree, my brethren,

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:32.300
bear olive berries, either a vine, figs?

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:36.940
So can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.980
Listen, our speech is important.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.720
And here, Paul says that we need to put off

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.760
this filthy communication,

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.480
this foul speaking, low and obscene speech.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.960
Listen, it's not right for believers

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.740
to tell off-color jokes.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.720
Amen?

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.920
You know what an off-color joke is?

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.080
If you don't, praise God, you don't know.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.960
But for most of us in the room this morning,

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.240
we know what an off-color joke is.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.940
Can I tell you that we ought not be sharing those?

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.720
We ought not be speaking those.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.160
That's the flash.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.000
That's the old man.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.080
We're to put off all these.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.140
Notice verse number nine.

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.120
Number six, if you're looking at the details

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.560
that are provided, anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy,

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.780
filthy communication, and then,

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.900
verse number nine, I've just said lying

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.860
because he says this, lie not one to another.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.660
Lie not one to another.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.340
We know what it is to lie.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.060
Children know what it is to lie.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.420
There's some children down in the nursery

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.940
that yet can't do a whole lot of things,

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.940
but they know how to lie.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:47.780
Right?

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:50.060
It's part of the old man.

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:54.900
The devil is a liar and the father of it.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.260
John 8, verse 44.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.420
The ninth commandment,

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:02.980
bear ye not false witness.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:03.880
Right?

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.460
Stop lying.

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.900
You know what's interesting about lying?

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.880
For some reason in our culture today,

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.800
in our society today,

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.160
there's not really been a premium set on truth.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.680
And lying is just something that has just become

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:21.380
so common in our society.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.440
You know the reality is that there are times

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.680
in which you're hearing something,

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.920
you're listening to something,

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.760
and as you're listening and hearing it,

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.000
you expect that you're being lied to.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.380
You know you're being lied to.

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:37.220
Right?

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.480
We hear it all the time.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.640
Brother Mark hears it, I'm sure.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.920
He doesn't pull as many people over as he used to,

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:43.760
but I'm sure.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.080
You know, how many of you ever got pulled over

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:45.920
and the police officer said,

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:46.760
do you know why I pulled you over?

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:47.960
You say, I have no idea.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.320
But you knew exactly why you got pulled over.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.600
Right?

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.920
I remember somebody saying this when they got pulled over

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.320
and they were asked, do you know why I pulled you over?

00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.160
And they said, well,

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.320
it depends how long you've been following me.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.600
Where shall I start?

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.520
There's some honesty, right?

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:12.080
But listen, we live in a place in which a time,

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.560
for some reason in our culture,

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:19.080
that truth-telling is just not as important as it once was.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.400
Can I tell you as the believers

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.360
that we can't be influenced by our culture?

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.440
I understand our culture's trying to influence us,

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.040
but it has always been the plan of God,

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:31.480
that the church of God influenced the culture,

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.640
not the other way around.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.560
We're to be truth-tellers.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.320
We're to speak the truth.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:38.940
I use another illustration

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:41.980
from my days working in the corporate world.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.540
And it's good to be,

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:45.700
I'm not trying to pat myself on the back.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.660
I'm just trying to be transparent with you.

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.140
This morning, it's good to be known

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.700
as someone that tells the truth.

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.700
I bought a piece of equipment while I worked at Sikorsky

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.740
and it was just, had purchased it over the weekend.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:01.420
As we were talking on Monday, someone asked me about the weekend,

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:02.780
what did you do, so on and so forth.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:06.300
And I told him I got a great deal on this piece of workout equipment.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:07.820
And I was really excited about it.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.380
I didn't use it a whole lot, but I did get a great deal on it.

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:13.100
And I got a great deal on this piece of workout equipment.

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.820
And he began to inquire because he said, man, I've been looking for one of those as well.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:17.580
And it was a treadmill.

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.860
I had purchased it from Sears.

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.140
You know, Sears used to exist.

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:21.740
Hard to find them now.

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.700
But I purchased it from Sears, a great deal.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:29.180
And I shared it with the individual, gave him the model number, so on and so forth.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:32.940
And that night, that co-worker went to Sears to buy one.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.380
The price was several hundred dollars more than what I paid on Saturday.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:44.220
And so the co-worker says to the person at the counter, he's like, but I got a friend,

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.620
a co-worker that, man, he said he bought it for this much.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:48.540
And they said, well, he's not telling you the truth.

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:52.540
Now, I didn't know this guy that well.

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:53.580
We were just co-workers.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:55.660
And here's what he said.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:59.660
On my behalf to the worker at Sears, he said, no, no, you don't understand.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.700
This guy tells the truth.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.420
He came back to work Tuesday morning, told me what happened.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:06.700
I said, I'll give you the receipt if you want it.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:07.900
He said, I don't need the receipt.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:09.740
He just believed me.

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.940
I would have given him the receipt happily.

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:13.100
Why?

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:14.700
Because I wasn't lying to him.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:16.620
There was no reason.

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.300
There was no motivation for me to lie.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:23.900
And so we find that here, as we think about this lying, deliberate falsehoods,

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.820
a misrepresentation of the truth.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.740
Think of this in Proverbs chapter 6.

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.460
We won't take time to turn there because I want to look at Acts 5.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:33.420
But in Proverbs chapter 6 and verses 16 through 19,

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:37.500
God gives us things that are an abomination, things that he hates.

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:41.580
And you know that lying falls on that list twice out of seven items.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.900
Lying is on the list twice.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.140
Listen, God is serious about telling the truth.

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:49.020
Amen.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:54.220
He is the way, the truth, and the life.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:59.340
And so how best for us as the people of God to represent God is by speaking truth.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:04.140
You know, the reality is that we ought to be so willing to share the truth and speak the truth,

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:07.820
that even if it is going to result in our own harm,

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:11.260
in our own difficulty,

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:14.620
where we're going to face some level of punishment,

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:18.060
we're going to face some level of negative recourse,

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:19.340
to speak the truth.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:21.020
To speak the truth.

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:24.460
Why is it that the child lies?

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.940
Because he wants to avoid whatever the consequences are.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.660
So why is it that we as adults lie?

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:31.820
Because we want to avoid whatever the consequence is.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:33.900
He says, put it off.

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.020
Put off all these.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.460
Notice in Acts chapter number 5,

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:37.980
we're familiar with the passage of Scripture,

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.220
but I want to take time to read it this morning.

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.660
And I want you to think about this.

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:46.220
Many times we think about this particular section of Acts,

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.060
and we think about all that's taking place,

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:50.620
and we think about the moving of God.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:55.340
And, you know, the reality is that God is not working,

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:59.500
dealing with sin in this same fashion today.

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.700
But I wonder if he did,

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.820
what kind of an effect it would have upon us as the people of God.

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.980
In Acts 5, the Bible tells us of a particular account.

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.180
It says this in verse number 1,

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.660
but a certain man named Ananias with Sapphira, his wife,

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:15.180
sold a possession and kept back part of the price.

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:18.540
His wife also being privy to it,

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:21.180
and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles' feet.

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.300
But Peter said, Ananias,

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.500
why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:30.380
and to keep back part of the price of the land?

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.260
Notice in verse number 4, it says this,

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:36.060
whilst it remained, was it not thine own?

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:38.540
And after it was sold, was it not in thine own power?

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.700
So you understand that it was not some requirement

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:44.540
that was placed upon Ananias and Sapphira,

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:46.860
that number one, they even sell the possession,

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.020
but number two, after they sold the possession,

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:52.140
there was no requirement that they give all to the church.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:57.180
What was it that would motivate them to say we've brought it all?

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:58.780
Well, man, they're going to look good, aren't they?

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.140
It's pride.

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:03.100
It's look at us, man, we sold this possession

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.500
and we've brought all of it.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.860
Peter says, why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart?

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:14.300
Notice, thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:21.900
And Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and gave up the ghost.

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:23.340
It means he died.

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:24.940
He was smitten.

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:26.160
He died.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.860
It says, great fear came on all them that heard these things.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.740
Would it not bring great fear to you as well?

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:37.360
Right?

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.900
What happened to Ananias?

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:40.860
He lied.

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:41.500
He lied?

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:43.500
And he died?

00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:44.720
Yeah.

00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:46.160
Yeah.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:48.620
Listen, sin is serious.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:52.060
And there are times in our lives in which we experience

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:56.060
the long-suffering of God and we mistake that with God being okay with it.

00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:00.140
God is never okay with sin, not even lying.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:00.700
You know what we do?

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.140
We say, it was just a little white lie.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:03.600
No, no.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:04.940
Call it what it is.

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:06.300
Amen?

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.740
That just tries to make us feel better about what we did and what we said.

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:15.180
Notice verse 6, and the young man arose, wound him up, and carried him out and buried him.

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:19.900
It was about the space of three hours after when his wife, not knowing what was done,

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:20.380
came in.

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:24.300
And Peter answered, said unto her, tell me whether you sold the land for so much.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:27.020
And she said, yea, for so much.

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:29.500
She didn't know what happened to her husband.

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:34.620
Then Peter said unto her, verse 9, how is it that you've agreed together to tempt the

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:35.420
spirit of the Lord?

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.980
Behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:40.780
thee out.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:43.820
Then fell she down, straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost.

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:49.020
And the young man came in and found her dead, and carrying her forth, buried her by her

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:49.500
husband.

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:55.100
And notice the result in verse number 11, great fear came upon all the church and upon

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.540
as many as heard these things.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:07.420
See, sometimes we don't see the justice and judgment of God, and we think we've gotten

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:08.460
away with something.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.980
We think that God's okay with something.

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:16.620
We think, as G. Campbell Morgan said, that these are sins in good standing.

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:20.380
That we really don't think about them too much because it's just become common practice.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.820
We've gotten comfortable with the old man.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:24.540
We've gotten comfortable behaving in this manner.

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.300
It no longer grieves us.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:29.820
It no longer convicts us because we've just gotten used to it.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.980
And Paul says, put off all these.

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.380
Now, I told you that we'd go through the list, and I want to give you three thoughts

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:39.740
for consideration this morning.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:45.100
Three thoughts for consideration as we consider these particular items that are listed in

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.660
Colossians chapter number three.

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:51.900
And of course, we took into consideration what was mentioned last week in verse five.

00:36:51.900 --> 00:37:00.300
And now as we look at the verse in eight and nine, number one, learn to identify sin

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.020
in your life.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:04.220
Learn to identify sin in your life.

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:09.260
You know that I did not say learn to identify sin in someone else's life.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:14.380
It's easy for us to identify sin in somebody else's life.

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:16.060
How many of you like it when somebody lies to you?

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:17.820
Anyone?

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:20.540
No, we don't like it when somebody lies to us.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.860
It bothers us.

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:29.340
In fact, if we just see someone lying to somebody else, it can bother us, right?

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:33.580
But yet, for some reason, I can lie to someone and it never even bothers me.

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:39.340
You know the beam and moat truth that Jesus gave, right?

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:44.860
We need to learn to identify sin in our lives personally.

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.100
Can I tell you this, give you a secret?

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:51.340
The Word of God, the Bible, will help you to identify sin.

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:53.100
It will.

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:57.020
As you dig into the Word of God and you read.

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:01.820
And listen, I understand that there's times that, well, I don't want to read all of that

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:03.660
about don't do these things and so on and so forth.

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:07.180
But that's what teaches us what doesn't please God.

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:12.540
You know, there are people in blindness and darkness all around the world today that have

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:19.420
absolutely no idea what God's Word says with regard to what pleases Him and what displeases

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:19.660
Him.

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.820
You know that we can look at various countries around the world.

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:27.820
We could speak to some of our missionaries today and speak to them about some of the

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.180
experiences that they've had.

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:33.020
And we can look at some people that behave in certain manners.

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:36.060
And we could look at them and say, why would they do that?

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:39.980
I mean, that's crazy that they would behave that way.

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:40.940
You know why they do that?

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:42.620
They don't have this book.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:44.700
They don't know the truth.

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:48.060
The truth has not yet set them free.

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:54.140
And so when we dig into the Word of God and we have that proper relationship with God

00:38:54.140 --> 00:39:00.140
and His Word, it is through that relationship that God will help us in our lives to identify

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.820
sin in our lives.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:05.740
And we need to learn to identify sin in our lives.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:12.860
Number two, we need to refuse to excuse sin in our lives.

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:20.060
Just make a decision that we're going to refuse to excuse sin in our lives.

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:23.820
You know that it's easy to excuse sin?

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:31.420
I mean, in the old man, right, the flesh, it is easy for us to excuse sin.

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:39.900
And in fact, unfortunately, sometimes we can get good at it of excusing sin.

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:41.020
Why did you do that?

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:43.980
Well, I wouldn't have done that if they didn't do this and dah, dah, dah, dah, right?

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:48.620
I knew someone many years ago who was in Pennsylvania.

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.260
And I lived there a number of years.

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:52.460
We were there for about 10 years.

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.380
And so it was someone that I knew in Pennsylvania.

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.300
And they had a real problem with anger.

00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:57.580
I mean, just.

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:05.740
really with wrath, with just losing their temper. You know what they did? I mean, 99%

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:14.340
of the time, they said, well, it's just common for my ethnicity to behave that way. I just

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:21.180
have a violent temper. It's just what we are. You know what that is? That's an excuse for

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:29.900
sin. And kindly, graciously, what I tried to tell that individual was, yes, that's your

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:39.540
nationality, but in Christ, we're a new creature, right? See, they didn't like that whole in

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:45.540
Christ, I'm a new creature because they liked being able to excuse their sin. They enjoyed

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:52.900
being able to excuse their wrath and their losing their temper on, this is my nationality,

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:59.700
and this is just common for us. It's possible that we just, well, if you'd stop pushing

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:07.460
my buttons, I wouldn't, you understand, the context of anger and wrath and malice. When

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:11.620
we apologize, have you ever heard somebody apologize to someone and say, I'm sorry, but

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:15.140
if you wouldn't have done blah, blah, blah, blah, then I wouldn't have, is that an apology?

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:19.860
Is it not an apology? It's always confusing, right? And so what I'm saying this morning

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:25.180
is that when we learn to identify sin in our lives, then we need to, number two, refuse

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:31.840
to excuse sin in our lives. There's no excuse for this. There's no justification for this.

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:36.060
This is a time in which I gave place to my flesh, that I walked in the flesh as opposed

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:42.580
to the spirit, and then we come to number three of these three thoughts for consideration

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:50.380
is that we then determine to confess and forsake sin in our lives. You know, it is an absolute

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:58.220
joy to know that we have the promise of forgiveness. Amen? 1 John 1 and verse number 9. If we confess

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:04.980
our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:08.820
You read the Old Testament and you find that some of the attributes that are revealed to

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:12.860
us of God in the Old Testament, the Bible tells us that he's gracious and merciful and

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:18.340
we can enjoy and appreciate those attributes. But the Bible says this with regard to forgiveness,

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:23.820
with thee is forgiveness, but then the Bible tells us that our God is ready to pardon.

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:30.740
He is ready to forgive. Listen, there are times in which we cover, we seek to cover

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:36.500
our sin. Do you understand that he that covereth his sin shall not prosper? It's what the

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:43.780
Word of God says. And so when we've learned to identify sin and we refuse to excuse sin,

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:49.060
then we come to the place where we confess and forsake that sin and we have that forgiveness

00:42:49.060 --> 00:43:00.480
that God provides us with. This morning, is God omniscient? Does he know everything? Absolutely.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:06.480
So when you confess your sin, does it surprise God? Or did he already know it? He already

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:14.440
knew it. And so you're not telling God something he doesn't already know. He knows your thoughts,

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:25.920
right? He knows my thoughts. Let that sink in for a second. And so why if God knows everything

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:34.400
and if sin hinders my fellowship with God, and if God promises to forgive, why would

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:45.240
we try to cover it? Because of our flesh. Why did Adam and Eve try to cover their nakedness?

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:54.200
They were ashamed. They tried to hide themselves, did they not? See, we can't hide from God.

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:59.800
Adam couldn't hide from God. When God asked Adam what happened, God already knew what

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:07.080
happened. It wasn't a surprise to God. So for us this morning, this idea of confession

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:12.920
and forsaking is so important in our lives. It's not to a point where we say, well, I

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:17.680
just keep doing this, I keep doing this. I'm thankful that God promises to forgive. We

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:25.480
forsake it. We say, God, help me to have victory over this. Give no place to the devil.

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:32.880
Walk in the Spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. Last week, when I preached

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:38.680
the message from verses five through seven, I titled the message, Crucify Your Flesh.

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:42.400
The reason that I titled the message that, as I told you last week, is because it's a

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:49.560
personal responsibility. Only you can crucify your flesh and only I can crucify my flesh.

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:55.000
I can't crucify your flesh and you can't crucify my flesh. It's a decision that you have to

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.720
make. But I've used the same idea in these three thoughts this morning that we're to

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:06.360
learn to identify sin in your life, personally. God, help me to, I'm not interested in trying

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:11.800
to worry about identifying the sin in somebody else's life. I can't do anything about that.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:17.760
I want to know what's the sin in my life so that I can then refuse to make an excuse

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:23.880
for it. I understand that there are times in which it's easy for us to make excuses

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:30.400
and we can become good at it. But when we understand that it's costing us sweet fellowship

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:37.240
with our God, it's hindering that closeness with God because I'm regarding this iniquity

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:43.920
in my heart and it will lead me to a place where I want to confess and forsake it. I

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:48.240
don't want sin in my life. Now, the reality is that we're never going to reach a place

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:55.240
of sinless perfection until we get to heaven. Until this mortal shall put on immortality,

00:45:55.240 --> 00:46:01.560
we're going to deal with sin. But we've got to deal with it. Deal with it. And so this

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:07.000
morning as we look at this list that is provided, again, understanding that Paul is being

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:15.000
direct, put off all these. He's being detailed. Anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication,

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.320
lie not one to another. We look at those six things and we say, listen, these are things

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:25.520
that ought not be present in my life, in our lives as the people of God. We need to put

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:31.040
off. And then we're going to look next week about how we put on because we're new creatures

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:35.160
in Christ. Old things are passed away. Behold, all things are become new. I'm not what I

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:40.440
used to be. I now belong to Jesus and Jesus belongs to me. The Holy Spirit of God lives

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:44.400
within me and he gives me the opportunity to have victory. And as I look at a list such

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:49.360
as this, I say, I want to learn. God, help me to learn to identify sin in my life. I

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:54.840
hope that that would be your prayer this morning as well. Help me to identify sin in my life.

00:46:54.840 --> 00:47:01.280
And then help me not to excuse it. Help me to confess it and forsake it, knowing that

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:08.400
you've promised to forgive. Put off all these. Oh, that it would not be said as G. Campbell

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:17.800
Morgan said that these are sins in good standing. No, they're sins and they must be dealt with.

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:26.440
Jesus died for sin, right? He died for sin. And sometimes we look at big sin, little sin,

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:38.880
we fail to recognize that the wages of sin is death and that Jesus died for sin. And

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:45.160
sin will hinder my fellowship with God. I've often heard people say this to me when I've

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:50.200
asked them if they're a sinner. I never murdered anybody. Well, I'm glad that you've not murdered

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:56.240
anyone. I mean, it's a really good thing. Put that at the top of your resume. Amen?

00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:03.240
Never killed anyone. But when you drill in and drill down, have you ever lied? Well,

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:10.040
yeah, everybody does. I agree. All men are liars. That's what the word of God says. But

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:15.440
we've been born again. So these things we need to deal with. Amen? Put off all these.

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:22.440
Let's pray. Father, how we love you. We thank you for giving us a list such as this. We

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:33.240
pray that you would help us this morning to do business with you. Thank you that you're

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:41.720
a God that's ready to pardon and ready to forgive. Help us to identify sin in our lives.

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:50.160
Help us to refuse to excuse it. God, help us to confess and forsake it. That we might

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:57.280
have, as David said, restore unto me the joy of thy salvation. We have that clean heart.

00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:02.240
Have that sweet fellowship with you again. We pray that you'd move and work in lives

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:08.040
this morning as only you can. We'll give you the honor and glory for all that's done. For

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.200
it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:15.840
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano. Maybe you need to visit the altar this morning.

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:20.440
Maybe you need to make your pew an altar this morning. Maybe you want to make a commitment

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:26.400
to God. As the Holy Spirit has moved in your heart and life, would you respond to the Lord

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:33.400
as Kimberly plays?
