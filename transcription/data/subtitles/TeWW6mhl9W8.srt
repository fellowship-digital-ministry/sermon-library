1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
And what a great joy to know the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,199
And thankful for those songs that we're able to sing today.

3
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:10,899
Thankful for that special Hebrews chapter number 11.

4
00:00:10,899 --> 00:00:13,399
Hebrews chapter number 11 this morning.

5
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:17,200
And we'll be in Hebrews chapter number 11 for a few weeks.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,700
I mentioned as we began Hebrews chapter number 11 two Sunday mornings ago,

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,100
Now Faith Is, that was the title for the message.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,600
And we looked at the first three verses.

9
00:00:27,799 --> 00:00:31,399
And this morning we'll be looking at verses 4 through 7.

10
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:34,299
And as we look at the passage of Scripture that is before us

11
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:37,500
and over the next several weeks as we examine Hebrews chapter 11,

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,599
we find that the Word of God provides us with a list of individuals who lived by faith.

13
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:46,900
We understand that the original recipients of this book,

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,400
the Jewish believers in the first century,

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,900
that they would have had an awareness of these individuals that are referenced by name.

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,799
They would have understood and been familiar with the accounts that are referenced.

17
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,799
And these same individuals had been encouraged,

18
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:04,099
we remember back in Hebrews chapter number 6,

19
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,800
that they are to go on.

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:11,000
And we find that at the end of chapter number 10 that they are challenged to live by faith.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,199
And we understand the quote from Habakkuk that is referenced not only here in the book of Hebrews,

22
00:01:17,199 --> 00:01:21,300
but also Paul uses it in Romans and again in Galatians,

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,400
that the just shall live by faith.

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,500
And these believers had been challenged and they had been given,

25
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:36,699
or they now are being given a sampling of those that have gone before them who indeed lived by faith.

26
00:01:36,699 --> 00:01:42,400
And as we consider these particular folks that are mentioned throughout Hebrews chapter 11,

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,300
I believe that it is noteworthy that we recognize this morning

28
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:53,199
that every era of human history had believers that lived by faith.

29
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:56,000
These believers were living in the first century,

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,199
and as we go through the Old Testament we find, first of all,

31
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:01,900
starting there with Abel in verse number 4,

32
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,900
and we'll begin looking at that here in just a moment,

33
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,900
but we find that it begins all the way back in the book of Genesis,

34
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,800
and we find that he goes through the entire era of the prophets,

35
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,399
and he mentions many people.

36
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:14,300
Of course, there are some that he mentions specifically by name,

37
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,600
and there are others that he just kind of says,

38
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:22,000
hey, we don't have the time to deal with all of these individuals.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,199
And he goes through and he provides some lists,

40
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:27,800
and what a blessing to consider this morning

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,600
that throughout all of human history there have been people that have believed God,

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,500
and they have lived by faith.

43
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:42,600
I believe this morning that if we would do a survey over the last 2,000 years of church history,

44
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,899
that you could trace and you could find individuals,

45
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,399
no, they're not in the canon of Scripture,

46
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:53,399
but you can find individual believers that lived by faith.

47
00:02:53,399 --> 00:03:00,500
And this morning, we are challenged as believers in 2020 to live by faith.

48
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,600
That we are to take God at His Word,

49
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,399
that we're to believe what God has said,

50
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:08,699
and that God will do what He says He will do.

51
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:13,600
I believe that the list of folks that are mentioned here in Hebrews 11,

52
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,000
it encourages the people of God.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,300
When you begin to read about those that have gone before us,

54
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:24,300
and you begin to read about the way in which God worked and God blessed and what God did,

55
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:31,300
man, it's encouraging to read those accounts that God has provided us with in His precious Word.

56
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,300
But I believe that more than just being encouraged,

57
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,800
that we ought to be challenged in our own lives to live by faith.

58
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,000
I wonder this morning of how many of us,

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,100
if God were to make mention this morning

60
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:55,500
of those in 2020, how many of us would find ourselves on the roll of they lived by faith?

61
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,600
As we look at our passage of Scripture, and if you're taking notes,

62
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,300
I've simply entitled the message this morning,

63
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,199
Living by Faith, Part 1.

64
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:09,899
We're going to have a multi-part series with the same title as we go through here in Hebrews 11.

65
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:11,800
But notice with me in verse number 4, the Bible says,

66
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,299
"...by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain,

67
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:21,200
by which he obtained witness that he was righteous,

68
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:28,100
God testifying of his gifts, and by it he being dead yet speaketh."

69
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,500
Verse 5, "...by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death,

70
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,500
and was not found, because God had translated him.

71
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:44,000
For before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,299
But without faith it is impossible to please him,

73
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:48,899
for he that cometh to God must believe that he is,

74
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:51,500
and it is the rewarder of them that diligently seek him."

75
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:57,799
Verse 7, "...by faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet,

76
00:04:57,799 --> 00:05:02,100
moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house,

77
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:08,600
by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith."

78
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
As we examine the passage of Scripture this morning,

79
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,799
I want you to notice with me in verse number 4,

80
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:16,399
if you're taking notes, first of all, the worship of Abel.

81
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,700
I want you to understand, it's amazing to me how the writer of Hebrews,

82
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:25,200
of course, it's the Word of God, and so all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

83
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,200
And God goes back to creation in verse number 3,

84
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,500
when he says, "...through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God,

85
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,899
so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear."

86
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:41,600
And we studied that in our previous lesson two weeks ago,

87
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,500
in this first three verses of Hebrews 11.

88
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,399
And we find that the record of creation is referenced, of course,

89
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,200
you can find the record of creation in Genesis 1 and 2,

90
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,200
but it is not exclusive to the book of Genesis.

91
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,000
You find the record and the testimony of creation throughout the whole of Scripture.

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,500
And now we find that the writer of Hebrews goes to Genesis chapter number 4

93
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:10,200
and begins to discuss about an offering that was made by Abel, the son of Adam and Eve.

94
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,500
Of course, Adam and Eve were created in the garden,

95
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,100
and I love the fact that we start here because there are so many this morning in our world

96
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,299
that deny creation, that dismiss the Genesis record.

97
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:25,000
Of course, we've been preaching through the book of Genesis on Sunday evenings,

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and we've spent many, many messages through the first 11 chapters of the book of Genesis

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,399
to lay that foundation and the groundwork

100
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,700
and to understand the importance of the record of Genesis.

101
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:43,500
They seek to destroy the foundation and undermine the authority of the Word of God,

102
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:49,299
thus taking not only offense to what is given in Genesis 1-11,

103
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:53,899
but so that they can then pick apart the whole of Scripture.

104
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:56,799
And we find that the record of Genesis is absolutely true.

105
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:59,200
It was accepted, as I mentioned, when he says,

106
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,700
through faith we understand in verse number 3

107
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:10,200
how the testimony of those that believe that God is indeed the Creator of all things.

108
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,200
We sing for our theme song this year from Psalm 121,

109
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,100
I will lift up mine eyes into the hills, from whence cometh my help.

110
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,700
My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.

111
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:28,399
And we find that now he references Abel, again, a reference that would help us understand

112
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,200
the fact that these believers had an awareness

113
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,200
and understood that the book of Genesis was a literal record

114
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,399
that God has provided for human history.

115
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,100
And we go back to Genesis chapter number 4, you notice here, we'll go there in just a moment,

116
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,000
but notice what it says,

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,399
By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain,

118
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:55,399
by which he, Abel, obtained witness that he was righteous,

119
00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:02,700
God testifying of his gifts, and by it he being dead yet speaketh.

120
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,100
When we think about the worship of Abel and we notice what is said here in verse number 4,

121
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,500
and in just a moment we'll go to Genesis chapter number 4

122
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:15,100
and read the account of what God is referencing here in Hebrews 11 in verse number 4,

123
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,600
we understand that Abel is the first human being to die.

124
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
He's the first one to die.

125
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,700
He'd be killed by his brother Cain shortly after this offering was made.

126
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,899
And we find that as we would understand the worship of Abel

127
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:33,700
and we'd understand the importance of our worship,

128
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,599
first we must acknowledge that our God is worthy of worship.

129
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,099
And what a joy to understand who our God is.

130
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:46,700
I'm so thankful that God has revealed Himself to us through His Word

131
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,299
and He has given us testimony of who He is and of His character.

132
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:55,000
And we understand that He is worthy of our worship.

133
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,299
In fact, I know that I've mentioned this before,

134
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:02,400
but the very word worship originally in the English language carried with it the idea,

135
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,599
and they would use it in this way, worth-ship.

136
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:08,200
And He is worthy of our worship.

137
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,400
Look over to the book of Psalms, if you will, Psalm 29.

138
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,000
I want to reference just a couple of verses of Scripture here in the book of Psalms

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,900
to understand and lay the groundwork for the fact that God indeed is worthy of our worship.

140
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,500
In Psalm 29, in verse 2, the Bible says this.

141
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,200
The psalmist is giving us truth.

142
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,799
Look at Psalm 29 and verse 1.

143
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:36,200
Give unto the Lord, O ye mighty, give unto the Lord glory and strength.

144
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,700
Give unto the Lord the glory due unto His name.

145
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:46,799
Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness.

146
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:52,299
I was singing around the house yesterday that song that we're familiar with,

147
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:55,500
Jesus is the sweetest name I know.

148
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,099
Begin to think about our Savior.

149
00:09:57,099 --> 00:10:00,000
Begin to think about our God and what He's done.

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,599
done for us, and oh, how we ought to offer Him our worship.

151
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:06,840
He is worthy of our worship.

152
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,439
The psalmist will go on to say in Psalm 96,

153
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:13,319
in verse 9, he'll make this testimony.

154
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:15,039
He says, oh, worship the Lord

155
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,200
and the beauty of holiness.

156
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,280
Fear before Him all the earth.

157
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,639
I'm mindful, and we ended our message

158
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,040
last Sunday morning in Revelation 19

159
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,479
as we spoke about the marriage supper of the Lamb.

160
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:33,439
But I find that as John is rehearsing those things

161
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:35,680
and there's some things that he is able

162
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,080
to be familiar with, in verse 10 of Revelation 19,

163
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,880
the Bible says that he fell to his feet

164
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,560
to worship Him, and he said unto me,

165
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,240
see thou do it not, I am thy fellow servant

166
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,880
of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus.

167
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,400
Worship God.

168
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,439
For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

169
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:57,919
We find that we acknowledge this morning

170
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,040
that our God is worthy of worship,

171
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,560
but we next need to understand and accept

172
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,000
the fact that God has defined

173
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,080
how we are to worship Him.

174
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,040
In John 4 and verse 24,

175
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,040
the Bible says that God is a spirit

176
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,599
and they that worship Him must

177
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:17,120
worship Him in spirit and in truth.

178
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,800
And we find this morning

179
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,080
that all that is called worship

180
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,239
is not really worship.

181
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:26,519
We must acknowledge and we must accept

182
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:29,319
this morning that God is worthy of our worship,

183
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:31,800
but we also must understand that God

184
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,040
has defined how we are to worship Him.

185
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,760
We understand that and we see that

186
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,160
through the passage of Scripture

187
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,080
that is referenced in Hebrews 11

188
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,040
in verse number four.

189
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,440
Notice back in Genesis four, if you will,

190
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,559
as we have the opportunity to go back

191
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,319
to this Old Testament account

192
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:50,080
and see what the writer of Hebrews

193
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,720
is referring to when he speaks about

194
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,480
by faith Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice.

195
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,239
You'll notice here in Genesis 4,

196
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:01,680
the Bible tells us beginning in verse number one,

197
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,480
and Adam knew Eve his wife,

198
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,040
and she conceived and bare Cain

199
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,360
and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord.

200
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,720
And she again bare his brother Abel.

201
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,880
And Abel was a keeper of sheep,

202
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,639
but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

203
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:16,960
The Bible says in verse number three,

204
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,720
and in the process of time it came to pass

205
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,160
that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground

206
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,960
an offering unto the Lord.

207
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,919
And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings

208
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,880
of his flock and of the fat thereof.

209
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,839
And the Lord had respect unto Abel

210
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,279
and to his offering.

211
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,800
It tells us in verse number five,

212
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,919
but unto Cain and to his offering,

213
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,880
he had not respect and Cain was very wroth

214
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,199
and his countenance fell.

215
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:43,839
We find that the Bible records for us

216
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:44,720
these two brothers.

217
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,520
They have two different occupations

218
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,479
and there's no problem in what their occupation is.

219
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:52,679
There's no problem with what they do in life.

220
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,479
The Bible begins to reveal to us

221
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:58,160
in the process of time how they would bring forth

222
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,440
these offerings.

223
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,800
And we find that the offerings differed greatly.

224
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,639
We find that the one offering that is mentioned

225
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:08,440
in verse number three, the offering of Cain

226
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,720
that he brought of the fruit of the ground

227
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,679
an offering unto the Lord,

228
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:15,600
but Abel's offering was much different.

229
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,360
The Bible tells us that Abel,

230
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,880
his offering in verse number four,

231
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,759
he brought of the firstlings of his flock

232
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,199
and of the fat thereof.

233
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:26,440
And notice the Bible tells us that God had respect

234
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,000
to the one, but not to the other.

235
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,720
It's interesting that as we read Hebrews 11

236
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,919
and we interpret Scripture with Scripture

237
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,479
and we understand that's what we've been encouraged to do

238
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:41,479
that the Bible says by faith Abel offered.

239
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:46,160
So it was by faith that he offered this sacrifice.

240
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,880
And notice what it says that he offered unto God.

241
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,800
What did he offer?

242
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,559
A more excellent sacrifice than Cain.

243
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,199
Why was it more excellent?

244
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:00,240
Why was it a better sacrifice?

245
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,000
Why is it that God had respect unto Abel and to his offering

246
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,580
but not unto Cain and his offering?

247
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,199
Well, we find that God will give some insight here

248
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,000
in Genesis chapter four and then we'll go back

249
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,239
in a previous chapter and look some more

250
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:17,239
as to what's going on.

251
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:18,679
But notice in verse number six,

252
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:20,920
the Lord begins to speak to Cain.

253
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,279
And the Lord said unto Cain,

254
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,399
why art thou wroth?

255
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,399
And why is thy countenance fallen?

256
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,920
If thou doest well,

257
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,040
shalt thou not be accepted?

258
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,079
What a great question.

259
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,959
What a great revelation that is given to us here

260
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,600
in the beginning of verse number seven.

261
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,600
In fact, basically what God is saying to Cain

262
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,519
is that if you come the appropriate way,

263
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,679
then you'll be accepted.

264
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,399
The problem was that Cain did not come

265
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:51,000
the way in which he was to come.

266
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,239
Notice what he says,

267
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:54,799
and if thou doest not well,

268
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,279
sin lieth at the door

269
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,959
and unto thee shall be his desire

270
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,559
and thou shalt rule over him.

271
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:01,440
And Cain talked with Abel his brother

272
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,279
in verse number eight,

273
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,940
it came to pass when they were in a field

274
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,079
that Cain rose up against Abel his brother

275
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,440
and slew him.

276
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:11,160
Begin to think about this offering.

277
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,359
We find that Abel,

278
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:14,160
according to what we read in Hebrews 11

279
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,000
in verse number four,

280
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,640
he offered this sacrifice by faith.

281
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,480
He made this offering to God

282
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,559
and it was by faith that he offered this sacrifice.

283
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,040
We find that it was a more excellent sacrifice

284
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,359
and that it was accepted, why?

285
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:29,200
Because it was a blood sacrifice.

286
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,720
You understand as we've studied

287
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,839
through the book of Hebrews

288
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,839
and in particular these last few chapters

289
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:35,679
that we've been studying

290
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,720
and understanding the importance of the blood

291
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,679
and understanding the Old Testament

292
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,880
and how they would bring all of those offerings

293
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,000
and all of the blood

294
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,519
and how it represented the fact

295
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,600
that one day Messiah would come

296
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,279
and Christ would become our Passover.

297
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,019
He would go to a cruel cross.

298
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,279
He would shed his precious blood

299
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,459
so that mankind could be redeemed.

300
00:15:57,459 --> 00:15:59,600
He would be buried in a borrowed tomb

301
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,519
and he would rise in victory on day number three,

302
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,980
conquering sin, death, and the grave.

303
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,480
We find that the Bible says

304
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,440
as we would understand the apostle Paul

305
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,559
speaking about this very truth in the book of Galatians

306
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,440
he says, I do not frustrate the grace of God.

307
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,600
If righteousness came by the law,

308
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,640
then Christ is dead in vain.

309
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,760
What is he saying to us?

310
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,040
He's saying salvation is by grace through faith alone.

311
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Jesus paid it all and he paid it with his blood.

312
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,320
He said on the cross of Calvary, it is finished.

313
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,000
And we go all the way back to Genesis chapter number four

314
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,359
and as we read about this offering of Abel,

315
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,160
we see that it was a picture of that blood

316
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,200
that would one day be shed by God himself,

317
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,480
the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary.

318
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,119
But how is it that Abel knew to come in this fashion?

319
00:16:57,119 --> 00:17:00,160
How is it that God could tell us

320
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,399
in Hebrews chapter number 11

321
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:04,119
that this offering was by faith?

322
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,760
Well, we believe this morning

323
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,239
and understand as we look at the whole of Scripture

324
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:13,079
that he, Abel, had faith in the spoken word of God.

325
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,760
Go back a chapter in Genesis chapter number three.

326
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,359
I want you to understand that no doubt

327
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,600
as God is providing us with this record of history

328
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,040
here in the book of Genesis,

329
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,079
that every conversation that they had,

330
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,119
that God had with Adam and Eve was not,

331
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:33,480
has not been recorded for us.

332
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,440
But we do understand that God has recorded for us

333
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,480
exactly what He wants us to know.

334
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,359
And we understand that in Genesis chapter number three,

335
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,320
that God gives us the record

336
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,760
of when sin first entered into the world.

337
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,040
We find that God created the world perfect,

338
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,519
that there was no sin.

339
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:54,839
And we find that in that state of perfection,

340
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:57,160
that Satan, that old serpent,

341
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,000
that he comes and he tempts Eve

342
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,239
in the beginning of Genesis chapter number three

343
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:04,519
and he questions what God says.

344
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:06,640
He says, yea, hath God said.

345
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,519
He says, ye shall not surely die.

346
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:11,760
By the way, the devil's still a deceiver.

347
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,880
He is a liar.

348
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,239
The Bible tells us that in John chapter number eight,

349
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:16,600
and he is from the beginning,

350
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,920
but we find that after sin entered into the world

351
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,559
and after Adam and Eve both partook of the fruit

352
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,200
and their eyes are opened,

353
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,040
that they did a couple of things.

354
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,000
Number one, the Bible tells us

355
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,739
that they hid themselves from God.

356
00:18:30,739 --> 00:18:34,119
No doubt, they were shameful of their sin.

357
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,919
No doubt, they were shameful

358
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,799
of the consequence of their sin.

359
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,640
And they hide from God.

360
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,239
Not only did they hide from God,

361
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:43,200
but they sewed fig leaves together

362
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,700
to cover their nakedness.

363
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,760
We find that as they would sew those fig leaves together,

364
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,520
that that is the work of their hands.

365
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,440
When God comes into the garden,

366
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,200
the Bible records it here for us

367
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,400
in Genesis chapter number three,

368
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,559
that he goes and he says in verse number nine,

369
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,960
the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him,

370
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,159
where art thou?

371
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,559
We find that the Bible then records for us

372
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,799
the judgment that is shared with regard to the sin

373
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,640
and how God deals with Adam and Eve and the serpent,

374
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,599
and then he gives us that great prophecy

375
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,880
in Genesis 3 in verse number 15,

376
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,359
and I will put enmity between thee and the woman,

377
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,880
between thy seed and her seed.

378
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,880
It shall bruise thy head,

379
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,559
and thou shalt bruise his heel.

380
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,760
We find that as we continue to go through

381
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,479
the passage of Scripture,

382
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:38,880
and we understand again that they,

383
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,239
Adam and Eve, have these aprons of fig leaves

384
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:44,080
to cover their nakedness,

385
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,159
the works of their hands that God says,

386
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:49,599
that's not sufficient.

387
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:50,919
So what does he do?

388
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:53,640
We find that in Genesis 3 in verse number 21,

389
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,640
the Bible says, and unto Adam, also unto his wife,

390
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,159
did the Lord God make coats of skins

391
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:06,839
and clothed them." What had to happen for God to provide these coats of skins?

392
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:13,159
An innocent animal had to die. Blood had to be shed. And we find that in that moment

393
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:18,439
that God was communicating not only to Adam and Eve, but then Adam would then

394
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:24,919
communicate to his children the truth that God has given with regard to this

395
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:30,439
process with regard to this fact that these fig leaves weren't insufficient,

396
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:36,159
the works of your hands can never obtain salvation, but it has to be through the

397
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,919
blood. What a great picture that we find all the way in the beginning of the book

398
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:47,919
of Genesis. Someone said this, Scroggie is the last name, and he said that as he

399
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,119
wrote a book with regard to his study the Word of God, he referred to the title

400
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,239
of his book, The Unfolding Drama of Redemption, and he said the Old Testament

401
00:20:57,239 --> 00:21:02,399
gives us all of these truths with regard to the Messiah who would one day come,

402
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:06,959
and as we lead through history and we go through the unfolding of this drama of

403
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:12,199
redemption, we eventually come to the pages of Scripture, the gospel records of

404
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:18,319
the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ, the God in flesh, and we find that he would

405
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,399
live a perfect and sinless life and he would go to the cross of Calvary,

406
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:28,479
fulfilling all of the picture of the Old Testament. And what a blessing. And so we

407
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:34,719
find that Abel in chapter number four, as Adam and Eve have these children, Cain

408
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:39,559
and Abel are listed by name, we find later Seth will be mentioned at the end

409
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:43,279
of chapter number four, but we find that it was in process of time that they

410
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,639
would bring these offerings, and no doubt they had been instructed by Adam, and

411
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:56,839
this instruction that came from God, and Abel comes with a blood offering. Cain? He

412
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:02,759
comes with an offering that's the work of his hands. And what does God say? He

413
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:07,679
says the works of your hands are insufficient. Many religions around the

414
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:14,039
world today, in fact I heard in the last couple of weeks a survey that was done,

415
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:20,399
and amongst those that were asked the question about salvation, nearly 70%

416
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:26,479
responded by saying you could be good enough to get to heaven. That's not what

417
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:31,599
the Word of God teaches. The Word of God tells us that we're all sinners, for all

418
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:36,759
have sinned and come short of the glory of God. Isaiah, in fact, says all of our

419
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:42,119
good works are as filthy rags. See, we could not earn our own salvation. It's

420
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:45,919
impossible, for by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves

421
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:51,439
is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. And we find that in

422
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:57,639
Abel's worship, that he would come and he would worship God in accordance to what

423
00:22:57,639 --> 00:23:04,159
God had instructed, what God had commanded. I believe that Cain came with

424
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:10,399
a desire to worship God, but he came the wrong way. He came the wrong way. And so

425
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:14,959
we find that God is worthy of our worship, but God has also defined how we

426
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:19,679
are to worship Him. Notice with me back in Hebrews chapter 11, as we look at the

427
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,759
remainder of verse number four, I want you to notice what the Bible tells us

428
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:29,239
about this man Abel. The Bible says this, by faith Abel offered unto God a more

429
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:35,639
excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was

430
00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:42,119
righteous. That's a good testimony, by the way, is it not? In verse number four, we

431
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:47,839
find that when we would consider our righteousness, we understand that we are

432
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:54,599
clothed the imputed righteousness of Christ. For God hath made Him Christ to

433
00:23:54,599 --> 00:24:00,119
be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God

434
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:05,679
in Him. 2nd Corinthians 5 and verse number 21. Paul said, I'm not going about

435
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,759
to establish mine own righteousness, but Christ's righteousness in Philippians

436
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:14,279
chapter number 3. And you find that as we look at the the passage of Scripture,

437
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:18,559
you think about the testimony that we can stand and we can say, I've been

438
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:24,659
redeemed, I am saved by the blood of the Lamb, I am declared righteous, not because

439
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:29,679
of any work that I have done, but all because of what Jesus did. I came by way

440
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:35,039
of the cross. Notice it continues and says this, God testifying of His gifts.

441
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:41,799
And notice this last phrase in verse number four, and by it He being dead yet

442
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:49,399
speaketh. Oh, the testimony of this man. All of these years later, millennia later,

443
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:58,759
we're speaking about this offering of Abel. He being dead yet speaketh. We see

444
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:01,759
the worship of Abel as we continue to move through the passage of Scripture.

445
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:05,399
Notice with me in verses five and six, number two this morning, the walk of

446
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:11,279
Enoch. The walk of Enoch. Oh, we're to worship God according to how He has

447
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,559
instructed us to worship Him, and no doubt He is worthy of our worship. But

448
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:20,179
we then find, as we move into verse number five, that the Bible says that by

449
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:25,759
faith Enoch was translated, that he should not see death and was not found,

450
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:31,279
because God had translated him, for before his translation he had this

451
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:36,239
testimony that he pleased God. We find that in Genesis chapter 5, verses 22

452
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:40,719
through 24, again a reference to the beginning of the Bible, that the Bible

453
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:46,159
says this, that Enoch walked with God and he was not, for God took him. I mean, what

454
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,079
a great picture that is. What a great testimony that is. And we find that as we

455
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:55,479
consider the walk of Enoch, and we would understand this morning that as

456
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:00,879
Abel was the first human being to die, that Enoch was the first human being to

457
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:06,359
escape death. The Bible tells us of Enoch that he walked with God and he was not,

458
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:11,679
for God took him. It says that he had this testimony that he was, notice it

459
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,439
says that he was translated, that he should not see death and was not found.

460
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:21,599
They couldn't find him because God took him, amen? And can you imagine, I mean, the

461
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,199
Bible gives us, look back in Genesis chapter number five, and I want you to

462
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:30,039
notice what the Bible says in verses 22 through 24. The Bible says this, in

463
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:35,479
Genesis chapter number five, in verse number 22, and Enoch, well look at verse

464
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:40,079
21, it says, and Enoch lived sixty and five years and begat Methuselah. And

465
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:47,279
Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years and begat

466
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:52,079
sons and daughters. And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five

467
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:58,559
years, and look at verse 24, and Enoch walked with God and he was not, for God

468
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:04,759
took him. Can you imagine just walking along in life, having that sweet communion

469
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:11,039
and fellowship with God, so much so that God took him? I mean, where did Enoch go?

470
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,759
Has anyone seen Enoch? He's missing. Isn't that awesome? I mean, I think it's great. I

471
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:21,799
also believe that it's a picture, a type, of the rapture. The fact that one day the

472
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:26,199
trumpet of the Lord is going to sound. We find that the Bible tells us in

473
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:30,679
Revelation chapter number four that John heard this voice that said, come up

474
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:35,679
hither. We find that in chapters two and three, all the churches in Asia are

475
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,479
referenced in dealing with not only those physical churches that existed,

476
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:45,079
those real churches, but also dealing with church age, if you will. And then you

477
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:49,519
find in the fourth chapter, come up hither. I'm mindful of what the Apostle

478
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:52,799
Paul says in 1 Thessalonians chapter number four with regard to the

479
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:58,079
instruction, the teaching that he gives us with regard to the rapture. Yes, I

480
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:02,959
agree. Many people have said the word rapture is not in the Bible. It's not, but

481
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:06,319
the word rapture means to be caught up. And in 1 Thessalonians chapter number four,

482
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:09,799
he says, then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together to

483
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:15,319
meet the Lord in the clouds, and so shall we ever be with the Lord. And then he

484
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:19,439
says in verse number 18, wherefore comfort one another with these words. Oh,

485
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:25,039
how comforting those words are to understand that one day the Lord Jesus

486
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:30,399
Christ is going to call us home. Now, I'd like to believe that it would be in my

487
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:35,119
lifetime. I know there are preachers over the centuries that have had that same

488
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,959
testimony and that same desire that the rapture of the church would happen

489
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:41,959
during their lifetime, and what a blessing it would be. Brother Mershawn

490
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:46,519
often says he's looking for the upper taker and not the undertaker, and I love

491
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:52,079
that quote, that phraseology that he uses. And we find that Enoch, he escaped

492
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:57,639
death. He walked with God. He had this testimony back in chapter number 11 of

493
00:28:57,639 --> 00:29:01,759
Hebrews in verse number five, the verse in which we're looking at the walk of

494
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:09,759
Enoch. Notice what it says at the end of the verse. For before his translation, he

495
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:17,440
had this testimony. What is it? That he pleased God. Can I tell you this morning,

496
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:26,239
that's a good testimony to have. Can I ask you this morning, what God say of us?

497
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:32,839
What God say of you? That your walk pleases Him. I hope this morning you

498
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:38,759
could say yes. Not in a prideful, boastful way, but a way in which you have sought

499
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:43,119
to walk with the Lord and be obedient to His Word. That you've gone through the

500
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:47,440
process of proving what is acceptable unto the Lord, and that you've desired to

501
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,919
walk with Him and to please Him. And we find that the Bible tells us that Enoch

502
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,559
had this testimony, but when we look at verse number six, the Bible tells us but

503
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,559
without faith, it is impossible to please Him.

504
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,859
For he that cometh to God must believe that he is,

505
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:06,579
and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him."

506
00:30:06,579 --> 00:30:09,739
And so I find that as I look at verses 5 and 6 together,

507
00:30:09,739 --> 00:30:12,019
and I notice the walk of Enoch,

508
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:15,659
that I am encouraged not only by his walk,

509
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:17,239
challenged by his walk,

510
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:19,539
but I'm encouraged to know that by faith

511
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:21,379
I can please God as well.

512
00:30:22,539 --> 00:30:24,299
And so can you.

513
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,819
We understand that the Bible says without faith,

514
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:29,739
it is impossible to please Him.

515
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:33,259
Remember, as we've studied several weeks on Wednesdays

516
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:34,739
over the past couple of months,

517
00:30:34,739 --> 00:30:37,459
we have referenced various passages of Scripture

518
00:30:37,459 --> 00:30:40,419
after we ended our Elijah and Elisha study.

519
00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:43,179
And as we've looked at a number of different passages,

520
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:46,719
we have mentioned how that God marveled at their faith.

521
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:49,859
He marveled also at their unbelief.

522
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:52,859
He says to the disciples, he says to Peter, in fact,

523
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:54,959
how is it that your faith is so small?

524
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:56,899
How is it that you have no faith?

525
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:58,099
Remember the disciples.

526
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:01,339
There was the feeding of the 5,000.

527
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:04,419
What miraculous event that was.

528
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:06,259
We find that Jesus says,

529
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:08,459
hey, we need to get them something to eat.

530
00:31:08,459 --> 00:31:10,299
The disciples say, hey, send them away.

531
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:12,299
It's time is far spent.

532
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:13,459
It's time for them to go home.

533
00:31:13,459 --> 00:31:14,979
We have nothing to give them to eat.

534
00:31:14,979 --> 00:31:18,399
And Jesus says, no, we're gonna give them something to eat.

535
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,139
They have five loaves and two fish, right?

536
00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:24,739
And the Bible tells us that He instructs the disciples

537
00:31:24,739 --> 00:31:26,419
to have them sit in companies.

538
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,180
And as they sit in companies by 50,

539
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:32,139
that He blessed and break and He distributed

540
00:31:32,139 --> 00:31:34,459
through the disciples to all of those folks,

541
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,339
and they all were filled.

542
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:40,299
And then they took up some baskets of the remains.

543
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:41,699
How many baskets?

544
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:42,540
12.

545
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,819
They had more at the end than they had at the beginning.

546
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:48,819
Now, the disciples saw that.

547
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:50,540
The disciples experienced that.

548
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,259
The disciples were part of that.

549
00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:54,019
They were the ones that were distributing.

550
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:56,259
They were the ones that picked up the fragments.

551
00:31:57,099 --> 00:32:01,339
They witnessed the work of God and the power of God.

552
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:04,339
But shortly thereafter, there were 4,000 that were gathered.

553
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,699
You know what the disciples said?

554
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:12,300
How can a man provide bread for these folks?

555
00:32:13,459 --> 00:32:14,500
That's what they say.

556
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,639
The question is, why don't they believe?

557
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:19,940
Why don't they have faith?

558
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,860
And I find myself so often,

559
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,619
as we would look at the Scriptures

560
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:29,179
and we would evaluate and understand what's going on,

561
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:31,940
and we would be able to identify things in the lives

562
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,440
of those that have gone before us,

563
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,619
but how often do we face the same situations in our life?

564
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:40,660
We've seen God work, we've witnessed God's power,

565
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,099
but we come to a particular situation in our life

566
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:45,259
and we say, I just don't know how it's gonna work.

567
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:47,259
I just don't know how it's gonna happen.

568
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,099
Where's your faith?

569
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:51,099
Where's your faith?

570
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:54,539
And so we understand that without faith,

571
00:32:55,179 --> 00:32:56,020
it's impossible to please Him.

572
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,380
See, God wants us to believe Him.

573
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,339
I'm mindful of the book of Numbers,

574
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:05,059
the account that God gives us in chapters 13 and 14

575
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:07,179
with the spies that would be sent out.

576
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:11,020
We find that as the spies return,

577
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,099
and there were 12 of them,

578
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:13,819
and we know that it was Caleb and Joshua

579
00:33:13,819 --> 00:33:17,899
that brought back the good report, the faithful report.

580
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:20,660
The other 10, they didn't believe God.

581
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,899
God had said over and over,

582
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:26,099
I'm gonna give you this land.

583
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:27,020
I'm gonna go with you.

584
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,940
You're gonna possess this land.

585
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:32,300
And yet they didn't believe.

586
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,179
We know that those 10 individuals,

587
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,419
they influenced the entire congregation

588
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:38,699
of the nation of Israel.

589
00:33:39,739 --> 00:33:41,819
Joshua and Caleb, they rent their clothes,

590
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:43,300
they plead with the people,

591
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,599
so much so that the people are ready to stone Joshua and Caleb.

592
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:50,020
God says to Moses, how long will it be,

593
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,580
ere my people believe me?

594
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,099
What of this morning?

595
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:57,020
We think about the walk of Enoch.

596
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,139
He walked with God.

597
00:33:58,139 --> 00:33:59,300
He believed God.

598
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,860
He walked by faith.

599
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:04,779
And we see that God blessed and God translated him.

600
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:07,419
I mean, it's an amazing truth of the word of God.

601
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:10,619
Again, as we look at these first references

602
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,220
in Hebrews chapter 11,

603
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,839
and we see how that they provide this reference

604
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,380
back to the book of Genesis,

605
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:21,639
giving credibility to what we read in the book of Genesis.

606
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:24,299
We see the worship of Abel.

607
00:34:24,299 --> 00:34:28,059
We see the walk of Enoch in number three this morning.

608
00:34:28,059 --> 00:34:31,660
In verse number seven, we see the work of Noah.

609
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,419
The work of Noah.

610
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:35,739
We understand that God spoke to Noah.

611
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:38,660
God informed Noah of coming judgment.

612
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,980
And God specifically instructed Moses

613
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,660
with regard to what he needed to do.

614
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,720
We find that Noah believed God.

615
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,839
He acted with faith.

616
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,279
Notice in verse number seven,

617
00:34:49,279 --> 00:34:50,959
and we're noticing the work of Noah.

618
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:52,200
It tells us in verse number seven,

619
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,359
by faith Noah being warned of God

620
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,200
of things not seen as yet.

621
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,359
Notice what the Bible says.

622
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:00,399
He moved with fear,

623
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:04,200
prepared an ark to the saving of his house,

624
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,959
by the witch he condemned the world

625
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:08,639
and became heir of the righteousness,

626
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,839
which is by faith.

627
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:12,959
In Genesis chapter six through eight,

628
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:15,639
we find the Bible gives us a record

629
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:17,959
of the Genesis flood.

630
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:20,359
We spent many weeks studying through

631
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:22,119
those chapters in Genesis.

632
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:24,480
And you notice in Genesis chapter number six,

633
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,200
if you turn back there,

634
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,679
the Bible tells us that God sees

635
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:30,480
the wickedness of mankind.

636
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,480
And the Lord says that he's going to destroy man

637
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,779
whom he had created from the face of the earth.

638
00:35:35,779 --> 00:35:39,179
But yet God tells us that Noah found grace

639
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:42,119
in the eyes of the Lord in verse number eight.

640
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,600
And the Bible tells us that in verse number 13

641
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:46,000
of Genesis chapter number six,

642
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,679
that God said unto Noah,

643
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:50,160
the end of all flesh has come before me,

644
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,600
for the earth is filled with violence through them

645
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,639
and behold, notice what he says,

646
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,639
I will destroy them with the earth.

647
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:01,579
The very next verse, verse 14,

648
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:04,079
make thee an ark of gopher wood.

649
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,839
Room shalt thou make in the ark

650
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,160
and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

651
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,040
He goes through and he gives them the instruction

652
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,639
with regard to what to do and how to do

653
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:17,519
and the elements that he should use,

654
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:19,679
the materials I shall say that he should use

655
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:22,799
and all of the details with regard to this ark.

656
00:36:22,799 --> 00:36:24,600
And we find that in verse number 22,

657
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,600
the Bible says this,

658
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,239
thus did Noah,

659
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:33,359
according to all that God commanded him,

660
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,760
so did he.

661
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,799
He was a man of faith and he was a man of obedience.

662
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:41,399
I think it's interesting,

663
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,399
the Bible tells us in Hebrews chapter 11,

664
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:46,040
that he was warned of God,

665
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,079
notice what it says,

666
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,760
of things not seen as yet.

667
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,079
He was warned of God of things not seen as yet.

668
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:57,679
As best we know and understand,

669
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:59,480
there had not been any rain

670
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,639
and God said he's gonna destroy the earth with rain,

671
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:02,480
with a flood.

672
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,040
It was gonna rain for 40 days and 40 nights.

673
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,959
And we find that here,

674
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:09,359
that God gives this instruction,

675
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,320
this warning to Noah of these things not seen as yet.

676
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,839
He had never experienced rain,

677
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:18,359
nor had he ever endured a flood.

678
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:20,519
But God said it was gonna happen.

679
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:21,519
And so guess what he did?

680
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,480
Notice it says this,

681
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,119
that he moved with fear.

682
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,200
He believed God.

683
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,880
He believed that what God said he was going to do,

684
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,160
that he was going to do.

685
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,480
And God said, I'm gonna destroy.

686
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,880
But he says, make thee an ark of gopher wood.

687
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,919
Here's the instruction.

688
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:42,279
By the way, this work was a hard work.

689
00:37:42,279 --> 00:37:44,839
It was a long, enduring work.

690
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:47,600
We find that this warning is given

691
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,880
and it had an impact.

692
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,359
And we find that he then prepared,

693
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:55,959
it says here, an ark to the saving of his house.

694
00:37:56,919 --> 00:38:01,359
No doubt this was a lengthy, tiring work.

695
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,000
We find that he was faithful to do

696
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,200
what God called him to do.

697
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,040
And God sustained him.

698
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:12,359
I think about Noah building that ark.

699
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:13,720
How many of you have been out to Kentucky

700
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,959
and you've seen the ark out there?

701
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:17,480
It's pretty neat, isn't it?

702
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,320
I mean, you get up,

703
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,279
you kind of come over the crest of the hill

704
00:38:20,279 --> 00:38:22,359
there in Kentucky where that ark is.

705
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:24,480
I can't remember the town in which it's located.

706
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,639
You come over the crest of the hill

707
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:28,160
and man, you just see this ark.

708
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,679
It's humongous.

709
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:32,440
Ken Ham answers in Genesis,

710
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,799
they wanted to build that model

711
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:37,440
and they did to scale based upon the cubits

712
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,559
and all the lengths that are mentioned

713
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:41,000
there in the Genesis record.

714
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,760
And I mean, it's amazing.

715
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,400
You go in that thing and you realize how small you are

716
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,760
and how large this thing is

717
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,760
and the detail, the amount of time

718
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,440
that it would have taken he and his family.

719
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,000
And we find that he was preparing this ark.

720
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,279
He was obedient to the work.

721
00:38:58,279 --> 00:39:00,880
Listen, no one ever said that working for God

722
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,119
was going to be easy.

723
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:06,479
But the amazing thing is that God sustains us

724
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:07,440
in the work.

725
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,400
He gives us the strength when we have no strength.

726
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,840
I think about the Apostle Paul

727
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,520
and I think about his testimony as he's serving God

728
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,279
as he's going on those missionary journeys

729
00:39:17,279 --> 00:39:19,039
and all of the things that he endures

730
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:21,400
and all of the difficulties that he faces.

731
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,119
And yet he says that the Lord delivered him

732
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:25,679
and the Lord sustained him.

733
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,520
We find this morning that Noah,

734
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,159
he was working for the Lord.

735
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:38,039
It's interesting as we would consider our work for God.

736
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:40,080
I want you to look at a few verses of Scripture.

737
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,279
I've referenced earlier,

738
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:43,359
turn to the book of Ephesians, if you will.

739
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,359
And I referenced, I quoted for you earlier,

740
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,640
Ephesians 2, verses 8 and 9,

741
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,840
with regard to the subject matter of worship

742
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,840
and how that we're saved by grace through faith,

743
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,559
that it's nothing that we can do.

744
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,239
It's of no works that you could do.

745
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:59,559
It's of no works that I could do to earn my salvation.

746
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:02,000
The Bible says that the gift of God...

747
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,279
God is eternal life through Jesus Christ, my Lord.

748
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:08,320
Can I tell you this morning that if you work for it,

749
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,800
it ceases to be a gift.

750
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,960
Amen?

751
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,159
I go and I work for something

752
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,720
and somebody gives me something

753
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,960
and says, here's a gift for you.

754
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,680
No, no, that's a wage, amen?

755
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,059
I worked for that, I earned that, right?

756
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:23,840
We understand that.

757
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,719
At the end of the week when you get your paycheck,

758
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:26,840
your boss doesn't come to you and say,

759
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,360
here's a gift for you.

760
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,540
He's like, man, I work like a dog all week.

761
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,700
What do you mean a gift for me, right?

762
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,000
It's a wage.

763
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,299
You know what the Bible says about our sin?

764
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:38,540
The wages of sin is death.

765
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,819
The gift of God is eternal life

766
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:41,299
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

767
00:40:41,299 --> 00:40:43,459
And we find that that gift is based upon

768
00:40:43,459 --> 00:40:45,220
the grace and mercy of God

769
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,659
and the work that he did at the cross of Calvary.

770
00:40:47,659 --> 00:40:50,580
However, we understand as the scriptures

771
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,659
would unfold for us and tell us in verse number 10,

772
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:57,799
that as we are saved, we become his workmen.

773
00:40:57,799 --> 00:40:59,740
We become his servants.

774
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,700
And I love the way in which the writers

775
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,819
of the New Testament,

776
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:04,540
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

777
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,699
many of them, they'll begin the letters

778
00:41:06,699 --> 00:41:08,220
in which they write by saying,

779
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,660
Paul, a servant.

780
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,940
Peter, a servant.

781
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,779
James, a servant.

782
00:41:12,779 --> 00:41:16,319
What a joy to be the servant of the Lord.

783
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,059
We find here in Ephesians 2,

784
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,540
in verse number 10, the Bible says,

785
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,180
for we are his workmanship,

786
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,419
created in Christ Jesus unto good works,

787
00:41:25,419 --> 00:41:27,580
which God hath before ordained

788
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,580
that we should walk in them.

789
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,500
Now let me help you understand something very important.

790
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,019
We do not work to earn our salvation,

791
00:41:38,019 --> 00:41:41,980
and we do not work to keep our salvation.

792
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,480
We work because we're saved.

793
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,019
That's our response to what God has done for us

794
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:50,620
and how he's blessed us.

795
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,860
And what a joy, listen,

796
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:56,019
the reality today is that if God had deemed it to be so,

797
00:41:56,019 --> 00:41:58,500
that at the moment that you trust at Christ your Savior,

798
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,980
we could have immediately gone to heaven.

799
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,220
And some say, man, that would have been wonderful.

800
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,059
But he's left us here,

801
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:07,099
and he's left us here for a purpose.

802
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:11,059
He's left us here to be his representatives,

803
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:12,399
his ambassadors.

804
00:42:14,419 --> 00:42:17,300
Remember, as we had that message on Sunday evening

805
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,419
from Brother Hauser,

806
00:42:18,419 --> 00:42:19,699
that you're the salt of the earth,

807
00:42:19,699 --> 00:42:22,339
that you're the light of the world.

808
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,339
And as we understand here this morning,

809
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,500
as we begin to look at what's going on

810
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:30,259
and we see this truth that we are his workmanship

811
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:33,500
created in Christ Jesus unto good works,

812
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,779
in the book of Philippians,

813
00:42:35,779 --> 00:42:38,539
Paul says this to the church in Philippi,

814
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:41,179
just a few pages over in your Bible,

815
00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:43,580
in Philippians 1 and verse number six,

816
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,300
being confident of this very thing,

817
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,979
that he which hath begun a good work in you

818
00:42:48,979 --> 00:42:52,699
will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.

819
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:57,460
We're familiar with the truth that Peter gives

820
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,059
in 1 Peter chapter number four

821
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:03,979
with regard to the gift that we've been given.

822
00:43:03,979 --> 00:43:06,339
I speak of this gift that he's mentioning

823
00:43:06,339 --> 00:43:07,979
in 1 Peter chapter number four.

824
00:43:07,979 --> 00:43:09,619
It is the gift of serving,

825
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:12,339
the gifts of the Holy Spirit of God.

826
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:15,259
And here we find that he says in verse number 10

827
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,419
of 1 Peter chapter number four,

828
00:43:16,419 --> 00:43:19,339
as every man hath received the gift,

829
00:43:19,339 --> 00:43:21,300
even so minister the same one to another

830
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,500
as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

831
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,979
If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God.

832
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:29,100
If any man minister, let him do it as of the ability

833
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,660
which God giveth.

834
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,500
Why?

835
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,500
That God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ

836
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,179
to whom be praise and dominion forever and ever, amen.

837
00:43:38,179 --> 00:43:41,779
You see how it goes back to our first point of worship.

838
00:43:41,779 --> 00:43:43,740
He's glorified, he's exalted,

839
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:47,100
he is receiving the glory that's due unto his name.

840
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,860
And we find here that as we look

841
00:43:48,979 --> 00:43:52,460
at these three individuals that are mentioned

842
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,899
in Hebrews 11 verses four through seven,

843
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:58,100
we find that we notice that the worship of Abel,

844
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,179
we notice the walk of Enoch,

845
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,660
and we notice the work of Noah.

846
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,259
As we think about the work of Noah,

847
00:44:04,259 --> 00:44:06,059
we see that he prepared this ark.

848
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:07,940
Notice what the result is.

849
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,460
Really, there's a twofold result

850
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,940
that is given to us in verse number seven of Hebrews 11.

851
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,419
The Bible says this,

852
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:19,420
that he prepared an ark, notice, to the saving of his house,

853
00:44:19,459 --> 00:44:21,100
to the saving of his house.

854
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,579
We understand this morning that Noah and Mrs. Noah

855
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:29,940
and his three sons and their wives all got onto that ark.

856
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:34,459
And the only place of safety, of refuge was in the ark.

857
00:44:34,459 --> 00:44:35,940
You had to be in the ark.

858
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:38,859
I think about the fact that the Bible tells us

859
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:41,940
that Noah was a preacher of righteousness.

860
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:44,260
And I think about the way in which Noah preached

861
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:47,980
for all those years as he was preparing the ark.

862
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,220
As we think about his preaching

863
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,260
and the way in which no doubt he was mocked

864
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,380
and ridiculed and made fun of,

865
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:56,700
and we find that as that door was shut

866
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,579
and God shut that door in there in the ark,

867
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:02,579
that when that flood began,

868
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:04,459
when those rains started to descend

869
00:45:04,459 --> 00:45:07,779
and the depths of the earth opened up,

870
00:45:07,779 --> 00:45:12,779
I believe that those individuals that had not listened,

871
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:17,100
man, they were seeking some kind of refuge.

872
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:21,220
But there was no refuge because you had to be in the ark.

873
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,540
As New Testament believers, we have to be in Christ.

874
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,660
If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.

875
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,540
Old things are passed away.

876
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,859
Behold, all things are become new.

877
00:45:30,859 --> 00:45:33,459
And so we find, as we look at the twofold result

878
00:45:33,459 --> 00:45:35,179
of the work of Noah, that number one,

879
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:37,220
he and his family were spared

880
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:39,579
to the saving of his house, the Bible says.

881
00:45:39,579 --> 00:45:43,059
And then notice this, by the witch, he condemned the world.

882
00:45:43,059 --> 00:45:44,859
We find that the world was condemned.

883
00:45:44,859 --> 00:45:46,779
In 2 Peter 2, in verse number five,

884
00:45:46,779 --> 00:45:49,540
a thought that I just referenced a moment ago,

885
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,540
but the Bible says this,

886
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,220
and spared not the old world,

887
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,700
but saved Noah, the eighth person,

888
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,220
a preacher of righteousness,

889
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:59,220
bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly.

890
00:46:01,779 --> 00:46:04,220
And it says that he became heir of the righteousness,

891
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,179
which is by faith.

892
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:07,619
Isn't that a great statement?

893
00:46:08,619 --> 00:46:13,019
We find this morning that righteousness is by faith.

894
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:14,739
It's not by works.

895
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:17,500
And even as we look at the work of Noah here

896
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,820
in verse number seven,

897
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,619
we understand that it was not his work

898
00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:23,820
that caused him to have this righteousness,

899
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:27,380
but it was his faith and obedience to God.

900
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:30,059
And we find that as Noah would get off the ark,

901
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:32,700
that the first thing he does is he worships the Lord.

902
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,820
He builds those altars,

903
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,619
and he provides an offering unto the Lord.

904
00:46:35,899 --> 00:46:38,459
The first matter of business was worship

905
00:46:38,459 --> 00:46:40,179
after they got off of that ark.

906
00:46:41,179 --> 00:46:44,940
As we look at the truth of this first message

907
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:45,899
in Hebrews 11,

908
00:46:45,899 --> 00:46:47,660
as we begin to deal with the individuals

909
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,820
that are referenced by name,

910
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,779
we see the worship.

911
00:46:51,779 --> 00:46:54,579
I hope this morning that we're worshiping God properly.

912
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,380
That we understand this morning

913
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,420
that He is worthy of our worship.

914
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,899
I hope this morning that we are walking with God.

915
00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:10,339
That we would have the testimony of Enoch,

916
00:47:10,339 --> 00:47:11,700
that he walked with God,

917
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,059
and he was not, for God took him.

918
00:47:14,059 --> 00:47:15,260
That we'd walk with him.

919
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,739
That we'd enjoy that sweet communion and fellowship

920
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:20,940
that is able to be enjoyed

921
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,380
because of what the Lord Jesus Christ did for us

922
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,619
on the cross of Calvary.

923
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,380
And I hope this morning that we're working for the Lord.

924
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,220
The songwriter said,

925
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:33,980
work for the night is coming when man's work works no more.

926
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,339
And this morning,

927
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:37,500
we have an opportunity to work for the Lord.

928
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,339
By the way,

929
00:47:38,339 --> 00:47:40,420
it's a great thing to be able to work for the Lord,

930
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,500
to be His servant.

931
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,339
And again,

932
00:47:43,339 --> 00:47:46,299
we do not confuse the teaching of the Word of God.

933
00:47:46,299 --> 00:47:47,660
We do not say that you work

934
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:50,779
so that you can earn or keep your salvation.

935
00:47:50,779 --> 00:47:52,660
It simply is out of a response

936
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:55,700
to all that God has done for us.

937
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,019
I desire to work for Him.

938
00:47:57,019 --> 00:47:58,420
I desire to live for Him.

939
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,540
I desire to walk with Him

940
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,059
because I understand what He's given me here

941
00:48:02,059 --> 00:48:04,299
in this book and His Word.

942
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:05,140
And this morning,

943
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,140
we see these three characters,

944
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,179
Abel, Enoch and Noah.

945
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,019
Next week,

946
00:48:11,019 --> 00:48:12,899
we'll continue looking at Abraham.

947
00:48:12,899 --> 00:48:16,220
Begin to see how these individuals lived by faith,

948
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,019
living by faith.

949
00:48:18,019 --> 00:48:19,179
But this morning,

950
00:48:19,179 --> 00:48:21,579
how are we living by faith?

951
00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:24,899
How is it in our lives that we are living by faith,

952
00:48:24,899 --> 00:48:27,179
that we're taking God at His Word,

953
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:29,019
that we're believing Him?

954
00:48:29,019 --> 00:48:29,859
See,

955
00:48:29,859 --> 00:48:30,700
I'll tell you this morning,

956
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:33,899
it's not easy for us to live by sight.

957
00:48:33,899 --> 00:48:34,820
It really is.

958
00:48:35,739 --> 00:48:37,979
I've been doing some reading here recently

959
00:48:37,979 --> 00:48:42,979
of some believers that have gone on before us

960
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,859
over the centuries.

961
00:48:47,859 --> 00:48:50,119
Those that have served God faithfully.

962
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,940
And some of that which they endured

963
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:55,299
and how they lived by faith.

964
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:59,059
They begin to think about our environment,

965
00:48:59,059 --> 00:49:01,539
what we have in 2020.

966
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:03,780
It's easy for us to live by sight.

967
00:49:04,979 --> 00:49:06,679
But without faith,

968
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:09,099
it is impossible to please Him.

969
00:49:09,099 --> 00:49:10,539
And so this morning,

970
00:49:10,539 --> 00:49:15,340
we come to Him by faith with regard to salvation.

971
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:18,059
But we must understand that we must live by faith

972
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:20,479
all the days of our lives.

973
00:49:20,479 --> 00:49:21,320
These men,

974
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,140
they lived by faith

975
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,739
and the Bible tells us what they did by faith.

976
00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:27,059
And we'll continue to see testimonies

977
00:49:27,059 --> 00:49:29,179
of those that have gone before us.

978
00:49:29,179 --> 00:49:31,000
And know that we would have a testimony

979
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,700
of living by faith.

980
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,900
Father, we love You this morning.

981
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,599
We thank You for loving us.

982
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,340
We thank You for the testimonies of these

983
00:49:40,419 --> 00:49:41,739
that have gone before us.

984
00:49:41,739 --> 00:49:44,539
All the way back to the book of Genesis.

985
00:49:44,539 --> 00:49:49,260
In reading in Genesis chapters four through eight

986
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,500
of Abel and Enoch and Noah,

987
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,340
seeing their worship and their walk and their work.

988
00:49:55,419 --> 00:50:00,419
And God, I pray this morning that You would encourage us.

989
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:02,580
I pray that You would challenge us.

990
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:05,780
or to help us to live by faith.

991
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:08,620
There's one here that's not sure of heaven.

992
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,860
As we shared testimony this morning,

993
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:13,660
as we were singing this morning about salvation

994
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,940
and knowing for sure that heaven's our home,

995
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:16,980
maybe there's someone this morning

996
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:20,060
that they just simply do not have 100% assurance

997
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:22,100
that if they were to die today that heaven's their home.

998
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,860
We pray that the Holy Spirit of God

999
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,820
would convict them of their sin,

1000
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:28,220
of Christ's righteousness, of judgment to come.

1001
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,500
I pray that before they leave this place,

1002
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,660
they would get it settled.

1003
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,020
I pray for each child of God this morning.

1004
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,140
God, would you help us to live by faith?

1005
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:43,060
Help us to be challenged by the testimony of these men.

1006
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,460
I pray that you would do a work in our lives

1007
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,700
in these next few moments

1008
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:52,940
that would result in you being glorified and exalted,

1009
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:57,480
and us being made conformed to the image of your Son.

1010
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,920
Well, thank you for the work that you'll do,

1011
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,140
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

1012
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:03,560
Would you stand with me, heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

1013
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,260
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

1014
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,020
As she does, the altar is open.

1015
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,240
If you're not sure of heaven,

1016
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,400
we'd love to take a Bible and show you

1017
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,880
how you can know for sure that heaven's your home.

1018
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,860
If you're a child of God,

1019
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,520
maybe you just wanna come and thank God

1020
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,160
for the gift of salvation.

1021
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,920
Maybe you just wanna come and commit to live by faith.

1022
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,040
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
