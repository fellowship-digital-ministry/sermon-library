1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,559
Hebrews 9, we'll be looking at verses 1-14 this morning in this passage of Scripture.

2
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,760
And you'll remember that as we studied the 8th chapter of the book of Hebrews, that we

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:16,159
had made note that the subject matter that was discussed in the first few verses of Hebrews

4
00:00:16,159 --> 00:00:23,040
8 would be further developed in chapter 9 and really the first half of chapter 10.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,920
And we understand that we're still within the section of the book of Hebrews where God

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,560
is dealing with the superiority of the priesthood of Jesus Christ.

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,740
And I'm so thankful that the writer, that obviously all Scripture is given by inspiration

8
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:44,000
of God, and God has seen fit to give us several chapters of instruction with regard to this

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,159
particular subject matter and really helping not only us today, but I think about the huge

10
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:58,520
benefit to those that the original recipients of this letter, those saved Jewish people

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,880
that were dealing with all sorts of difficulties and obviously much persecution and various

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,599
things going on, the thought of returning to Judaism and all of that system.

13
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:15,239
And we find that the book of Hebrews deals with the subject matter of Christ is ministering

14
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:19,980
in a better place, but He also presented a better offering.

15
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:25,419
And again, throughout chapters 9 and 10 we see this theme recurring and we see great

16
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,620
amounts of evidence that are given.

17
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,139
In fact, as you read certain portions of the Scripture, I believe that the book of Romans

18
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:36,379
is very much this way, and here we find in this section of the book of Hebrews that there's

19
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:42,699
so much evidence that is given in presenting the case that Christ is superior, and we find

20
00:01:42,699 --> 00:01:48,180
that yes, He could have just said Christ is superior, but all of the supporting evidence

21
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:55,099
that is being given to us throughout the Word of God that helps us to rightfully conclude

22
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:58,900
that which is being presented to us and the truth that is being revealed.

23
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:05,500
We understand that as we mentioned the superiority of the priesthood of Jesus Christ, that He's

24
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,660
from a better order.

25
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:12,339
We understand that He's after the order of Melchizedek and obvious fulfillment of Psalm

26
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:18,020
110 and verse number 4, that messianic prophecy, and it's properly applied to the person of

27
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,460
Jesus Christ, God in flesh, and what a blessing that is for us to be able to see that.

28
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:31,899
And we mentioned that not only would the book of Hebrews present Jesus as being that priest

29
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:37,500
after the order of Melchizedek, but we find that the passages of Scripture that are before

30
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,699
us will prove to us the superiority of the Lord Jesus Christ in this ministry, in this

31
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:44,699
office.

32
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:48,539
And we're so thankful for the Word of God and the truth that is given to us and how

33
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:50,979
rich the truth is.

34
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:54,580
Notice as we begin in chapter number 9 and verse number 1, the Bible says,

35
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:00,940
Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary.

36
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,259
Now remember, as we looked at the first part of chapter number 8, He dealt with the fact

37
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:09,899
that Christ ministers in a better place, in a superior place, and also we found that He

38
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:14,660
referenced it as being the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched and not man, in verse

39
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,660
number 2.

40
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,979
We also find that He presented a better offering He offered Himself.

41
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:24,699
And as we look at the passage of Scripture in chapter number 8, last week we dealt with

42
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:31,220
the new covenant, a better covenant, and we looked at the aspects of how that Bible truth

43
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:39,139
applies first in relation to Israel as a nation, and then of course how it relates to us as

44
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:42,100
God's people, and what a blessing to see that.

45
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,580
Now we enter into chapter number 9 and He's going back to the first covenant.

46
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,580
He says,

47
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,660
Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary.

48
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:59,500
Now understand, when He's using this phraseology, a worldly sanctuary, He's not dealing with

49
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,160
it on being worldly or holy, as sometimes we would use that comparison, but simply that

50
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,220
it's of this earth.

51
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,339
It's a temporal thing.

52
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:07,899
It was of this earth.

53
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:14,059
Remember that Moses was given the instruction and Bezalel and others were equipped to be

54
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:20,140
able to present all and to make all of the pieces of furniture and then to pitch the

55
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,140
tabernacle.

56
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,859
And so that's what He's referring to.

57
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:27,779
And we see immediately that He's going to go into the details of the tabernacle.

58
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:30,899
I want you to skip down, if you will, to verse number 12.

59
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:31,899
I'll give you the title.

60
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:33,380
We'll get into the message this morning.

61
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,619
In verse number 12, the Bible says,

62
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:40,059
Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood, speaking of Jesus Christ,

63
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:47,820
He entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.

64
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,899
What a precious verse of Scripture.

65
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:55,660
This morning, I'd like to preach a message that I've simply entitled, He Offered Himself.

66
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,299
He offered Himself.

67
00:04:57,299 --> 00:05:02,859
In fact, as you read the latter part of verse number 26, it will not be part of our, we

68
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:04,459
won't get that far this morning.

69
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:08,540
But in verse number 26, the latter part says, But now once in the end of the world hath

70
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:15,140
He appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.

71
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,059
So this morning, as we look at this subject matter, He offered Himself.

72
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:21,380
I want you to notice, first of all, the pattern of the tabernacle.

73
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,339
In verses one through five, the writer of Hebrews is going to remind, of course, these

74
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:29,059
Jewish believers to be very familiar with this truth that's being presented.

75
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:32,700
Many times, obviously, I spent some time a couple of years ago on Wednesday evening

76
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,500
teaching through the tabernacle and all the aspects of the tabernacle, but we don't have

77
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,140
a tabernacle, we don't have that process, and we're maybe not as familiar with some

78
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,619
of those things that these Jewish believers would have had a keen understanding of.

79
00:05:48,619 --> 00:05:54,019
Of course, as we study the Word of God, we're able to gain that understanding, and we begin

80
00:05:54,019 --> 00:06:00,540
to notice how that immediately the writer of Hebrews deals with the pattern of the tabernacle.

81
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:05,420
Notice immediately in verse number two, he says, There was a tabernacle made, the first,

82
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,760
wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the showbread, which is called the sanctuary.

83
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,279
And so immediately what the writer is doing, he's coming into focus of the tabernacle.

84
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:18,899
We know that there's an outer court, but he's dealing specifically not with the outer court,

85
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:23,619
he's dealing with the tabernacle proper, and in verse number two, what is in focus is the

86
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:28,660
holy place, that first place of entrance that the priest would go into.

87
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,540
Of course, you have the entrance into the outer court, the brazen altar, the laver,

88
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,339
and then you have the holy place, as it was often referred to as, and they would go in

89
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:40,579
there daily, and they would minister, and we'll see even in the passage how he deals

90
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:41,579
with that.

91
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:46,899
And so we find that this particular holy place, the first section of the tabernacle proper

92
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:54,339
was 30 by 15 by 15, that was the size of this place of ministry, and we find that,

93
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:58,299
he says, which is called the sanctuary, and then in verse number three, he says, And after

94
00:06:58,299 --> 00:07:03,140
the second veil, the tabernacle, which is called the holiest of all.

95
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:10,140
And so we find that now the writer will go into the holy of holies, as we've often referred

96
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,019
to it as, and begin to give us some instruction.

97
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:19,100
And we find that what's happening, really, is what becomes clearly in view in these first

98
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:25,420
five verses of Hebrews 9, is what was accomplished on the day of atonement.

99
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:30,779
And that's why the scripture is given to us the way that it is, and the details that are

100
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:34,980
provided is because the author wants to deal with that subject matter of the day of atonement,

101
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,940
and what was accomplished there.

102
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,899
And we know that as we read through, in verse number four, it says, Which had the golden

103
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:44,500
censer in the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden

104
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:50,059
pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant, verse five,

105
00:07:50,059 --> 00:07:56,380
and over it the cherubims of glory, shadowing the mercy seat of which we cannot now speak

106
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,299
particularly.

107
00:07:58,299 --> 00:08:02,980
And so we find that as we look at the holy place, and the holy of holies, in that first

108
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:08,260
chamber, if you will, the holy place, you would have as you entered in, on your left-hand

109
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:12,500
side would be the candlestick, on the right-hand side would be the table of showbread, and

110
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,540
straight ahead of you, before you would enter that second veil that goes in the holy of

111
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,059
holies, you would have the altar of incense.

112
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:23,420
Those are the three pieces of furniture that were in the holy place.

113
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:29,059
We find that it's interesting that in our text of scripture, in verse number two, that

114
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:32,619
he does not mention the altar of incense.

115
00:08:32,619 --> 00:08:37,900
Again, we understand that he's dealing with the day of atonement as we look through the

116
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,299
passage, and we'll find that he mentions, as he talks about the holy of holies, there's

117
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,219
only one piece of furniture in there, the ark of the covenant with the mercy seat, right?

118
00:08:46,219 --> 00:08:48,419
That was what was in the holy of holies.

119
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:54,219
The priest could only enter once a year, and we find that they better go with blood.

120
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:59,340
And we find that as they would go in, notice in verse number four, the Bible says, which

121
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,099
had the golden censer.

122
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:06,500
He's not talking about the altar of incense, he's talking about the golden censer that

123
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:11,020
the priest would carry in when he'd go into the holy of holies, and that smoke, as he

124
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:17,780
would have that censer, that smoke would prevent him from gazing upon the glory of God that

125
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:24,020
would be there at the Shekinah glory, as we'd often refer to it as, with the ark of the

126
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,900
covenant and, as we notice, the mercy seat.

127
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:33,580
Now, it's interesting, when we look at the passage, there's some that would like to understand

128
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:38,140
the details of what's going on, but it's interesting that the passage at the end of

129
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,739
verse number five says, of which we cannot now speak particularly.

130
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:45,059
It's not that those things aren't important, but there's something more important.

131
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:50,179
Remember, the author has shared many times, and even will continue to deal with this subject

132
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:55,979
matter, that this is this earthly tabernacle, this one that they would have been aware of

133
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:59,979
from the Old Testament, that it was simply a picture, it was pointing, it was a title.

134
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:03,319
that was pointing to something far superior.

135
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:06,819
And so we find that he does deal with in v. 4

136
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:08,899
the contents of the Ark of the Covenant.

137
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,899
Notice there in v. 4 it says,

138
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:13,439
wherein was the golden pot that had manna,

139
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:17,019
and Aaron's rob that budded in the tables of the Covenant.

140
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:19,359
Now it's interesting that he mentions

141
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:22,519
these three items that were in the Ark of the Covenant

142
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,939
even though he says in v. 5

143
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:27,159
of which we cannot now speak particularly.

144
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,739
The reason why it's so interesting

145
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:32,219
is because what those three items represented.

146
00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:35,259
We find that as we think about the golden pot of manna,

147
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,299
we understand the provision of God

148
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:39,539
and we understand how that Jesus Christ

149
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,979
is the bread of life.

150
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:45,059
And we find that he gave that truth in the book of John

151
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:46,539
and he deals with that.

152
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:48,459
And so we see how that the picture

153
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:51,619
of what the contents of the Ark of the Covenant,

154
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:52,499
and he deals with that.

155
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:53,939
Then he deals with Aaron's rod.

156
00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:55,379
You'll remember from the Old Testament,

157
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:58,019
we deal with the rod and some of the division

158
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,619
that was going on and Aaron's rod budded, right?

159
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,499
It flourished, it produced,

160
00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:06,379
and we find that when you look at Aaron's rod,

161
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:10,099
it really represents the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

162
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:12,579
And what a joy to know that Jesus Christ

163
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,579
went to the cross of Calvary.

164
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:16,699
He was buried in a borrowed tomb,

165
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:20,739
but he rose in victory conquering sin, death, and the grave.

166
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:23,019
He is the risen Savior.

167
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:25,339
He ever liveth to make intercession for us.

168
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:27,499
And so when we think about the contents,

169
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:29,739
we see the pot of manna,

170
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:31,939
the golden pot that contained the manna

171
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:34,779
being representative of Jesus being the bread of life.

172
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:36,099
Aaron's rod that budded,

173
00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:40,099
the fact that Jesus rose in victory

174
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,979
as he conquered sin, death, and the grave.

175
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:44,619
And then you see that the law was there.

176
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:47,459
It says, and the tables of the covenant.

177
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:50,019
Now you remember that as we think about the law,

178
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:51,779
that it reveals really two things to us.

179
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,979
Number one, God's holiness and righteousness,

180
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:57,499
that holy standard in which he has set forth,

181
00:11:57,499 --> 00:11:59,739
and also man's sinfulness.

182
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:01,579
Remember as we looked last week

183
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:03,379
through the last several chapters,

184
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:05,299
in chapters 20 through 40,

185
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:07,319
I gave a very quick overview

186
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:09,219
of the latter part of the book of Exodus,

187
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:11,299
and we dealt with the law being given,

188
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:13,219
and how that it was agreed upon.

189
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:16,219
And they said all that the Lord has said we will do.

190
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:18,019
And then as Moses is up on the Mount

191
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:20,699
receiving the instruction with regard to the tabernacle,

192
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:21,539
what do they do?

193
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:23,899
They defile themselves and they break the very covenant

194
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:25,699
that they agreed to.

195
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:28,499
And we find that the law would represent

196
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:30,019
not only the holiness of God,

197
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:31,459
but the sinfulness of man.

198
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,499
And I think about that Ark of the Covenant

199
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:34,619
and the mercy seat.

200
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:35,699
And we think about the way in which

201
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:37,179
the Ark of the Covenant was there

202
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:38,299
and the contents,

203
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,419
and we think about the,

204
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:43,779
really it's a piece of furniture

205
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:47,819
that would represent judgment apart from the mercy seat.

206
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:49,419
The mercy seat completely covered it.

207
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:51,339
We know that the cherubims that were there,

208
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:52,899
and the blood that was applied,

209
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:55,059
and what a great truth that is given to us

210
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:56,939
of a picture again,

211
00:12:56,939 --> 00:13:01,939
the typology of what Jesus Christ would do who he is.

212
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:04,419
And so we find in the first five verses

213
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:07,379
that immediately the author begins to deal

214
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:10,139
with this pattern of the tabernacle.

215
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,459
He then deals with in verses six through 10

216
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,459
the purpose of the tabernacle.

217
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,099
You know God has a purpose in everything.

218
00:13:17,099 --> 00:13:17,939
Amen?

219
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:19,459
There are times in which we go through life

220
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:20,819
and we say why are we dealing with this?

221
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:21,899
Why is this going on?

222
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:22,739
Why that?

223
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:26,139
And the reality is that God has a purpose in everything.

224
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,579
And when he gave the instruction

225
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:28,899
with regard to the tabernacle,

226
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:30,619
he gave that first covenant.

227
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:33,139
He had a purpose in doing so.

228
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:34,539
And we find that of course,

229
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:36,859
the truth is being presented here.

230
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:41,139
It will culminate as we come to verses 11 through 14.

231
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:43,819
But notice how he reveals to us the purpose

232
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:45,419
in verses six through 10.

233
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:48,979
Again, the day of atonement comes in full view

234
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:50,579
here in verses six and seven.

235
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,419
Notice it says,

236
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:54,859
now when these things were thus ordained,

237
00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:57,899
the priest went always into the first tabernacle

238
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:59,779
accomplishing the service of God.

239
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:03,819
That's in the holy place where there was the candlestick,

240
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:05,939
the table of showbread and the altar of incense.

241
00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:07,099
They went in there daily.

242
00:14:07,099 --> 00:14:09,539
That was part of their ministry into the holy place.

243
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:11,139
And all that they did,

244
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:13,579
remember Hebrews 10 talks about they stood daily

245
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:16,019
offering the same offerings.

246
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,739
And they were doing these things and that was the work.

247
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,819
But then you come to verse number seven.

248
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:22,779
And he says,

249
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,979
but into the second,

250
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:26,819
what's he meaning?

251
00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:29,059
That second veil that separated the holy place

252
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:30,499
from the holy of holies,

253
00:14:30,499 --> 00:14:32,979
that place of ministry,

254
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:33,819
he says,

255
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:38,059
but into the second went the high priest alone

256
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:40,139
once every year,

257
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:41,759
not without blood,

258
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:44,359
which he offered for himself

259
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:47,679
and for the heirs of the people.

260
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,879
We don't have time this morning

261
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:52,639
to go back to Leviticus chapter number 16,

262
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,479
but we find that the emphasis here

263
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,399
that as we come to this passage of scripture

264
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,399
and we come to verses six and seven

265
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,199
would deal with this annual day of atonement

266
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:03,719
and all that is taking place.

267
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:07,239
And that's why he mentions back in verse number four,

268
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,719
as we talked about the golden censer,

269
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:11,759
that as he would on that day of atonement,

270
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,559
as he would go in,

271
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:16,699
he would take and he would make that offering,

272
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:19,659
but he would go with that golden censer

273
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:21,939
to be able to have that smoke fill

274
00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:23,099
so they did not see the glory

275
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:24,939
or gaze upon the glory of God.

276
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:27,459
Now it's interesting if you were to study Leviticus 16,

277
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,919
and I recommend that you read the passage of scripture,

278
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:32,239
it's very interesting all that had to happen

279
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:34,019
on the day of atonement.

280
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:36,939
This was the highest of all holy days

281
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:38,379
for the nation of Israel.

282
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:40,279
And we find that on that particular day,

283
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:42,179
you understand that the high priest,

284
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:45,539
that he was arrayed in beautiful garment, right?

285
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:49,539
I mean, just the glory of the garments of the high priest.

286
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:51,299
But on that particular day,

287
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:54,259
you know that he took off those garments

288
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:57,619
and he put on a linen garment to be able to go in.

289
00:15:57,619 --> 00:15:59,539
When you think about the Lord Jesus Christ

290
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:01,819
as the passage will come in verse number 11,

291
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:04,659
and you think about how Jesus set aside his glory

292
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:06,819
that he had for all of eternity,

293
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:09,939
and he came to this sin-cursed world.

294
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:13,219
We understand that he remained perfect and sinless.

295
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:15,939
He is God in flesh, he is the God-man.

296
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:18,619
But there's so many wonderful parallels that you see

297
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:21,259
as you begin to study the way in which God

298
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:23,779
would give the purpose and the typology

299
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:26,499
of these Old Testament events

300
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:28,739
and how they would point to Jesus Christ.

301
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,699
Notice as he talks about in verse number six,

302
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:33,379
they were always in the first tabernacle.

303
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:34,979
This was a continual thing every day.

304
00:16:34,979 --> 00:16:36,379
And by the way, I mentioned this before,

305
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:38,419
there's no seat, there's no chair,

306
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:40,979
there's no furniture that would give rest

307
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:43,139
to these priests as they would minister.

308
00:16:43,859 --> 00:16:46,499
This was something that was always done in the first,

309
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:49,179
but then in the second, they can only go once a year.

310
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:52,939
But you understand that throughout the history of Israel,

311
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:56,219
that would mean that there were many, many times

312
00:16:56,219 --> 00:16:57,899
in which the high priest would enter

313
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:01,739
into the Holy of Holies on the Day of Atonement.

314
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:04,219
We find that as we come to verse number eight,

315
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:06,179
the Bible says the Holy Ghost,

316
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:11,139
this signifying that the way into the holiest of all

317
00:17:11,139 --> 00:17:13,459
was not yet made manifest

318
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:17,899
while as the first tabernacle was yet standing.

319
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:20,499
We find that again, the figure,

320
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:21,939
as we come to verse number nine,

321
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:24,099
notice the verbage that is used,

322
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:26,499
which was a figure, notice this,

323
00:17:26,499 --> 00:17:30,139
for the time then present.

324
00:17:30,139 --> 00:17:33,299
Remember Paul as he's writing to the believers in Galatia,

325
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:34,899
in that region of Galatia,

326
00:17:34,899 --> 00:17:36,779
the churches that were established there,

327
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:39,459
we find that he says that when the fullness of time was come,

328
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,579
God sent forth His Son.

329
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:43,819
And we find that He sent Him forth,

330
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:44,859
Jesus came, why?

331
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:47,499
To die for the sins of the world.

332
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,979
And we find here that He mentions that this,

333
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:51,659
this Old Testament tabernacle,

334
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:53,299
the pattern that we're looking at

335
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:54,779
in these first five verses,

336
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:57,339
the Day of Atonement, all of the sacrifice,

337
00:17:57,339 --> 00:17:58,499
all that was done,

338
00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:03,499
this was a figure for the time then present.

339
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:05,379
Notice the rest of verse number nine,

340
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:08,659
in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices

341
00:18:08,699 --> 00:18:13,379
that could not make Him that did the service perfect

342
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:16,659
as pertaining to the conscience,

343
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:19,499
which stood only in meats and drinks

344
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:22,859
and divers washings and cardinal ordinances

345
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:24,499
imposed on them,

346
00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:26,259
notice the last part of verse number 10,

347
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:30,419
until the time of reformation.

348
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,099
Until the time of reformation.

349
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:34,059
We'll be talking about really what's in view here

350
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:36,139
is that new covenant that we dealt with

351
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:37,500
at the end of chapter number eight

352
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,219
in verses six through 13,

353
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,500
this time of reformation,

354
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,459
the fact that Jesus would come

355
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:47,380
and completely fulfill that which was prophesied,

356
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,779
all of the types would be fulfilled in Jesus Christ

357
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:53,139
when He would come to this sin-cursed world,

358
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:55,219
when He would live a perfect sinless life,

359
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:57,820
He would go to the cross of Calvary, die,

360
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,299
He would be buried in a borrowed tomb

361
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:00,979
and He'd rise in victory.

362
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:02,699
And what He accomplished,

363
00:19:02,699 --> 00:19:04,419
as we study throughout the passage,

364
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:05,500
we've already dealt with a little bit

365
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,459
in chapter number eight,

366
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:08,659
He accomplished for us

367
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:10,899
what that Old Testament system

368
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,979
could never accomplish.

369
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,299
Now, think about the recipients,

370
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:19,339
the original recipients of the book of Hebrews.

371
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:22,459
Think about the influence

372
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:25,179
and the pull to go back into Judaism

373
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:26,260
and all that's going on,

374
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,779
and we understand that that's what's going on

375
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:30,739
at the time of the writing of the book of Hebrews,

376
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:34,260
and now God is giving them truth again.

377
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,899
The truth that is given,

378
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,940
He's providing evidence after evidence

379
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,979
and He's saying, listen, look at the old

380
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:42,219
and look at what Christ did, look at this,

381
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:43,899
you're familiar with this,

382
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:47,619
but let me show you that we have a great high priest,

383
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,260
we have our high priest,

384
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,019
he didn't just enter through the veil,

385
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:52,859
he entered into the heavens, right?

386
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,619
We've dealt with that already,

387
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:57,579
and so we find that he continues to hammer the point

388
00:19:57,579 --> 00:19:59,619
and we find that he deals with the purpose,

389
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:01,619
it was a great high priest.

390
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:08,739
figure for the time present, until the time of Reformation. And so therefore we

391
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:13,459
know that that Old Testament system, if you look at the passage in verses 8

392
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:18,439
through 10, I believe that one word that we could use to summarize is that it was

393
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:24,539
temporary. Amen? It was temporary. Notice, in fact, at the beginning of verse

394
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:29,339
number 1 of chapter number 10, the Bible says, for the law having a shadow of good

395
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:34,339
things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never, with those

396
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:39,259
sacrifices which they offered year by year continually, make the comers thereunto

397
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:45,739
perfect. And so we find that it was a temporary system. We understand, remember,

398
00:20:45,739 --> 00:20:49,259
as we looked at chapter number 8, the problem with the old, God found fault

399
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:58,699
with them. They broke the covenant, them being Israel. So we come to the passage

400
00:20:58,699 --> 00:21:02,579
and we see the pattern of the tabernacle. We see the purpose of the

401
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:07,699
tabernacle, but then we see the payment for sin. And what a great contrast that

402
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:11,379
takes place in verse number 11. Again, as we come to the culmination of the

403
00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:15,419
argument and the presentation that is made, we find that the verse begins in

404
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:22,179
verse number 11, but Christ. But Christ. And we see that these people, they would

405
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:25,979
have been familiar with who Jesus Christ was. We understand that the book of

406
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:31,499
Hebrews has presented Jesus as being superior. He's better. It doesn't matter

407
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:37,059
what you put him next to, he's superior, amen? He is greater. Remember, during his

408
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:39,899
earthly ministry, there were some that said, is there a greater than Solomon

409
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:45,939
here? Yes, indeed! The Lord Jesus Christ, amen? And so we come here to verse number

410
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:51,859
11 and it says, but Christ, being come and high priest of good things to come. Again,

411
00:21:51,939 --> 00:21:57,139
what all of that Old Testament system was pointing to was something that was

412
00:21:57,139 --> 00:22:02,899
better. This is temporary. No doubt as they were living in it and going through

413
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:08,419
it day by day and all that they did, they understood that one day that Messiah

414
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:16,220
would come. It was temporary. But now Christ. But Christ being come and a high

415
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,539
priest of good things to come. These things have come, notice what he says in

416
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:26,259
verse number 11, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle. Not made with hands,

417
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:31,539
that is to say, not of this building. Remember back in chapter number 8 and

418
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:35,739
verse number 2, he says, a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle

419
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:40,459
which the Lord pitched and not man. And so we find that as we began chapter

420
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:44,619
number 9 that he says that verily the first covenant had also ordinances of

421
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:49,539
divine service in a worldly sanctuary. Now he's going to talk about this

422
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:53,860
greater and more perfect tabernacle that's not made with hands, that is to

423
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,539
say, not of this building. Again, as we've made note throughout the last several

424
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:02,860
passages of the book of Hebrews, how that this was a the tabernacle that the

425
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:07,619
children of Israel would be aware of, that God used Moses and the children of

426
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:11,779
Israel to pitch, as it's read there in chapter number 40 of the book of Exodus,

427
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:18,139
it followed a pattern. Remember, the Lord said to Moses, he gave him the

428
00:23:18,139 --> 00:23:24,059
pattern, don't deviate. It's extremely important that every detail was followed

429
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:30,419
exactly. Why? Because of what it represented. God didn't just tell Moses,

430
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:34,819
go build a tabernacle and put these things in it, however you do it, do it. No.

431
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:39,339
It's very specific, very detailed. We understand that our God is a God of

432
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:43,019
order, he's a God of purpose, and we find that he's given those things and now we

433
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:47,379
come to Christ. He's a high priest of good things to come. Notice in verse

434
00:23:47,379 --> 00:23:52,659
number 12, the Bible says this, neither by the blood of goats and calves. Can you

435
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:59,139
imagine during the entire Old Testament era, after the law had been given, all of

436
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:03,500
those sacrifices that were made daily and then annually on the Day of

437
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,699
Atonement, as the Day of Atonement is in view here in the passage of Scripture,

438
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:10,419
and you think about all of the blood of the goats and the calves and all that

439
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:14,259
was done, and you look throughout the Old Testament and you read all of that and

440
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:18,979
all of those offerings, but you find that there's a contrast. He says not in that

441
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:25,619
manner, neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, the precious

442
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:34,540
blood of Christ. The Bible says that by his own blood, he entered in once into

443
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:40,940
the holy place. The high priest, he had to go into the Holy of Holies every year.

444
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:47,899
Yes, he could only go once a year, but he had to go every year. And obviously what

445
00:24:47,899 --> 00:24:53,339
is in view here in the verbiage that is used is that by his own blood, he entered

446
00:24:53,339 --> 00:25:00,979
in once for all. No longer, no more necessary for another offering to be

447
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:06,540
made because he did it once. And we find that he says that he went in once into

448
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:13,260
the holy place. Notice what the Bible says, having obtained eternal redemption

449
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:18,019
for us. Isn't that wonderful? You understand the payment for sin, you

450
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:21,540
understand what was accomplished through the offering of the Lord Jesus Christ

451
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:26,739
when he offered himself. Remember, as we look back at the old system, as

452
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:30,660
we look at that temporary system that was mentioned in the first ten verses of

453
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:35,299
Hebrews 9, we find that the Bible told us in verse number seven, but into the

454
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:38,940
second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he

455
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,540
offered for himself. Remember, Jesus didn't have to offer it for himself. He

456
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:47,459
was sinless, the just for the unjust. It continues and says, and for the errors

457
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:50,660
of the people. But then you come to verse number nine and it says, which was a

458
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:56,019
figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and

459
00:25:56,019 --> 00:26:03,339
sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to

460
00:26:03,339 --> 00:26:10,419
the conscience. But Jesus, after he made that offering, he obtained eternal

461
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:17,739
redemption for us. Isn't that precious? You think about the truth we've mentioned as

462
00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:22,260
we studied this book already about the subject of eternal security. There are

463
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,419
some that have looked at the sixth chapter of the book of Hebrews and sought

464
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:29,220
to teach something otherwise than eternal security, and the reality is that

465
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,940
we mentioned as we study that portion of Scripture that we must always interpret

466
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:39,419
the obscure by the obvious, and we must always go to interpret Scripture by

467
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:43,019
Scripture and look at the whole of Scripture, not build a doctrine off of a

468
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:47,779
single verse of Scripture, but interpret that verse in the light of all of

469
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:53,139
Scripture. And we find that as book ends between the truth that is given in

470
00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:57,540
Hebrews chapter number six, we read how the Bible said in Hebrews 5 and verse

471
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:03,019
number 9, and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation

472
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:09,260
unto all them that obey him. We find that as we come to verse number 19 of chapter

473
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:13,779
number 6, the Bible says, which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure

474
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:19,699
and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil. We find now in

475
00:27:19,699 --> 00:27:24,459
Hebrews 9 in verse number 12, the Bible says that he's obtained eternal

476
00:27:24,459 --> 00:27:31,339
redemption for us. Aren't you thankful that he obtained eternal redemption for

477
00:27:31,339 --> 00:27:36,100
us? What a great gift. The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our

478
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,579
Lord, Romans 6 and verse number 23. We understand the Bible says that the front

479
00:27:40,579 --> 00:27:45,380
of that verse, the first aspect of that verse, for the wage of sin is death, but

480
00:27:45,619 --> 00:27:51,059
a conjunction, the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. And

481
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:55,739
we find here that as we look at what he obtained for us, what was accomplished on

482
00:27:55,739 --> 00:28:01,820
the cross of Calvary, he entered in once. Notice in verse number 24 and 25 of our

483
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:06,699
text of Hebrews 9, the Bible says, for Christ is not entered into the holy

484
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:11,199
places made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into heaven

485
00:28:11,199 --> 00:28:16,119
itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us, nor yet that he should offer

486
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:21,679
himself often as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year

487
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:28,720
with blood of others. No, Jesus once for all, right? We sing the song, great hymn,

488
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,040
and we look here and we find that this was not something that he did that had

489
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,679
to be done often or repeated. Unfortunately, there are some religions

490
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:40,960
today that would teach that when you observe the Lord's Supper, that Jesus is

491
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:49,000
being crucified afresh. That's wicked. It's ungodly. Amen? The reality is that

492
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,960
it was once for all. Jesus made one sacrifice for sin forever, Hebrews 10 and

493
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,719
verse number 12. We'll get there in a few weeks, but we find the payment for sin. We

494
00:28:58,719 --> 00:29:03,359
find what Christ accomplished for us. Again, remember as we're looking at the

495
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:06,719
whole of the section, the book of Hebrews that we're dealing with, we're talking

496
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:11,440
about the superiority of the priesthood of Jesus Christ, what he accomplished

497
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:17,440
that the old could not accomplish. The old having to constantly be going back

498
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,719
and constantly making these offerings. In fact, as we would think about the Old

499
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:28,400
Testament sacrificial system, it was a constant reminder of sin. Amen? I mean,

500
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,080
constantly reminded of sin. However, we would find that the sacrificial

501
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:40,839
offering of Jesus Christ once for all offers remission for sin. What a blessing

502
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:44,719
to think about the remission of sin and the fact that we have that truth. In fact,

503
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:50,520
Romans 3 deals with that. We see how that we have this great truth and we see what

504
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:56,359
he obtained for us, eternal redemption. By the way, there's nothing you can do to

505
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:02,919
add to what Jesus already took care of. Amen? He's paid it all.

506
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:08,999
There are people that live on this earth today that are trying somehow to earn their own

507
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:14,719
righteousness, to make it their own way, and to follow some creed or some religion.

508
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:20,879
But the reality is that Jesus, after He made one sacrifice for sin forever, when He entered

509
00:30:20,879 --> 00:30:27,179
into the holy place once with His blood, He obtained for us eternal redemption.

510
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:29,119
For us.

511
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:34,319
So we find that He's writing to believers, these Jewish believers.

512
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,559
Of course, as we're reading it this morning, as those that have trusted the Lord Jesus

513
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,159
Christ, you can rejoice in the fact that you have eternal redemption, aren't you thankful

514
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:44,679
that you're redeemed?

515
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:46,599
We sing the song, Redeemed?

516
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:48,399
How I love to proclaim it.

517
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,399
Redeemed how?

518
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:51,279
There's only one way, by the blood of the Lamb.

519
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,279
Right?

520
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:53,679
It's what the songwriter said.

521
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,319
We know that the songwriter was basing his song and the lyrics of his song based on

522
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:59,359
Scripture.

523
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:06,759
There's a song that we've had as special music in the past, I'm Forgiven Forever.

524
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:12,239
That truth of redemption and being redeemed, what a joy.

525
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:15,439
You know, there are a lot of people today in our world that they don't know what redemption

526
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:17,479
is.

527
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:18,879
They've not yet been redeemed.

528
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:24,799
In fact, if you talk to them about being redeemed or redemption, they may not have a clear understanding

529
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,559
of what that even means.

530
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:32,479
We have the great privilege, remember as we dealt with last week in chapter number eight

531
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:36,399
about that new covenant and how it relates to the believers.

532
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,599
We said, look at how it relates to Israel, but then look at how it relates to individual

533
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:41,599
believers.

534
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:47,359
And as Paul gave us the truth in second Corinthians chapters three and four, he's given us the

535
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:49,919
ministry of reconciliation.

536
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,319
He's given us the opportunity to be ministers of this new covenant.

537
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:56,439
What a blessing that is.

538
00:31:56,439 --> 00:31:57,559
And guess what?

539
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:58,559
That's our duty.

540
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,919
That's our responsibility.

541
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,399
We see that the days are evil.

542
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:05,519
We see that there's many things that are taking place in our world today, just as they were

543
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,559
evil in the days in which these recipients were receiving this truth.

544
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:17,439
And to understand what Christ accomplished for us, and understanding this morning that

545
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:22,719
it wasn't just for our sins, but for the sins of the world, that we have the privilege of

546
00:32:22,719 --> 00:32:25,719
taking that message to a lost and dying world.

547
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:26,719
What a great joy.

548
00:32:26,719 --> 00:32:32,719
Notice as we continue in verses 13 and 14, it's interesting how the verses start and

549
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:38,319
again the contrast to show and indicate clearly the superiority of the offering of the Lord

550
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:39,479
Jesus Christ.

551
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:43,799
We find in verse 13 it starts with, for if the blood of bulls and of goats, and dealing

552
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:48,639
with again that Old Testament sacrificial system, and understanding that this is what

553
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:50,519
was accomplished through that.

554
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:55,159
Notice the way that verse 14 starts, how much more?

555
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:58,999
Read it in its entirety with me in verse 13, the Bible says, for if the blood of bulls

556
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:04,399
and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctify it to the purifying of

557
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,399
the flesh.

558
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:07,799
That was what God prescribed, amen?

559
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:13,079
That was as they followed the pattern that God had prescribed in the Old Testament, as

560
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:18,679
they observed the Day of Atonement, and of course as you look at all of the other sacrifices

561
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:23,239
and offerings that were made in the Old Testament, you look at that, that was what God had prescribed.

562
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:28,679
And as that high priest did his duty on the Day of Atonement, as he would go into the

563
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:33,679
Holy of Holies and he would make that sacrifice, he'd come back out with the, and then go back

564
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,679
in a second time, and as he would go through all of the process in which he's going through,

565
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:42,679
we find that as, if he came out alive, things were good, amen?

566
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:47,999
And we find that God's wrath was appeased, God was satisfied with the fact that they

567
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:50,119
were following what he had prescribed.

568
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:55,439
It was a picture, though, it was a type, and we find that as we come to the New Testament,

569
00:33:55,439 --> 00:34:00,799
we find that as we look at the fulfillment, that here it says, how much more, verse number

570
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,079
14, shall the blood of Christ, I mean, if the blood of bulls and of calves could do

571
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:11,919
this, of goats and calves, excuse me, could do this, how much more shall the blood of

572
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:20,599
Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience

573
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:25,699
from dead works to serve the living God?

574
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:30,439
No longer is that Old Testament sacrificial system required.

575
00:34:30,439 --> 00:34:34,599
In fact, we'd find that now it would be referred to as being dead works.

576
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:40,119
We find that as we read Isaiah chapter number 53, a great messianic prophecy regarding the

577
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:44,519
suffering of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and what he would obtain for us, we find that

578
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:52,039
the Bible tells us that God was satisfied with the offering of his Son, that he was

579
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:54,679
pleased with the offering of his Son.

580
00:34:54,679 --> 00:35:01,079
As Jesus Christ, God in flesh, as he went and he made that offering, as he offered himself

581
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:05,879
without spot to God, he did purge our conscience from dead works.

582
00:35:05,879 --> 00:35:10,719
He did give us, he obtained for us this eternal redemption that is spoken of in verse number

583
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:12,399
12.

584
00:35:12,399 --> 00:35:17,079
We find that he ends verse number 14, speaking about the fact that not only did he purge

585
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:22,159
your conscience from dead works, it says here, to serve the living God.

586
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:28,159
As we think about the way in which Christ came and fulfilled the types that are represented

587
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:33,999
in this Old Covenant, in this Old Testament sacrificial system, we find that as he completely

588
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:40,999
fulfilled those types, that really what happened is he rendered it no longer necessary.

589
00:35:41,999 --> 00:35:43,839
Amen?

590
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:47,679
The type isn't necessary if the real thing has come.

591
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:48,879
Amen?

592
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:51,159
Glory to God!

593
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:55,359
So what he has done, the author now, as he's writing and he's going through, we find that

594
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:01,239
he's speaking to these Jewish believers and he's saying to these Jewish believers, listen,

595
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:03,999
we have a great high priest.

596
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:06,699
We have a better priest.

597
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:11,319
We have the Son of God, Jesus Christ, and here's what he's done.

598
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:13,119
Here's what he's accomplished.

599
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,919
Here's his ministry.

600
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:17,799
And here's what that means.

601
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:21,159
That old system is no longer needed.

602
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,759
It's no longer necessary.

603
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:28,199
And so don't think about going back to Judaism.

604
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:30,759
Don't think about going back to that old way.

605
00:36:30,759 --> 00:36:33,399
Because it's useless.

606
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,279
It served its purpose.

607
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:36,279
Amen?

608
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:40,319
And in serving its purpose, it pointed to Messiah.

609
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:41,319
And he fulfilled it.

610
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:47,439
I think about the truth of the Scriptures and you look at the whole of the ministry

611
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:51,239
of the Lord Jesus Christ and you understand what he did.

612
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:55,119
He said this in Matthew 5 and verse number 17, think not that I am come to destroy the

613
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,479
law or the prophets.

614
00:36:56,479 --> 00:37:00,599
I am not come to destroy but to fulfill.

615
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:04,879
And he fulfilled everything that needed to be fulfilled.

616
00:37:04,879 --> 00:37:08,039
You think about the book of Ruth.

617
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:09,439
It's just a short little book.

618
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:13,879
It's really still dealing with the period of the judges as you find that reference in

619
00:37:13,879 --> 00:37:16,079
the beginning of the book of Ruth.

620
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:21,159
And we're certainly familiar with all that takes place in that book and just four chapters.

621
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:26,679
But it's very interesting as you think about Boaz as he's made aware of what's taking

622
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:27,679
place.

623
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:28,679
You come to the third chapter.

624
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:34,959
Remember, we made this point of reference several weeks ago as we were studying through

625
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:41,119
the book of Hebrews in the sixth chapter and we dealt with the fact that what was in view

626
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,879
was the fact that he is our kinsman redeemer.

627
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:52,599
We talk about the fact of what he was able to accomplish for us and in the book of Ruth

628
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:59,799
in the third chapter, we find that Boaz is made aware of all that was going on and all

629
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:05,759
of the situation and we find that he says this in chapter number three and verse number

630
00:38:05,759 --> 00:38:10,479
12, and now it is true that I am thy near kinsman, albeit there is a kinsman nearer

631
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:11,839
than I.

632
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,759
You see, you know what had to happen there in Ruth, and we don't have time to develop

633
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,639
all of it, but you know what had to happen?

634
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:21,919
He had to follow that which was given in the law.

635
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:26,439
Boaz ensured that the law was fulfilled before he redeemed Ruth.

636
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:27,439
It was necessary.

637
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:32,639
They had to follow the process that had been prescribed by the Lord there in the Old Testament,

638
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:38,799
but we find that as we look at the truth of the book of Ruth and we find that as Jesus

639
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:44,639
is our kinsman redeemer in that picture that is given here in the book of Ruth, that that

640
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:49,919
relative that he went to that was a nearer kinsman, what happened?

641
00:38:49,919 --> 00:38:52,760
He said, no, I can't, right?

642
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,760
I can't.

643
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,039
Now, think about this and think about the picture and the type, if you will, that the

644
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:03,959
relative that cannot give you rest is the law, amen?

645
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:12,200
It can't, it can't give life, it condemns, but thank God that Jesus Christ fulfilled

646
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,899
all that needed to be fulfilled in order to redeem us, isn't that wonderful?

647
00:39:16,899 --> 00:39:20,519
And we come here to chapter number nine of the book of Hebrews and we see how that he

648
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:26,239
offered himself and again, the pattern of the old and the pattern of the tabernacle

649
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:32,159
and the purpose of the tabernacle, it served a purpose.

650
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:37,440
Those Jews that were following all of that Old Testament sacrificial system, they were

651
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,739
constantly reminded of their sin, they were constantly reminded of the fact that one day

652
00:39:42,739 --> 00:39:45,200
Messiah would come.

653
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,239
We think about the Passover, right?

654
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:50,459
Paul says, Christ, our Passover.

655
00:39:50,459 --> 00:39:54,479
We see how that the Old Testament is pointing to Messiah.

656
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:59,059
Unfortunately, in a certain sense, we looked at it last week in chapter number eight as

657
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:02,899
we dealt with the truth of the new covenant, the Jewish people.

658
00:40:02,899 --> 00:40:14,499
a nation rejected Messiah. Because of that, we were grafted in. Amen? So we come

659
00:40:14,499 --> 00:40:19,139
to Hebrews chapter number nine. So, okay, this is wonderful. What do we do with

660
00:40:19,139 --> 00:40:24,259
this? Well, number one, rejoice. Amen? I rejoice that I'm not in that Old

661
00:40:24,259 --> 00:40:28,099
Testament sacrificial system. If you read the book of Leviticus and you read all

662
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:31,819
of that stuff that's going on, I mean, that's a, I mean, yes, I'm thankful that

663
00:40:31,819 --> 00:40:36,139
God gave it and the purpose in which it fulfilled, but I'm thankful to be on this

664
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:43,539
side of Calvary. Amen? But I will say this, there's something interesting about

665
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:49,459
the Old Testament system in the fact that it was a reminder of sin daily,

666
00:40:49,459 --> 00:40:54,899
they're reminded of their sin, that sometimes in this new system we can kind

667
00:40:54,899 --> 00:41:03,779
of forget about the fact that we too sin. Believers sin. Amen? And what happens

668
00:41:03,779 --> 00:41:11,699
when we sin? Our fellowship with God is hindered. Right? That's biblical. We find

669
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:15,739
it in first John chapter number one, we understand the truth of fellowship that

670
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:19,979
is given throughout that passage of Scripture, and sometimes because it's

671
00:41:19,979 --> 00:41:23,579
under the blood, because we're on this side of Calvary and we're not having to

672
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:27,419
go through that Old Testament sacrificial system, sometimes we're not

673
00:41:27,419 --> 00:41:35,059
as aware of our sin as we really need to be. Sometimes we go through life and we

674
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:41,339
don't confess our sin as we should. I'm thankful that He's faithful and just to

675
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:45,299
forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness, but it says if we

676
00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:49,299
confess our sins, right? It's a conditional, I'm thankful I'm forgiven

677
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:53,739
forever, I'm going to heaven, it has no bearing on my security as a child of God,

678
00:41:53,739 --> 00:41:59,699
but it has everything to do with my fellowship with God. How's my fellowship

679
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:03,979
with God? How's your fellowship with God? Is there something between, the songwriter

680
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:08,299
said, nothing between my soul and my Savior. I'm thankful that He obtained

681
00:42:08,299 --> 00:42:13,579
eternal redemption for us and I'm thankful that He is superior and we look

682
00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:16,459
at all of this evidence and we look at all of this truth and we say this is

683
00:42:16,459 --> 00:42:21,059
wonderful and we're rejoicing in it, but I also take away from the passage of

684
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:26,459
Scripture that I need not to make the mistake of resting and thinking that

685
00:42:26,459 --> 00:42:30,579
no longer do I need to be concerned with my fellowship with God on a

686
00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:34,859
daily basis. The psalmist said, if I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord

687
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:40,619
will not hear me. And we find that here is we would look at this truth and we

688
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:44,859
couple it with that in 1st John and all that's going on there with the truth of

689
00:42:44,859 --> 00:42:51,459
walking in the light as He is in the light. This morning we don't have that

690
00:42:51,459 --> 00:42:55,939
Old Testament sacrificial system that reminds us every day of our sin, but you

691
00:42:55,939 --> 00:43:00,539
know what we have? We have the Holy Spirit of God that indwells us. They

692
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:03,739
didn't have the Holy Spirit of God that indwelled them. We have the Holy Spirit

693
00:43:03,739 --> 00:43:07,259
of God that indwells us. You know what the Holy Spirit of God will do in your

694
00:43:07,259 --> 00:43:11,699
life? He'll convict you. Amen? How many of you

695
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:15,259
experience it? Don't show me your hands, but you know, amen? The conviction of the

696
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:20,819
Holy Spirit of God. By the way, that's a good thing. It's good to be convicted of

697
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:26,739
your sin, and it's good to be aware of the fact that we need to confess our sin

698
00:43:26,739 --> 00:43:31,139
and we need to understand that our fellowship can be restored. Remember

699
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:35,939
David as he prayed, as he made confession in Psalm 51, he says,

700
00:43:35,939 --> 00:43:44,179
return unto me the joy of my salvation. He had sinned greatly. He's confessing

701
00:43:44,179 --> 00:43:48,739
his sin, and he's saying to the Lord, return unto me the joy of my salvation.

702
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:52,299
D. L. Moody said, this book will keep you from sin, or sin will keep you from this

703
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:57,859
book. And unfortunately, sometimes what happens is we have, as the book of

704
00:43:57,859 --> 00:44:05,419
Hebrews has already warned us, hardened hearts. And we're not as in tune with the

705
00:44:05,419 --> 00:44:10,659
Holy Spirit of God and the conviction of the Holy Spirit of God. The Bible

706
00:44:10,659 --> 00:44:14,419
talks about the fact that we can grieve the Holy Spirit of God. The Bible talks

707
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:19,179
about the fact that we can quench the Holy Spirit of God. That's dangerous,

708
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:26,019
dangerous territory to be in. Oh, that we'd be sensitive, that we would have the

709
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:30,019
theme of that song, that there would be nothing between my soul and my Savior,

710
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:36,899
that I desire to walk right and to walk clean. David Gibbs made this statement

711
00:44:36,899 --> 00:44:40,539
several years ago. I heard him preaching, and it was such a powerful truth. He said,

712
00:44:40,539 --> 00:44:44,059
I don't want to, unfortunately, what happens sometimes in the life of

713
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:48,299
believers is they really don't want to be clean. They just want to be a little

714
00:44:48,299 --> 00:44:55,659
cleaner. What a great distinction. He said, I want to be clean. Amen? I want to have

715
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:58,699
nothing between my soul and my Savior. Lord, if there's something, remember the

716
00:44:58,939 --> 00:45:04,059
psalmist talks about this in Psalm 139, search me. Amen? Show me if there be any

717
00:45:04,059 --> 00:45:07,579
wicked way in me. So we have the Holy Spirit of God. Somebody gave this analogy.

718
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:11,059
It's not original with me. We think about the convicting work of the Holy Spirit

719
00:45:11,059 --> 00:45:15,339
of God, and they said that it seems like this as they use this analogy to explain

720
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:21,179
it, and they said if you can imagine a triangle in a sandbox. You take a

721
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:25,139
triangle, and you put it in the sandbox, and every time you rotate that triangle,

722
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:29,619
there's going to be friction, right? Because it's got three distinct points,

723
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:34,979
and so every time, if it's in the sand, it's always going to have friction, but

724
00:45:34,979 --> 00:45:40,059
eventually when it goes a full 360 degrees, what's there now instead of a

725
00:45:40,059 --> 00:45:46,579
triangle? A circle, and what can the triangle do within the circle? Can rotate

726
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:53,659
freely. All of a sudden, that friction is no longer there. When we get to that

727
00:45:53,699 --> 00:45:57,059
point where we grieve and quench the Holy Spirit of God, maybe it's times in

728
00:45:57,059 --> 00:46:00,459
that situation where we don't even sense the convicting work of the

729
00:46:00,459 --> 00:46:04,779
Holy Spirit of God. We find in the passage of Scripture, there's so much

730
00:46:04,779 --> 00:46:09,099
great truth for us as New Testament believers, and yes, we understand that He

731
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:14,539
has accomplished for us, He has obtained for us this eternal redemption, and we

732
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:18,939
have these great privileges that we looked at last week with regard to how

733
00:46:18,939 --> 00:46:23,579
the New Covenant relates to us as New Testament believers, but oh how we have

734
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:29,059
to understand that God has called us to be holy people. He's called us to be

735
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:33,339
holy. We find in the book of Leviticus, even within the whole of the Old

736
00:46:33,339 --> 00:46:36,699
Testament system, He deals with the fact of the importance of the children of

737
00:46:36,699 --> 00:46:41,219
Israel being holy. Why? Because God is holy, and I'll finish with this passage

738
00:46:41,219 --> 00:46:48,579
this morning in 1st Peter 1, in verses 13 through 16, and here's what the

739
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:53,019
writer Peter says to the believers that he's ministering to. He says,

740
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:58,059
Wherefore, gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the

741
00:46:58,059 --> 00:47:01,419
grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. Notice

742
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:08,099
in verse 14, As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the

743
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:13,579
former lust and your ignorance, but as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye

744
00:47:13,579 --> 00:47:21,299
holy in all manner of conversation, because it is written, Be holy, for I am

745
00:47:21,299 --> 00:47:29,299
holy. God's called us to holy living, and what a joy that He's obtained for us

746
00:47:29,299 --> 00:47:34,739
eternal redemption. We can have the rest of eternal security, but we

747
00:47:34,739 --> 00:47:37,979
understand that while we're here still on this earth, that I want that

748
00:47:38,019 --> 00:47:46,179
fellowship with God to be sweet. In His presence is fullness of joy. So the Bible

749
00:47:46,179 --> 00:47:50,979
tells us in the book of Psalms, and we find here that it's such an

750
00:47:50,979 --> 00:47:55,819
important thing that we understand this truth of what He's accomplished for

751
00:47:55,819 --> 00:47:59,739
us, but then as we enter into that relationship with Him, He's our Father

752
00:47:59,739 --> 00:48:06,419
and we're His children, and Peter says, As obedient children. There were times that

753
00:48:06,419 --> 00:48:10,259
I'll admit this morning that I was not an obedient child, physically speaking,

754
00:48:10,259 --> 00:48:15,419
and in those scenarios, in those times when I was living, yeah, you look at my

755
00:48:15,419 --> 00:48:20,819
parents, I know, they're here, that when you're a child and you're disobedient,

756
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:27,619
your fellowship with mom and dad isn't great, is it? Amen? I want my fellowship

757
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:33,659
with my Heavenly Father to be sweet as we walk with Him and talk with Him. Amen?

758
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:38,859
What a great joy, what a great privilege that He's given us. Remember, the Old

759
00:48:38,859 --> 00:48:45,259
Testament sacrificial system was a constant reminder of sin, while the

760
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:51,619
sacrificial offering of Jesus Christ once for all offers remission of sin, and

761
00:48:51,619 --> 00:48:57,339
what a joy that He obtained for us eternal redemption when He offered

762
00:48:57,339 --> 00:49:02,499
Himself. Amen? Let's pray. Father, we love you this morning, we thank you for loving

763
00:49:02,659 --> 00:49:10,219
us. We thank you, God, for the truth of Thy Word, the power of Thy Word. We thank you

764
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:21,179
for the privilege of being able to serve you. The way in wherein we serve you

765
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:27,459
today is greatly different than how those priests served in the Old Testament.

766
00:49:27,459 --> 00:49:34,139
We thank you for the truth of the royal priesthood, in that we are priests as we

767
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:38,579
believe in the individual priesthood of the believer. God, I pray that we would

768
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:45,899
offer unto you the sacrifice of our lips, giving praise unto Thy name, that we do

769
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:50,339
it continually. I pray, God, that we'd offer up ourselves as a living sacrifice

770
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:58,699
even as we see the truth in Romans 12, verses 1 and 2. Oh God, I pray this

771
00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:04,779
morning you'd help us to rejoice in that which has been accomplished

772
00:50:04,779 --> 00:50:08,659
accomplished at the cross of Calvary.

773
00:50:08,659 --> 00:50:13,259
How joyful we are to live on this side of Calvary.

774
00:50:13,259 --> 00:50:14,879
God, I pray that You'd help us to have

775
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:20,579
a keen awareness of our sin

776
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:23,899
and the impact that it has upon our fellowship.

777
00:50:23,899 --> 00:50:26,059
I'm thankful the Bible teaches us

778
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:31,019
the eternal security of the believer.

779
00:50:31,019 --> 00:50:35,979
Salvation is so much more than just going to heaven.

780
00:50:35,979 --> 00:50:39,899
It's the joy that we can experience even now

781
00:50:39,899 --> 00:50:42,339
as we walk with You

782
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:43,819
and enjoy Your presence

783
00:50:43,819 --> 00:50:46,619
and have that fullness of joy.

784
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:48,619
And God, I pray that there be nothing

785
00:50:48,619 --> 00:50:53,579
between my soul and my Savior.

786
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:57,479
Help us, Lord, to walk with You.

787
00:50:57,479 --> 00:51:00,959
Help us, Lord, to be ministers of this new covenant

788
00:51:00,959 --> 00:51:02,179
that we would share with those

789
00:51:02,179 --> 00:51:03,379
that we come in contact with

790
00:51:03,379 --> 00:51:04,499
and those divine appointments

791
00:51:04,499 --> 00:51:07,419
that You'd give us opportunity to testify

792
00:51:07,419 --> 00:51:11,499
of what Christ accomplished on the cross of Calvary

793
00:51:11,499 --> 00:51:13,619
and what He offers

794
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:18,259
to those that would come by way of the cross.

795
00:51:18,259 --> 00:51:19,939
Father, if there's one present this morning,

796
00:51:19,939 --> 00:51:22,099
if there's one that's watching via livestream

797
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:22,939
that does not know You

798
00:51:22,939 --> 00:51:25,179
as their personal Lord and Savior,

799
00:51:25,179 --> 00:51:26,019
if they're to die today,

800
00:51:26,019 --> 00:51:28,979
they do not have certainty that heaven is their home,

801
00:51:28,979 --> 00:51:30,659
it's our prayer that the Holy Spirit of God

802
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:32,799
can convict them of their sin,

803
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:34,879
convince them of Christ's righteousness

804
00:51:34,879 --> 00:51:37,039
and of judgment to come,

805
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:38,879
that they would trust the Lord Jesus Christ,

806
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,759
the finished work of Calvary,

807
00:51:40,759 --> 00:51:43,919
understanding that Jesus paid it all.

808
00:51:43,919 --> 00:51:44,759
It's done.

809
00:51:44,759 --> 00:51:45,939
He said it is finished.

810
00:51:47,399 --> 00:51:48,879
We pray, God, that You would use us

811
00:51:48,879 --> 00:51:49,859
for Your honor and glory.

812
00:51:49,859 --> 00:51:52,959
Help us to impact eternity with our lives.

813
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,119
Well, thank You for what You'll do.

814
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:55,359
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

815
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:56,199
Would You stand with me?

816
00:51:56,199 --> 00:51:57,739
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

817
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,279
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano

818
00:51:59,299 --> 00:52:00,739
and as she does, the altar's open.

819
00:52:00,739 --> 00:52:02,739
Make your seat and altar if you'd like.

820
00:52:03,659 --> 00:52:05,779
This morning, let us rejoice

821
00:52:06,699 --> 00:52:08,539
in what the Lord accomplished for us

822
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:09,619
on the cross of Calvary,

823
00:52:09,619 --> 00:52:12,939
having obtained eternal redemption for us.

824
00:52:13,859 --> 00:52:14,959
Maybe this morning,

825
00:52:16,939 --> 00:52:19,099
you would humbly admit,

826
00:52:19,099 --> 00:52:21,419
not to any man, but to God Himself,

827
00:52:21,419 --> 00:52:25,019
that there is something between you and your Savior.

828
00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:27,099
Maybe there's some sin that you need to confess

829
00:52:27,099 --> 00:52:29,559
and get right and have that joy

830
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:31,919
of your salvation restored.

831
00:52:31,919 --> 00:52:33,979
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
