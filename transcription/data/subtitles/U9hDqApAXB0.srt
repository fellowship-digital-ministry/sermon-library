1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
with a bad back today and unable to be here.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,579
And so if you'd pray for Doc,

3
00:00:04,579 --> 00:00:05,920
I know that he'd appreciate that.

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,719
The book of 3rd John,

5
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:10,659
the book of 3rd John all the way in the back of your Bible,

6
00:00:10,659 --> 00:00:13,119
3rd John, Jude and Revelation,

7
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,840
and just a very short letter, just 14 verses.

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,399
We're just gonna look at the first eight verses this morning

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,319
and I'm thankful that God has given us his word.

10
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm thankful that the Bible reveals God to mankind.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,840
I'm thankful that within the pages of this precious book,

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,759
that God has provided us with the details

13
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:36,439
regarding his plan.

14
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:38,319
I'm thankful that God has a plan.

15
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:40,159
And you know, have you ever had a plan

16
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:41,840
and somebody kind of messed with your plan

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,400
and kind of changed things up?

18
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,080
No one's gonna change God's plan.

19
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,360
I'm thankful that God has a plan

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,099
and his plan will come to pass.

21
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:53,520
And we find that within the pages of the Bible,

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,680
that God has also chosen to record for us

23
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,959
the interactions between God and man.

24
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,919
We find that obviously not all of the interactions

25
00:01:02,919 --> 00:01:05,120
between God and man are recorded

26
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,559
within the pages of this book,

27
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:10,720
but we do find that God has given us insight

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,720
as to how God had an impact in the lives of these believers,

29
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:18,220
those that we read of,

30
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,680
that we might refer to as the heroes of the faith

31
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,839
and what have you.

32
00:01:21,839 --> 00:01:26,500
We have the opportunity to be able to see how the truth,

33
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:30,220
how God's revelation had an impact in their lives.

34
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,699
We find, of course, this morning

35
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:33,099
that there are some Bible characters

36
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:34,779
that are more familiar than others.

37
00:01:34,779 --> 00:01:37,019
And if we were to go around the room this morning

38
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:38,779
and ask each individual that's here,

39
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:40,860
who is your favorite Bible character?

40
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,379
I'm sure we'd have a variety of answers,

41
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:45,779
but we'd probably have some duplicates as well

42
00:01:45,779 --> 00:01:49,379
because we have some characters within the Bible

43
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:50,660
that are very well known.

44
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,400
Others, like the one that we'll look at this morning,

45
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,019
there's not a whole lot that God tells us

46
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:58,059
about these individuals.

47
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:00,500
As we think about the first eight verses

48
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,419
to the short epistle of the book of 3 John,

49
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:07,660
we see and we note the testimony of a man named Gaius.

50
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,720
Now we see that there's a few other references

51
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,940
within the New Testament

52
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,740
to an individual holding the name Gaius.

53
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,539
It is really difficult for us to be able to tell

54
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:19,339
if this is the same Gaius

55
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,440
that's mentioned in the book of Acts

56
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,740
or if it's a different one.

57
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,699
It would seem to be it's a different one,

58
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:26,940
but for sake of argument this morning,

59
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,899
we are not 100% sure.

60
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,419
It seems as if, as you study the scriptures,

61
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:34,279
that this Gaius that John is referring to

62
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,660
in the epistle of 3 John is a different Gaius

63
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,339
than the ones that are mentioned earlier

64
00:02:40,339 --> 00:02:44,979
and God gives us some insight with regard to this man.

65
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:47,320
And I believe that as we study these eight verses

66
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,179
that God would challenge us this morning

67
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:52,220
with regard to his testimony.

68
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,899
It's interesting to note how John refers to this man.

69
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:59,539
He refers to him as the well-beloved Gaius.

70
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:04,279
And then John also makes it known and declares publicly

71
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:07,259
that he, John, loved Gaius.

72
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:09,619
And we understand we're to love the brethren.

73
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:12,380
And so as we look at this portion of scripture

74
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,179
and we begin to understand what's taking place,

75
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:17,460
it may be, as you look at verse number two,

76
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,460
it seems as if this man Gaius had some physical illness

77
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,259
that is hinted to in verse number two,

78
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:28,539
but we will see with great clarity

79
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:31,279
that even if he had a physical illness,

80
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:34,220
that he was thriving spiritually.

81
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,259
And what a blessing to think about someone

82
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,940
that is doing well spiritually.

83
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,139
The fact of the matter is that we may be hindered physically.

84
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:46,339
We may have some difficulties as we age

85
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:47,500
and so on and so forth.

86
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,139
We have some difficulties with our failing health

87
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:54,460
and strength and physical capabilities.

88
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,899
But what a blessing to know

89
00:03:55,899 --> 00:03:59,240
that even if the physical is suffering,

90
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,539
that we can be thriving spiritually.

91
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:04,259
And as we look at this portion of scripture,

92
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:06,619
I've simply entitled from verse number one,

93
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:08,460
our title for the message this morning,

94
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,220
the well-beloved Gaius.

95
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,860
Notice the Bible says this in beginning in verse number one,

96
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,940
the elder, John, unto the well-beloved Gaius,

97
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,339
whom I love in the truth.

98
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:24,179
Beloved, I wish above all things

99
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:27,940
that thou mayest prosper and be in health,

100
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,980
even as thy soul prospereth.

101
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,480
For I rejoiced greatly when the brethren came

102
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,459
and testified of the truth that is in thee,

103
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:40,660
even as thou walkest in the truth.

104
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,339
I have no greater joy than to hear

105
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:45,019
that my children walk in truth.

106
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:48,739
Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest

107
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:51,500
to the brethren and to strangers,

108
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,179
which have borne witness of thy charity before the church,

109
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:58,399
whom if thou bring forward on their journey

110
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,260
after a godly sort, thou shalt do well.

111
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,179
Because that for his name's sake,

112
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,220
they went forth taking nothing of the Gentiles,

113
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,619
we therefore ought to receive such

114
00:05:09,619 --> 00:05:13,940
that we might be fellow helpers to the truth.

115
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,700
As you look at this portion of scripture,

116
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,079
I wanna note really five things this morning

117
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,260
that I trust will be an encouragement to you

118
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,179
as we study the life of Gaius,

119
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:25,600
to be challenged by his testimony

120
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,600
and to be comforted in knowing that God uses individuals.

121
00:05:30,859 --> 00:05:32,179
If you take notes this morning,

122
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:33,700
notice number one with me,

123
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,899
Gaius was obedient to God's word.

124
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:39,179
Gaius was obedient to God's word.

125
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,500
The Bible says in verse number three,

126
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,459
notice it says, for I rejoiced greatly

127
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:44,980
when the brethren came and testified

128
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,899
of the truth that is in thee,

129
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:50,500
even as thou walkest in the truth.

130
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,940
Now we understand as we look at this statement here

131
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,779
in verse number three,

132
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:56,179
when we consider the obedience of Gaius,

133
00:05:56,179 --> 00:05:58,260
that his obedience was evident

134
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,440
to those to whom he was serving.

135
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,299
They could see in his life that he was an individual

136
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:06,619
that was obedient to the word of God.

137
00:06:06,619 --> 00:06:08,980
He had a good testimony publicly,

138
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:12,420
no doubt if publicly he was obedient to the word of God

139
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,579
and we're looking at the passage of scripture

140
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:16,899
and seeing how his soul was prospering,

141
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:19,459
that privately he must have been obedient

142
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:21,459
to God's word as well.

143
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:24,859
And begin to think about this obedience of this man Gaius

144
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:26,299
and understanding that it was evident,

145
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:29,739
it was obvious to those with whom he served.

146
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:32,260
But we also know in verse number three,

147
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,140
that the Bible says that it was reported by the brethren.

148
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,059
Notice it says, for I rejoiced greatly

149
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,500
when the brethren came and testified

150
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,100
of the truth that is in thee,

151
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,380
even as thou walkest in the truth.

152
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,459
Let another man praise thee, the Bible tells us.

153
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:51,619
And we find here in this text of scripture

154
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,459
that Gaius was not writing back to John

155
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:56,339
and saying, John, I just want you to understand

156
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:58,720
how obedient I am in my life.

157
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,619
And I want you to know, John, that I'm more obedient,

158
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:06,220
that no, no, the brethren brought this report to John.

159
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,059
As the brethren brought this report to John,

160
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:12,299
and we understand the obedience of this man Gaius,

161
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,140
that it was obvious, it was evident

162
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,619
to those with whom he served,

163
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:17,500
but it was reported by the brethren.

164
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,540
I do not believe this morning that Gaius was a man

165
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,100
that was looking for acceptance.

166
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,179
I do not believe that Gaius was a man

167
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:26,579
that was looking for accolades.

168
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,179
No, I believe Gaius was a man who simply loved the Lord.

169
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:36,179
And because he loved the Lord, he obeyed God's word.

170
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,220
The Bible is a precious book that's been given to us.

171
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,420
We understand that it's been preserved.

172
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,459
And you think about the supernatural work of God,

173
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:51,019
not only in giving us the Bible through the truth

174
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:53,940
of all scriptures given by inspiration of God

175
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,700
and that divine revelation,

176
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,420
but we understand that he's divinely preserved

177
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:01,179
his word for us, and we have the Bible

178
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:04,100
and how precious and profitable it is to us.

179
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,459
And we understand that the scriptures tell us in Psalm 19,

180
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:10,700
if you were to read through really verse seven

181
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,179
down through verse number 11,

182
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:15,260
and all how the Bible describes itself

183
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,339
in those portions of those verses of scripture.

184
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:20,119
And we find that the Bible tells us

185
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:22,720
that we do well if we take heed.

186
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,820
And we are to take the warnings and we're to obey.

187
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,940
We understand that the principle of obedience

188
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:29,660
is a principle that is found

189
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,900
throughout the entirety of God's word.

190
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,599
You begin to read of the situation there,

191
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,539
the account of Cain and Abel.

192
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,059
And you find that Cain is told if thou doest well,

193
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,900
shalt thou not be accepted.

194
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,179
In other words, if you obey,

195
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:47,299
if you follow the prescribed path, you'll be accepted.

196
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:50,539
Obedience always leads to blessing.

197
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:52,940
I want you to notice it's interesting as you know,

198
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,059
in verse number three, again, as we're speaking

199
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:57,299
about the obedience of this man Gaius,

200
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:00,460
that his obedience had a profound impact

201
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,059
upon the Apostle John.

202
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,179
Notice what John says in verse number three,

203
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:07,820
for I rejoiced greatly.

204
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,700
John, what is it that would cause you to rejoice greatly?

205
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,820
I'm rejoicing greatly because there's a man over there,

206
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,539
Gaius, someone in whom God had given me an opportunity

207
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:22,479
to influence and to have some part of influencing his life.

208
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,340
And he's walking in the truth.

209
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,059
He's obedient to God's word.

210
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,219
And John the Apostle is saying this truth

211
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:34,020
has caused me to rejoice greatly.

212
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,140
No doubt as we find in verse number four,

213
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,460
a verse of scripture that has often been used

214
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,900
when we speak about parenting,

215
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,580
where John says I have no greater joy

216
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,780
than to hear that my children walk in truth.

217
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,799
And you'd understand that we can look at that truth

218
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:50,359
from verse number four and apply it to parenting.

219
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:53,500
And no doubt there's great joy that comes in the heart

220
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,900
and the life of a parent when a child is doing what's right

221
00:09:57,739 --> 00:09:58,659
and walking in truth.

222
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:00,140
But you understand that.

223
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,880
Biblically, he's not talking about being a parent.

224
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,360
He's speaking about the spiritual relationship

225
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,620
between John and Gaius, and he says,

226
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,000
listen, I have no greater joy

227
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,480
than to hear that my children walk in truth.

228
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,080
John was rejoicing greatly because of the obedience

229
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,840
of an individual believer.

230
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,520
Look at a few verses with me, if you will.

231
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,440
Turn back to the Gospel of John,

232
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,220
and look at John chapter number two.

233
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,860
The Gospel of John, and John chapter number two.

234
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,660
We'll look at just a few verses here this morning

235
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,920
with regard to the subject matter of obedience,

236
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,380
and noting the obedience of Gaius in our text of scripture

237
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,740
in the short epistle, 3 John.

238
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,740
But notice in John chapter number two,

239
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,620
this is the first miracle, the beginning of miracles,

240
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,620
there at the wedding in Cana.

241
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,500
But I wanna draw your attention to just a single verse

242
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,480
of scripture within this miracle,

243
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,240
and it's a statement that is made by Mary.

244
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,640
Notice in verse number five, his mother, Mary,

245
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,640
saith unto the servants, whatsoever he saith unto you,

246
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,960
do it.

247
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,520
That's pretty straightforward, isn't it?

248
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,800
Now, contextually, it's with regard

249
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,000
to the particular miracle that's taking place in Cana.

250
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,120
We understand that, but understanding

251
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,600
by way of application this morning,

252
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,940
that Jesus is God, he's God in flesh,

253
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,260
and we find that he's given us the written word of God,

254
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,820
and as we have the Bible in our hands this morning,

255
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,820
whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.

256
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,380
That settles a whole lot of things, doesn't it?

257
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,460
We've often said in counseling,

258
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,980
privately, in public preaching,

259
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,480
I've often said to individuals that, listen,

260
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,820
we must first agree that we're gonna agree with God,

261
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,900
because if we can agree that we're going to agree with God

262
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,460
and with God's word and what God said,

263
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,540
then that settles a whole lot of things,

264
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,460
because no longer is it your position or my position

265
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,780
or my interpretation or your interpretation.

266
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,740
No, we're gonna go to the Bible

267
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,460
and find what the Bible says,

268
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,380
and Jesus is here ministering,

269
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,380
and Mary says to the servants,

270
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,720
whatsoever he, Jesus, saith unto you,

271
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,260
servants, do it, do it.

272
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,460
Notice, if you will, in Luke chapter number six,

273
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,200
Luke chapter number six,

274
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,120
and this verse of scripture

275
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,400
is a convicting verse of scripture.

276
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,940
In fact, I remember a number of years ago,

277
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,520
Brianna just graduated from high school,

278
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,920
so it was, I think she might have been in fifth grade,

279
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,560
maybe sixth grade, so it was six, seven years ago

280
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,760
that she was over at Heritage Christian School

281
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,020
and she was singing a song as part of Odax,

282
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,340
and part of that song that they were singing

283
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,780
was really taken from this truth

284
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,740
in Luke chapter number six and verse number 46,

285
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,060
and I remember hearing that song.

286
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,380
I'd never heard the song before.

287
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,480
I've never heard it since then,

288
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,240
but what a great song that gives the truth

289
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,560
of this verse of scripture.

290
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,160
Notice in Luke six and verse 46,

291
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,660
notice Jesus says this,

292
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,620
why call ye me Lord, Lord,

293
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,080
and do not the things which I say?

294
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,300
That's convicting.

295
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,160
Jesus is saying, why are you calling me Lord,

296
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,000
but you're not obeying me?

297
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,200
You're not doing the things which I say.

298
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,560
Verse 47, whosoever cometh to me

299
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,280
and heareth my sayings and doeth them,

300
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,680
I will show you to whom he is like.

301
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,840
He is like a man which built a house and digged deep

302
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,740
and laid the foundation on a rock,

303
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,320
and when the floods arose,

304
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,540
the stream beat vehemently upon the house

305
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,860
and could not shake it,

306
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,260
for it was founded upon a rock,

307
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,180
but he that heareth and doeth not

308
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,620
is like a man that without a foundation

309
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,220
built a house upon the earth

310
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,740
against which the stream did beat vehemently,

311
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,220
and immediately it fell,

312
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,840
and the ruin of that house was great.

313
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,460
You find that Jesus asked that piercing question,

314
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,960
why call ye me Lord, Lord,

315
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,060
and do not the things which I say?

316
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,760
See, Gaius was a man who was obedient to the word of God.

317
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,760
I said this a moment ago that I do not believe

318
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,900
that Gaius was looking for acceptance or accolades.

319
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,740
He was not trying.

320
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,200
He wasn't vying for a position within the church.

321
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,280
I believe that he was simply a man that loved God,

322
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,680
and out of his love for God came obedience to God's word,

323
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,580
and that's what Jesus tells us in John 14 and 15.

324
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:46,120
He says, if you love me, keep my commandments.

325
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,360
If you love me, keep my commandments.

326
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,700
We see that is repeated by John in 1 John 5,

327
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,300
that he says that same thing again

328
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,380
that John would have heard Jesus say

329
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,660
there in John 14 and verse 15.

330
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,580
We find that in 1 John 5 and verse number three,

331
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,700
John says this, for this is the love of God,

332
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,340
that we keep his commandments,

333
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,360
and his commandments are not grievous.

334
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,800
I'm so thankful that God has given us his word,

335
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,440
but how imperative it is that we obey his word,

336
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,440
that we are doers of the word and not hearers only.

337
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,160
It is absolutely imperative.

338
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,860
It's not enough to have the right Bible.

339
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,480
It's not enough to talk about having the Bible.

340
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,080
We must be doers of the word.

341
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,260
We must be obedient to God's word,

342
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,360
and with obedience to God's word comes blessing.

343
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:41,000
No doubt we find that the key, if you will,

344
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,140
to Gaius having, as John refers to it,

345
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:49,140
as a soul that prospereth, is his obedience to God's word.

346
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,100
Gaius was obedient to the word of God.

347
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,760
Number two, if you're taking notes back in 3 John,

348
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,280
I want you to notice with me, number two,

349
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,240
that Gaius was a servant.

350
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,260
He was a servant.

351
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,840
As we look here at the short letter of 3 John,

352
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,360
we do not have a complete record

353
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,580
of the service of this man, Gaius,

354
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,800
but we find that the summary statement

355
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,860
that is given to us in verse number five

356
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,020
is of great significance, and it's a powerful truth.

357
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,260
Notice what the Bible says in verse number five

358
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,900
with regard to this man, Gaius,

359
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,180
being a servant of the Lord.

360
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:27,060
It says, beloved, thou doest faithfully

361
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,060
whatsoever thou doest to the brethren and to strangers.

362
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,140
I want you to think about this statement

363
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,720
in considering the service and the fact

364
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,120
that Gaius is a servant.

365
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,240
By the way, it's a great thing to be a servant of the Lord.

366
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,080
You find that as you study and you read

367
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,960
through the New Testament,

368
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,840
that a number of the New Testament letters

369
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,980
that you'll read, the books in the New Testament,

370
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,360
they'll start out by the author mentioning

371
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,280
that they are a servant of the Lord.

372
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,460
And what a great privilege to be a servant

373
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,840
of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

374
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,680
And we find that he's a good master

375
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,440
and he's worthy of our service.

376
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,440
And we find that the Bible says there in verse number five,

377
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,440
thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest.

378
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,880
Now, last Sunday evening, we had an introduction

379
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,080
to the life of Joseph from Genesis chapter 37.

380
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,360
And one of the points that I made in that introduction

381
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,360
was that Joseph was a man that worked.

382
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,600
He was a man that was working, hardworking.

383
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,120
And we noticed some of that from Genesis 37.

384
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,560
And I talked about the fact that work is good.

385
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,200
And we find that the Bible says,

386
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,200
whatsoever thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest.

387
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,360
And I see this faithful servant of the Lord.

388
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,240
I don't believe, again, that Gaius was a man

389
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,000
that was serving just if certain people were around

390
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,280
and watching and observing.

391
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,440
I remember when I worked in the corporate world,

392
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,040
there would be times in which you'd be in the office there

393
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,920
and then all of a sudden,

394
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,720
the people that were goofing off and doing whatever,

395
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,920
they quickly get back to their desk

396
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,760
and pretend as if they're working.

397
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,600
Why?

398
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,200
Because one of the bosses enters into the building.

399
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,280
That's nonsense.

400
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,360
Really, it is.

401
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,280
As a child of God, we are serving God.

402
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,360
And we serve the Lord.

403
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,120
And we find that here, that his service,

404
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,280
he was a faithful servant of the Lord.

405
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,160
That thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest.

406
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,760
But I want you to notice the latter part

407
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,440
of verse number five, to the brethren, to the brethren.

408
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,960
Now, we can understand that.

409
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,080
We can understand brothers and sisters in Christ.

410
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,119
And we can understand the service

411
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:42,359
that maybe he would be involved in on serving one another

412
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:44,600
and loving one another and so on and so forth.

413
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,559
And that relationship of brother and sister in Christ.

414
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,559
But the Bible says to the brethren and to strangers,

415
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,020
to strangers.

416
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,260
It's impactful when we begin to think about the service

417
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,859
of Gaius and understanding that he was a servant.

418
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:06,059
He just, I believe, was a man that was privileged

419
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:07,460
to be able to serve God.

420
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,140
And he wasn't serving for any recognition.

421
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,020
He wasn't serving so that he could get

422
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,700
some level of promotion, if you will.

423
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,260
He just was privileged to serve God.

424
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,540
And he did whatever he did faithfully.

425
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,340
And he did it to the brethren and to strangers.

426
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,980
We're gonna think about that phraseology

427
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,179
with regard to his service.

428
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:31,220
And I would say that it's quite evident

429
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,460
from the way in which the description is given to us

430
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:37,260
that his service was first to the Lord.

431
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,340
His service was first to the Lord.

432
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,179
It wasn't that he was just serving this individual

433
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,340
or these individuals.

434
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,020
No, he was serving the Lord.

435
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,260
And as he was serving the Lord,

436
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,299
God would give him opportunities.

437
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:52,220
And he was mindful of the fact that he was serving Christ.

438
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,119
He was serving his master.

439
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,600
And what a wonderful blessing it is

440
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,320
to be a servant of the Lord.

441
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,679
I would say number three this morning,

442
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,679
as you look at this.

443
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:02,679
this portion of scripture that you'll notice

444
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:05,579
that Gaius was not only a man that was obedient

445
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:09,079
to God's word, a man that was a servant of the Lord,

446
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:11,319
but Gaius was generous.

447
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,839
Gaius was generous.

448
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:14,799
I believe that the Lord had blessed him.

449
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,879
Again, we don't know a lot about this man

450
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:19,639
and his background and so on and so forth,

451
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:21,439
but it seems as if, as you would look

452
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:22,919
at the text of scripture, that the Lord

453
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,199
had blessed this man and he desired

454
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:26,439
to be a blessing to others.

455
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:29,919
In fact, he desired to use his resources

456
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,799
for God's work and for God's glory.

457
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,079
As you look in verse number six,

458
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:36,799
the Bible says, which have borne witness

459
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,359
of thy charity before the church,

460
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:42,959
whom, if thou bring forward on their journey

461
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:45,719
after a godly sort, thou shalt do well,

462
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:48,099
because that for his namesake they went forth,

463
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:49,839
taking nothing of the Gentiles.

464
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:51,459
And so, to get a little background

465
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,519
as to what's taking place, we would see

466
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,039
that the hospitality of Gaius is on display

467
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,479
in verses six and seven, and his generosity

468
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:02,039
is being referred to in verses six and seven.

469
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:04,639
There were these preachers, these servants

470
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,719
of the Lord that would travel through,

471
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:07,979
and as they were traveling through,

472
00:21:07,979 --> 00:21:09,159
they would need assistance.

473
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:10,799
They would need somebody to help them

474
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,719
on their way to get to the next place,

475
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:16,479
to be able to serve and minister in the next location.

476
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:18,279
And we find that the Bible would tell us

477
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,879
that Gaius was a man that was involved

478
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,839
in helping in those particular situations.

479
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:26,199
The phrase in your Bible that says

480
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:30,719
in verse number six, bring forward on their journey.

481
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:34,079
Now, that's a five-word phrase in English,

482
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:36,639
but it's just one Greek word.

483
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:39,359
And that single Greek word that is translated

484
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:41,519
for us, bring forward on their journey,

485
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:44,799
literally carries with it the idea

486
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,319
of fitting someone out for all

487
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:49,999
that is necessary for a journey.

488
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:51,259
Now, think about that.

489
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:53,279
Someone's taking a journey.

490
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,719
These traveling preachers, they're taking this journey,

491
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:59,399
and there were some needs that they had

492
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:01,319
in order to get from where they were

493
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,599
to where they were supposed to be ministering,

494
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,919
and there were certain needs that were necessary

495
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,079
in order to allow them to take that journey.

496
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:15,119
And that word means, to bring forward on their journey,

497
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,279
means to fit them out, to provide the things necessary

498
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,819
for that journey, whether they be supplies,

499
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:24,599
whether they be lodging, whatever it might be,

500
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:26,739
that those things are being supplied.

501
00:22:26,739 --> 00:22:30,819
I see the generosity of this man, Gaius.

502
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:33,179
I begin to think about this man's generosity,

503
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:34,419
and I would say that he was a man

504
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,339
that was storing up treasure in heaven.

505
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:39,019
He was storing up treasure in heaven.

506
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:40,419
Turn to the book of Matthew, if you will,

507
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:43,779
in chapter number five, Matthew chapter number five.

508
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,059
Someone made the comment to me this past week

509
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:49,299
about something with regard to the stock market

510
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:51,359
and something about, man, you could have made

511
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:52,879
a lot of money in this particular day

512
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:54,599
in the stock market or whatever it was.

513
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:57,279
And the reality is that we understand

514
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:59,939
that things quickly can change.

515
00:22:59,939 --> 00:23:02,859
When you think about the truth this morning

516
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:06,279
with regard to all that takes place

517
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:09,959
with our economy and so on and so forth,

518
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:12,799
but the Bible teaches us that we can lay up

519
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,439
for ourselves treasures in heaven.

520
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:17,599
I think I said Matthew five, but it should be Matthew six.

521
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:18,799
Did I say five?

522
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,079
And my apologies, Matthew chapter number six.

523
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,679
Matthew chapter number six.

524
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,199
In verse number 19, the Bible says this.

525
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:29,759
Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth

526
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:31,599
where moth and rust doth corrupt

527
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:34,319
and where thieves break through and steal.

528
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,279
Now, I believe that there is a level of being prudent

529
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:40,279
and understanding the importance of retirement

530
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:42,699
and what have you, and we understand those things.

531
00:23:42,699 --> 00:23:44,439
I've said this before from the pulpit.

532
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:46,719
I don't say it to be mean or unkind,

533
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:50,079
but the reality is that there's a danger

534
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:53,439
in a society like ours where there's so much emphasis

535
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:55,679
placed upon retirement planning

536
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,879
and very little emphasis that's placed

537
00:23:57,879 --> 00:23:59,799
upon eternal planning.

538
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,639
And the reality is that you may

539
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:06,239
or may not ever have retirement years.

540
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:09,319
Some of you say I'm already enjoying them, hallelujah.

541
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:12,179
But for some of us, we may never have retirement years.

542
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:13,919
We just don't know.

543
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,039
There's but a step between us and death.

544
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,679
As it appointed unto man wants to die

545
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,880
after this the judgment, but there's also the truth

546
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,839
that the trumpet of the Lord shall sound at any time, amen.

547
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:25,000
And I'm looking forward to hearing

548
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,479
the trumpet of the Lord sound.

549
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:29,220
And so we are not sure of retirement,

550
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,239
but we are sure of eternity.

551
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,279
And here, Jesus in his instruction here in Matthew six,

552
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:39,679
he says with regard to laying up treasures,

553
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,000
notice in verse number 20,

554
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,699
but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven

555
00:24:44,699 --> 00:24:46,759
where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt

556
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:49,339
and where thieves do not break through nor steal,

557
00:24:49,339 --> 00:24:53,279
for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

558
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:55,699
I would tell you this morning

559
00:24:55,699 --> 00:24:57,619
that it is absolutely possible

560
00:24:57,619 --> 00:25:00,539
that you can plan for retirement here on this earth,

561
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,539
but also be planning for eternity,

562
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:04,779
and you can be storing up treasure in heaven.

563
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:06,419
It's not an either or.

564
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:09,820
You can do both.

565
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:13,399
You can be wise and you can prepare for retirement

566
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:17,160
here on this earth, but you can be actively generous

567
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,679
in your giving to God and to his work.

568
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:23,559
And by the way, that's God honoring.

569
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:25,880
I begin to think about this thought

570
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,679
of storing up treasure, laying up treasure in heaven,

571
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,339
sending it in advance,

572
00:25:31,339 --> 00:25:33,919
and all that God is able to do with it.

573
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,600
And I said it's not an either or, we can do both,

574
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,019
but it requires that we live within our means.

575
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:42,759
It might require that we don't have

576
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:45,880
all of the newest things that come down the pike.

577
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,600
We live in a society that constantly is bombarding us

578
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,559
with all of the newest, fanciest,

579
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:54,799
you need this, you need that, you can't live without it.

580
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:59,799
And the marketing ploys of our society

581
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:02,559
are of course very in your face,

582
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,759
and they're very good at what they do,

583
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:07,759
otherwise they wouldn't be given the kind of monies

584
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:09,959
that they're given on an annual basis.

585
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:13,079
But the reality is that we can do both.

586
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:15,759
Gaius was a man who was generous.

587
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:19,440
He was providing and helping those

588
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,399
that were serving the Lord.

589
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:21,320
Notice what the Bible says

590
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,079
in 2 Corinthians chapter number nine.

591
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,799
In 2 Corinthians chapter number nine,

592
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:28,000
it's a familiar verse of scripture,

593
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,559
but I want you to notice what God tells us

594
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,199
with regard to giving.

595
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:37,039
And by the way, I'm so thankful that God has blessed us.

596
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,320
And we have been blessed beyond measure,

597
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,799
and it's an absolute privilege

598
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,199
that I have an opportunity to give back to God

599
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:46,119
a portion of what he has graciously blessed me with.

600
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:50,279
I thank God for the opportunity to give to the work of God.

601
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,759
He says in 2 Corinthians nine in verse number six,

602
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:55,559
but this I say, he which soweth sparingly

603
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,039
shall reap also sparingly,

604
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,959
and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.

605
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:03,479
Every man according as he purposeth in his heart,

606
00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:04,679
so let him give.

607
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:08,320
Notice what it says, not grudgingly or of necessity,

608
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,119
for God loveth a cheerful giver.

609
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:14,320
God loveth a cheerful giver.

610
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,679
Someone that I often pray that God would help us

611
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,779
to give cheerfully and appropriately.

612
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:25,720
And we look at that, listen, it's not that I have to give,

613
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,839
it's not that I'm holding on to that offering so tight

614
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:29,799
that it's hard for me to part.

615
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:32,839
No, no, I get to give to God's work.

616
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:34,720
What a privilege.

617
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,479
Personally, we won't take time this morning to go there,

618
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:39,399
but maybe you wanna jot it down in your notes.

619
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:42,039
I believe that 1 Chronicles chapter 29

620
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:44,880
is probably within the whole of scripture,

621
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,579
the greatest illustration of someone

622
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:51,320
that's giving cheerfully, and that's David.

623
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,399
In 1 Chronicles chapter 29, you go back there

624
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:55,880
and you read it later today or this week,

625
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,759
and you read that text of scripture,

626
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,239
and you see for yourself

627
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:02,639
that that is a wonderful illustration example

628
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,959
of a man that was giving cheerfully.

629
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:08,600
And by the way, if you understand within the context

630
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,119
of 1 Chronicles 29, that David was giving for a temple

631
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,059
that he would never see and never worship God in,

632
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,339
but he was given for the next generation.

633
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:21,299
What a blessing, what a blessing.

634
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,239
In Philippians chapter number four,

635
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:28,600
the Bible teaches us about those that were giving

636
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,299
to the work of mission, specifically the church at Philippi

637
00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:35,219
here in the ministry of the Apostle Paul

638
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:37,859
in Philippians chapter number four.

639
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:40,580
As I think about the work of the ministry

640
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,099
and the Apostle Paul faithfully serving the Lord

641
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:47,260
and how God would use the church at Philippi,

642
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,299
we find that God gives in this text of scripture

643
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:54,219
some wonderful promises and realities

644
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:55,700
with regard to our giving.

645
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,539
Notice what Paul says beginning in verse number 14

646
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:01,419
of Philippians four, as he's writing to this local church,

647
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,539
notwithstanding you have well done

648
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:06,219
that you did communicate with my affliction.

649
00:29:06,219 --> 00:29:07,820
Now you Philippians know also

650
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,260
that in the beginning of the gospel

651
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,140
when I departed from Macedonia,

652
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,979
no church communicated with me

653
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:15,779
as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.

654
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:17,099
For even in Thessalonica,

655
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:19,940
ye sent once again unto my necessity,

656
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,460
not because I desire a gift,

657
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,419
but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.

658
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:26,339
But I have all and abound, I am full,

659
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:28,500
having received of Epaphroditus

660
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,099
the things which were sent from you.

661
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:33,020
Notice how this offering is described

662
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,739
at the end of verse number 18,

663
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:39,739
an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable,

664
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:42,859
well-pleasing to God.

665
00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:46,380
But my God, verse 19, shall supply all your need

666
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,099
according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.

667
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:52,580
I believe that as we look at the life of Gaius

668
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,099
and we note as we're looking at his testimony

669
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:56,899
here in third John, that yes,

670
00:29:56,899 --> 00:29:59,000
he was a man who was obedient to God's word.

671
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,839
He was a man that was a servant.

672
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,599
He was a man that was generous.

673
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:06,239
He was a man that gave so that others could go.

674
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:09,239
And he was a man that I believe that his generosity,

675
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:12,399
his sacrifice was an odor of a sweet smell,

676
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,879
a sacrifice that was acceptable

677
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:18,099
and well-pleasing to God Almighty.

678
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,599
What a blessing.

679
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:23,039
As you study and look at the life of Gaius here

680
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,319
in 3rd John, sounds like a guy that we'd like

681
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:28,239
to be able to know and worship the Lord with.

682
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:30,279
I mean, a good servant of the Lord,

683
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:33,199
a faithful follower of the Lord Jesus Christ.

684
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:34,479
As we look at his testimony,

685
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:36,519
turn back to 3rd John, if you will.

686
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:38,639
And let me just note two other things quickly

687
00:30:38,639 --> 00:30:40,399
as we close this morning.

688
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,879
I want you to notice with me number four,

689
00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:45,479
if you're taking notes, that Gaius was a man

690
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:48,319
that was involved in the work of God.

691
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:50,879
He was involved in the work of God.

692
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:52,659
As we know, as we look at the scripture,

693
00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:55,199
we find that the Bible would tell us

694
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:58,599
how that he was walking in truth in verse number three,

695
00:30:58,599 --> 00:30:59,959
how that in verse number five,

696
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:03,319
thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest

697
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,039
to the brethren and to the strangers.

698
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,479
And so he is personally involved in the work of God.

699
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:11,439
The Bible tells us which have borne witness

700
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:14,459
of thy charity before the church.

701
00:31:14,459 --> 00:31:16,319
If thou bring forward on their journey

702
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:18,679
after a godly sort, thou shalt do well

703
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:20,319
because that for his namesake,

704
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:23,319
they went forth taking nothing of the Gentiles.

705
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:25,279
We therefore ought to receive such.

706
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:29,679
Notice that we might be fellow helpers to the truth.

707
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,039
When I think about the involvement of Gaius

708
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,019
and how Gaius was a man who was involved

709
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:36,479
in the work of God, his involvement,

710
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:38,799
as you know at the end of verse number eight,

711
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:43,279
makes him a fellow helper to the truth.

712
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,439
Now I like that terminology as we would think about

713
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:49,399
the way in which God would use us to be fellow helpers,

714
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:52,319
fellow laborers to the truth.

715
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:54,439
And we find that God's perspective

716
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:56,639
is different than man's perspective,

717
00:31:56,639 --> 00:31:59,119
that Gaius was not the man that was actually

718
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:01,719
the traveling preacher, if you will,

719
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:04,899
but he was involved on helping the traveling preacher

720
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:06,519
to get to where he needed to be.

721
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:10,279
And God says he was involved in the work

722
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:14,559
and that he was a fellow helper to the truth.

723
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,039
When I think about Gaius being a man

724
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:17,839
that was involved in the work of God,

725
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:20,399
I think about it this way, be a participator.

726
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:22,879
Don't be a spectator.

727
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:25,939
You know, some people like to just sit

728
00:32:25,939 --> 00:32:30,039
on the sidelines and watch, it drives me crazy.

729
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,759
You watch a game, you watch something,

730
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:34,159
man, I wanna get involved, I wanna participate.

731
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:37,799
You know, these guys out here for the,

732
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,639
every once in a while we have different activities

733
00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:42,439
and during a recent celebration,

734
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:43,959
they're playing cornhole out here.

735
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:45,519
I don't wanna stand there for two hours

736
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,679
and watch them play cornhole, I wanna play.

737
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:51,599
I wanna participate.

738
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:53,079
I watch them play basketball.

739
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:55,359
I'm not that great, I'm getting old, I know,

740
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:57,519
but I wanna play, I wanna get involved,

741
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,279
I wanna participate.

742
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:04,359
When it comes to church, when it comes to the work of God,

743
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:07,639
it's a wonderful thing to be involved in God's work,

744
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:10,839
to be a participator, not to be a spectator,

745
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,079
not to just sit on the sidelines,

746
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:15,119
but, well, there's not a whole lot I can do.

747
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:17,239
Find out what you can do and do it

748
00:33:18,219 --> 00:33:19,719
because God has a purpose for us,

749
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:21,599
God has a plan for us.

750
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,719
We're speaking with a man years ago

751
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:27,279
and he had a list of I can't do this

752
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,999
and I can't do this and I can't do this

753
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:30,719
and I said, listen, let's forget about that list

754
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:32,439
that you've prepared and let's just focus

755
00:33:32,439 --> 00:33:35,439
on the things you can do because the reality

756
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:37,039
is that we're not interested in talking

757
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,239
about all the things you can't do,

758
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:39,999
but let's figure out what we can do

759
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:43,919
because God has equipped us and what a blessing it is

760
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,919
to be a participator, to be involved in the work of God.

761
00:33:48,999 --> 00:33:52,319
We mentioned already John chapter number two

762
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:55,239
and verse number five earlier when the mother

763
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:58,599
of Jesus, Mary, she said, what sort of he saith unto you,

764
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:00,599
do it, and it's interesting as you look

765
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:03,759
at that portion of scripture that the Bible tells us

766
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:08,119
how the servants, they knew what had taken place,

767
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:10,899
but the servants which drew the water knew

768
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:13,079
is a statement in verse number nine

769
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:16,159
and they were involved in the work.

770
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,239
I think about the disciples.

771
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,999
We can read of the many miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ

772
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:24,839
and we can see how the Lord Jesus Christ worked

773
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:28,119
in just amazing ways, but there's certain miracles

774
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:30,939
that Christ performed that he used his disciples.

775
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:34,919
I think about the feeding of the 5,000.

776
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:36,599
Think about the feeding of the 4,000,

777
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,559
but if you just focus on the feeding of the 5,000

778
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:42,199
for just a moment, we find that God told the disciples

779
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:44,919
to have everyone sit down, right?

780
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:47,079
Now what was the perspective of the disciples?

781
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:48,719
It would have been a long day.

782
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,239
I mean, they were tired.

783
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,119
The purpose that Jesus said, let's go to a desert place,

784
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,179
who remembers why?

785
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:59,599
To rest, to rest, but when they went to rest,

786
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,599
there were some people that got there before them

787
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,999
and Jesus spent all day ministering to them

788
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:07,199
and those disciples, what did they say?

789
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:12,439
Send them away that they may get something to eat.

790
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:15,479
They don't want to be bothered with it.

791
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:16,999
You ever feel that way?

792
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:21,199
You can get weird, you can get tired, send them away

793
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:23,959
and Jesus says, give ye them to eat.

794
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:27,759
We don't have anything.

795
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:29,759
What do you want us to do?

796
00:35:29,759 --> 00:35:32,539
Through a series of circumstances, they find a small lunch

797
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:35,999
and the Lord says, have them all sit down

798
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:38,679
and they all sit down, they have them sit in companies

799
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,559
and it's very orderly how it's done.

800
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:44,239
We find that Jesus blessed and multiplied,

801
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:45,959
but if you read the text of scripture,

802
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:46,919
you know what has to happen?

803
00:35:46,919 --> 00:35:51,799
The disciples come to Jesus, they get the bread and the fish

804
00:35:51,799 --> 00:35:53,439
and they distribute to the people

805
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:57,319
and then they go back to Jesus

806
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:01,119
and they get the bread and the fish

807
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,799
and they go and they distribute to the next group of people.

808
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:06,879
Is that not what happens in your Bible?

809
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:10,759
That's how it says in my Bible, that's what happens.

810
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:13,039
So guess what those disciples were doing?

811
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:15,519
They're participating in the work of God.

812
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,159
Now let me ask you this, could God have just supernaturally,

813
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:21,679
bam, there's a plate of food in everybody's lap?

814
00:36:23,439 --> 00:36:26,199
I mean, sure enough, if he multiplied it the way he did,

815
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:28,399
he could have done whatever he wanted to do,

816
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:31,639
but you know what he decided to do?

817
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:33,399
I'm gonna use these disciples.

818
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:35,999
You know what God's still doing today?

819
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:40,839
Listen, God doesn't need us, but he's chosen to use us

820
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:46,039
and that is a truth that I don't know,

821
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:48,519
I've been saved now for 25 years,

822
00:36:49,479 --> 00:36:53,719
almost 26 years I've been saved serving the Lord.

823
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,319
I don't know that I will ever be able to wrap my mind

824
00:36:57,319 --> 00:36:59,439
around the truth that God would use us.

825
00:36:59,439 --> 00:37:04,119
It's an amazing truth that God would use us,

826
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:07,959
but in God's plan and in God's wisdom,

827
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:11,919
he determined that he would use his children

828
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:17,959
and what a privilege and honor to serve the master,

829
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:21,479
to be involved in the work.

830
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:24,279
See, there's something about being involved in the work

831
00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:28,559
that's different than just observing the work.

832
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:34,759
Somebody went out yesterday with us

833
00:37:34,759 --> 00:37:36,119
and they contacted me and they said,

834
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:38,799
I just have so much joy

835
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:42,719
because I was able to go and share the gospel with someone.

836
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:48,599
Involved in the work, doing the work.

837
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:51,359
Somebody might be able to hear that,

838
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:56,359
that's an observer that's, wow, that seems exciting,

839
00:37:56,759 --> 00:37:59,099
but it's a different experience altogether

840
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:01,319
when you're involved in the work.

841
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:04,999
And Gaius was a man that was involved,

842
00:38:04,999 --> 00:38:07,219
he was involved in God's work.

843
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:09,599
Number five, very simply,

844
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,879
more of a summary statement than a point actually,

845
00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:16,399
Gaius was exemplary, he was exemplary.

846
00:38:16,399 --> 00:38:17,639
If I could say it this way,

847
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:20,879
he is a model follower of Christ.

848
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:24,319
I hesitate on using the terminology

849
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:25,859
of being a model Christian,

850
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:30,359
but we do know that God has given us in his word

851
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:34,359
the truth that Jesus is our example

852
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:37,599
and we understand that it makes it very plain.

853
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,279
Peter writes that Jesus left us an example

854
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:42,599
that we should follow his steps.

855
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:45,779
And so we understand that Jesus is the greatest example.

856
00:38:45,779 --> 00:38:48,039
But you understand that the apostle Paul said,

857
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:53,039
be followers of me even as I also am of Christ.

858
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:55,199
You understand that Paul said to the believers

859
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,399
in Philippi in chapter four,

860
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:58,799
just before what we read just a moment ago,

861
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:00,919
he says that the things that you've heard

862
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:03,099
and seen in me do.

863
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:06,179
And so we find that this man Gaius,

864
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:08,339
when I look at his testimony and again,

865
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:10,979
a man that God doesn't tell us a whole lot about.

866
00:39:10,979 --> 00:39:13,819
I mean, if you were to study the life of Paul this morning,

867
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:15,699
there's so many more things that you find

868
00:39:15,699 --> 00:39:19,499
in God's record in his Bible about the apostle Paul

869
00:39:19,499 --> 00:39:21,739
and so little about this man Gaius,

870
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:24,739
but yet what God has chosen to record for us

871
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:27,459
and to provide us record with this morning

872
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:30,899
of this man Gaius, man, he's exemplary.

873
00:39:31,899 --> 00:39:35,059
And God chose to record it for a purpose.

874
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:36,819
And I believe this morning that as much

875
00:39:36,819 --> 00:39:39,899
as we can be encouraged by studying about this man Gaius

876
00:39:39,899 --> 00:39:43,259
and understanding how God would use this individual

877
00:39:43,259 --> 00:39:45,419
and how he was a man that was obedient.

878
00:39:45,419 --> 00:39:47,619
He was a man that was a servant.

879
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:49,019
He was a man that was generous.

880
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,499
He was a man that was involved.

881
00:39:50,499 --> 00:39:52,619
And we look at his life and we rejoice

882
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:54,619
just as John was rejoicing.

883
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:56,779
He says, listen, I'm rejoicing greatly

884
00:39:56,779 --> 00:40:00,699
because of the record, the report that I'm receiving.

885
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:06,679
We can rejoice this morning, but oh that God would help us to look at the life of Gaius

886
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:13,639
and say, God would you use me in the same way that you used Gaius?

887
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:18,919
See Gaius was just a man that made himself available to God and said where I am with

888
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:23,039
what I have, I just want to serve God.

889
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:26,359
I want to be obedient to His Word.

890
00:40:26,479 --> 00:40:30,959
Though his health may have been failing, as you would note in verse number two, that his

891
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:34,959
soul was prospering, he was doing quite well spiritually.

892
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:39,719
And I'm thankful that we can thrive spiritually.

893
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:46,399
I've said this before, we're as close to God as we want to be.

894
00:40:46,399 --> 00:40:49,119
We are as close to God as we want to be.

895
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:55,639
We spend as much time with God in His Word and in prayer as we really want to.

896
00:40:55,919 --> 00:40:58,279
Oh, I just don't have any time.

897
00:40:58,279 --> 00:41:02,079
If you've got a smart phone like I do, it tells you how many minutes you've spent on

898
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:07,239
your phone all week, hallelujah, right?

899
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:12,199
Listen, we've got time for all kinds of things, really.

900
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:17,959
Gaius, when we look at his testimony, it's exemplary.

901
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:23,239
He's a believer that just was all in.

902
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:30,279
A believer that though he doesn't say it, Paul says it, I am crucified with Christ.

903
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:33,039
I think it fits with Gaius.

904
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:35,959
He's a man that just wanted to serve God.

905
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:45,479
This morning, we need some people of God, some men of God, some women of God that would

906
00:41:45,479 --> 00:41:52,879
have these same type of character traits evident in their life, obedience to God's

907
00:41:52,879 --> 00:41:53,879
Word.

908
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:59,919
Why call you me Lord, Lord and do not the things that I say?

909
00:41:59,919 --> 00:42:05,679
That we just understand we're servants and what a privilege it is to be a servant of

910
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:11,359
the Lord, that we'd be generous.

911
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:16,439
I want to lay up treasure in heaven.

912
00:42:16,439 --> 00:42:17,599
I want to be used of thee.

913
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:22,919
I thank you for giving me the resources that you did, that you have, so I might be used

914
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:23,919
of thee.

915
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:26,119
Oh, that we'd be involved.

916
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:30,079
God, what's the place that you have for me?

917
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,159
What can I do in your work?

918
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:34,639
How can you use me?

919
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:36,919
Gaius was a man that was exemplary.

920
00:42:36,919 --> 00:42:41,879
I thank God for his testimony and I trust this morning that we would be challenged to

921
00:42:41,879 --> 00:42:44,399
walk in obedience to God.

922
00:42:44,399 --> 00:42:45,399
Let's pray.

923
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:46,399
Father, we love you.

924
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,639
We thank you for loving us.

925
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:54,919
We thank you for the privilege that we have of being able to gather together, having a

926
00:42:54,919 --> 00:43:03,959
Bible, reading of those who have gone before us and the testimony of this man, Gaius.

927
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:05,959
I'm thankful.

928
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:08,559
I'm challenged.

929
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:14,199
And I pray that as we've examined your word this morning, that you'd help us in this moment.

930
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:20,159
God, help us to be doers of the word and not hearers only.

931
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:27,039
Help us, yes, to rejoice in the testimony of an individual named Gaius.

932
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:34,879
Help us to examine our own lives, determine the level of obedience and service in our

933
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:36,679
lives personally.

934
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:40,399
God, I pray that you'd use us.

935
00:43:40,399 --> 00:43:50,319
I pray that as we have a few moments of invitation, you'd help us to have a heart of submission

936
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:51,999
and obedience to you.

937
00:43:51,999 --> 00:43:56,759
Lord, that you'd have your will in way, that we'd be doers of the word and not hearers

938
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:57,759
only.

939
00:43:57,759 --> 00:43:59,679
Well, thank you for all that you'll do.

940
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,119
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

941
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,039
Would you stand with me?

942
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:05,039
Eyes are out and eyes are closed.

943
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:06,199
No one's looking around this morning.

944
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:09,159
We'll have an opportunity to have an invitation.

945
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:13,159
Maybe you want to make your altar or your seat, your pew an altar.

946
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:14,959
Maybe you want to come to this old-fashioned altar.

947
00:44:14,959 --> 00:44:17,519
But as Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
