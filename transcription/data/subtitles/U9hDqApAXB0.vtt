WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
with a bad back today and unable to be here.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.579
And so if you'd pray for Doc,

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:05.920
I know that he'd appreciate that.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.719
The book of 3rd John,

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:10.659
the book of 3rd John all the way in the back of your Bible,

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:13.119
3rd John, Jude and Revelation,

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.840
and just a very short letter, just 14 verses.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.399
We're just gonna look at the first eight verses this morning

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:23.319
and I'm thankful that God has given us his word.

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm thankful that the Bible reveals God to mankind.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.840
I'm thankful that within the pages of this precious book,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.759
that God has provided us with the details

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:36.439
regarding his plan.

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:38.319
I'm thankful that God has a plan.

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:40.159
And you know, have you ever had a plan

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:41.840
and somebody kind of messed with your plan

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.400
and kind of changed things up?

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.080
No one's gonna change God's plan.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.360
I'm thankful that God has a plan

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.099
and his plan will come to pass.

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:53.520
And we find that within the pages of the Bible,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.680
that God has also chosen to record for us

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.959
the interactions between God and man.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:02.919
We find that obviously not all of the interactions

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:05.120
between God and man are recorded

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.559
within the pages of this book,

00:01:06.559 --> 00:01:10.720
but we do find that God has given us insight

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.720
as to how God had an impact in the lives of these believers,

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:18.220
those that we read of,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.680
that we might refer to as the heroes of the faith

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.839
and what have you.

00:01:21.839 --> 00:01:26.500
We have the opportunity to be able to see how the truth,

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.220
how God's revelation had an impact in their lives.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.699
We find, of course, this morning

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:33.099
that there are some Bible characters

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:34.779
that are more familiar than others.

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:37.019
And if we were to go around the room this morning

00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:38.779
and ask each individual that's here,

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:40.860
who is your favorite Bible character?

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.379
I'm sure we'd have a variety of answers,

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:45.779
but we'd probably have some duplicates as well

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:49.379
because we have some characters within the Bible

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:50.660
that are very well known.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.400
Others, like the one that we'll look at this morning,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.019
there's not a whole lot that God tells us

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.059
about these individuals.

00:01:58.059 --> 00:02:00.500
As we think about the first eight verses

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.419
to the short epistle of the book of 3 John,

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:07.660
we see and we note the testimony of a man named Gaius.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.720
Now we see that there's a few other references

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.940
within the New Testament

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.740
to an individual holding the name Gaius.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.539
It is really difficult for us to be able to tell

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:19.339
if this is the same Gaius

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:20.440
that's mentioned in the book of Acts

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.740
or if it's a different one.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.699
It would seem to be it's a different one,

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:26.940
but for sake of argument this morning,

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.899
we are not 100% sure.

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:31.419
It seems as if, as you study the scriptures,

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:34.279
that this Gaius that John is referring to

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.660
in the epistle of 3 John is a different Gaius

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.339
than the ones that are mentioned earlier

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:44.979
and God gives us some insight with regard to this man.

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.320
And I believe that as we study these eight verses

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.179
that God would challenge us this morning

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:52.220
with regard to his testimony.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.899
It's interesting to note how John refers to this man.

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:59.539
He refers to him as the well-beloved Gaius.

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:04.279
And then John also makes it known and declares publicly

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:07.259
that he, John, loved Gaius.

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:09.619
And we understand we're to love the brethren.

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:12.380
And so as we look at this portion of scripture

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.179
and we begin to understand what's taking place,

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:17.460
it may be, as you look at verse number two,

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.460
it seems as if this man Gaius had some physical illness

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.259
that is hinted to in verse number two,

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:28.539
but we will see with great clarity

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:31.279
that even if he had a physical illness,

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:34.220
that he was thriving spiritually.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.259
And what a blessing to think about someone

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:38.940
that is doing well spiritually.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.139
The fact of the matter is that we may be hindered physically.

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:46.339
We may have some difficulties as we age

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:47.500
and so on and so forth.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.139
We have some difficulties with our failing health

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.460
and strength and physical capabilities.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.899
But what a blessing to know

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:59.240
that even if the physical is suffering,

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.539
that we can be thriving spiritually.

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:04.259
And as we look at this portion of scripture,

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:06.619
I've simply entitled from verse number one,

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:08.460
our title for the message this morning,

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.220
the well-beloved Gaius.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.860
Notice the Bible says this in beginning in verse number one,

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.940
the elder, John, unto the well-beloved Gaius,

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.339
whom I love in the truth.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:24.179
Beloved, I wish above all things

00:04:24.179 --> 00:04:27.940
that thou mayest prosper and be in health,

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.980
even as thy soul prospereth.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.480
For I rejoiced greatly when the brethren came

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.459
and testified of the truth that is in thee,

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:40.660
even as thou walkest in the truth.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.339
I have no greater joy than to hear

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:45.019
that my children walk in truth.

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:48.739
Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest

00:04:48.739 --> 00:04:51.500
to the brethren and to strangers,

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.179
which have borne witness of thy charity before the church,

00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:58.399
whom if thou bring forward on their journey

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:02.260
after a godly sort, thou shalt do well.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.179
Because that for his name's sake,

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:07.220
they went forth taking nothing of the Gentiles,

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.619
we therefore ought to receive such

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:13.940
that we might be fellow helpers to the truth.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.700
As you look at this portion of scripture,

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.079
I wanna note really five things this morning

00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:20.260
that I trust will be an encouragement to you

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.179
as we study the life of Gaius,

00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:25.600
to be challenged by his testimony

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.600
and to be comforted in knowing that God uses individuals.

00:05:30.859 --> 00:05:32.179
If you take notes this morning,

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:33.700
notice number one with me,

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.899
Gaius was obedient to God's word.

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:39.179
Gaius was obedient to God's word.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.500
The Bible says in verse number three,

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.459
notice it says, for I rejoiced greatly

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:44.980
when the brethren came and testified

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.899
of the truth that is in thee,

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:50.500
even as thou walkest in the truth.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.940
Now we understand as we look at this statement here

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:53.779
in verse number three,

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:56.179
when we consider the obedience of Gaius,

00:05:56.179 --> 00:05:58.260
that his obedience was evident

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.440
to those to whom he was serving.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.299
They could see in his life that he was an individual

00:06:04.299 --> 00:06:06.619
that was obedient to the word of God.

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:08.980
He had a good testimony publicly,

00:06:09.739 --> 00:06:12.420
no doubt if publicly he was obedient to the word of God

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.579
and we're looking at the passage of scripture

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:16.899
and seeing how his soul was prospering,

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:19.459
that privately he must have been obedient

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:21.459
to God's word as well.

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:24.859
And begin to think about this obedience of this man Gaius

00:06:24.859 --> 00:06:26.299
and understanding that it was evident,

00:06:26.299 --> 00:06:29.739
it was obvious to those with whom he served.

00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:32.260
But we also know in verse number three,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.140
that the Bible says that it was reported by the brethren.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.059
Notice it says, for I rejoiced greatly

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:41.500
when the brethren came and testified

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.100
of the truth that is in thee,

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.380
even as thou walkest in the truth.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.459
Let another man praise thee, the Bible tells us.

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:51.619
And we find here in this text of scripture

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:54.459
that Gaius was not writing back to John

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:56.339
and saying, John, I just want you to understand

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:58.720
how obedient I am in my life.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.619
And I want you to know, John, that I'm more obedient,

00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:06.220
that no, no, the brethren brought this report to John.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.059
As the brethren brought this report to John,

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:12.299
and we understand the obedience of this man Gaius,

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:14.140
that it was obvious, it was evident

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.619
to those with whom he served,

00:07:15.619 --> 00:07:17.500
but it was reported by the brethren.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.540
I do not believe this morning that Gaius was a man

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.100
that was looking for acceptance.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.179
I do not believe that Gaius was a man

00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:26.579
that was looking for accolades.

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:30.179
No, I believe Gaius was a man who simply loved the Lord.

00:07:31.179 --> 00:07:36.179
And because he loved the Lord, he obeyed God's word.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.220
The Bible is a precious book that's been given to us.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.420
We understand that it's been preserved.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.459
And you think about the supernatural work of God,

00:07:46.459 --> 00:07:51.019
not only in giving us the Bible through the truth

00:07:51.019 --> 00:07:53.940
of all scriptures given by inspiration of God

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.700
and that divine revelation,

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.420
but we understand that he's divinely preserved

00:07:58.459 --> 00:08:01.179
his word for us, and we have the Bible

00:08:01.179 --> 00:08:04.100
and how precious and profitable it is to us.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.459
And we understand that the scriptures tell us in Psalm 19,

00:08:08.459 --> 00:08:10.700
if you were to read through really verse seven

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.179
down through verse number 11,

00:08:12.179 --> 00:08:15.260
and all how the Bible describes itself

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.339
in those portions of those verses of scripture.

00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:20.119
And we find that the Bible tells us

00:08:20.119 --> 00:08:22.720
that we do well if we take heed.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.820
And we are to take the warnings and we're to obey.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.940
We understand that the principle of obedience

00:08:28.459 --> 00:08:29.660
is a principle that is found

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.900
throughout the entirety of God's word.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.599
You begin to read of the situation there,

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:37.539
the account of Cain and Abel.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:40.059
And you find that Cain is told if thou doest well,

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:41.900
shalt thou not be accepted.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.179
In other words, if you obey,

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:47.299
if you follow the prescribed path, you'll be accepted.

00:08:47.299 --> 00:08:50.539
Obedience always leads to blessing.

00:08:50.539 --> 00:08:52.940
I want you to notice it's interesting as you know,

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.059
in verse number three, again, as we're speaking

00:08:55.059 --> 00:08:57.299
about the obedience of this man Gaius,

00:08:57.299 --> 00:09:00.460
that his obedience had a profound impact

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.059
upon the Apostle John.

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:05.179
Notice what John says in verse number three,

00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:07.820
for I rejoiced greatly.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.700
John, what is it that would cause you to rejoice greatly?

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.820
I'm rejoicing greatly because there's a man over there,

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.539
Gaius, someone in whom God had given me an opportunity

00:09:18.539 --> 00:09:22.479
to influence and to have some part of influencing his life.

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:24.340
And he's walking in the truth.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.059
He's obedient to God's word.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.219
And John the Apostle is saying this truth

00:09:30.219 --> 00:09:34.020
has caused me to rejoice greatly.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.140
No doubt as we find in verse number four,

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.460
a verse of scripture that has often been used

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.900
when we speak about parenting,

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.580
where John says I have no greater joy

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.780
than to hear that my children walk in truth.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.799
And you'd understand that we can look at that truth

00:09:47.799 --> 00:09:50.359
from verse number four and apply it to parenting.

00:09:50.359 --> 00:09:53.500
And no doubt there's great joy that comes in the heart

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.900
and the life of a parent when a child is doing what's right

00:09:57.739 --> 00:09:58.659
and walking in truth.

00:09:58.659 --> 00:10:00.140
But you understand that.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.880
Biblically, he's not talking about being a parent.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.360
He's speaking about the spiritual relationship

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.620
between John and Gaius, and he says,

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.000
listen, I have no greater joy

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.480
than to hear that my children walk in truth.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:21.080
John was rejoicing greatly because of the obedience

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.840
of an individual believer.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.520
Look at a few verses with me, if you will.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.440
Turn back to the Gospel of John,

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.220
and look at John chapter number two.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.860
The Gospel of John, and John chapter number two.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.660
We'll look at just a few verses here this morning

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.920
with regard to the subject matter of obedience,

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.380
and noting the obedience of Gaius in our text of scripture

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.740
in the short epistle, 3 John.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.740
But notice in John chapter number two,

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.620
this is the first miracle, the beginning of miracles,

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.620
there at the wedding in Cana.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.500
But I wanna draw your attention to just a single verse

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.480
of scripture within this miracle,

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.240
and it's a statement that is made by Mary.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.640
Notice in verse number five, his mother, Mary,

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.640
saith unto the servants, whatsoever he saith unto you,

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:11.960
do it.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.520
That's pretty straightforward, isn't it?

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.800
Now, contextually, it's with regard

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.000
to the particular miracle that's taking place in Cana.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.120
We understand that, but understanding

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.600
by way of application this morning,

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.940
that Jesus is God, he's God in flesh,

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:31.260
and we find that he's given us the written word of God,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.820
and as we have the Bible in our hands this morning,

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:39.820
whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.380
That settles a whole lot of things, doesn't it?

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.460
We've often said in counseling,

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.980
privately, in public preaching,

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.480
I've often said to individuals that, listen,

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.820
we must first agree that we're gonna agree with God,

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.900
because if we can agree that we're going to agree with God

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.460
and with God's word and what God said,

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.540
then that settles a whole lot of things,

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.460
because no longer is it your position or my position

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.780
or my interpretation or your interpretation.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.740
No, we're gonna go to the Bible

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.460
and find what the Bible says,

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.380
and Jesus is here ministering,

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.380
and Mary says to the servants,

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.720
whatsoever he, Jesus, saith unto you,

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.260
servants, do it, do it.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.460
Notice, if you will, in Luke chapter number six,

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.200
Luke chapter number six,

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.120
and this verse of scripture

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.400
is a convicting verse of scripture.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.940
In fact, I remember a number of years ago,

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.520
Brianna just graduated from high school,

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.920
so it was, I think she might have been in fifth grade,

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.560
maybe sixth grade, so it was six, seven years ago

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.760
that she was over at Heritage Christian School

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:51.020
and she was singing a song as part of Odax,

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.340
and part of that song that they were singing

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.780
was really taken from this truth

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.740
in Luke chapter number six and verse number 46,

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.060
and I remember hearing that song.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.380
I'd never heard the song before.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.480
I've never heard it since then,

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.240
but what a great song that gives the truth

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.560
of this verse of scripture.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.160
Notice in Luke six and verse 46,

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.660
notice Jesus says this,

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.620
why call ye me Lord, Lord,

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.080
and do not the things which I say?

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.300
That's convicting.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.160
Jesus is saying, why are you calling me Lord,

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.000
but you're not obeying me?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.200
You're not doing the things which I say.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.560
Verse 47, whosoever cometh to me

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.280
and heareth my sayings and doeth them,

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.680
I will show you to whom he is like.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.840
He is like a man which built a house and digged deep

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.740
and laid the foundation on a rock,

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.320
and when the floods arose,

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.540
the stream beat vehemently upon the house

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:48.860
and could not shake it,

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.260
for it was founded upon a rock,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.180
but he that heareth and doeth not

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.620
is like a man that without a foundation

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.220
built a house upon the earth

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.740
against which the stream did beat vehemently,

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.220
and immediately it fell,

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.840
and the ruin of that house was great.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.460
You find that Jesus asked that piercing question,

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.960
why call ye me Lord, Lord,

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:17.060
and do not the things which I say?

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.760
See, Gaius was a man who was obedient to the word of God.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.760
I said this a moment ago that I do not believe

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.900
that Gaius was looking for acceptance or accolades.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:28.740
He was not trying.

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:31.200
He wasn't vying for a position within the church.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.280
I believe that he was simply a man that loved God,

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.680
and out of his love for God came obedience to God's word,

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.580
and that's what Jesus tells us in John 14 and 15.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:46.120
He says, if you love me, keep my commandments.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.360
If you love me, keep my commandments.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.700
We see that is repeated by John in 1 John 5,

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.300
that he says that same thing again

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.380
that John would have heard Jesus say

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.660
there in John 14 and verse 15.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.580
We find that in 1 John 5 and verse number three,

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.700
John says this, for this is the love of God,

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.340
that we keep his commandments,

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.360
and his commandments are not grievous.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.800
I'm so thankful that God has given us his word,

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.440
but how imperative it is that we obey his word,

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.440
that we are doers of the word and not hearers only.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.160
It is absolutely imperative.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.860
It's not enough to have the right Bible.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.480
It's not enough to talk about having the Bible.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.080
We must be doers of the word.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.260
We must be obedient to God's word,

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.360
and with obedience to God's word comes blessing.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:41.000
No doubt we find that the key, if you will,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.140
to Gaius having, as John refers to it,

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:49.140
as a soul that prospereth, is his obedience to God's word.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.100
Gaius was obedient to the word of God.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.760
Number two, if you're taking notes back in 3 John,

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.280
I want you to notice with me, number two,

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.240
that Gaius was a servant.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.260
He was a servant.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.840
As we look here at the short letter of 3 John,

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.360
we do not have a complete record

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.580
of the service of this man, Gaius,

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.800
but we find that the summary statement

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.860
that is given to us in verse number five

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:16.020
is of great significance, and it's a powerful truth.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.260
Notice what the Bible says in verse number five

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.900
with regard to this man, Gaius,

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.180
being a servant of the Lord.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:27.060
It says, beloved, thou doest faithfully

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:32.060
whatsoever thou doest to the brethren and to strangers.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.140
I want you to think about this statement

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.720
in considering the service and the fact

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.120
that Gaius is a servant.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.240
By the way, it's a great thing to be a servant of the Lord.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.080
You find that as you study and you read

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:45.960
through the New Testament,

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.840
that a number of the New Testament letters

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.980
that you'll read, the books in the New Testament,

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.360
they'll start out by the author mentioning

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.280
that they are a servant of the Lord.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.460
And what a great privilege to be a servant

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.840
of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.680
And we find that he's a good master

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.440
and he's worthy of our service.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.440
And we find that the Bible says there in verse number five,

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:12.440
thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.880
Now, last Sunday evening, we had an introduction

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.080
to the life of Joseph from Genesis chapter 37.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.360
And one of the points that I made in that introduction

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.360
was that Joseph was a man that worked.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.600
He was a man that was working, hardworking.

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.120
And we noticed some of that from Genesis 37.

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.560
And I talked about the fact that work is good.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.200
And we find that the Bible says,

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:38.200
whatsoever thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:42.360
And I see this faithful servant of the Lord.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.240
I don't believe, again, that Gaius was a man

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.000
that was serving just if certain people were around

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.280
and watching and observing.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.440
I remember when I worked in the corporate world,

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.040
there would be times in which you'd be in the office there

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:56.920
and then all of a sudden,

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.720
the people that were goofing off and doing whatever,

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.920
they quickly get back to their desk

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.760
and pretend as if they're working.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.600
Why?

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.200
Because one of the bosses enters into the building.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.280
That's nonsense.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.360
Really, it is.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.280
As a child of God, we are serving God.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.360
And we serve the Lord.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.120
And we find that here, that his service,

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.280
he was a faithful servant of the Lord.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.160
That thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.760
But I want you to notice the latter part

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:32.440
of verse number five, to the brethren, to the brethren.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.960
Now, we can understand that.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.080
We can understand brothers and sisters in Christ.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.119
And we can understand the service

00:18:38.119 --> 00:18:42.359
that maybe he would be involved in on serving one another

00:18:42.359 --> 00:18:44.600
and loving one another and so on and so forth.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.559
And that relationship of brother and sister in Christ.

00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:53.559
But the Bible says to the brethren and to strangers,

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.020
to strangers.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:00.260
It's impactful when we begin to think about the service

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.859
of Gaius and understanding that he was a servant.

00:19:02.859 --> 00:19:06.059
He just, I believe, was a man that was privileged

00:19:06.059 --> 00:19:07.460
to be able to serve God.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.140
And he wasn't serving for any recognition.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.020
He wasn't serving so that he could get

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.700
some level of promotion, if you will.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.260
He just was privileged to serve God.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.540
And he did whatever he did faithfully.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:24.340
And he did it to the brethren and to strangers.

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.980
We're gonna think about that phraseology

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.179
with regard to his service.

00:19:29.179 --> 00:19:31.220
And I would say that it's quite evident

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.460
from the way in which the description is given to us

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:37.260
that his service was first to the Lord.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.340
His service was first to the Lord.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.179
It wasn't that he was just serving this individual

00:19:42.179 --> 00:19:43.340
or these individuals.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.020
No, he was serving the Lord.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.260
And as he was serving the Lord,

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.299
God would give him opportunities.

00:19:48.299 --> 00:19:52.220
And he was mindful of the fact that he was serving Christ.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.119
He was serving his master.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.600
And what a wonderful blessing it is

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.320
to be a servant of the Lord.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.679
I would say number three this morning,

00:19:59.679 --> 00:20:00.679
as you look at this.

00:20:00.679 --> 00:20:02.679
this portion of scripture that you'll notice

00:20:02.679 --> 00:20:05.579
that Gaius was not only a man that was obedient

00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:09.079
to God's word, a man that was a servant of the Lord,

00:20:09.079 --> 00:20:11.319
but Gaius was generous.

00:20:11.319 --> 00:20:12.839
Gaius was generous.

00:20:12.839 --> 00:20:14.799
I believe that the Lord had blessed him.

00:20:14.799 --> 00:20:16.879
Again, we don't know a lot about this man

00:20:16.879 --> 00:20:19.639
and his background and so on and so forth,

00:20:19.639 --> 00:20:21.439
but it seems as if, as you would look

00:20:21.439 --> 00:20:22.919
at the text of scripture, that the Lord

00:20:22.919 --> 00:20:25.199
had blessed this man and he desired

00:20:25.199 --> 00:20:26.439
to be a blessing to others.

00:20:26.439 --> 00:20:29.919
In fact, he desired to use his resources

00:20:29.919 --> 00:20:32.799
for God's work and for God's glory.

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:34.079
As you look in verse number six,

00:20:34.079 --> 00:20:36.799
the Bible says, which have borne witness

00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:40.359
of thy charity before the church,

00:20:40.359 --> 00:20:42.959
whom, if thou bring forward on their journey

00:20:42.959 --> 00:20:45.719
after a godly sort, thou shalt do well,

00:20:45.719 --> 00:20:48.099
because that for his namesake they went forth,

00:20:48.099 --> 00:20:49.839
taking nothing of the Gentiles.

00:20:49.839 --> 00:20:51.459
And so, to get a little background

00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:53.519
as to what's taking place, we would see

00:20:53.519 --> 00:20:57.039
that the hospitality of Gaius is on display

00:20:57.039 --> 00:20:59.479
in verses six and seven, and his generosity

00:20:59.479 --> 00:21:02.039
is being referred to in verses six and seven.

00:21:02.039 --> 00:21:04.639
There were these preachers, these servants

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:06.719
of the Lord that would travel through,

00:21:06.719 --> 00:21:07.979
and as they were traveling through,

00:21:07.979 --> 00:21:09.159
they would need assistance.

00:21:09.159 --> 00:21:10.799
They would need somebody to help them

00:21:10.799 --> 00:21:13.719
on their way to get to the next place,

00:21:13.719 --> 00:21:16.479
to be able to serve and minister in the next location.

00:21:16.479 --> 00:21:18.279
And we find that the Bible would tell us

00:21:18.279 --> 00:21:20.879
that Gaius was a man that was involved

00:21:20.879 --> 00:21:23.839
in helping in those particular situations.

00:21:23.839 --> 00:21:26.199
The phrase in your Bible that says

00:21:26.199 --> 00:21:30.719
in verse number six, bring forward on their journey.

00:21:30.719 --> 00:21:34.079
Now, that's a five-word phrase in English,

00:21:34.079 --> 00:21:36.639
but it's just one Greek word.

00:21:36.639 --> 00:21:39.359
And that single Greek word that is translated

00:21:39.359 --> 00:21:41.519
for us, bring forward on their journey,

00:21:41.519 --> 00:21:44.799
literally carries with it the idea

00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:47.319
of fitting someone out for all

00:21:47.319 --> 00:21:49.999
that is necessary for a journey.

00:21:49.999 --> 00:21:51.259
Now, think about that.

00:21:51.259 --> 00:21:53.279
Someone's taking a journey.

00:21:53.279 --> 00:21:56.719
These traveling preachers, they're taking this journey,

00:21:56.719 --> 00:21:59.399
and there were some needs that they had

00:21:59.399 --> 00:22:01.319
in order to get from where they were

00:22:01.319 --> 00:22:03.599
to where they were supposed to be ministering,

00:22:03.599 --> 00:22:07.919
and there were certain needs that were necessary

00:22:07.919 --> 00:22:11.079
in order to allow them to take that journey.

00:22:11.079 --> 00:22:15.119
And that word means, to bring forward on their journey,

00:22:15.119 --> 00:22:19.279
means to fit them out, to provide the things necessary

00:22:19.279 --> 00:22:21.819
for that journey, whether they be supplies,

00:22:21.819 --> 00:22:24.599
whether they be lodging, whatever it might be,

00:22:24.599 --> 00:22:26.739
that those things are being supplied.

00:22:26.739 --> 00:22:30.819
I see the generosity of this man, Gaius.

00:22:30.819 --> 00:22:33.179
I begin to think about this man's generosity,

00:22:33.179 --> 00:22:34.419
and I would say that he was a man

00:22:34.419 --> 00:22:37.339
that was storing up treasure in heaven.

00:22:37.339 --> 00:22:39.019
He was storing up treasure in heaven.

00:22:39.019 --> 00:22:40.419
Turn to the book of Matthew, if you will,

00:22:40.419 --> 00:22:43.779
in chapter number five, Matthew chapter number five.

00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:46.059
Someone made the comment to me this past week

00:22:46.059 --> 00:22:49.299
about something with regard to the stock market

00:22:49.299 --> 00:22:51.359
and something about, man, you could have made

00:22:51.899 --> 00:22:52.879
a lot of money in this particular day

00:22:52.879 --> 00:22:54.599
in the stock market or whatever it was.

00:22:54.599 --> 00:22:57.279
And the reality is that we understand

00:22:57.279 --> 00:22:59.939
that things quickly can change.

00:22:59.939 --> 00:23:02.859
When you think about the truth this morning

00:23:02.859 --> 00:23:06.279
with regard to all that takes place

00:23:06.279 --> 00:23:09.959
with our economy and so on and so forth,

00:23:09.959 --> 00:23:12.799
but the Bible teaches us that we can lay up

00:23:12.799 --> 00:23:15.439
for ourselves treasures in heaven.

00:23:15.439 --> 00:23:17.599
I think I said Matthew five, but it should be Matthew six.

00:23:17.599 --> 00:23:18.799
Did I say five?

00:23:18.799 --> 00:23:22.079
And my apologies, Matthew chapter number six.

00:23:22.079 --> 00:23:23.679
Matthew chapter number six.

00:23:23.679 --> 00:23:26.199
In verse number 19, the Bible says this.

00:23:26.199 --> 00:23:29.759
Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth

00:23:29.759 --> 00:23:31.599
where moth and rust doth corrupt

00:23:31.599 --> 00:23:34.319
and where thieves break through and steal.

00:23:34.319 --> 00:23:37.279
Now, I believe that there is a level of being prudent

00:23:37.279 --> 00:23:40.279
and understanding the importance of retirement

00:23:40.279 --> 00:23:42.699
and what have you, and we understand those things.

00:23:42.699 --> 00:23:44.439
I've said this before from the pulpit.

00:23:44.439 --> 00:23:46.719
I don't say it to be mean or unkind,

00:23:46.719 --> 00:23:50.079
but the reality is that there's a danger

00:23:50.079 --> 00:23:53.439
in a society like ours where there's so much emphasis

00:23:53.439 --> 00:23:55.679
placed upon retirement planning

00:23:55.679 --> 00:23:57.879
and very little emphasis that's placed

00:23:57.879 --> 00:23:59.799
upon eternal planning.

00:24:00.639 --> 00:24:02.639
And the reality is that you may

00:24:02.639 --> 00:24:06.239
or may not ever have retirement years.

00:24:06.239 --> 00:24:09.319
Some of you say I'm already enjoying them, hallelujah.

00:24:09.319 --> 00:24:12.179
But for some of us, we may never have retirement years.

00:24:12.179 --> 00:24:13.919
We just don't know.

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:16.039
There's but a step between us and death.

00:24:16.039 --> 00:24:17.679
As it appointed unto man wants to die

00:24:17.679 --> 00:24:19.880
after this the judgment, but there's also the truth

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.839
that the trumpet of the Lord shall sound at any time, amen.

00:24:22.839 --> 00:24:25.000
And I'm looking forward to hearing

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.479
the trumpet of the Lord sound.

00:24:26.479 --> 00:24:29.220
And so we are not sure of retirement,

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.239
but we are sure of eternity.

00:24:32.559 --> 00:24:36.279
And here, Jesus in his instruction here in Matthew six,

00:24:36.279 --> 00:24:39.679
he says with regard to laying up treasures,

00:24:39.679 --> 00:24:41.000
notice in verse number 20,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.699
but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven

00:24:44.699 --> 00:24:46.759
where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt

00:24:46.759 --> 00:24:49.339
and where thieves do not break through nor steal,

00:24:49.339 --> 00:24:53.279
for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

00:24:54.619 --> 00:24:55.699
I would tell you this morning

00:24:55.699 --> 00:24:57.619
that it is absolutely possible

00:24:57.619 --> 00:25:00.539
that you can plan for retirement here on this earth,

00:25:00.539 --> 00:25:02.539
but also be planning for eternity,

00:25:02.539 --> 00:25:04.779
and you can be storing up treasure in heaven.

00:25:04.779 --> 00:25:06.419
It's not an either or.

00:25:08.019 --> 00:25:09.820
You can do both.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.399
You can be wise and you can prepare for retirement

00:25:13.399 --> 00:25:17.160
here on this earth, but you can be actively generous

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.679
in your giving to God and to his work.

00:25:20.839 --> 00:25:23.559
And by the way, that's God honoring.

00:25:23.559 --> 00:25:25.880
I begin to think about this thought

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.679
of storing up treasure, laying up treasure in heaven,

00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:31.339
sending it in advance,

00:25:31.339 --> 00:25:33.919
and all that God is able to do with it.

00:25:33.919 --> 00:25:37.600
And I said it's not an either or, we can do both,

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:41.019
but it requires that we live within our means.

00:25:41.019 --> 00:25:42.759
It might require that we don't have

00:25:43.119 --> 00:25:45.880
all of the newest things that come down the pike.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.600
We live in a society that constantly is bombarding us

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.559
with all of the newest, fanciest,

00:25:51.559 --> 00:25:54.799
you need this, you need that, you can't live without it.

00:25:54.799 --> 00:25:59.799
And the marketing ploys of our society

00:25:59.859 --> 00:26:02.559
are of course very in your face,

00:26:02.559 --> 00:26:04.759
and they're very good at what they do,

00:26:04.759 --> 00:26:07.759
otherwise they wouldn't be given the kind of monies

00:26:07.759 --> 00:26:09.959
that they're given on an annual basis.

00:26:09.959 --> 00:26:13.079
But the reality is that we can do both.

00:26:13.079 --> 00:26:15.759
Gaius was a man who was generous.

00:26:15.759 --> 00:26:19.440
He was providing and helping those

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.399
that were serving the Lord.

00:26:20.399 --> 00:26:21.320
Notice what the Bible says

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.079
in 2 Corinthians chapter number nine.

00:26:24.079 --> 00:26:25.799
In 2 Corinthians chapter number nine,

00:26:25.799 --> 00:26:28.000
it's a familiar verse of scripture,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.559
but I want you to notice what God tells us

00:26:30.559 --> 00:26:32.199
with regard to giving.

00:26:32.199 --> 00:26:37.039
And by the way, I'm so thankful that God has blessed us.

00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:39.320
And we have been blessed beyond measure,

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.799
and it's an absolute privilege

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:43.199
that I have an opportunity to give back to God

00:26:43.199 --> 00:26:46.119
a portion of what he has graciously blessed me with.

00:26:46.119 --> 00:26:50.279
I thank God for the opportunity to give to the work of God.

00:26:50.279 --> 00:26:52.759
He says in 2 Corinthians nine in verse number six,

00:26:52.759 --> 00:26:55.559
but this I say, he which soweth sparingly

00:26:55.559 --> 00:26:57.039
shall reap also sparingly,

00:26:57.039 --> 00:27:00.959
and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.

00:27:00.959 --> 00:27:03.479
Every man according as he purposeth in his heart,

00:27:03.479 --> 00:27:04.679
so let him give.

00:27:04.679 --> 00:27:08.320
Notice what it says, not grudgingly or of necessity,

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:12.119
for God loveth a cheerful giver.

00:27:12.119 --> 00:27:14.320
God loveth a cheerful giver.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.679
Someone that I often pray that God would help us

00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:21.779
to give cheerfully and appropriately.

00:27:21.779 --> 00:27:25.720
And we look at that, listen, it's not that I have to give,

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.839
it's not that I'm holding on to that offering so tight

00:27:28.839 --> 00:27:29.799
that it's hard for me to part.

00:27:29.799 --> 00:27:32.839
No, no, I get to give to God's work.

00:27:32.839 --> 00:27:34.720
What a privilege.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.479
Personally, we won't take time this morning to go there,

00:27:37.519 --> 00:27:39.399
but maybe you wanna jot it down in your notes.

00:27:39.399 --> 00:27:42.039
I believe that 1 Chronicles chapter 29

00:27:42.039 --> 00:27:44.880
is probably within the whole of scripture,

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.579
the greatest illustration of someone

00:27:47.579 --> 00:27:51.320
that's giving cheerfully, and that's David.

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.399
In 1 Chronicles chapter 29, you go back there

00:27:53.399 --> 00:27:55.880
and you read it later today or this week,

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.759
and you read that text of scripture,

00:27:57.759 --> 00:27:59.239
and you see for yourself

00:27:59.239 --> 00:28:02.639
that that is a wonderful illustration example

00:28:02.639 --> 00:28:04.959
of a man that was giving cheerfully.

00:28:05.839 --> 00:28:08.600
And by the way, if you understand within the context

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:13.119
of 1 Chronicles 29, that David was giving for a temple

00:28:13.119 --> 00:28:16.059
that he would never see and never worship God in,

00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:19.339
but he was given for the next generation.

00:28:19.339 --> 00:28:21.299
What a blessing, what a blessing.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.239
In Philippians chapter number four,

00:28:25.199 --> 00:28:28.600
the Bible teaches us about those that were giving

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:32.299
to the work of mission, specifically the church at Philippi

00:28:32.299 --> 00:28:35.219
here in the ministry of the Apostle Paul

00:28:35.219 --> 00:28:37.859
in Philippians chapter number four.

00:28:37.859 --> 00:28:40.580
As I think about the work of the ministry

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:43.099
and the Apostle Paul faithfully serving the Lord

00:28:43.099 --> 00:28:47.260
and how God would use the church at Philippi,

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:51.299
we find that God gives in this text of scripture

00:28:51.299 --> 00:28:54.219
some wonderful promises and realities

00:28:54.219 --> 00:28:55.700
with regard to our giving.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.539
Notice what Paul says beginning in verse number 14

00:28:58.539 --> 00:29:01.419
of Philippians four, as he's writing to this local church,

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.539
notwithstanding you have well done

00:29:03.539 --> 00:29:06.219
that you did communicate with my affliction.

00:29:06.219 --> 00:29:07.820
Now you Philippians know also

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:09.260
that in the beginning of the gospel

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.140
when I departed from Macedonia,

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:12.979
no church communicated with me

00:29:12.979 --> 00:29:15.779
as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.

00:29:15.779 --> 00:29:17.099
For even in Thessalonica,

00:29:17.099 --> 00:29:19.940
ye sent once again unto my necessity,

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.460
not because I desire a gift,

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.419
but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.

00:29:24.419 --> 00:29:26.339
But I have all and abound, I am full,

00:29:26.339 --> 00:29:28.500
having received of Epaphroditus

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.099
the things which were sent from you.

00:29:30.099 --> 00:29:33.020
Notice how this offering is described

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:34.739
at the end of verse number 18,

00:29:34.739 --> 00:29:39.739
an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable,

00:29:39.899 --> 00:29:42.859
well-pleasing to God.

00:29:43.899 --> 00:29:46.380
But my God, verse 19, shall supply all your need

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:50.099
according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.

00:29:50.099 --> 00:29:52.580
I believe that as we look at the life of Gaius

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.099
and we note as we're looking at his testimony

00:29:55.099 --> 00:29:56.899
here in third John, that yes,

00:29:56.899 --> 00:29:59.000
he was a man who was obedient to God's word.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.839
He was a man that was a servant.

00:30:00.839 --> 00:30:02.599
He was a man that was generous.

00:30:02.599 --> 00:30:06.239
He was a man that gave so that others could go.

00:30:06.239 --> 00:30:09.239
And he was a man that I believe that his generosity,

00:30:09.239 --> 00:30:12.399
his sacrifice was an odor of a sweet smell,

00:30:12.399 --> 00:30:14.879
a sacrifice that was acceptable

00:30:14.879 --> 00:30:18.099
and well-pleasing to God Almighty.

00:30:19.079 --> 00:30:20.599
What a blessing.

00:30:20.599 --> 00:30:23.039
As you study and look at the life of Gaius here

00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:25.319
in 3rd John, sounds like a guy that we'd like

00:30:25.319 --> 00:30:28.239
to be able to know and worship the Lord with.

00:30:28.239 --> 00:30:30.279
I mean, a good servant of the Lord,

00:30:30.279 --> 00:30:33.199
a faithful follower of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:30:33.199 --> 00:30:34.479
As we look at his testimony,

00:30:34.479 --> 00:30:36.519
turn back to 3rd John, if you will.

00:30:36.519 --> 00:30:38.639
And let me just note two other things quickly

00:30:38.639 --> 00:30:40.399
as we close this morning.

00:30:40.399 --> 00:30:42.879
I want you to notice with me number four,

00:30:42.879 --> 00:30:45.479
if you're taking notes, that Gaius was a man

00:30:45.479 --> 00:30:48.319
that was involved in the work of God.

00:30:48.319 --> 00:30:50.879
He was involved in the work of God.

00:30:50.879 --> 00:30:52.659
As we know, as we look at the scripture,

00:30:52.659 --> 00:30:55.199
we find that the Bible would tell us

00:30:55.199 --> 00:30:58.599
how that he was walking in truth in verse number three,

00:30:58.599 --> 00:30:59.959
how that in verse number five,

00:30:59.959 --> 00:31:03.319
thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest

00:31:03.319 --> 00:31:05.039
to the brethren and to the strangers.

00:31:05.039 --> 00:31:09.479
And so he is personally involved in the work of God.

00:31:09.479 --> 00:31:11.439
The Bible tells us which have borne witness

00:31:11.439 --> 00:31:14.459
of thy charity before the church.

00:31:14.459 --> 00:31:16.319
If thou bring forward on their journey

00:31:16.319 --> 00:31:18.679
after a godly sort, thou shalt do well

00:31:18.679 --> 00:31:20.319
because that for his namesake,

00:31:20.319 --> 00:31:23.319
they went forth taking nothing of the Gentiles.

00:31:23.319 --> 00:31:25.279
We therefore ought to receive such.

00:31:25.319 --> 00:31:29.679
Notice that we might be fellow helpers to the truth.

00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:32.039
When I think about the involvement of Gaius

00:31:32.039 --> 00:31:34.019
and how Gaius was a man who was involved

00:31:34.019 --> 00:31:36.479
in the work of God, his involvement,

00:31:36.479 --> 00:31:38.799
as you know at the end of verse number eight,

00:31:38.799 --> 00:31:43.279
makes him a fellow helper to the truth.

00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:46.439
Now I like that terminology as we would think about

00:31:46.439 --> 00:31:49.399
the way in which God would use us to be fellow helpers,

00:31:49.399 --> 00:31:52.319
fellow laborers to the truth.

00:31:52.319 --> 00:31:54.439
And we find that God's perspective

00:31:54.439 --> 00:31:56.639
is different than man's perspective,

00:31:56.639 --> 00:31:59.119
that Gaius was not the man that was actually

00:31:59.119 --> 00:32:01.719
the traveling preacher, if you will,

00:32:01.719 --> 00:32:04.899
but he was involved on helping the traveling preacher

00:32:04.899 --> 00:32:06.519
to get to where he needed to be.

00:32:07.399 --> 00:32:10.279
And God says he was involved in the work

00:32:10.279 --> 00:32:14.559
and that he was a fellow helper to the truth.

00:32:14.559 --> 00:32:16.039
When I think about Gaius being a man

00:32:16.039 --> 00:32:17.839
that was involved in the work of God,

00:32:17.839 --> 00:32:20.399
I think about it this way, be a participator.

00:32:21.559 --> 00:32:22.879
Don't be a spectator.

00:32:23.879 --> 00:32:25.939
You know, some people like to just sit

00:32:25.939 --> 00:32:30.039
on the sidelines and watch, it drives me crazy.

00:32:30.039 --> 00:32:31.759
You watch a game, you watch something,

00:32:31.759 --> 00:32:34.159
man, I wanna get involved, I wanna participate.

00:32:35.239 --> 00:32:37.799
You know, these guys out here for the,

00:32:37.799 --> 00:32:39.639
every once in a while we have different activities

00:32:39.639 --> 00:32:42.439
and during a recent celebration,

00:32:42.439 --> 00:32:43.959
they're playing cornhole out here.

00:32:43.959 --> 00:32:45.519
I don't wanna stand there for two hours

00:32:45.519 --> 00:32:47.679
and watch them play cornhole, I wanna play.

00:32:48.959 --> 00:32:51.599
I wanna participate.

00:32:51.599 --> 00:32:53.079
I watch them play basketball.

00:32:53.079 --> 00:32:55.359
I'm not that great, I'm getting old, I know,

00:32:55.359 --> 00:32:57.519
but I wanna play, I wanna get involved,

00:32:57.519 --> 00:32:59.279
I wanna participate.

00:33:00.639 --> 00:33:04.359
When it comes to church, when it comes to the work of God,

00:33:04.359 --> 00:33:07.639
it's a wonderful thing to be involved in God's work,

00:33:07.639 --> 00:33:10.839
to be a participator, not to be a spectator,

00:33:10.839 --> 00:33:12.079
not to just sit on the sidelines,

00:33:12.079 --> 00:33:15.119
but, well, there's not a whole lot I can do.

00:33:15.119 --> 00:33:17.239
Find out what you can do and do it

00:33:18.219 --> 00:33:19.719
because God has a purpose for us,

00:33:19.719 --> 00:33:21.599
God has a plan for us.

00:33:21.599 --> 00:33:23.719
We're speaking with a man years ago

00:33:24.639 --> 00:33:27.279
and he had a list of I can't do this

00:33:27.279 --> 00:33:28.999
and I can't do this and I can't do this

00:33:28.999 --> 00:33:30.719
and I said, listen, let's forget about that list

00:33:30.719 --> 00:33:32.439
that you've prepared and let's just focus

00:33:32.439 --> 00:33:35.439
on the things you can do because the reality

00:33:35.439 --> 00:33:37.039
is that we're not interested in talking

00:33:37.039 --> 00:33:38.239
about all the things you can't do,

00:33:38.239 --> 00:33:39.999
but let's figure out what we can do

00:33:39.999 --> 00:33:43.919
because God has equipped us and what a blessing it is

00:33:43.919 --> 00:33:48.919
to be a participator, to be involved in the work of God.

00:33:48.999 --> 00:33:52.319
We mentioned already John chapter number two

00:33:52.319 --> 00:33:55.239
and verse number five earlier when the mother

00:33:55.239 --> 00:33:58.599
of Jesus, Mary, she said, what sort of he saith unto you,

00:33:58.599 --> 00:34:00.599
do it, and it's interesting as you look

00:34:00.599 --> 00:34:03.759
at that portion of scripture that the Bible tells us

00:34:03.759 --> 00:34:08.119
how the servants, they knew what had taken place,

00:34:08.119 --> 00:34:10.899
but the servants which drew the water knew

00:34:10.899 --> 00:34:13.079
is a statement in verse number nine

00:34:13.079 --> 00:34:16.159
and they were involved in the work.

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:18.239
I think about the disciples.

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:21.999
We can read of the many miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:34:21.999 --> 00:34:24.839
and we can see how the Lord Jesus Christ worked

00:34:24.839 --> 00:34:28.119
in just amazing ways, but there's certain miracles

00:34:28.119 --> 00:34:30.939
that Christ performed that he used his disciples.

00:34:32.539 --> 00:34:34.919
I think about the feeding of the 5,000.

00:34:34.919 --> 00:34:36.599
Think about the feeding of the 4,000,

00:34:36.599 --> 00:34:38.559
but if you just focus on the feeding of the 5,000

00:34:38.559 --> 00:34:42.199
for just a moment, we find that God told the disciples

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:44.919
to have everyone sit down, right?

00:34:44.919 --> 00:34:47.079
Now what was the perspective of the disciples?

00:34:47.079 --> 00:34:48.719
It would have been a long day.

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:50.239
I mean, they were tired.

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:53.119
The purpose that Jesus said, let's go to a desert place,

00:34:53.119 --> 00:34:54.179
who remembers why?

00:34:55.239 --> 00:34:59.599
To rest, to rest, but when they went to rest,

00:34:59.599 --> 00:35:01.599
there were some people that got there before them

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:03.999
and Jesus spent all day ministering to them

00:35:05.239 --> 00:35:07.199
and those disciples, what did they say?

00:35:08.239 --> 00:35:12.439
Send them away that they may get something to eat.

00:35:13.439 --> 00:35:15.479
They don't want to be bothered with it.

00:35:15.479 --> 00:35:16.999
You ever feel that way?

00:35:17.919 --> 00:35:21.199
You can get weird, you can get tired, send them away

00:35:21.199 --> 00:35:23.959
and Jesus says, give ye them to eat.

00:35:26.239 --> 00:35:27.759
We don't have anything.

00:35:27.759 --> 00:35:29.759
What do you want us to do?

00:35:29.759 --> 00:35:32.539
Through a series of circumstances, they find a small lunch

00:35:32.539 --> 00:35:35.999
and the Lord says, have them all sit down

00:35:35.999 --> 00:35:38.679
and they all sit down, they have them sit in companies

00:35:38.679 --> 00:35:40.559
and it's very orderly how it's done.

00:35:41.439 --> 00:35:44.239
We find that Jesus blessed and multiplied,

00:35:44.239 --> 00:35:45.959
but if you read the text of scripture,

00:35:45.959 --> 00:35:46.919
you know what has to happen?

00:35:46.919 --> 00:35:51.799
The disciples come to Jesus, they get the bread and the fish

00:35:51.799 --> 00:35:53.439
and they distribute to the people

00:35:55.679 --> 00:35:57.319
and then they go back to Jesus

00:35:58.839 --> 00:36:01.119
and they get the bread and the fish

00:36:01.119 --> 00:36:03.799
and they go and they distribute to the next group of people.

00:36:04.679 --> 00:36:06.879
Is that not what happens in your Bible?

00:36:06.879 --> 00:36:10.759
That's how it says in my Bible, that's what happens.

00:36:10.759 --> 00:36:13.039
So guess what those disciples were doing?

00:36:13.039 --> 00:36:15.519
They're participating in the work of God.

00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:19.159
Now let me ask you this, could God have just supernaturally,

00:36:19.159 --> 00:36:21.679
bam, there's a plate of food in everybody's lap?

00:36:23.439 --> 00:36:26.199
I mean, sure enough, if he multiplied it the way he did,

00:36:26.199 --> 00:36:28.399
he could have done whatever he wanted to do,

00:36:30.119 --> 00:36:31.639
but you know what he decided to do?

00:36:31.639 --> 00:36:33.399
I'm gonna use these disciples.

00:36:34.279 --> 00:36:35.999
You know what God's still doing today?

00:36:35.999 --> 00:36:40.839
Listen, God doesn't need us, but he's chosen to use us

00:36:41.799 --> 00:36:46.039
and that is a truth that I don't know,

00:36:46.039 --> 00:36:48.519
I've been saved now for 25 years,

00:36:49.479 --> 00:36:53.719
almost 26 years I've been saved serving the Lord.

00:36:54.679 --> 00:36:57.319
I don't know that I will ever be able to wrap my mind

00:36:57.319 --> 00:36:59.439
around the truth that God would use us.

00:36:59.439 --> 00:37:04.119
It's an amazing truth that God would use us,

00:37:04.119 --> 00:37:07.959
but in God's plan and in God's wisdom,

00:37:07.959 --> 00:37:11.919
he determined that he would use his children

00:37:13.159 --> 00:37:17.959
and what a privilege and honor to serve the master,

00:37:17.959 --> 00:37:21.479
to be involved in the work.

00:37:21.479 --> 00:37:24.279
See, there's something about being involved in the work

00:37:25.279 --> 00:37:28.559
that's different than just observing the work.

00:37:31.519 --> 00:37:34.759
Somebody went out yesterday with us

00:37:34.759 --> 00:37:36.119
and they contacted me and they said,

00:37:36.119 --> 00:37:38.799
I just have so much joy

00:37:39.719 --> 00:37:42.719
because I was able to go and share the gospel with someone.

00:37:45.159 --> 00:37:48.599
Involved in the work, doing the work.

00:37:49.719 --> 00:37:51.359
Somebody might be able to hear that,

00:37:51.359 --> 00:37:56.359
that's an observer that's, wow, that seems exciting,

00:37:56.759 --> 00:37:59.099
but it's a different experience altogether

00:37:59.099 --> 00:38:01.319
when you're involved in the work.

00:38:01.319 --> 00:38:04.999
And Gaius was a man that was involved,

00:38:04.999 --> 00:38:07.219
he was involved in God's work.

00:38:07.219 --> 00:38:09.599
Number five, very simply,

00:38:09.599 --> 00:38:12.879
more of a summary statement than a point actually,

00:38:12.879 --> 00:38:16.399
Gaius was exemplary, he was exemplary.

00:38:16.399 --> 00:38:17.639
If I could say it this way,

00:38:17.639 --> 00:38:20.879
he is a model follower of Christ.

00:38:20.879 --> 00:38:24.319
I hesitate on using the terminology

00:38:24.319 --> 00:38:25.859
of being a model Christian,

00:38:27.199 --> 00:38:30.359
but we do know that God has given us in his word

00:38:30.359 --> 00:38:34.359
the truth that Jesus is our example

00:38:34.359 --> 00:38:37.599
and we understand that it makes it very plain.

00:38:37.599 --> 00:38:40.279
Peter writes that Jesus left us an example

00:38:40.279 --> 00:38:42.599
that we should follow his steps.

00:38:42.599 --> 00:38:45.779
And so we understand that Jesus is the greatest example.

00:38:45.779 --> 00:38:48.039
But you understand that the apostle Paul said,

00:38:48.039 --> 00:38:53.039
be followers of me even as I also am of Christ.

00:38:53.159 --> 00:38:55.199
You understand that Paul said to the believers

00:38:55.199 --> 00:38:56.399
in Philippi in chapter four,

00:38:56.399 --> 00:38:58.799
just before what we read just a moment ago,

00:38:58.799 --> 00:39:00.919
he says that the things that you've heard

00:39:00.919 --> 00:39:03.099
and seen in me do.

00:39:04.099 --> 00:39:06.179
And so we find that this man Gaius,

00:39:06.179 --> 00:39:08.339
when I look at his testimony and again,

00:39:08.339 --> 00:39:10.979
a man that God doesn't tell us a whole lot about.

00:39:10.979 --> 00:39:13.819
I mean, if you were to study the life of Paul this morning,

00:39:13.819 --> 00:39:15.699
there's so many more things that you find

00:39:15.699 --> 00:39:19.499
in God's record in his Bible about the apostle Paul

00:39:19.499 --> 00:39:21.739
and so little about this man Gaius,

00:39:21.739 --> 00:39:24.739
but yet what God has chosen to record for us

00:39:24.739 --> 00:39:27.459
and to provide us record with this morning

00:39:27.459 --> 00:39:30.899
of this man Gaius, man, he's exemplary.

00:39:31.899 --> 00:39:35.059
And God chose to record it for a purpose.

00:39:35.059 --> 00:39:36.819
And I believe this morning that as much

00:39:36.819 --> 00:39:39.899
as we can be encouraged by studying about this man Gaius

00:39:39.899 --> 00:39:43.259
and understanding how God would use this individual

00:39:43.259 --> 00:39:45.419
and how he was a man that was obedient.

00:39:45.419 --> 00:39:47.619
He was a man that was a servant.

00:39:47.619 --> 00:39:49.019
He was a man that was generous.

00:39:49.019 --> 00:39:50.499
He was a man that was involved.

00:39:50.499 --> 00:39:52.619
And we look at his life and we rejoice

00:39:52.619 --> 00:39:54.619
just as John was rejoicing.

00:39:54.619 --> 00:39:56.779
He says, listen, I'm rejoicing greatly

00:39:56.779 --> 00:40:00.699
because of the record, the report that I'm receiving.

00:40:00.699 --> 00:40:06.679
We can rejoice this morning, but oh that God would help us to look at the life of Gaius

00:40:06.679 --> 00:40:13.639
and say, God would you use me in the same way that you used Gaius?

00:40:13.639 --> 00:40:18.919
See Gaius was just a man that made himself available to God and said where I am with

00:40:18.919 --> 00:40:23.039
what I have, I just want to serve God.

00:40:23.039 --> 00:40:26.359
I want to be obedient to His Word.

00:40:26.479 --> 00:40:30.959
Though his health may have been failing, as you would note in verse number two, that his

00:40:30.959 --> 00:40:34.959
soul was prospering, he was doing quite well spiritually.

00:40:34.959 --> 00:40:39.719
And I'm thankful that we can thrive spiritually.

00:40:39.719 --> 00:40:46.399
I've said this before, we're as close to God as we want to be.

00:40:46.399 --> 00:40:49.119
We are as close to God as we want to be.

00:40:49.119 --> 00:40:55.639
We spend as much time with God in His Word and in prayer as we really want to.

00:40:55.919 --> 00:40:58.279
Oh, I just don't have any time.

00:40:58.279 --> 00:41:02.079
If you've got a smart phone like I do, it tells you how many minutes you've spent on

00:41:02.079 --> 00:41:07.239
your phone all week, hallelujah, right?

00:41:07.239 --> 00:41:12.199
Listen, we've got time for all kinds of things, really.

00:41:12.199 --> 00:41:17.959
Gaius, when we look at his testimony, it's exemplary.

00:41:17.959 --> 00:41:23.239
He's a believer that just was all in.

00:41:23.239 --> 00:41:30.279
A believer that though he doesn't say it, Paul says it, I am crucified with Christ.

00:41:30.279 --> 00:41:33.039
I think it fits with Gaius.

00:41:33.039 --> 00:41:35.959
He's a man that just wanted to serve God.

00:41:35.959 --> 00:41:45.479
This morning, we need some people of God, some men of God, some women of God that would

00:41:45.479 --> 00:41:52.879
have these same type of character traits evident in their life, obedience to God's

00:41:52.879 --> 00:41:53.879
Word.

00:41:53.879 --> 00:41:59.919
Why call you me Lord, Lord and do not the things that I say?

00:41:59.919 --> 00:42:05.679
That we just understand we're servants and what a privilege it is to be a servant of

00:42:05.679 --> 00:42:11.359
the Lord, that we'd be generous.

00:42:11.359 --> 00:42:16.439
I want to lay up treasure in heaven.

00:42:16.439 --> 00:42:17.599
I want to be used of thee.

00:42:17.599 --> 00:42:22.919
I thank you for giving me the resources that you did, that you have, so I might be used

00:42:22.919 --> 00:42:23.919
of thee.

00:42:23.919 --> 00:42:26.119
Oh, that we'd be involved.

00:42:26.119 --> 00:42:30.079
God, what's the place that you have for me?

00:42:30.079 --> 00:42:32.159
What can I do in your work?

00:42:32.159 --> 00:42:34.639
How can you use me?

00:42:34.639 --> 00:42:36.919
Gaius was a man that was exemplary.

00:42:36.919 --> 00:42:41.879
I thank God for his testimony and I trust this morning that we would be challenged to

00:42:41.879 --> 00:42:44.399
walk in obedience to God.

00:42:44.399 --> 00:42:45.399
Let's pray.

00:42:45.399 --> 00:42:46.399
Father, we love you.

00:42:46.399 --> 00:42:48.639
We thank you for loving us.

00:42:48.639 --> 00:42:54.919
We thank you for the privilege that we have of being able to gather together, having a

00:42:54.919 --> 00:43:03.959
Bible, reading of those who have gone before us and the testimony of this man, Gaius.

00:43:03.959 --> 00:43:05.959
I'm thankful.

00:43:05.999 --> 00:43:08.559
I'm challenged.

00:43:08.559 --> 00:43:14.199
And I pray that as we've examined your word this morning, that you'd help us in this moment.

00:43:14.199 --> 00:43:20.159
God, help us to be doers of the word and not hearers only.

00:43:20.159 --> 00:43:27.039
Help us, yes, to rejoice in the testimony of an individual named Gaius.

00:43:27.039 --> 00:43:34.879
Help us to examine our own lives, determine the level of obedience and service in our

00:43:34.879 --> 00:43:36.679
lives personally.

00:43:36.679 --> 00:43:40.399
God, I pray that you'd use us.

00:43:40.399 --> 00:43:50.319
I pray that as we have a few moments of invitation, you'd help us to have a heart of submission

00:43:50.319 --> 00:43:51.999
and obedience to you.

00:43:51.999 --> 00:43:56.759
Lord, that you'd have your will in way, that we'd be doers of the word and not hearers

00:43:56.759 --> 00:43:57.759
only.

00:43:57.759 --> 00:43:59.679
Well, thank you for all that you'll do.

00:43:59.679 --> 00:44:01.119
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:44:01.119 --> 00:44:03.039
Would you stand with me?

00:44:03.039 --> 00:44:05.039
Eyes are out and eyes are closed.

00:44:05.039 --> 00:44:06.199
No one's looking around this morning.

00:44:06.199 --> 00:44:09.159
We'll have an opportunity to have an invitation.

00:44:09.159 --> 00:44:13.159
Maybe you want to make your altar or your seat, your pew an altar.

00:44:13.159 --> 00:44:14.959
Maybe you want to come to this old-fashioned altar.

00:44:14.959 --> 00:44:17.519
But as Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
