WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.519
of this evening, the book of Genesis, the 25th chapter, Genesis chapter number 25 this evening.

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:12.079
And we have had the opportunity now for some time to be studying through the book of Genesis.

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:18.719
And it's been a great encouragement to me. I trust to you as well. And this is lesson number 59

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:25.200
through the book of Genesis. I won't tell you when we started, but it's been a while and we will

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:32.159
eventually. So there's 50 chapters. So we're halfway. Amen. Isn't that awesome? And praise

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:38.720
the Lord. And Genesis 25, we'll be looking at verses 1 through 11 this evening. And of course,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:46.479
we were first introduced to Abram back at the end of Genesis chapter number 11. It was in the 12th

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:52.080
chapter in the first part of the chapter that we read about the call that God placed on the life

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.840
of Abram and his response to that call of departing from the Ur of the Chaldees. And he

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.279
went to a place whether he knew not. And we find that as we've traced the steps of Abram, Abraham

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:11.199
became his name in Genesis chapter number 17. We've had the privilege from the end of chapter

00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:18.160
number 11 all the way through the first part of here, chapter 25 this evening, to really trace

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:25.040
the steps of a hundred years of this man's life. Isn't that exciting? And as you study the life

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:32.879
of Abraham, of course, his name is very familiar to us and to many around the world. He is one of

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:38.480
the patriarchs. He is one that often was referenced as you would study through the gospels. And

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.639
you look at his course testimony throughout the word of God. And this evening, as we come to this

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:50.160
chapter where his death and burial are recorded, I trust it'll be a great encouragement to each of

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:57.199
us as we consider really a life well lived. A life in which, yes, had ebbs and flows, had

00:01:57.199 --> 00:02:05.040
mountain peaks and valleys, had disappointments and great victories. And you think about the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.919
way in which we can relate to a life like that because we too live in this flesh and we live

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:18.639
in this fallen world. And there are days in which we deal with adversity and great opposition and

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:26.320
disappointment. But we find that our God is always faithful and he is always trustworthy and dependable.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.880
He always does what he says he will do. And as we look at the life of Abraham tonight, as we look

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.880
at this portion, I trust that you'd be encouraged. Look at verse number nine with me. We'll get right

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.399
into the message. The Bible says this in verse number nine, and his sons, Isaac and Ishmael,

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:49.360
buried him in the cave of Machpelah in the field of Ephraim, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.000
before Mamre. I've just titled the message this evening from that phrase in verse number nine,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.520
Isaac and Ishmael buried Abraham. As we look at the portion of scripture, if you're taking notes

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.279
this evening, what you notice first of all, the descendants of Abraham. We begin reading this

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:13.600
portion of scripture and we find that as you enter down into and get familiar with the timeline,

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:21.279
you find that Abraham, when he dies, is 175 years old. And so therefore, we would find that this

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:29.199
particular text of scripture that is given to us takes place 38 years after the death of Sarah.

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:35.520
Now, of course, we read and studied the portion of scripture a few weeks ago in Genesis 23,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.600
where the Bible told us of the death and burial of Sarah and how that Abraham came to mourn for

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.600
Sarah and to weep for her. And we find that at that time he was 137 years old, and now we find

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.320
that he's 175 years old. And so these 38 years have now passed, and the Bible begins by telling

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.720
us in verse number one of the text of scripture, then again, Abraham took a wife and her name

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:06.240
was Ketorah. We find that as we read the next few verses of scripture that we'll read of the sons

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.839
that were born to Abraham through Ketorah. But before we look at that, as we think about the

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:16.959
descendants of Abraham, of course, we'd first have to go back to Genesis chapter number 16

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.799
and see the birth of Ishmael. We find that he, of course, was the one that was born really after the

00:04:22.799 --> 00:04:31.440
flesh, Hagar being the the mother of Ishmael. We understand the disappointment that was contained

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.799
within the portion of scriptures we studied many months ago and had the opportunity to see how that

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.679
through the counsel of Sarah and all that had taken place. And Ishmael is born, and we find

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:50.399
that it was after the flesh. This was not the son of promise, as we'll find. That, of course,

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:57.519
was Isaac. And we find that in chapter number 21, the Bible tells us that God gave the instruction

00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:05.040
to Abraham to cast out Ishmael along with Hagar. We find that as we study that portion of scripture

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.000
and coupled it with the book of Galatians that Paul references under the inspiration of the Holy

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.920
Spirit of God that this is an allegory. And the reality is that the son of the flesh cannot dwell

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:24.079
with the son of promise. We think about the truth of being redeemed, and we think about the old nature

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:30.480
and the new nature, and we understand that the old nature must be mortified. It must be crucified.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.679
We must walk in the spirit so that we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh. And what great

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:41.519
truth is given to us there. We find that as they were cast out according to Genesis 21, verses 20

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:49.519
and 21, that he, Ishmael, dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. We also find that the Bible tells us

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:55.040
that his mother, Hagar, took him a wife out of Egypt. Now, we understand that that would be

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.920
understood. Not only the scriptures tell us that, but she, of course, Hagar, was from Egypt, and so

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:08.799
it would make sense that she would return to find a wife for her son from Egypt. We then read about

00:06:08.799 --> 00:06:15.040
Isaac, the birth of Isaac. It's given to us in Genesis 21, and as we would look at and refer to

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:21.600
the birth of Ishmael as being after the flesh, we would find this birth of Isaac. He is the son of

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.239
promise. We find that the Bible tells us in Genesis 21, in verse number one,

00:06:26.239 --> 00:06:32.959
and the Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.359
For Sarah conceived and bare Abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which God had spoken

00:06:39.359 --> 00:06:44.320
to him, and Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him,

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:51.600
Isaac. Now, God had given many promises to Abraham over the years with regard to this son that would

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:58.399
be born, but, of course, Abraham and Sarah to have a son and the covenant that would be established,

00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:04.239
and we find the fulfillment of that birth there in Genesis 21. We find here in our text of

00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:10.160
Scripture, well, last week in Genesis 24, we read about the wife of Isaac, Rebekah. We looked at the

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:17.440
entirety of chapter 24, and we find in verse number five, the Bible says of Isaac, of Genesis 25,

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:25.600
that Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. We now read of these sons of Keturah. It tells us

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.480
that Abraham took a wife. Her name was Keturah. Notice in verses two and three, the Bible tells

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:38.320
us, and she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Midan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah, and

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:47.679
Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan, and the sons of Dedan were Asheram, and Latusham, and Lamumim,

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:55.440
and the sons of Midian, Ephah, and Epher, and Hanok, and Abida, and Eldah. All these were the

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:03.040
children of Keturah. And so you read of the sons, Zimran, Jokshan, Midan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah,

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.279
and then the grandsons that are mentioned there, the descendants of these particular sons that are

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:14.480
listed for us as well. But we find that in this list, of course, many Arab nations would come from

00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:21.760
these sons that were born. We find that the name that is most familiar out of this list of

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:27.200
names that is provided to us of these sons of Keturah would be that of Midian. Of course,

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.640
as you look at Bible history and you read through the Scriptures, you will read many things with

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.159
regard to the Midianites. And as you read about the Midianites and you read about some of the

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:44.640
adversity between the descendants of Midian, the Midianites, and the people of God, the nation of

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:51.119
Israel, you will see that there was some real hostility between the descendants of Midian and

00:08:51.119 --> 00:08:56.719
the descendants of Isaac. And we see that throughout the pages of Scripture. And so

00:08:56.719 --> 00:09:03.359
Midian is absolutely the most familiar, biblically speaking, that we see. But these particular sons

00:09:03.359 --> 00:09:11.840
of Abraham would be where many Arab nations would, of course, come from. And we read of those

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.239
things historically. It tells us that Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac in verse number five.

00:09:16.239 --> 00:09:21.679
We see in verse number six, it says this, but unto the sons of the concubines which Abraham had,

00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:28.320
Abraham gave gifts and sent them away from Isaac, his son, while he yet lived eastward unto

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:35.280
the east country. And so we notice in verse number six, of course, in verse number five, it tells us

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.679
that Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. There were some gifts that were given to these

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:44.559
sons that are mentioned in verses two and three, and to these sons were given gifts. But I want you

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:50.320
to notice that the Bible says that Abraham sent them away from Isaac, his son, and where did he

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:56.640
send them? Eastward unto the east country. And again, as you would think about the Arab nations

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.840
that would descend from these individuals, you would find

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:05.520
that in that region of the world there would be able to trace their lineage, etc., and so we find

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:11.600
that the place of where they were sent by Abraham is noted for us. And we see the descendants of

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.680
Abraham, and we know that as we continue through the scripture, I want you to really look at

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:22.080
verses 7 through 10, number 2 if you're taking notes, the death of Abraham. As we look at the

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:27.040
death of Abraham, I am encouraged, it's just a couple of verses of scripture, but I believe that

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:32.080
it's encouraging when you think about the opportunity to walk with the Lord and to live

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:38.320
a life that is well-pleasing. Notice what the Bible says in verses 7 and 8. The Bible says this,

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:44.000
and these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, and hundred, threescore,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.800
and fifteen years. Then Abraham gave up the ghost and died in a good old age, an old man,

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:56.560
and full of years, and was gathered to his people. When you think about someone that dies,

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:01.520
you understand that there are preparations that are made, even in our culture and our custom,

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:06.640
with having funeral services, etc. And if I were to look at verses 7 and 8 this evening,

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.280
I would look at those as really being a eulogy. And you think about the eulogy that would be

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:18.480
given, and obviously the length of eulogy here is quite short, but we find that God gives us

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:25.280
some very interesting things with regard to the life of Abraham. We find that he is 175 years

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:30.240
old, according to verse number 7, and we find that he walked with the Lord for a hundred years.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.480
That's a lengthy period of time. You think about that, if you go all the way back to Genesis 12,

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:40.320
as I mentioned by way of introduction, that God calls Abram, and he calls him from the Ur of the

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:48.080
Chaldees, and over the next 100 years from that initial response, that call that God gave to

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:53.840
Abram in Genesis chapter number 12, all that we've read in all of these chapters, and watching

00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:01.840
Abraham grow and develop, and thinking about the increase of his faith, and how God was

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:08.160
revealing himself to Abraham, and how wonderful that is. We begin to reflect on our own lives,

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:14.800
and we think about the journey that we're on, and we understand that no one's having a funeral

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:20.320
service this evening, but we begin to think about when was it that we started walking with God,

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:27.280
and however many days God would give us the length of our life, and to consider the opportunity that

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:33.520
we have to walk with him. It's interesting, I was just praying yesterday about the importance of

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:40.080
finishing well, and finishing strong, and understanding that it's good to start out

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:47.920
strong, it's good to start out well, but to finish well, to hear as Paul, as it's recorded for us in

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:54.720
2 Timothy chapter 4, to think about a life where he's finished his course. Not only did he finish,

00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:01.920
but he kept the faith. And, you know, you can finish, but did you finish with the same beliefs

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:07.680
that you started with? Did you finish serving the Lord as faithfully as you started? And we find that

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:13.520
as we look at the life of Abraham, and we consider these 100 years of walking with God,

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:21.600
and you consider the mountaintops, and the valleys, and you consider great victories, you consider

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:30.480
the way in which God had revealed himself to Abraham, the names by which God gave to Abraham,

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:36.400
and describing the character, the very nature of God, and how he revealed himself to Abraham.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:44.320
What a blessing! And, you know, we began as we looked and saw that God revealed himself as

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:51.440
El Elyon, and you think about God being the possessor of heaven and earth, and the impact

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:57.760
that that made upon Abraham. And then, of course, when he told him that his name was El Shaddai,

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:04.160
and you think about the truth that he is the Almighty God. Abraham was wavering at times, and

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:10.720
wondering as to the promise that God had given with regard to a descendant. We know that there

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:17.360
were times that he said, what about this, that's the servant that's born in my house? And God says,

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.520
no, that's not the way it's going to work. I'm going to give you a son, and Abraham,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:27.520
you and Sarah will have a son. And you think about the way in which God was proving Abraham,

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:34.400
and the way in which God was showing us, even through the account of Scripture, the plan that

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.920
God has, and the ways in which we just walk with him and trust him, and find that he is always

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:46.880
faithful. It was in Genesis chapter 22 that we had the opportunity to read about the great test

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:54.480
that Abraham faced when God says, take thine son, thine only son, and go up to the mount that I'll

00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:00.240
show thee of. And it was there that he was to offer Isaac as an offering. We find that it was

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:06.480
in that text of Scripture that we really find a mountain peak of faith in the life of Abraham,

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:12.800
where he believed that God would provide. And as we read the book of Hebrews in the 11th chapter,

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:18.320
we find that it's revealed to us there that Abraham understood that even if he had to kill

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:26.160
his son, that God was able to raise him up. And what faith! We mentioned this as we studied that

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.960
portion of Scripture a few weeks ago, and even as we've looked at the miracles of the Lord Jesus

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.840
Christ during our Sunday School series, and we've considered the fact that Abraham, at that

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:41.680
particular time, there's no one in recorded biblical history that had been raised from the dead,

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:50.480
but Abraham believed that God was able. What faith! And we read about all of these events,

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:58.000
and we read of the record that God has given us of these hundred years, and we can rejoice,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.640
and we can thank God for the testimony of this man Abraham. We find that it's in verse number eight

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.960
that the Bible describes it this way, and these are the days of, excuse me, verse number eight,

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:17.200
that Abraham gave up the ghost and died. Notice what it says, in a good old age, an old man. 175,

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:24.720
I guess that is pretty old, and he died an old man. And it says this, and full of years,

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:30.400
and was gathered to his people. It's interesting that phrase, full of years, the word full,

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:39.120
it literally means abounding or satisfied. And oftentimes when we read it as full of years,

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:45.280
we may think about it as really the quantity, but really, when we look at the text of Scripture,

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:51.200
we find that verse number seven and part of verse number eight deals with the quantity of life,

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:59.680
that he was 175 years old, that he was an old man, and we find the quantity of life,

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:04.880
but really, in that phrase in verse number eight, when it says, and full of years,

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:12.960
really what's being focused upon is the quality of life. Not only the quantity, but the quality.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:19.520
To think about the satisfaction, to think about the abounding nature of Abraham's life. Remember,

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:24.560
it was back in Genesis 24, in verse number one, when the Bible tells us that Abraham was old and

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:31.680
well stricken in age, and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things. What a great testimony.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:40.960
The Lord had blessed Abraham in all things. God blesses, or the blessings of God, we think,

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:46.240
and we mention, and we thank God for his blessings, and we are encouraged through song to

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:52.480
count your blessings, name them one by one. I mentioned last week how that the reality is that

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:58.480
there are times in which our understanding or definition or description of a blessing may differ

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:04.800
from what God would look at as being a blessing. There are times when God says no, and I would

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:10.800
submit to you this evening that that's a blessing. We say, no, I want God to say yes. Sometimes God

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.440
says no, and that's a blessing, and we need to thank God for it, and we think about the trials

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:21.440
and difficulties and how God is growing us and developing us, and we find the blessings that God

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:27.920
had bestowed upon Abraham. As we look at the Word of God, I want you to consider this truth that

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:32.640
Moses gives us in Deuteronomy. Turn to the 11th chapter, if you will. We'll be back to Genesis

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:37.120
here in just a moment, but I want you to think about this when the Bible tells us that God blessed

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:46.960
him, and we understand the content of what God is telling us, and really the summary of the life of

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:53.120
Abraham, and to think about the blessing of God upon him that the Lord had blessed Abraham in all

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:59.200
things, and we find that in Deuteronomy chapter 11, and this is a biblical principle that we find

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:04.800
throughout the Word of God. I want you to notice, begin looking with me in verse number 26 of

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:14.800
Deuteronomy 11. The Bible says this, "'Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse.'"

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:20.320
That sounds like a pretty good deal. There's a blessing and a curse, and so I want the blessing,

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:25.760
right? If we took and pretended this evening, used our sanctified imaginations to say

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:32.640
that there were two lines and a header over the door where the line would be formed, and

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:37.920
the description of that particular door, one says, "'Blessing, enter here,' and the other says,

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:44.400
"'Cursing, enter here.'" You'd be crazy to get in the line that said, "'Cursing.'" Right? Somebody

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.320
thinks something's wrong with you. You say, but this line is shorter. There's a reason it's

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:53.040
shorter, amen? And you get in the line that says, "'Blessing.'" You say, yeah, that's what I'm

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:59.760
signing up for. I desire God's blessing upon my life. Do you desire the blessing of God upon your

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:05.280
life? Sure you do. The favor of God, the blessing of God, knowing that all that

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:10.960
God gives us is for our good and for his glory, amen? And we say, God, I want your

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:16.640
blessing, I want your favor upon my life. But as we know that as Moses is giving

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:21.120
this instruction to the children of Israel, and he's saying to them as

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.360
they're preparing for entering into the land of promise, he says this in verse

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:32.640
27, a blessing if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God which

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:42.320
I command you this day. So we'd find that blessing is directly tied to obedience,

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:51.640
correct? A blessing if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your God which

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:59.760
I command you this day. He says today, listen, behold, I set before you this day

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:07.840
a blessing and a curse. A blessing, but it's tied directly to obedience. Notice

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:14.920
in verse 28, and a curse if ye will not obey the commandments of the Lord your

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:19.680
God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day to go after other

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:28.320
gods which you have not known. As you study the history of Israel through the

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:33.680
Old Testament, you'll find there are many times in which they obeyed God. They had

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:40.320
the favor of God, they had the blessing of God. You find, however, that with much

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:46.160
frequency you read that the nation of Israel disobeyed the commandments of the

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:52.840
Lord, correct? Often, as you read the accounts throughout the Word of God of

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:59.360
the disobedience of the people of God to the commandments of God, it was not the

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.000
fact that the commandments were not known to the people of God, it was not

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.400
that they were not given the truth, it was that they chose to disobey. It was

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:13.240
that they rebelled against what God said and we find that there would be cursing,

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:17.760
there would be judgment, there would be opposition and adversity, and we find

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:23.840
that they would deal with great troubles and trials and various levels of

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:28.800
opposition. We find eventually, of course, as you note, the nation of Israel as a

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:33.320
whole, and you think about the divided kingdom and, of course, the ten tribes of

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:39.360
the north being taken captive by the Assyrians, and years later, Judah, the

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:43.600
tribes in the south, being taken captive by the Babylonians. Why? Because of their

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:51.160
disobedience. When Jeremiah is prophesying to the nation of Judah on

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:56.760
the eve of the Babylonian captivity, he's seeking to encourage them to trust the

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:03.560
Lord and we find that God is revealing to Jeremiah and Jeremiah sees the

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:08.960
Babylonians have laid siege against the city and he understands the the days are

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:13.520
coming in which they'll be taken captive and there are people, the king

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.520
and others, that would come and say, is there a word from the Lord? The word's

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:23.440
not changed, you've disobeyed and judgment is coming. Will God fight for us?

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:33.080
And Jeremiah says, actually God will fight against you. Wow, what tragic news

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:38.560
received that God Almighty would fight against them, but it was because of their

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:44.360
disobedience. And so when we see the life of Abraham and we see the eulogy that is

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:48.280
provided and we think of the quantity of life, but we also think of the the

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:52.760
quality of life, that he was full of years, that he was both abounding and

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:57.880
satisfied, the reality that he had walked with God and that he had seen and

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:02.440
experienced the blessing of God and that God had blessed him in all things, and we

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:06.760
understand this evening that the blessing of God is tied to obedience.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:11.440
It's a biblical truth all throughout the pages of Scripture and how vital it

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:17.520
is that we make that decision that we would obey the Lord, follow his word, I

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:23.880
will obey, and what a place to be. We find that it's in James chapter

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:29.520
number 2 and the the New Testament truth that is given to us here, what a

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.279
powerful verse of Scripture where the Bible says that the Scripture was

00:24:33.279 --> 00:24:38.240
fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:44.839
righteousness and he was called the friend of God. In James 2 and verse

00:24:44.839 --> 00:24:52.360
number 23, Abraham was called the friend of God. I'm thankful for the life of

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.720
Abraham and as we think about the eulogy and we think about and even reflect

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.480
upon our own lives, you'll recall that in Genesis chapter 23 as we looked at the

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:05.800
life of Sarah and the death and the burial of Sarah that we mentioned that

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:10.400
we're told by Solomon that it's better that we would go to the house of mourning

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:15.920
than to the house of feasting, and we understand that the reason that it's

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:20.960
better, that it's more advantageous for us to go to the house of mourning

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:26.400
than to the house of feasting is because that is the end of all men. Man goes to

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:31.600
his long home. And as we think about the life of Abraham and we look at just a

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.839
couple of verses of Scripture but really consider in very brief overview fashion

00:25:36.839 --> 00:25:41.839
the the hundred years that are summarized in these chapters in the

00:25:41.839 --> 00:25:46.559
book of Genesis where God allows us to have insight to the life and experiences

00:25:46.559 --> 00:25:53.440
of Abraham, I wonder this evening how it is that at the time of our death what

00:25:53.440 --> 00:26:01.760
will the eulogy sound like? What is it that that someone would say of us when

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:06.720
they look at our life? Would they look at our life as being a testimony of a life

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:14.520
that that was lived for the Lord? A life, a testimony of a believer that trusted

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.640
the Lord, that followed the Lord, that had faith? Oh not anyone that's perfect for

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:23.400
we know that none of us are perfect. But we've come to the place where we've

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:28.279
yielded and we've surrendered and we have sought to walk with God and we've

00:26:28.279 --> 00:26:35.040
desired and longed for that blessing of God upon our lives. We find that Abraham

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:42.240
had a wonderful testimony. We find not only as you would think about a death

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:47.160
and a funeral, you think of the eulogy but you also think of the burial and we

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:53.520
find it in verses 9 and 10 God gives us the record of the burial of Abraham. The

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:58.160
Bible says that his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him and so we find that in

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:02.400
the beginning of verse number 9 that the people that are involved are revealed to

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:06.720
us and we find here that the Bible tells us that Isaac and Ishmael buried him in

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.720
the cave of Machpelah. Now it's interesting that Isaac and Ishmael are

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:15.640
now referenced in this portion of scripture. We find that of course at this

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.920
particular time when you do all of the calculations in determining the death of

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.920
Abraham and his age being a hundred and seventy-five years old that Isaac at

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:31.720
this time is 75 and Ishmael is 89. Now if you go back to the 21st chapter of the

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:37.040
book of Genesis that's where we read of the birth of Isaac and you'll remember

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:42.160
that as we went through the portion of scripture that we come down and you find

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:47.400
that in verse number 8 of Genesis 21 the Bible says the child grew speaking

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:51.920
of Isaac and was weaned and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:56.960
was weaned and Sarah saw the son of Hagar that's Ishmael the Egyptian which

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:02.119
she had born unto Abraham mocking and it was at that time in which Sarah said

00:28:02.119 --> 00:28:07.360
cast out this bondwoman and her son. In verse number 10 we see that and we find

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.839
that Sarah said for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son

00:28:11.839 --> 00:28:15.680
even with Isaac. We referenced this a few moments ago but looking at it in

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:21.080
more detail here we find that God also says to Abraham because it was something

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:25.480
that was grievous in the sight of Abraham and verse number 11 tells us

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:31.200
that that God says to Abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:35.320
lad and because of thy bondwoman and all that Sarah hath said unto thee hearken

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:42.000
unto her voice for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. We find that Abraham

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.160
according to verse number 14 rose up early in the morning and took bread and

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.679
a bowl of water and gave it unto Hagar putting it on her shoulder and the child

00:28:48.679 --> 00:28:52.799
and sent her away and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.

00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:55.979
And so we studied this and we looked at this portion of scripture and as we

00:28:55.979 --> 00:29:01.520
understand the the truth that God has given us and now we find in this portion

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.600
of scripture in which we're looking at tonight at the death and the burial of

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:12.640
Abraham that now Isaac is 75 and Ishmael is 89 but when we look at Genesis

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:17.479
chapter number 21 and we look at all that's going on we talked about the age

00:29:17.479 --> 00:29:23.080
of Ishmael at that particular time and we said that Ishmael would be between

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:30.080
16 and 17 years old and so from that time Isaac just a few years old

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:38.720
according to historical tradition and so now over 70 years has passed because

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:43.600
what happened with Ishmael well as we mentioned by way of introduction Ishmael

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:48.359
and Hagar they were sent and they went to the wilderness of Paran and we find

00:29:48.359 --> 00:29:55.479
now that at the burial of Abraham that Isaac and Ishmael are there together. Now

00:29:55.479 --> 00:30:01.600
it's of note because we find that of course many of us do not

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:06.360
many things from our toddler years from the age of two or three. It's not common

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:12.320
for us to have memories of those particular events. Oftentimes I find in

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:16.480
my own life at least that when we talk about things that we remember from those

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:20.320
ages it's typically from hearing stories and what have you and you begin to

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:25.280
rehearse some of those things. But some of us have had conversations what's the

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:29.320
earliest memory that you have as a child and so on and so forth and we try to

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:32.720
figure out how old we were and so on and so forth and some of you say I don't

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:37.200
remember yesterday so I'm not sure what my earliest memory was I understand but

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.320
but what I'm saying to you this evening is that a lengthy period of time has

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:47.640
passed at least 70 years 70 72 years has passed from the time in which Ishmael is

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:54.380
cast out and now the death of Abraham and I make that statement because as we

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:58.560
look at the portion of Scripture here the Bible tells us in verse number nine

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:04.000
and his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him there does not seem as we look at

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.800
the text of Scripture there's no animosity whatsoever that is hinted at

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:15.000
in the text of Scripture none in fact as we would study the scriptures I find

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.560
oftentimes that we will and I've been guilty of this myself of making

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:24.520
statements about the hostilities between the descendants of Isaac and the

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:28.600
descendants of Ishmael but if you study the scriptures you actually find and I

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:32.120
think even when you study history will prove this to be the case and we'll

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:37.200
study this as we continue through the book of Genesis you will find that

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:41.040
there's a whole lot more animosity between the descendants of Jacob and the

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:47.280
descendants of Edom you read of that regularly you read even of the animosity

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.120
that we spoke about in the beginning of Genesis 25 with the descendants of

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:55.840
Ketorah and thinking of Midian and the Midianites and so we see that here in

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.680
this portion of Scripture it seems as if it's not even hinted at that there's any

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:05.360
animosity whatsoever between Isaac and Ishmael they're there together burying

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:09.520
Abraham so we see the people that are involved we see the place it's the cave

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:14.000
of Machpelah we find that it says in the field of Ephraim the son of Zohar the

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.920
Hittite which is before Mamre and then the Bible tells us in verse number 10

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:23.160
referencing back to what we studied in Genesis 23 the field which Abraham

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:30.280
purchased of the sons of Heth there was Abraham buried and Sarah his wife and so

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:34.000
we find that as we look at this portion of Scripture we've seen now the

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.840
descendants we've seen the death the eulogy the burial of Abraham and we find

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:44.600
that a great patriarch has now passed off the scene this life we understand

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:49.120
the Bible teaches us that the wages of sin is death we understand that that

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:54.480
contains the the truth of the second death but also that by sin comes death

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:59.560
we understand physical death in the Bible tells us in Hebrews 9 as and it's

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:05.160
appointed unto man wants to die after this the judgment and we understand this

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:10.720
evening that we're not gonna live forever amen I'm gonna live forever I've

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:14.040
often said to people over the years are you prepared to die if you were to die

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:19.440
today we say that to people we sang songs this evening evangelistic songs

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:24.080
about the gospel and about whosoever will and Christ receive its sinful men

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.920
and what great songs they are and the reality is that we understand

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:35.360
biblically that there's a time to be born and there is a time to die we have

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:39.840
an appointment and as I think about that I've often said to people over the years

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:45.160
are you prepared for that appointment are you prepared for it and we

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:49.720
understand this evening the importance of trusting Christ as our Savior to

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:54.480
understand that my sins have been forgiven that I've been born again that

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.880
heaven is my home that I have that assurance that confidence and as we look

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:02.800
at the life of Abraham here and we read of his death and his burial we're once

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:09.480
again confronted with the brevity of life you say the brevity of life is 175

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:18.040
years old in comparison to eternity it's a very short the life span of

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:22.200
mankind today is even shorter and when we look at it in comparison with

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:28.840
eternity it's just that long and so often we spend so much time with that

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:33.240
long and forget about the eternity part of it I've said over the years that

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:37.760
there are many times in which especially being guilty of this and in our country

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.520
in our culture and I understand it's where we are it's what we're confronted

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:48.560
with but so often there is so much attention and so much emphasis that is

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:58.000
placed upon retirement planning but very little on eternity planning I would say

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.440
to you this evening I've said this before but I'd say it again this evening

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:09.840
that retirement is not certain eternity is certain and there's so much emphasis

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:13.920
placed upon retirement planning estate planning all of these things I'm not

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:19.640
suggesting that you shouldn't plan but I'm just suggesting that the emphasis

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:24.640
placed upon it might need to be re-evaluated because there's so much

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:29.600
emphasis on the retirement planning part and again very little on the eternity

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:35.000
planning part and I'm thankful that God tells us that we can store up treasure

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:42.800
in heaven amen what a blessing to think about the the dividends of of that type

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:48.400
of planning and to understand that as we walk with God as we faithfully serve God

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:53.680
that we can hear well done thou good and faithful servant that we can receive

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:58.480
even as we looked at a few weeks ago from Colossians 4 and understanding the

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:03.200
reward of the fellow worker and understanding that God has given us in

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:08.720
his word record of crowns that can be received and Paul was confident of

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:14.720
receiving a crown he mentions it in 2nd Timothy 4 and verse number 8 that crown

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:18.320
of righteousness and we think about those crowns they're not for us to keep

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:24.320
but for us to cast at the at the very throne of our God and what a blessing

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:30.000
and to have that perspective see eternity is certain Abraham wasn't

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.760
gonna live forever he lived 175 years old it's a long time but really just

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:40.960
that long in light of eternity and for us this evening when we read a passage

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:44.840
of scripture like this I hope that we would be confronted and we would be

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:51.800
aware of our own mortality in our own life and the brevity of our life and

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:55.680
that we would reevaluate we'd look and say what is it that's going to be said

00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:01.440
at the end of my life how is it that that by life will be remembered who is

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:09.000
it that that I'm impacting what is the testimony of my life how is it that it

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.600
would it be said that I lived a life of faith that I lived in fear what will be

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:22.920
said it's very unusual for an individual to pen their own eulogy

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:31.320
happens just a little unusual this evening we think about not only what

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:36.160
others would say of us but as I've mentioned before what God would say what

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.440
God would say and tonight I hope that we'd be challenged as the thought of

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:45.480
even looking at this testimony of Abraham we finish in verse number 11

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:50.920
this evening and it kind of almost seems as if it's a little bit of an addendum

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:55.600
but it's a quite an interesting phrase that is used here if you are taking

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:00.680
notes I would give a third point this evening as being the distinct air the

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:06.120
Bible says this and it came to pass after the death of Abraham and so we've

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:10.400
read of the descendants we've read of the death we've understood the eulogy

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.160
the burial we see the the people involved with the burial the place of

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:19.680
the burial and we find that God says it came to pass after the death of Abraham

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:28.080
notice this it says that God blessed his son Isaac and Isaac dwelt by the well

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:34.760
le hey I row I and as we look at the that that phrase right in the middle of

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:41.440
the verse it says that God blessed his son Isaac we speak about the distinct

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:46.560
air we find that here in verse number five we've read a few moments ago where

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:51.520
the Bible says that Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac we've read back

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:58.440
in chapter number 21 where God says to Abraham to cast out the Ishmael and

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:05.280
Hagar why for an Isaac shall thy seed be called we find that in the middle of

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:09.400
Genesis chapter 25 the text in which we'll study next week that the Bible

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:15.200
gives us in verses 12 through 18 the the descendants of Ishmael and discusses for

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:20.720
us the death of Ishmael but really as we look at verse number 11 of Genesis 25

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:26.260
apart from those next several verses of Scripture what we find happens is the

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:31.860
focus of Scripture now shifts from the life of Abraham to the life of Isaac and

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:37.100
we find that this happened remember as we studied back in Genesis chapter 11

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:41.140
for just a moment turn back there if you will and I want you to just notice what

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:45.500
God is giving us in chapters really chapters 10 and 11 of the book of

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:50.180
Genesis you begin to read of these genealogies and all of the the sons of

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:55.260
Japheth and the sons of Ham and the sons of Shem and you read of all of these

00:39:55.260 --> 00:40:00.500
descendants and then we find at the end of chapter number 11 that the Bible

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.740
gives us all the descendants

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:07.980
of Shem, and it begins to provide us with all of these names and all of these

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:12.740
years and all that's taken place, and we find that we come to this place where

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:18.180
the Bible tells us in verse number 26 of Genesis 11, and Terah lived 70 years and

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:24.940
begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran, and we find that it's at that point that the Bible

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:32.620
begins to focus its attention on Abram, on Abraham. We find even as we

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:38.300
studied and looked throughout the text of Scripture, beginning in those messages

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:42.980
at that particular place in the book of Genesis, how that the Hebrew race and the

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:49.300
promise that God had given with regard to the Lord Jesus Christ and the line,

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:54.540
the messianic line, and all of the prophecies of Scripture, and we find how

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:59.260
that the broadness of the scope of Genesis 10 and Genesis 11 of

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:03.220
understanding the genealogies and all of these descendants and so on, and it

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:09.100
just zeroes in on Abraham, and we read all of these chapters and all of these

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:14.860
events of a hundred years of the life of Abraham. Remember it was that God said

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:19.100
this as we read Galatians, and just hold your place, yeah, just turn over to

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.660
Galatians, you don't need to hold your place in Genesis anymore, but go over to

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:25.420
Galatians, if you will, and I want you to know what God tells us here in the book

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:32.500
of Galatians in chapter number 3, and we find again how the the attention of

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:38.860
Scripture, the focus of Scripture from Abraham now shifting to Isaac, and we see

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:42.620
this in Galatians 3 and verse number 16. Notice what the Bible says,

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:49.460
"...now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made." Notice what it says, "...he

00:41:49.620 --> 00:42:00.300
saith not unto seeds, plural, as of many, but as of one, and to thy seed, which is

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:08.020
Christ." We've mentioned in the past the phraseology of the title of a book that

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:13.220
was written by William Scroggie, the unfolding drama of redemption, and we

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:17.580
find how God, no doubt He could have given us all of the history of any of

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:23.060
the other descendants that He chose to give us because He knows everything, but

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:30.020
in His plan, in His plan of redemption, the Messianic line, the birth of

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:34.900
Christ, we find that the shift of Scripture, the focus now shifts from that

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:39.940
of Abraham to Isaac specifically. Just a few verses given to us with regard to

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:44.540
the descendants of Ishmael and the death of Ishmael, and then you begin to read

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:48.100
about Isaac, you begin to read about his life, and then you begin to read about

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:52.580
his sons, and you begin to read about Israel as a nation and the twelve tribes,

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:58.580
the twelve sons, and you see the focus. And Matthew 1 says this, and we'll close

00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:03.900
with this text of Scripture as we think about the truth that God has

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:09.820
given us with regard to the shift of Scripture and understanding that Isaac

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:14.660
is the distinct heir. We find that the Bible tells us this in Matthew 1.

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:19.620
Matthew 1, beginning in verse number 1, the book of the generation of Jesus

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:30.980
Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. Abraham begat Isaac. Is that what it

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:36.180
says in verse number 2? And Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judas and his

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:40.800
brethren. We're not gonna go down through all of the text of Scripture here, but we

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:48.900
find that focus of Scripture. Why? Because it's showing us that messianic line in

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:53.980
which Jesus Christ would come to this earth, God in flesh. We find that it's in

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:58.180
verse number 16, it says, "...and Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:03.180
born Jesus, who is called Christ." So all the generations from Abraham to David

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:07.060
are 14 generations, and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are 14

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:11.980
generations, and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are 14

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:20.220
generations. I'm so thankful that God has given us a record, the Word of God, the

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:25.220
pure Word of God. He's given us a record of these descendants and how He's

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:31.220
promised the birth of Christ, and through the pages of Scripture we can trace and

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:38.300
route and understand what God is doing and how God is working. This evening, as

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:42.660
we look at this portion of Scripture, we think about the death of Abraham, I'll

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:48.180
just close with saying this, we can rejoice in the testimony of a life well

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:52.580
lived. We can rejoice. Listen, it's a blessing to be able to go. I went to a

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:57.540
funeral not long ago, and you know, when you attend a funeral service, there are

00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.780
times in which there's, it's a home-going service, I mean, it's a

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:05.860
wonderful rejoicing time of knowing that the individual walked with God and

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:10.220
served God, and they're now with God, and what joy. And I had the privilege of

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:14.540
attending such a funeral not long ago, and it was just a sweet service, a

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:22.020
testimony of a faithful follower of Jesus Christ. That's my desire. A pastor

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:26.660
friend that was there, it was for Pastor Mike Reed's wife, and Mrs. Reed, we prayed

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:30.540
for her for a long time, Mrs. Reed went home to be with the Lord, and man, it was

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:35.180
a wonderful, wonderful service. And a pastor friend that was sitting next to

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:39.580
me at that funeral, he tapped me on the arm at the end, he said, this is what all

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:44.780
of us should desire in a funeral service, a celebration of a life that was lived

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:50.620
for Christ. And as we think about Abraham, and we think about the life of

00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:55.500
Abraham, we ought to rejoice in a life lived for the Lord, a life in which he

00:45:55.500 --> 00:46:00.100
followed the Lord. He went out not knowing where he went, just following the

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:09.060
Lord. And he saw God do some amazing things. Was he perfect? No, not by far. Can

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:13.460
we find critique? Can we find criticism? Can we poke at and say, look at this

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:18.780
failure, and look at that? Absolutely. There's flaws. He's a man. But we find

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:26.060
that he's the friend of God. He's in Hebrews 11. He had great faith. We say,

00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:31.740
man, I desire that when I die, I don't know when it's gonna be, could be tonight,

00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:39.300
probably you're not gonna live to 175. But whatever the time is, that I would

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:45.060
decide that I want to follow the Lord, all in, all for him, because I want to

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:50.180
have a life that's well lived. Let's pray together. Father, we love you. We thank

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:55.140
you for loving us. We thank you for the life of Abraham. And as we look at this

00:46:55.140 --> 00:47:00.900
portion of Scripture, we're encouraged. But I would admit this evening that in

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:07.380
addition to being encouraged, we are challenged in our own lives. And I pray

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:14.300
that we'd take a few moments by way of invitation tonight to evaluate our own

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:23.900
lives, to consider our own mortality. I trust that each one that's gathered here

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:29.820
this evening knows you as their personal Lord and Savior. But if there might be

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:36.140
one that's not sure of heaven, it'd be our prayer that tonight they'd be saved.

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:42.700
With the thought that primarily we're speaking to believers this evening, I

00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:53.820
pray that we would be purposed in our lives. That we'd find that it was not by

00:47:53.820 --> 00:48:02.700
accident that Paul was able to say that he finished his course. For he set out

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:11.260
and declared this purpose in Acts 20, that I might finish my course with joy.

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:18.380
And God, I pray that for each one of us this evening, we know not how much longer

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:27.020
we have in this race. We know not when our course will end. It is my prayer that

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:35.180
each of us would have a desire to finish our course with joy. That we'd seek to

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:42.700
walk with you and obey you. That we'd be doers of the Word. That your favor would

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:49.020
be upon us, because we walk in obedience. We pray that you'd move and work as only

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:53.020
you can. We'll thank you for every decision that's made, for it's in Christ's

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:54.060
name we pray.
