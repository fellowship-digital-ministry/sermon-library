1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,519
This is our 18th lesson on this subject matter

2
00:00:03,519 --> 00:00:06,679
of walk worthy, please God.

3
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:08,880
And we've mentioned as we've studied

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,560
through this fifth chapter of the book of 1 Thessalonians,

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,199
we started in verse number 12,

6
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:15,600
this evening we'll finish the chapter.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,840
And as we first started this series on Wednesday evenings,

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,920
I mentioned that we'll study the fifth chapter,

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,719
the last portion of the fifth chapter of 1 Thessalonians.

10
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:27,459
And then once we're done there,

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,540
we'll go over to 2 Thessalonians chapter number three

12
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,180
and look at the latter portion of that text.

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,900
In both of those portions of scripture,

14
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,500
we find that God would use the Apostle Paul

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,979
to give instruction to the local church.

16
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:45,340
As this instruction is given to the local church,

17
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,919
the church at Thessalonica,

18
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:50,060
we understand that God has provided this instruction

19
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,060
so that the believers would have that information,

20
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,540
they'd understand what is acceptable unto the Lord,

21
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,819
and they would strive to walk worthy and please God.

22
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:02,180
As we close this book,

23
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,940
we find, I believe, three elements of a healthy church.

24
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,500
If you're taking notes tonight,

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,160
I've titled the message this evening, A Healthy Church.

26
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,099
The goal of every believer, every individual believer,

27
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:16,220
the goal that you should have

28
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,300
is that you would please the Lord with your life.

29
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,500
How do we please the Lord?

30
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,500
We live a life that is aligned

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,940
with the principles of God's word.

32
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,239
Healthy believers make a healthy church.

33
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,940
And you're not gonna have a healthy church

34
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,220
with unhealthy believers.

35
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,940
And so we strive to have a church

36
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,699
that would be referred to as being a healthy church.

37
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:44,199
And if we're going to have a healthy church as individuals,

38
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:46,819
we must be healthy believers.

39
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:51,480
We must be taking and applying the truth of God's word

40
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,459
into our lives.

41
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:55,379
Last week, we dealt with intercessory prayer from verse 25,

42
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:58,980
where the Bible simply says, brethren, pray for us.

43
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,139
This week, we'll look at verses 26 through 28,

44
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:03,239
look at these three elements of a healthy church.

45
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,739
The Bible says this,

46
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,639
greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.

47
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,419
I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read

48
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:16,139
unto all the holy brethren.

49
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:21,139
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, amen.

50
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,220
Number one this evening, a healthy church is unified.

51
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,460
A healthy church is unified.

52
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,419
Notice what the Bible says in verse 26,

53
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:31,660
greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.

54
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,500
We understand the book of Ephesians tells us

55
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,139
that we ought to strive for unity.

56
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:38,899
We must have that desire,

57
00:02:38,899 --> 00:02:41,259
endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit

58
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:42,419
and the bond of peace,

59
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:46,139
according to Ephesians chapter four in verse number three.

60
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:48,419
We find that in verse number 13 here,

61
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:51,539
1 Thessalonians five, the last phrase says,

62
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:54,619
and be at peace among yourselves.

63
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:56,660
And so now we come to verse number 26,

64
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,580
and the Bible says greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.

65
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,539
And I say that a healthy church is a unified church.

66
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:06,580
And we find that this particular greeting

67
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,779
that is mentioned in verse number 26

68
00:03:08,779 --> 00:03:11,460
was obviously culturally accepted

69
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,699
for this area in Thessalonica.

70
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:16,259
In fact, today in many parts of the world,

71
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,419
this would still be a greeting

72
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:22,100
that would be culturally appropriate.

73
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,300
Now here in the United States of America,

74
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,699
if you grew up here,

75
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:28,300
we're not greeting one another with an holy kiss.

76
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,779
But the reality is that we might shake hands,

77
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:33,339
we might give a hug, whatever it might be.

78
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:36,740
But we understand that as we look at this verse of scripture

79
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,740
and we see the unity in this culturally appropriate greeting

80
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,740
but what I really want you to focus on

81
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,100
when I think about and the reason

82
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,100
that I give the point of unity

83
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,500
is that the Bible says notice that little word all.

84
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,500
Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.

85
00:03:57,619 --> 00:03:59,460
See, the local church is made up

86
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,779
of saved baptized believers, individuals.

87
00:04:03,779 --> 00:04:06,419
When a person comes and they say,

88
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,339
hey, pastor, I would like to join the church.

89
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:13,460
My first question is tell me about when you got saved.

90
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,619
Let me understand your testimony of salvation.

91
00:04:16,619 --> 00:04:19,540
And then after I hear the testimony of salvation,

92
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,140
talk to me about when you were scripturally baptized.

93
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,519
The local church is made up of individuals

94
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,339
but those individuals that are members of the local church

95
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:33,059
are to be saved and baptized scripturally.

96
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:35,339
We find that with that truth

97
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:38,559
that we are brothers and sisters in Christ.

98
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:40,579
We are a family.

99
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:44,420
And we find here that God likens the church

100
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,959
in the book of First Corinthians to a body.

101
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,000
And you think about the picture,

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,059
the imagery if you will of a body

103
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,059
and he talks about the church being a body

104
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:56,260
that's fitly joined together.

105
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,339
And you find this evening that when Paul is writing

106
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:01,140
to this church in Thessalonica,

107
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,720
he's already spoken to them

108
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,380
about the importance of brotherly love.

109
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,579
He's already spoken to them

110
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:09,140
about the importance of loving one another.

111
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,140
Turn back to the fourth chapter if you will

112
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,100
and look at verse nine and also in verse number 10.

113
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,619
And we see that the apostle Paul deals with this subject

114
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:19,739
of brotherly love.

115
00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:23,339
Now remember the Lord Jesus Christ in John chapter 13

116
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:26,339
said a new commandment I give unto you.

117
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:27,540
What was that commandment?

118
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,859
That you love one another,

119
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:33,140
not as you would love yourself, Old Testament,

120
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,140
but as I have loved, New Testament.

121
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,339
And we find that he then says this,

122
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:41,779
the Lord Jesus Christ says by this, by what?

123
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:43,739
Your love one for another,

124
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:47,980
that all men are gonna know that you are my disciples.

125
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,899
And so we find here that Paul is writing

126
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:51,859
to this local church in the fourth chapter

127
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:53,579
and notice in verse nine, he says,

128
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:55,980
but as touching brotherly love,

129
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,559
notice what he says, ye need not that I write unto you.

130
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,179
Why?

131
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:05,820
For ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another

132
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,019
and then notice this statement in verse number 10,

133
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:10,420
he commends them.

134
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:15,339
He says, and indeed ye do it toward,

135
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:18,859
notice this phrase, all the brethren,

136
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:21,700
which are in all Macedonia,

137
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,459
but we beseech you brethren,

138
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:28,459
notice what he says, that ye increase more and more.

139
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:30,760
Don't get comfortable with where you are,

140
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,160
don't allow yourself to become stagnant, no increase.

141
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:37,920
We find that he says, the apostle Paul,

142
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,959
he commends them as he talks about brotherly love,

143
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,239
he says that indeed you do it toward all the brethren.

144
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:47,359
Now, as we come to the fifth chapter, this closing section,

145
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:50,839
he says, greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.

146
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:53,480
And so we find when we think about the unity

147
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,859
of the local church and we understand

148
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:59,600
that a healthy church is a unified church, why?

149
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,359
Because we have no differences of our backgrounds,

150
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:05,500
our upbringings, our personalities,

151
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,559
no, it's because we're unified in Christ.

152
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:12,119
It's because we take and we embrace the truth of God's word

153
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:15,000
and it is God that gives unity.

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,480
We find this evening that as we would consider

155
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,279
where the apostle Paul says,

156
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,959
greet all the brethren with an holy kiss,

157
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,359
I believe that that statement helps us to understand

158
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,720
that there are to be no cliques, no clubs.

159
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,279
See, sometimes you think about a church

160
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,160
and if you're not careful,

161
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,320
church can kind of have its little groups of people,

162
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,000
its little cliques, quote unquote,

163
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,920
if you want to use that terminology,

164
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,279
but the reality is that we are a family.

165
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,200
We're brothers and sisters in Christ

166
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,119
and we're to greet all the brethren.

167
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:48,959
Does it mean that we might not have a personal draw

168
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:51,920
to some individuals more than others

169
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,160
because of some of those personality type things?

170
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,820
Sure, that might be the case,

171
00:07:56,859 --> 00:08:01,579
but not at the expense of excluding others.

172
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:03,019
Does that make sense this evening?

173
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:06,779
And so we find that as a church, a healthy church,

174
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:08,660
there's gonna be a church that's unified

175
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,299
where he says greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.

176
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:13,140
Why?

177
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,660
Because we're all part of the family of God.

178
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,940
We're all part of the local church.

179
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,260
We're all brothers and sisters in Christ

180
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,980
and I think about the truth again

181
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,019
and as we mentioned a moment ago

182
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:26,140
at the end of verse number 13

183
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:29,940
where the Bible says and be at peace among yourselves

184
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,260
and as we looked at that text of scripture

185
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,460
several weeks ago, we talked about

186
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,099
the responsibility of the local church,

187
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,500
the responsibility of the pastor,

188
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,900
but also the responsibility of the local church

189
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,900
and how we're to have that peace.

190
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,919
There's to be no divisions

191
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,979
and to be no schisms amongst the body.

192
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:51,219
The church in Corinth is obviously corrected

193
00:08:51,219 --> 00:08:56,140
because of their divisions and because of their schisms

194
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:01,099
and by the way, what was one of the main causes

195
00:09:01,099 --> 00:09:03,359
of those schisms and divisions?

196
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:08,359
I'm of Paul, I'm of Apollos, I'm of Cephas, right?

197
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,400
And so what are they doing?

198
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,500
They're having these cliques,

199
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,380
these little segmented sections, if you will,

200
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:21,119
of no, no, Paul says greet all the brethren

201
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,799
with an holy kiss.

202
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,000
A healthy church is gonna be a church

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,080
that has unity, that is unified.

204
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,559
Number two, I would say this,

205
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,559
a healthy church places a priority on the scriptures.

206
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:39,159
A healthy church places a priority on the scriptures.

207
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:41,580
See, in verse number 27,

208
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,919
notice what the Bible says, I charge you.

209
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:48,599
Now this phraseology is important for us to understand.

210
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:51,059
Paul is not making a suggestion here.

211
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:52,700
Paul is really giving a command.

212
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,380
He says, I charge you.

213
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,059
I'm giving you this instruction.

214
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:00,059
Now remember when he began in verse number.

215
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:03,859
12, this closing section, he says, we beseech you.

216
00:10:03,859 --> 00:10:07,819
We noticed in verse number 14, he says, we exhort you.

217
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:11,699
But now in verse number 27, he says, I charge you.

218
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:15,499
It's not just a suggestion.

219
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:18,859
See, the reality is that the church

220
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:23,339
is the pillar and ground of the truth.

221
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:28,339
And we find that he says, I charge you by the Lord.

222
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:30,959
What's the charge, what's the command?

223
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,959
That this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.

224
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:42,119
So again, we see the reference to all,

225
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:45,059
not some segmented group within the church,

226
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:47,899
not the quote unquote religious leaders

227
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:50,099
or the clergy, the pastors.

228
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:52,739
No, we find that it's to be read

229
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:55,579
unto all the holy brethren.

230
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:57,619
See, God's word is for every believer.

231
00:10:57,619 --> 00:10:58,619
It's for every person.

232
00:10:58,619 --> 00:10:59,859
God so loved the world.

233
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:04,259
We understand the truth of that declaration in John 3, 16.

234
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:09,259
And God says that the entrance of his words giveth light.

235
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:14,659
I'm so thankful for the impact that this book,

236
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:17,059
the Bible, has made in my life.

237
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:19,860
I'm so thankful that the entrance of thy words giveth light.

238
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,699
I'm thankful, the truth that we find

239
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:24,879
in 2 Corinthians chapter number four,

240
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:27,360
the fact that the God of this world

241
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,399
hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,

242
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,500
lest the light of the glorious gospel

243
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,000
should shine in unto them.

244
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,479
And we find that the Bible continues in that text

245
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:42,040
and says that we have this treasure in earthen vessels.

246
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,959
And if our gospel be hid, it says previous,

247
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,079
it's hid to them that are lost.

248
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:49,159
And so we find that a healthy church

249
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:51,079
not only is gonna have unity,

250
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:52,639
is gonna be a unified church,

251
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,439
but we find that a healthy church

252
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,799
places a priority on the scriptures.

253
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,919
Paul gives a charge to Timothy

254
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,639
at the end of 2 Timothy in the fourth chapter.

255
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,519
Right after he gives that great declaration

256
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,479
about all scripture is given by inspiration of God,

257
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,520
and it's profitable, and he goes through

258
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,559
and he gives this wonderful declaration

259
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:19,559
about the means by which we receive this book, the Bible.

260
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:23,319
Through inspiration, it's God's word.

261
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:28,319
And then he says, preach the word, preach the word.

262
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:34,759
The pastor has the responsibility,

263
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:39,759
according to 1 Peter 5, to feed the flock of God.

264
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,800
What does it mean to feed the flock of God?

265
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,199
It doesn't mean that we set up a buffet every week

266
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:48,279
and have various types of entrees for you to partake.

267
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,000
No, it means that the preacher, the pastor,

268
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,720
he has a responsibility to take this book,

269
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,919
to study it himself, to develop, to understand,

270
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:03,880
and then to teach and to preach God's word.

271
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,639
In the book of Ezra, we find that the Bible teaches us

272
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,959
really a pattern that they read the word of God distinctly,

273
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:14,599
they gave the sense and made the people,

274
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:17,699
caused the people to understand it.

275
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:19,839
That's the responsibility of the preacher.

276
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,839
The Bible talks about there when the first deacons,

277
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,360
if you will, in Acts chapter number six

278
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,599
and all that was taking place,

279
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,139
and you find that Peter and the others,

280
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:32,880
they stand and they say, listen,

281
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,880
it's not reason that we should leave the word of God

282
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,380
and serve tables, no, what were they gonna do?

283
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,360
They were gonna give themselves continually to prayer

284
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,220
and to the ministry of the word.

285
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,160
And so we find here that when Paul says,

286
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,160
I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read

287
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,800
unto all the holy brethren.

288
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,020
Now we understand today in 2024,

289
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,020
that this book is part of the canon of scripture.

290
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,759
And so just as this letter,

291
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,360
this epistle was written to a local church,

292
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,619
it's God's word, it's been preserved,

293
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:09,399
it's part of the canon of scripture,

294
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:11,919
and it's to be read and it has been read

295
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:16,179
through the centuries to local churches.

296
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:20,059
And believers have been helped by the context,

297
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:24,899
the content, excuse me, of this book, this epistle.

298
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,540
And so Paul says that this book, this epistle

299
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:33,540
is to be read unto all the holy brethren.

300
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,899
I'm thankful for God's word.

301
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:37,779
Someone asked me years ago,

302
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:40,899
and I'd only been pre-pastoring here for just a few years,

303
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:42,139
and they said, you know,

304
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:45,179
how do you come up with these messages?

305
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:48,540
And it was actually, it was a legitimate, you know,

306
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,820
question that the individual had.

307
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,660
And I said, well, you know,

308
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,820
if it was up to me to come up with the content,

309
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,139
I'd have run out a long time ago.

310
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:58,220
But God has given me the responsibility

311
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,339
to simply preach his word.

312
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:02,700
And so I go to God's word and I study it

313
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,380
and I seek to understand it so that I then can come

314
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,859
and deliver to preach the word.

315
00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:10,820
I'm thankful that God has given us his word.

316
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,600
Could you imagine if we didn't have the Bible?

317
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,000
Man, everything that you know about God

318
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,239
is because we have a Bible.

319
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,559
The Bible tells us that the heavens

320
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,119
declare the glory of God.

321
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:26,440
You might be able to see from creation that there is a God,

322
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,919
but you would not know the attributes of God

323
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:30,880
by simply looking at creation.

324
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,760
I'm thankful that this book provides for us

325
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,040
all that we need to know.

326
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,019
The Bible says that he's given us all things

327
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:41,679
that pertain unto life and godliness.

328
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,959
As we look back in the beginning of 1 Thessalonians

329
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,919
in the first chapter, we find that in verse number one

330
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:51,720
that Paul says that he's writing Paul and Silvanus

331
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,440
and Timotheus unto the church of the Thessalonians.

332
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,200
He says in verse number two,

333
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,079
we give thanks to God always, notice this,

334
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:06,079
for you all, making mention of you in our prayers.

335
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,839
And so Paul was writing under the inspiration

336
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:11,519
of the Holy Spirit of God to the entire church

337
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:16,200
and to every believer, and he says he gives this charge

338
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:21,200
that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.

339
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:25,799
It wasn't to be reserved for just a certain group

340
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:29,480
within the church, it wasn't to have this distinction

341
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,079
between clergy and laity, if you will,

342
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,600
and to say no, you can't read the Bible.

343
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,720
No, he says it's to be read, it's to be read.

344
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,639
And I'm thankful.

345
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,119
A healthy church is a church that places a priority

346
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:45,339
on the scriptures.

347
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,399
The truth of the matter is that when a church

348
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,079
deviates from God's word, when a church doesn't have

349
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,040
an emphasis placed upon the preaching and teaching

350
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,679
of God's word, it really just becomes

351
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:07,720
any other kind of club, entertainment.

352
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,239
The reality is that God's given us this book

353
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:14,239
and it's profitable and it is to be a priority

354
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,760
in our church.

355
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,760
I love preaching and teaching the Bible, I love the Bible.

356
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:25,239
And the reality is that I enjoy singing, I love to sing,

357
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:28,919
and I love fellowship and prayer and so on and so forth,

358
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,040
but when we come together, we need to have the preaching

359
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,799
of God's word, because it's God's word that changes life,

360
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,600
that changes lives.

361
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,760
I remember reading a billboard many years ago

362
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,040
in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, said many books

363
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,480
can inform, but only the Bible can transform.

364
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,559
That was a powerful statement, one that set in my mind

365
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:55,919
that I remember all these years later.

366
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,119
So we find that Paul says, greet all the brethren

367
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,160
with a holy kiss, this unity that should be evident

368
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,880
in a church that is a healthy church.

369
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,959
He continues and says, I charge you by the Lord

370
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:12,799
that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren,

371
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,519
a priority that is placed upon the scriptures.

372
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:18,600
Number three, in verse number 28, a healthy church

373
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,260
acknowledges their need for God's grace.

374
00:18:24,139 --> 00:18:26,839
Where would we be without the grace of God?

375
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,040
Aren't you thankful tonight that our God is gracious?

376
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,600
Oh, he's so gracious.

377
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:35,520
We find that the Bible concludes, as in fact,

378
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,359
many of the epistles, as you study through

379
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:41,279
the New Testament, he says in verse 28,

380
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:46,279
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, amen.

381
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,080
We sing Amazing Grace, of course, Don and I haven't been

382
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,239
here for a number of months now with health issues,

383
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:55,880
but Mr. Don's favorite song, Amazing Grace,

384
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,559
it's got a tie that has the words of the song,

385
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,279
and I know I've said it before, but anytime you get

386
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:05,719
into the 180s, Amazing Grace in our hymnal is 187,

387
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:08,000
you sing any other number in the 180s,

388
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,039
and you can hear Mr. Don say, why not 187?

389
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,320
And, well, because there's some other good songs

390
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,239
in the 180s in our songbook, but the reality is that

391
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,159
God's grace is amazing.

392
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,020
We ought to be thankful tonight for the grace of God.

393
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,940
We understand tonight that we're saved by grace,

394
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,979
for by grace are you saved through faith.

395
00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:34,940
Wow, the saving grace of God.

396
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,260
I'm thankful tonight that our God is gracious.

397
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,400
We find that not only are we saved by grace,

398
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,380
but we find that it's the grace of God

399
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,779
that enables us to serve.

400
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:48,940
We find that as we were to look through the scriptures,

401
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,340
as we begin to understand in 1 Corinthians 15,

402
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,700
in verse number 10, the apostle Paul says,

403
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,059
he says this, by the grace of God, I am what I am.

404
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:00,140
We find that as you.

405
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,340
and Peter talks about serving, and the spiritual gifts,

406
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,040
as every man hath received the gift,

407
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,880
even so let him minister.

408
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,520
And then he says this, it's in 1 Peter chapter four

409
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,780
in verse number 10, if you wanna jot it down.

410
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,880
He says this, as good stewards

411
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,820
of the manifold grace of God.

412
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,040
God's gifted every believer.

413
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,160
It's a biblical truth.

414
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,880
1 Corinthians deals with it, Romans deals with it.

415
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,800
We find 1 Peter, that Peter's dealing with it.

416
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:36,400
In every believer, if you're born again this evening,

417
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,120
you have been given a spiritual gift,

418
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,880
and God says that as we understand the spiritual gift

419
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,280
that he has given to us, that we are to be good stewards

420
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,980
of the manifold grace of God.

421
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,160
I wanna be a good steward of God's grace

422
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,880
that has been bestowed upon me.

423
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,080
Not simply the saving grace, but again,

424
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,800
the grace of God that enables us to serve him.

425
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,720
I think about God's grace, and we understand,

426
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,240
I mentioned a moment ago about it being amazing.

427
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,320
You understand that the Apostle Paul

428
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,160
in 1 Timothy one, in verse number 14,

429
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,800
he speaks of the grace of God,

430
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,840
and he refers to it this way, that it's exceeding abundant.

431
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,240
I like that phraseology.

432
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,240
God's grace is exceeding abundant.

433
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,680
But I want you to think about this aspect as well,

434
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,080
when we consider that a healthy church

435
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,780
acknowledges their need for God's grace.

436
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,720
We understand that it's God's grace that saves us,

437
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,760
it's God's grace that enables us.

438
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,400
Again, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15, 10,

439
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,120
but by the grace of God, I am what I am.

440
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,640
See, God's grace has been bestowed upon us.

441
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,480
He continues and says this in that verse of scripture

442
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,760
in 1 Corinthians 15, 10, and his grace,

443
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,900
which was bestowed upon me, was not in vain,

444
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,440
but I labored more abundantly than they all,

445
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,640
yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.

446
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,560
And so we think about the coupling of this truth

447
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,460
in Paul's testimony in 1 Corinthians 15, 10,

448
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,680
coupled with 1 Peter four in verse number 10

449
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,240
that we're to be good stewards

450
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,080
of the manifold grace of God.

451
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,340
I believe that the Apostle Paul was a good steward

452
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,460
of the grace of God that had been bestowed upon him.

453
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,060
This evening, we too must be good stewards.

454
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,180
We recognize that where would we be

455
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,300
without the grace of God?

456
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,960
I mean, we understand that we wouldn't be saved

457
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,820
without the grace of God,

458
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,660
but then you think about his grace that enables us to serve.

459
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,860
How could we serve him without his grace?

460
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,660
A healthy church recognizes,

461
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,300
acknowledges their need for God's grace,

462
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,780
and I believe that's why the Apostle Paul closes

463
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,500
so many of the epistles with the reminder

464
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,900
of the grace of God, be with you,

465
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,700
because it's a reminder that we need God's grace.

466
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,060
We need his grace every day in our lives.

467
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,140
I want you to consider also,

468
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,980
when we think about the grace of God,

469
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,180
recognize tonight that God's grace is sufficient.

470
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,740
2 Corinthians chapter 12 is a passage of scripture

471
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,340
that is familiar to many of us,

472
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:21,340
and oftentimes we will quote a portion

473
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,180
of this scripture, of this passage.

474
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,700
We find that the Apostle Paul

475
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,460
in 2 Corinthians chapter 12,

476
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,700
he's giving a testimony,

477
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,660
and he talks about a vision,

478
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,260
and this vision that he had,

479
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,800
and he says in verse number four

480
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,060
how that he was caught up into paradise

481
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,980
and heard unspeakable words,

482
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,740
which it is not lawful for a man to utter.

483
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,900
Of such in one will I glory,

484
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,820
yet of myself I will not glory,

485
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,180
but in mine infirmities, verse six,

486
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,460
for though I would desire to glory,

487
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,180
I should not be a fool,

488
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,420
for I will say the truth,

489
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,060
but now I forbear,

490
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,820
lest any man should think of me above that

491
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,780
which he seeth me to be,

492
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,900
or that he heareth of me.

493
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,420
And lest I should be exalted above measure

494
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,260
through the abundance of the revelations.

495
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,740
Notice what Paul says.

496
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,660
He recognizes that he could have got prideful

497
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,940
because of the abundance of the revelations.

498
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,820
He said in verse six,

499
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,360
for though I would desire to glory.

500
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,200
Why?

501
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,980
That's just a fleshly human tendency.

502
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,860
When you got saved,

503
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,700
when I got saved,

504
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,700
when Paul got saved,

505
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,720
the flesh wasn't eradicated.

506
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,820
The flesh has to be crucified,

507
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,140
and so your flesh still has desires,

508
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,380
your flesh still has those,

509
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,340
and he says though I would desire to glory,

510
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,100
I should not be a fool.

511
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,580
He says that through these abundance of revelations,

512
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:48,020
that though and lest I should be exalted above measure

513
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,420
through the abundance of the revelations,

514
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,260
verse seven,

515
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,080
notice what he says,

516
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,100
there was given to me a thorn in the flesh.

517
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,060
The messenger of Satan to buff at me,

518
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:57,900
notice why,

519
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,900
lest I should be exalted above measure.

520
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,100
Then notice what Paul says in verse number eight.

521
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,740
For this thing,

522
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,860
I besought the Lord thrice,

523
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:12,580
that it might depart from me.

524
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,820
And Paul was consistent,

525
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,000
fervent, if you will.

526
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,780
He says I besought the Lord thrice,

527
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,000
that it might depart from me.

528
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,640
Now, could God have caused this to depart from him?

529
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,860
He can do anything.

530
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,460
Paul is the one that God used to write

531
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,340
that wonderful promise in Ephesians three,

532
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,340
now unto him,

533
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,980
which is able to do exceeding abundantly

534
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,000
above all that we ask or think.

535
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:45,100
But notice what God says in verse number nine,

536
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,140
God's answer to Paul,

537
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,500
when Paul besought the Lord

538
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,980
with regard to this thorn in the flesh,

539
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,980
God said my grace is sufficient for thee.

540
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,680
My grace is sufficient for thee.

541
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:07,060
For my strength is made perfect in weakness.

542
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,740
You know, most of us don't physically,

543
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,200
we don't emotionally,

544
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,240
we don't want to show any vulnerabilities of weakness.

545
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,660
Right?

546
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,480
We don't want that to be perceived by others

547
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,700
that there's some measure of weakness,

548
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:33,540
but God says that his strength is made perfect in weakness.

549
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:38,540
He says my grace is sufficient for thee.

550
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,220
God is no respecter of persons.

551
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,620
And if God's grace was sufficient for Paul,

552
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,360
God's grace is sufficient for every one of us.

553
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,620
And we recognize a healthy church,

554
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,660
and remember a healthy church

555
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,740
is made up of healthy individuals.

556
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,740
I mean, a church is made up of people.

557
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,660
The church is not the building, it's the people.

558
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,740
The people are saved and baptized individuals

559
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,880
that make up the church,

560
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,860
and a healthy church is going to acknowledge

561
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:10,700
their need for the grace of God, for God's grace.

562
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,340
Paul says this after he receives the answer

563
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,600
that God gives at the end of verse number nine,

564
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,600
most gladly therefore will I rather glory

565
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,680
in my infirmities that the power of Christ

566
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,840
may rest upon me.

567
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,880
Therefore, notice what he says,

568
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,760
I take pleasure in infirmities,

569
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,920
in reproaches, in necessities,

570
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,920
in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake.

571
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,460
For when I am weak, then am I strong.

572
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,560
What is it in that moment of weakness

573
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,960
that would make someone strong?

574
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,360
It's the grace of God.

575
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,160
It's God's strength,

576
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:00,080
his strength being made perfect in our weakness

577
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,240
because his grace is sufficient.

578
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,800
This evening, a healthy church is a unified church.

579
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,040
No schisms, no divisions, a unified church.

580
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,440
Unified because we have no differences

581
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,580
of background, of personalities.

582
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:22,580
No, unified because we embrace the same truth.

583
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,820
We accept and we believe the same truth

584
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,660
and therefore God gives us unity.

585
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,500
A healthy church places a priority on the scriptures.

586
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,100
It's God's word that must be taught

587
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,580
and preached and believed, practiced.

588
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,500
As a Baptist, we often will say

589
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,580
that the Bible is our sole authority

590
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,940
for faith and practice.

591
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,760
Well, if the Bible is our sole authority

592
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,280
for faith and practice,

593
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,640
there must be a priority placed upon the scriptures.

594
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,679
It must be taught, it must be learned,

595
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,000
it must be understood, it must be applied.

596
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,119
And so we find that a healthy church

597
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:04,520
places a priority in the scriptures.

598
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,540
And number three, these three elements

599
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,679
that we see in these three concluding verses

600
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:11,080
is that a healthy church acknowledges

601
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,119
their need for God's grace.

602
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,239
By the grace of God, I am what I am.

603
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:19,559
Where would we be without God's grace?

604
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,600
We must acknowledge that we need God's grace

605
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,320
every day of our lives.

606
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,720
And I'm thankful that God's grace is sufficient,

607
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,400
that God gives it.

608
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,400
I know I said this a number of weeks ago,

609
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,720
but sometimes if we're not careful,

610
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,720
we can play these hypothetical mind games.

611
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,840
And we can put ourselves in a position of,

612
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,220
man, I don't know how I could ever handle such and such.

613
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,080
Maybe you hear of someone that has suffered,

614
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,080
has experienced some tragedy or some just adversity.

615
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,359
And you say, I don't know how I could handle that.

616
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,320
The reality is that we should not play

617
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,119
those hypothetical type of mind.

618
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:07,679
games because God gives us His grace in the moment that we deal with whatever we deal

619
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,599
with.

620
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:16,259
And we don't have to think about how could we ever, no, no, we trust that God will give

621
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:21,839
us the grace in the very moment that we need His grace.

622
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:26,799
I don't know if you've ever read Foxe's Book of Martyrs or any portion of it or if you've

623
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,199
read of any martyrs of the faith.

624
00:30:30,199 --> 00:30:36,879
But you'll read of individuals that literally are being burned alive singing the praises

625
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:38,879
of God.

626
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,719
How?

627
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:51,599
I can't, no, no, in the moment that we need God's grace, God's grace is sufficient.

628
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:57,719
I believe that's the only way that you could explain those types of testimonies, that you

629
00:30:57,719 --> 00:31:09,639
could explain any of those tragic events outside of the grace of God is sufficient.

630
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:14,519
And I'm so thankful for that wonderful promise that God has given a healthy church.

631
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:18,239
Healthy church is made up of healthy believers.

632
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:24,479
Every believer should have the desire to live their life in such a way that God would

633
00:31:24,479 --> 00:31:25,959
be pleased.

634
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:32,479
That we could say, as we've used for the title of this series, walk worthy, please God.

635
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:39,319
What a joy that God has given us the instruction so that we know how we can please Him, how

636
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:41,759
we ought to walk.

637
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,099
The church in Thessalonica was given this instruction.

638
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:53,779
God graciously has preserved it for us so that we too today can understand how we can

639
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:56,459
walk worthy and please God.

640
00:31:56,459 --> 00:31:57,459
Let's pray together.

641
00:31:57,459 --> 00:31:58,499
Father, we love you.

642
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,779
We thank you for loving us.

643
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:06,299
We thank you for the privilege that you've given us to hear the gospel.

644
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:13,539
God thank you for those that have been faithful before us to deliver the truth, the gospel

645
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:15,699
of Jesus Christ.

646
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:24,379
Thank you for those that, Lord, suffered greatly, persecution, great adversities, but they continued.

647
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:26,699
They remained steadfast.

648
00:32:26,699 --> 00:32:29,339
Lord, I thank you for my salvation.

649
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:32,979
I thank you for those that are gathered this evening that have trusted you as their personal

650
00:32:32,979 --> 00:32:33,979
Lord and Savior.

651
00:32:33,979 --> 00:32:43,940
And God, I pray that as we consider the instruction from 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 this evening,

652
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:50,099
as we conclude that text and consider a healthy church, God, would you help us to take all

653
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:56,019
that we've learned over these many weeks and apply it, that we'd be doers of the word and

654
00:32:56,019 --> 00:33:02,940
not hearers only, that we would be a church that's a healthy church.

655
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:08,500
Lord, that you would use us to reach our community with the gospel, that you'd use us to continue

656
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:14,459
to support the work of missions, global evangelization.

657
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:19,179
Lord, I pray that you'd use us for your honor and for your glory.

658
00:33:19,179 --> 00:33:20,539
Bless now the time of prayer.

659
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:26,299
We thank you for the privilege at the end of our Wednesday night service that we can

660
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:30,419
pray together, intercessory prayer, corporate prayer.

661
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:32,419
God, we know that you hear and answer.

662
00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:35,059
You've given us wonderful promises.

663
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:38,379
I pray, God, that you would bless our time, that you'd be honored and we'll thank you

664
00:33:38,379 --> 00:33:39,379
for it.

665
00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:42,619
In Christ's name we pray, amen.
