00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.519
This is our 18th lesson on this subject matter

00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:06.679
of walk worthy, please God.

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:08.880
And we've mentioned as we've studied

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.560
through this fifth chapter of the book of 1 Thessalonians,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.199
we started in verse number 12,

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.600
this evening we'll finish the chapter.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.840
And as we first started this series on Wednesday evenings,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.920
I mentioned that we'll study the fifth chapter,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.719
the last portion of the fifth chapter of 1 Thessalonians.

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:27.459
And then once we're done there,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.540
we'll go over to 2 Thessalonians chapter number three

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.180
and look at the latter portion of that text.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.900
In both of those portions of scripture,

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.500
we find that God would use the Apostle Paul

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.979
to give instruction to the local church.

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:45.340
As this instruction is given to the local church,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.919
the church at Thessalonica,

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:50.060
we understand that God has provided this instruction

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.060
so that the believers would have that information,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.540
they'd understand what is acceptable unto the Lord,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.819
and they would strive to walk worthy and please God.

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:02.180
As we close this book,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.940
we find, I believe, three elements of a healthy church.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.500
If you're taking notes tonight,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.160
I've titled the message this evening, A Healthy Church.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.099
The goal of every believer, every individual believer,

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:16.220
the goal that you should have

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.300
is that you would please the Lord with your life.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.500
How do we please the Lord?

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.500
We live a life that is aligned

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.940
with the principles of God's word.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.239
Healthy believers make a healthy church.

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:31.940
And you're not gonna have a healthy church

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.220
with unhealthy believers.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.940
And so we strive to have a church

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.699
that would be referred to as being a healthy church.

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:44.199
And if we're going to have a healthy church as individuals,

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:46.819
we must be healthy believers.

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.480
We must be taking and applying the truth of God's word

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.459
into our lives.

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:55.379
Last week, we dealt with intercessory prayer from verse 25,

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:58.980
where the Bible simply says, brethren, pray for us.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.139
This week, we'll look at verses 26 through 28,

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:03.239
look at these three elements of a healthy church.

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:04.739
The Bible says this,

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:08.639
greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:13.419
I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:16.139
unto all the holy brethren.

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:21.139
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, amen.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.220
Number one this evening, a healthy church is unified.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.460
A healthy church is unified.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.419
Notice what the Bible says in verse 26,

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:31.660
greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.500
We understand the book of Ephesians tells us

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.139
that we ought to strive for unity.

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:38.899
We must have that desire,

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:41.259
endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:42.419
and the bond of peace,

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:46.139
according to Ephesians chapter four in verse number three.

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.419
We find that in verse number 13 here,

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:51.539
1 Thessalonians five, the last phrase says,

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:54.619
and be at peace among yourselves.

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:56.660
And so now we come to verse number 26,

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.580
and the Bible says greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.539
And I say that a healthy church is a unified church.

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:06.580
And we find that this particular greeting

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.779
that is mentioned in verse number 26

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:11.460
was obviously culturally accepted

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.699
for this area in Thessalonica.

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.259
In fact, today in many parts of the world,

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.419
this would still be a greeting

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.100
that would be culturally appropriate.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.300
Now here in the United States of America,

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.699
if you grew up here,

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:28.300
we're not greeting one another with an holy kiss.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.779
But the reality is that we might shake hands,

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:33.339
we might give a hug, whatever it might be.

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:36.740
But we understand that as we look at this verse of scripture

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.740
and we see the unity in this culturally appropriate greeting

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.740
but what I really want you to focus on

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.100
when I think about and the reason

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.100
that I give the point of unity

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.500
is that the Bible says notice that little word all.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.500
Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:59.460
See, the local church is made up

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.779
of saved baptized believers, individuals.

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:06.419
When a person comes and they say,

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:10.339
hey, pastor, I would like to join the church.

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:13.460
My first question is tell me about when you got saved.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.619
Let me understand your testimony of salvation.

00:04:16.619 --> 00:04:19.540
And then after I hear the testimony of salvation,

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.140
talk to me about when you were scripturally baptized.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.519
The local church is made up of individuals

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:29.339
but those individuals that are members of the local church

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:33.059
are to be saved and baptized scripturally.

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:35.339
We find that with that truth

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:38.559
that we are brothers and sisters in Christ.

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:40.579
We are a family.

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:44.420
And we find here that God likens the church

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.959
in the book of First Corinthians to a body.

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:49.000
And you think about the picture,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.059
the imagery if you will of a body

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:54.059
and he talks about the church being a body

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:56.260
that's fitly joined together.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.339
And you find this evening that when Paul is writing

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:01.140
to this church in Thessalonica,

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.720
he's already spoken to them

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.380
about the importance of brotherly love.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.579
He's already spoken to them

00:05:06.579 --> 00:05:09.140
about the importance of loving one another.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.140
Turn back to the fourth chapter if you will

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.100
and look at verse nine and also in verse number 10.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.619
And we see that the apostle Paul deals with this subject

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:19.739
of brotherly love.

00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:23.339
Now remember the Lord Jesus Christ in John chapter 13

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:26.339
said a new commandment I give unto you.

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:27.540
What was that commandment?

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.859
That you love one another,

00:05:29.859 --> 00:05:33.140
not as you would love yourself, Old Testament,

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.140
but as I have loved, New Testament.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.339
And we find that he then says this,

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:41.779
the Lord Jesus Christ says by this, by what?

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:43.739
Your love one for another,

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:47.980
that all men are gonna know that you are my disciples.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.899
And so we find here that Paul is writing

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:51.859
to this local church in the fourth chapter

00:05:51.859 --> 00:05:53.579
and notice in verse nine, he says,

00:05:53.579 --> 00:05:55.980
but as touching brotherly love,

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.559
notice what he says, ye need not that I write unto you.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.179
Why?

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:05.820
For ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.019
and then notice this statement in verse number 10,

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:10.420
he commends them.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.339
He says, and indeed ye do it toward,

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:18.859
notice this phrase, all the brethren,

00:06:19.799 --> 00:06:21.700
which are in all Macedonia,

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.459
but we beseech you brethren,

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:28.459
notice what he says, that ye increase more and more.

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:30.760
Don't get comfortable with where you are,

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.160
don't allow yourself to become stagnant, no increase.

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:37.920
We find that he says, the apostle Paul,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.959
he commends them as he talks about brotherly love,

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:44.239
he says that indeed you do it toward all the brethren.

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:47.359
Now, as we come to the fifth chapter, this closing section,

00:06:47.359 --> 00:06:50.839
he says, greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:53.480
And so we find when we think about the unity

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.859
of the local church and we understand

00:06:55.859 --> 00:06:59.600
that a healthy church is a unified church, why?

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.359
Because we have no differences of our backgrounds,

00:07:03.359 --> 00:07:05.500
our upbringings, our personalities,

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.559
no, it's because we're unified in Christ.

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:12.119
It's because we take and we embrace the truth of God's word

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:15.000
and it is God that gives unity.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.480
We find this evening that as we would consider

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.279
where the apostle Paul says,

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:21.959
greet all the brethren with an holy kiss,

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:25.359
I believe that that statement helps us to understand

00:07:25.359 --> 00:07:27.720
that there are to be no cliques, no clubs.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.279
See, sometimes you think about a church

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:31.160
and if you're not careful,

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.320
church can kind of have its little groups of people,

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.000
its little cliques, quote unquote,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.920
if you want to use that terminology,

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.279
but the reality is that we are a family.

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:42.200
We're brothers and sisters in Christ

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.119
and we're to greet all the brethren.

00:07:44.119 --> 00:07:48.959
Does it mean that we might not have a personal draw

00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:51.920
to some individuals more than others

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.160
because of some of those personality type things?

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.820
Sure, that might be the case,

00:07:56.859 --> 00:08:01.579
but not at the expense of excluding others.

00:08:01.579 --> 00:08:03.019
Does that make sense this evening?

00:08:03.019 --> 00:08:06.779
And so we find that as a church, a healthy church,

00:08:06.779 --> 00:08:08.660
there's gonna be a church that's unified

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.299
where he says greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.

00:08:12.299 --> 00:08:13.140
Why?

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.660
Because we're all part of the family of God.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.940
We're all part of the local church.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.260
We're all brothers and sisters in Christ

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.980
and I think about the truth again

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.019
and as we mentioned a moment ago

00:08:25.019 --> 00:08:26.140
at the end of verse number 13

00:08:26.459 --> 00:08:29.940
where the Bible says and be at peace among yourselves

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.260
and as we looked at that text of scripture

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.460
several weeks ago, we talked about

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.099
the responsibility of the local church,

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:37.500
the responsibility of the pastor,

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.900
but also the responsibility of the local church

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.900
and how we're to have that peace.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.919
There's to be no divisions

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.979
and to be no schisms amongst the body.

00:08:46.979 --> 00:08:51.219
The church in Corinth is obviously corrected

00:08:51.219 --> 00:08:56.140
because of their divisions and because of their schisms

00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:01.099
and by the way, what was one of the main causes

00:09:01.099 --> 00:09:03.359
of those schisms and divisions?

00:09:03.359 --> 00:09:08.359
I'm of Paul, I'm of Apollos, I'm of Cephas, right?

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.400
And so what are they doing?

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.500
They're having these cliques,

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.380
these little segmented sections, if you will,

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:21.119
of no, no, Paul says greet all the brethren

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.799
with an holy kiss.

00:09:22.799 --> 00:09:24.000
A healthy church is gonna be a church

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.080
that has unity, that is unified.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.559
Number two, I would say this,

00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:33.559
a healthy church places a priority on the scriptures.

00:09:34.159 --> 00:09:39.159
A healthy church places a priority on the scriptures.

00:09:39.239 --> 00:09:41.580
See, in verse number 27,

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.919
notice what the Bible says, I charge you.

00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:48.599
Now this phraseology is important for us to understand.

00:09:48.599 --> 00:09:51.059
Paul is not making a suggestion here.

00:09:51.859 --> 00:09:52.700
Paul is really giving a command.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.380
He says, I charge you.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.059
I'm giving you this instruction.

00:09:57.059 --> 00:10:00.059
Now remember when he began in verse number.

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:03.859
12, this closing section, he says, we beseech you.

00:10:03.859 --> 00:10:07.819
We noticed in verse number 14, he says, we exhort you.

00:10:07.819 --> 00:10:11.699
But now in verse number 27, he says, I charge you.

00:10:13.459 --> 00:10:15.499
It's not just a suggestion.

00:10:15.499 --> 00:10:18.859
See, the reality is that the church

00:10:18.859 --> 00:10:23.339
is the pillar and ground of the truth.

00:10:23.339 --> 00:10:28.339
And we find that he says, I charge you by the Lord.

00:10:29.179 --> 00:10:30.959
What's the charge, what's the command?

00:10:30.959 --> 00:10:35.959
That this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.

00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:42.119
So again, we see the reference to all,

00:10:42.119 --> 00:10:45.059
not some segmented group within the church,

00:10:45.059 --> 00:10:47.899
not the quote unquote religious leaders

00:10:47.899 --> 00:10:50.099
or the clergy, the pastors.

00:10:50.099 --> 00:10:52.739
No, we find that it's to be read

00:10:52.739 --> 00:10:55.579
unto all the holy brethren.

00:10:55.579 --> 00:10:57.619
See, God's word is for every believer.

00:10:57.619 --> 00:10:58.619
It's for every person.

00:10:58.619 --> 00:10:59.859
God so loved the world.

00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:04.259
We understand the truth of that declaration in John 3, 16.

00:11:04.259 --> 00:11:09.259
And God says that the entrance of his words giveth light.

00:11:10.379 --> 00:11:14.659
I'm so thankful for the impact that this book,

00:11:14.659 --> 00:11:17.059
the Bible, has made in my life.

00:11:17.059 --> 00:11:19.860
I'm so thankful that the entrance of thy words giveth light.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.699
I'm thankful, the truth that we find

00:11:22.699 --> 00:11:24.879
in 2 Corinthians chapter number four,

00:11:24.879 --> 00:11:27.360
the fact that the God of this world

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.399
hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:33.500
lest the light of the glorious gospel

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.000
should shine in unto them.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.479
And we find that the Bible continues in that text

00:11:37.479 --> 00:11:42.040
and says that we have this treasure in earthen vessels.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.959
And if our gospel be hid, it says previous,

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:47.079
it's hid to them that are lost.

00:11:47.079 --> 00:11:49.159
And so we find that a healthy church

00:11:49.159 --> 00:11:51.079
not only is gonna have unity,

00:11:51.079 --> 00:11:52.639
is gonna be a unified church,

00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:54.439
but we find that a healthy church

00:11:54.959 --> 00:11:57.799
places a priority on the scriptures.

00:11:57.799 --> 00:11:59.919
Paul gives a charge to Timothy

00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:02.639
at the end of 2 Timothy in the fourth chapter.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:05.519
Right after he gives that great declaration

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:09.479
about all scripture is given by inspiration of God,

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:11.520
and it's profitable, and he goes through

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.559
and he gives this wonderful declaration

00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:19.559
about the means by which we receive this book, the Bible.

00:12:20.319 --> 00:12:23.319
Through inspiration, it's God's word.

00:12:23.319 --> 00:12:28.319
And then he says, preach the word, preach the word.

00:12:30.479 --> 00:12:34.759
The pastor has the responsibility,

00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:39.759
according to 1 Peter 5, to feed the flock of God.

00:12:39.919 --> 00:12:41.800
What does it mean to feed the flock of God?

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.199
It doesn't mean that we set up a buffet every week

00:12:44.199 --> 00:12:48.279
and have various types of entrees for you to partake.

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:51.000
No, it means that the preacher, the pastor,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.720
he has a responsibility to take this book,

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.919
to study it himself, to develop, to understand,

00:12:58.919 --> 00:13:03.880
and then to teach and to preach God's word.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.639
In the book of Ezra, we find that the Bible teaches us

00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:11.959
really a pattern that they read the word of God distinctly,

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:14.599
they gave the sense and made the people,

00:13:14.599 --> 00:13:17.699
caused the people to understand it.

00:13:17.699 --> 00:13:19.839
That's the responsibility of the preacher.

00:13:19.839 --> 00:13:24.839
The Bible talks about there when the first deacons,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.360
if you will, in Acts chapter number six

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.599
and all that was taking place,

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:31.139
and you find that Peter and the others,

00:13:31.139 --> 00:13:32.880
they stand and they say, listen,

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.880
it's not reason that we should leave the word of God

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.380
and serve tables, no, what were they gonna do?

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.360
They were gonna give themselves continually to prayer

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.220
and to the ministry of the word.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.160
And so we find here that when Paul says,

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.160
I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:55.800
unto all the holy brethren.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.020
Now we understand today in 2024,

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.020
that this book is part of the canon of scripture.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.759
And so just as this letter,

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:05.360
this epistle was written to a local church,

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.619
it's God's word, it's been preserved,

00:14:07.619 --> 00:14:09.399
it's part of the canon of scripture,

00:14:09.399 --> 00:14:11.919
and it's to be read and it has been read

00:14:11.919 --> 00:14:16.179
through the centuries to local churches.

00:14:16.179 --> 00:14:20.059
And believers have been helped by the context,

00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:24.899
the content, excuse me, of this book, this epistle.

00:14:24.899 --> 00:14:28.540
And so Paul says that this book, this epistle

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:33.540
is to be read unto all the holy brethren.

00:14:33.959 --> 00:14:35.899
I'm thankful for God's word.

00:14:35.899 --> 00:14:37.779
Someone asked me years ago,

00:14:37.779 --> 00:14:40.899
and I'd only been pre-pastoring here for just a few years,

00:14:40.899 --> 00:14:42.139
and they said, you know,

00:14:42.139 --> 00:14:45.179
how do you come up with these messages?

00:14:45.179 --> 00:14:48.540
And it was actually, it was a legitimate, you know,

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.820
question that the individual had.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:51.660
And I said, well, you know,

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.820
if it was up to me to come up with the content,

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.139
I'd have run out a long time ago.

00:14:56.139 --> 00:14:58.220
But God has given me the responsibility

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.339
to simply preach his word.

00:15:00.339 --> 00:15:02.700
And so I go to God's word and I study it

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:06.380
and I seek to understand it so that I then can come

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.859
and deliver to preach the word.

00:15:08.859 --> 00:15:10.820
I'm thankful that God has given us his word.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.600
Could you imagine if we didn't have the Bible?

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.000
Man, everything that you know about God

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.239
is because we have a Bible.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.559
The Bible tells us that the heavens

00:15:21.559 --> 00:15:23.119
declare the glory of God.

00:15:23.119 --> 00:15:26.440
You might be able to see from creation that there is a God,

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.919
but you would not know the attributes of God

00:15:28.919 --> 00:15:30.880
by simply looking at creation.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.760
I'm thankful that this book provides for us

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.040
all that we need to know.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.019
The Bible says that he's given us all things

00:15:39.019 --> 00:15:41.679
that pertain unto life and godliness.

00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:44.959
As we look back in the beginning of 1 Thessalonians

00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:48.919
in the first chapter, we find that in verse number one

00:15:48.919 --> 00:15:51.720
that Paul says that he's writing Paul and Silvanus

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:56.440
and Timotheus unto the church of the Thessalonians.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.200
He says in verse number two,

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.079
we give thanks to God always, notice this,

00:16:01.079 --> 00:16:06.079
for you all, making mention of you in our prayers.

00:16:06.079 --> 00:16:08.839
And so Paul was writing under the inspiration

00:16:08.839 --> 00:16:11.519
of the Holy Spirit of God to the entire church

00:16:12.359 --> 00:16:16.200
and to every believer, and he says he gives this charge

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:21.200
that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.

00:16:21.959 --> 00:16:25.799
It wasn't to be reserved for just a certain group

00:16:25.799 --> 00:16:29.480
within the church, it wasn't to have this distinction

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.079
between clergy and laity, if you will,

00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:34.600
and to say no, you can't read the Bible.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.720
No, he says it's to be read, it's to be read.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.639
And I'm thankful.

00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:44.119
A healthy church is a church that places a priority

00:16:44.119 --> 00:16:45.339
on the scriptures.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.399
The truth of the matter is that when a church

00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:57.079
deviates from God's word, when a church doesn't have

00:16:57.639 --> 00:17:01.040
an emphasis placed upon the preaching and teaching

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.679
of God's word, it really just becomes

00:17:03.679 --> 00:17:07.720
any other kind of club, entertainment.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.239
The reality is that God's given us this book

00:17:10.239 --> 00:17:14.239
and it's profitable and it is to be a priority

00:17:14.239 --> 00:17:15.760
in our church.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:20.760
I love preaching and teaching the Bible, I love the Bible.

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:25.239
And the reality is that I enjoy singing, I love to sing,

00:17:25.239 --> 00:17:28.919
and I love fellowship and prayer and so on and so forth,

00:17:28.919 --> 00:17:32.040
but when we come together, we need to have the preaching

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:36.799
of God's word, because it's God's word that changes life,

00:17:36.799 --> 00:17:38.600
that changes lives.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.760
I remember reading a billboard many years ago

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:45.040
in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, said many books

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.480
can inform, but only the Bible can transform.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:53.559
That was a powerful statement, one that set in my mind

00:17:53.559 --> 00:17:55.919
that I remember all these years later.

00:17:55.919 --> 00:17:59.119
So we find that Paul says, greet all the brethren

00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:03.160
with a holy kiss, this unity that should be evident

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.880
in a church that is a healthy church.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.959
He continues and says, I charge you by the Lord

00:18:08.959 --> 00:18:12.799
that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren,

00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:15.519
a priority that is placed upon the scriptures.

00:18:15.519 --> 00:18:18.600
Number three, in verse number 28, a healthy church

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:23.260
acknowledges their need for God's grace.

00:18:24.139 --> 00:18:26.839
Where would we be without the grace of God?

00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:30.040
Aren't you thankful tonight that our God is gracious?

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.600
Oh, he's so gracious.

00:18:32.599 --> 00:18:35.520
We find that the Bible concludes, as in fact,

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.359
many of the epistles, as you study through

00:18:38.359 --> 00:18:41.279
the New Testament, he says in verse 28,

00:18:41.279 --> 00:18:46.279
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, amen.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.080
We sing Amazing Grace, of course, Don and I haven't been

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.239
here for a number of months now with health issues,

00:18:53.239 --> 00:18:55.880
but Mr. Don's favorite song, Amazing Grace,

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.559
it's got a tie that has the words of the song,

00:18:58.559 --> 00:19:01.279
and I know I've said it before, but anytime you get

00:19:02.039 --> 00:19:05.719
into the 180s, Amazing Grace in our hymnal is 187,

00:19:05.719 --> 00:19:08.000
you sing any other number in the 180s,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.039
and you can hear Mr. Don say, why not 187?

00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:13.320
And, well, because there's some other good songs

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:17.239
in the 180s in our songbook, but the reality is that

00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:19.159
God's grace is amazing.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.020
We ought to be thankful tonight for the grace of God.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.940
We understand tonight that we're saved by grace,

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.979
for by grace are you saved through faith.

00:19:31.979 --> 00:19:34.940
Wow, the saving grace of God.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.260
I'm thankful tonight that our God is gracious.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.400
We find that not only are we saved by grace,

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.380
but we find that it's the grace of God

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.779
that enables us to serve.

00:19:45.779 --> 00:19:48.940
We find that as we were to look through the scriptures,

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.340
as we begin to understand in 1 Corinthians 15,

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.700
in verse number 10, the apostle Paul says,

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:58.059
he says this, by the grace of God, I am what I am.

00:19:58.059 --> 00:20:00.140
We find that as you.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:04.340
and Peter talks about serving, and the spiritual gifts,

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:06.040
as every man hath received the gift,

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.880
even so let him minister.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.520
And then he says this, it's in 1 Peter chapter four

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.780
in verse number 10, if you wanna jot it down.

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:16.880
He says this, as good stewards

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.820
of the manifold grace of God.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.040
God's gifted every believer.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.160
It's a biblical truth.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.880
1 Corinthians deals with it, Romans deals with it.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.800
We find 1 Peter, that Peter's dealing with it.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:36.400
In every believer, if you're born again this evening,

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.120
you have been given a spiritual gift,

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:44.880
and God says that as we understand the spiritual gift

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:49.280
that he has given to us, that we are to be good stewards

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.980
of the manifold grace of God.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.160
I wanna be a good steward of God's grace

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.880
that has been bestowed upon me.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.080
Not simply the saving grace, but again,

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.800
the grace of God that enables us to serve him.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.720
I think about God's grace, and we understand,

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.240
I mentioned a moment ago about it being amazing.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.320
You understand that the Apostle Paul

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.160
in 1 Timothy one, in verse number 14,

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.800
he speaks of the grace of God,

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.840
and he refers to it this way, that it's exceeding abundant.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.240
I like that phraseology.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.240
God's grace is exceeding abundant.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.680
But I want you to think about this aspect as well,

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.080
when we consider that a healthy church

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.780
acknowledges their need for God's grace.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.720
We understand that it's God's grace that saves us,

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.760
it's God's grace that enables us.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.400
Again, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15, 10,

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.120
but by the grace of God, I am what I am.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.640
See, God's grace has been bestowed upon us.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.480
He continues and says this in that verse of scripture

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.760
in 1 Corinthians 15, 10, and his grace,

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.900
which was bestowed upon me, was not in vain,

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.440
but I labored more abundantly than they all,

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.640
yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.560
And so we think about the coupling of this truth

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.460
in Paul's testimony in 1 Corinthians 15, 10,

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.680
coupled with 1 Peter four in verse number 10

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.240
that we're to be good stewards

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.080
of the manifold grace of God.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.340
I believe that the Apostle Paul was a good steward

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.460
of the grace of God that had been bestowed upon him.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.060
This evening, we too must be good stewards.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:29.180
We recognize that where would we be

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:31.300
without the grace of God?

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.960
I mean, we understand that we wouldn't be saved

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.820
without the grace of God,

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:39.660
but then you think about his grace that enables us to serve.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.860
How could we serve him without his grace?

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.660
A healthy church recognizes,

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.300
acknowledges their need for God's grace,

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.780
and I believe that's why the Apostle Paul closes

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:54.500
so many of the epistles with the reminder

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.900
of the grace of God, be with you,

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.700
because it's a reminder that we need God's grace.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.060
We need his grace every day in our lives.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.140
I want you to consider also,

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.980
when we think about the grace of God,

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:12.180
recognize tonight that God's grace is sufficient.

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.740
2 Corinthians chapter 12 is a passage of scripture

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.340
that is familiar to many of us,

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:21.340
and oftentimes we will quote a portion

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.180
of this scripture, of this passage.

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.700
We find that the Apostle Paul

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.460
in 2 Corinthians chapter 12,

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.700
he's giving a testimony,

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.660
and he talks about a vision,

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.260
and this vision that he had,

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.800
and he says in verse number four

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.060
how that he was caught up into paradise

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.980
and heard unspeakable words,

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.740
which it is not lawful for a man to utter.

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.900
Of such in one will I glory,

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.820
yet of myself I will not glory,

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.180
but in mine infirmities, verse six,

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.460
for though I would desire to glory,

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.180
I should not be a fool,

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.420
for I will say the truth,

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.060
but now I forbear,

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.820
lest any man should think of me above that

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.780
which he seeth me to be,

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.900
or that he heareth of me.

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.420
And lest I should be exalted above measure

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:11.260
through the abundance of the revelations.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.740
Notice what Paul says.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.660
He recognizes that he could have got prideful

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.940
because of the abundance of the revelations.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.820
He said in verse six,

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.360
for though I would desire to glory.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.200
Why?

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.980
That's just a fleshly human tendency.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:26.860
When you got saved,

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:27.700
when I got saved,

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:28.700
when Paul got saved,

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.720
the flesh wasn't eradicated.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.820
The flesh has to be crucified,

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:36.140
and so your flesh still has desires,

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:37.380
your flesh still has those,

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.340
and he says though I would desire to glory,

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.100
I should not be a fool.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.580
He says that through these abundance of revelations,

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:48.020
that though and lest I should be exalted above measure

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.420
through the abundance of the revelations,

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:50.260
verse seven,

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.080
notice what he says,

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:55.100
there was given to me a thorn in the flesh.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.060
The messenger of Satan to buff at me,

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:57.900
notice why,

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.900
lest I should be exalted above measure.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.100
Then notice what Paul says in verse number eight.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.740
For this thing,

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:08.860
I besought the Lord thrice,

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:12.580
that it might depart from me.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.820
And Paul was consistent,

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.000
fervent, if you will.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.780
He says I besought the Lord thrice,

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.000
that it might depart from me.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.640
Now, could God have caused this to depart from him?

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:28.860
He can do anything.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.460
Paul is the one that God used to write

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.340
that wonderful promise in Ephesians three,

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:35.340
now unto him,

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.980
which is able to do exceeding abundantly

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:39.000
above all that we ask or think.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:45.100
But notice what God says in verse number nine,

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.140
God's answer to Paul,

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.500
when Paul besought the Lord

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.980
with regard to this thorn in the flesh,

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:57.980
God said my grace is sufficient for thee.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.680
My grace is sufficient for thee.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:07.060
For my strength is made perfect in weakness.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.740
You know, most of us don't physically,

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.200
we don't emotionally,

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:20.240
we don't want to show any vulnerabilities of weakness.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:22.660
Right?

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.480
We don't want that to be perceived by others

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.700
that there's some measure of weakness,

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:33.540
but God says that his strength is made perfect in weakness.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:38.540
He says my grace is sufficient for thee.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.220
God is no respecter of persons.

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.620
And if God's grace was sufficient for Paul,

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.360
God's grace is sufficient for every one of us.

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.620
And we recognize a healthy church,

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:53.660
and remember a healthy church

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:55.740
is made up of healthy individuals.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.740
I mean, a church is made up of people.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.660
The church is not the building, it's the people.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.740
The people are saved and baptized individuals

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:03.880
that make up the church,

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.860
and a healthy church is going to acknowledge

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.700
their need for the grace of God, for God's grace.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.340
Paul says this after he receives the answer

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.600
that God gives at the end of verse number nine,

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:20.600
most gladly therefore will I rather glory

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:25.680
in my infirmities that the power of Christ

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.840
may rest upon me.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.880
Therefore, notice what he says,

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.760
I take pleasure in infirmities,

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.920
in reproaches, in necessities,

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:41.920
in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.460
For when I am weak, then am I strong.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.560
What is it in that moment of weakness

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:50.960
that would make someone strong?

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.360
It's the grace of God.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.160
It's God's strength,

00:27:55.160 --> 00:28:00.080
his strength being made perfect in our weakness

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.240
because his grace is sufficient.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.800
This evening, a healthy church is a unified church.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.040
No schisms, no divisions, a unified church.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.440
Unified because we have no differences

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.580
of background, of personalities.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:22.580
No, unified because we embrace the same truth.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.820
We accept and we believe the same truth

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.660
and therefore God gives us unity.

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:33.500
A healthy church places a priority on the scriptures.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.100
It's God's word that must be taught

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:39.580
and preached and believed, practiced.

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:42.500
As a Baptist, we often will say

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.580
that the Bible is our sole authority

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.940
for faith and practice.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.760
Well, if the Bible is our sole authority

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.280
for faith and practice,

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.640
there must be a priority placed upon the scriptures.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.679
It must be taught, it must be learned,

00:28:58.679 --> 00:29:01.000
it must be understood, it must be applied.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.119
And so we find that a healthy church

00:29:03.119 --> 00:29:04.520
places a priority in the scriptures.

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.540
And number three, these three elements

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.679
that we see in these three concluding verses

00:29:08.679 --> 00:29:11.080
is that a healthy church acknowledges

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.119
their need for God's grace.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.239
By the grace of God, I am what I am.

00:29:16.239 --> 00:29:19.559
Where would we be without God's grace?

00:29:19.559 --> 00:29:21.600
We must acknowledge that we need God's grace

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.320
every day of our lives.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.720
And I'm thankful that God's grace is sufficient,

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.400
that God gives it.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.400
I know I said this a number of weeks ago,

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.720
but sometimes if we're not careful,

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:38.720
we can play these hypothetical mind games.

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.840
And we can put ourselves in a position of,

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:45.220
man, I don't know how I could ever handle such and such.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.080
Maybe you hear of someone that has suffered,

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:53.080
has experienced some tragedy or some just adversity.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.359
And you say, I don't know how I could handle that.

00:29:56.359 --> 00:29:58.320
The reality is that we should not play

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.119
those hypothetical type of mind.

00:30:00.119 --> 00:30:07.679
games because God gives us His grace in the moment that we deal with whatever we deal

00:30:07.679 --> 00:30:09.599
with.

00:30:09.599 --> 00:30:16.259
And we don't have to think about how could we ever, no, no, we trust that God will give

00:30:16.259 --> 00:30:21.839
us the grace in the very moment that we need His grace.

00:30:21.839 --> 00:30:26.799
I don't know if you've ever read Foxe's Book of Martyrs or any portion of it or if you've

00:30:26.799 --> 00:30:30.199
read of any martyrs of the faith.

00:30:30.199 --> 00:30:36.879
But you'll read of individuals that literally are being burned alive singing the praises

00:30:36.879 --> 00:30:38.879
of God.

00:30:38.879 --> 00:30:40.719
How?

00:30:40.719 --> 00:30:51.599
I can't, no, no, in the moment that we need God's grace, God's grace is sufficient.

00:30:51.599 --> 00:30:57.719
I believe that's the only way that you could explain those types of testimonies, that you

00:30:57.719 --> 00:31:09.639
could explain any of those tragic events outside of the grace of God is sufficient.

00:31:09.639 --> 00:31:14.519
And I'm so thankful for that wonderful promise that God has given a healthy church.

00:31:14.519 --> 00:31:18.239
Healthy church is made up of healthy believers.

00:31:18.239 --> 00:31:24.479
Every believer should have the desire to live their life in such a way that God would

00:31:24.479 --> 00:31:25.959
be pleased.

00:31:25.959 --> 00:31:32.479
That we could say, as we've used for the title of this series, walk worthy, please God.

00:31:32.479 --> 00:31:39.319
What a joy that God has given us the instruction so that we know how we can please Him, how

00:31:39.319 --> 00:31:41.759
we ought to walk.

00:31:41.759 --> 00:31:45.099
The church in Thessalonica was given this instruction.

00:31:45.099 --> 00:31:53.779
God graciously has preserved it for us so that we too today can understand how we can

00:31:53.779 --> 00:31:56.459
walk worthy and please God.

00:31:56.459 --> 00:31:57.459
Let's pray together.

00:31:57.459 --> 00:31:58.499
Father, we love you.

00:31:58.499 --> 00:31:59.779
We thank you for loving us.

00:31:59.779 --> 00:32:06.299
We thank you for the privilege that you've given us to hear the gospel.

00:32:06.299 --> 00:32:13.539
God thank you for those that have been faithful before us to deliver the truth, the gospel

00:32:13.539 --> 00:32:15.699
of Jesus Christ.

00:32:15.699 --> 00:32:24.379
Thank you for those that, Lord, suffered greatly, persecution, great adversities, but they continued.

00:32:24.379 --> 00:32:26.699
They remained steadfast.

00:32:26.699 --> 00:32:29.339
Lord, I thank you for my salvation.

00:32:29.339 --> 00:32:32.979
I thank you for those that are gathered this evening that have trusted you as their personal

00:32:32.979 --> 00:32:33.979
Lord and Savior.

00:32:33.979 --> 00:32:43.940
And God, I pray that as we consider the instruction from 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 this evening,

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:50.099
as we conclude that text and consider a healthy church, God, would you help us to take all

00:32:50.099 --> 00:32:56.019
that we've learned over these many weeks and apply it, that we'd be doers of the word and

00:32:56.019 --> 00:33:02.940
not hearers only, that we would be a church that's a healthy church.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:08.500
Lord, that you would use us to reach our community with the gospel, that you'd use us to continue

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:14.459
to support the work of missions, global evangelization.

00:33:14.459 --> 00:33:19.179
Lord, I pray that you'd use us for your honor and for your glory.

00:33:19.179 --> 00:33:20.539
Bless now the time of prayer.

00:33:20.539 --> 00:33:26.299
We thank you for the privilege at the end of our Wednesday night service that we can

00:33:26.299 --> 00:33:30.419
pray together, intercessory prayer, corporate prayer.

00:33:30.419 --> 00:33:32.419
God, we know that you hear and answer.

00:33:32.419 --> 00:33:35.059
You've given us wonderful promises.

00:33:35.059 --> 00:33:38.379
I pray, God, that you would bless our time, that you'd be honored and we'll thank you

00:33:38.379 --> 00:33:39.379
for it.

00:33:39.379 --> 00:33:42.619
In Christ's name we pray, amen.
