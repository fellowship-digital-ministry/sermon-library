WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
Deuteronomy chapter number 6, we'll be back in the book, Lord willing, of Colossians next

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.800
Sunday morning and finishing up the third chapter, entering into the very beginning

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.800
of the fourth chapter.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.399
That'll be next Sunday morning.

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:16.959
This morning, however, we're having a unique opportunity to have a baby dedication.

00:00:16.959 --> 00:00:21.200
In fact, we're going to have three babies that will be dedicated this morning, and that

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.360
is a blessing.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.879
Blake and Vanessa will be coming and having Ethan James to be able to dedicate to the

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.439
Lord, and then Michael and Elizabeth will be coming to have Alice Danielle dedicated

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:39.759
unto the Lord, and then Alfredo and Sharon will be coming to have Artemus James dedicated

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:40.759
unto the Lord.

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:41.759
And so that's a blessing.

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:46.279
Now, that's also a lot of pressure, and the reason why that's a lot of pressure is because

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:50.779
we don't want crying babies up here in just a little while, and so my timeline is maybe

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:55.080
a little bit restricted this morning, but we'll try to do our best and make sure we

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.840
don't have crying babies.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.439
And typically, in the past, every baby dedication that we've had has just been one baby at a

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:04.559
time, and so I've held the baby and all that sort of thing.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.000
Well, I won't be doing that with three, and that is beyond the ability of a dad, amen?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.559
And some moms might be able to figure out how to carry three, but not this dad, and

00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:20.720
I'm thankful that Juliana and Brianna were able to walk before Joseph came along, amen?

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.919
But I'm thankful that these families have expressed their desire to dedicate their children

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.319
to the Lord, but really, when we think about a baby dedication, it's more about their commitment

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:35.760
to bring their children up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.639
The reality is that these children really have no idea what's going on.

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:44.239
They're not aware of all the significance of what we're dealing with this morning, and

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:49.080
perhaps in years to come, they'll have the opportunity to see the certificate, see the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:56.440
Bible, look at a picture, but they themselves, of course, are not aware of the entirety of

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.239
what's taking place, and so the parents, really, the charge is more to them.

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:05.319
As we look at this passage of Scripture in Deuteronomy 6, I trust that not only would

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.000
it be a charge to these families, but really a charge to each and every one of us in helping

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.399
us to understand the blessedness of God's instruction to us as His people.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.320
I want to preach a message that I've simply entitled this morning,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.839
Thou Shalt Teach Thy Children.

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:26.240
Thou shalt teach thy children.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.520
Notice in verse number one of Deuteronomy 6, the Bible says,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.440
Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the Lord your God

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.240
commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it, that

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.919
thou mightest fear the Lord thy God to keep all His statutes and His commandments, which

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:51.039
I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life, and

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:53.800
that thy days may be prolonged.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.720
Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.199
Notice this, that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:08.759
Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey.

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:15.080
Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord, and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.639
all thine heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might.

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.880
And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.759
And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:34.919
thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down,

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.080
and when thou risest up.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.559
And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shalt be as frontlets

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:43.380
between thine eyes.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.240
And thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house, and on thy gates."

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.500
If you're taking notes this morning, I want you to notice, first of all, the importance

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.919
of the instruction.

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:58.000
I believe this morning, as we begin to look at the instruction that is provided here in

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.880
Deuteronomy 6, that we ought to rejoice and thank God that He has been faithful to provide

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.020
us with instruction.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.179
What a blessing to know that the God of the universe, the God of heaven, saw fit to provide

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:13.740
His people with instruction.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.459
Not only did He give it by inspiration, but we understand that He has preserved it, and

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.500
we hold in our hands the perfect Word of God, and it is profitable for us.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.619
And we understand this morning that when we think about the truth that is before us of

00:04:28.619 --> 00:04:33.820
the importance of the instruction, the source of the instruction is what makes it important.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.820
Amen?

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.500
And when we think about the source of this instruction, in verse number one, Moses is

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.940
faithful to distribute to the people of God the Word of God, but you note that he says,

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.940
now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, notice, which the Lord

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.880
your God commanded to teach you.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.380
This is not Moses figuring out for himself what instruction he should give to the children

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.500
of Israel as they prepare to enter into the land of promise.

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:07.619
No, this instruction comes direct from God, the Lord your God, and the source of the instruction

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:11.059
really determines the importance of the instruction.

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:14.260
And I'm thankful this morning that God has given us instruction.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:21.380
You'll notice in verse number one that the Bible says, commandments, statutes, and judgments.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.019
Commandments are laws or precepts.

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:29.739
Really the idea of a commandment is to give orders to provide that command that God has

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:30.739
given us.

00:05:30.739 --> 00:05:37.940
Statutes, really we could look at statutes as being, no doubt, a commandment.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.940
Not all commandments would be statutes, but statutes could fall into the category of being

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:43.940
commandments.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.140
But really it's dealing with the requirement of a prescribed task, and I believe it this

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:54.859
way that it gives us further detail as to how to carry out the command that has been

00:05:54.859 --> 00:05:55.859
given.

00:05:55.859 --> 00:06:00.459
And we find that even if you were to look at the Ten Commandments, that they're provided

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:05.119
to us in very short form in Exodus, chapter number 20, in the first instance.

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:11.600
But then you find that the law, as the statutes are provided, really it's opening up and providing

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:18.059
further instruction as to how to carry out the particular commandment.

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:23.519
And so we see that he says commandments, statutes, and then we notice the word judgments.

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:28.679
And really this is carrying it with it, the idea of a procedure or litigation.

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:33.880
Perhaps we would look at it as being a verdict, the execution of judgment, what happens when

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.579
these commands that God gives, what happens when these commands are broken.

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:42.720
And we find that God provides all of that detail.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:49.440
In the law, we find that the children of Israel had the understanding that here's a command,

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.880
here are statutes that provide further explanation of this command, how to carry it out in your

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:02.000
everyday life, and then if that is broken, here is the judgment, here's what the penalty

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
is for breaking that particular command.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.959
And we find that God has contained that within the Word of God, within the law for the children

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:09.959
of Israel.

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:15.320
I find that as we look at the truth of the Old Testament and look at the law and we continue

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:22.440
to think about us as New Testament believers, that God has clearly communicated to us through

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:28.000
the law being our schoolmaster, as Paul would indicate in the book of Galatians, that we

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.579
are all guilty.

00:07:30.579 --> 00:07:34.839
And the wages of sin is death, and that's what the Bible tells us in Romans chapter

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:35.839
number 6.

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:38.160
And so we find that everything is summed up.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.799
Remember, James says if you offend in one, you're guilty of all with regard to the law.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:49.760
So the judgment as New Testament believers understanding that the penalty, the wages

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.480
of sin, is death.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:58.239
I'm so thankful, even as Jared sang this morning, that the Lord Jesus Christ suffered and bled

00:07:58.239 --> 00:08:05.119
and died on the cross of Calvary to pay the penalty that needed to be paid for mankind

00:08:05.119 --> 00:08:06.799
to be redeemed, amen?

00:08:06.799 --> 00:08:12.420
And what a blessing as we think about that borrowed tomb that was left empty, amen?

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:17.339
He rose from the dead, conquering sin, death, and the grave, and what a blessing that is.

00:08:17.339 --> 00:08:20.739
And notice as we think about the importance of the instruction, he says this in verse

00:08:20.739 --> 00:08:21.739
number 3.

00:08:21.739 --> 00:08:28.859
Hear, therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it, notice, that it may be well with thee.

00:08:28.859 --> 00:08:33.900
I believe this morning that as we look at the instruction, we ought to rejoice and understand

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.780
the importance of the instruction.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:41.979
However, I believe this morning that we can acknowledge with our minds that instruction

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:43.380
has been given.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:49.739
We can even go to the point of acknowledging the importance of the instruction, and yet

00:08:49.739 --> 00:08:53.320
at times, we can set it aside, right?

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.219
We know the instruction's been given.

00:08:55.219 --> 00:08:56.299
It's been provided.

00:08:56.299 --> 00:08:57.619
God has been faithful.

00:08:57.619 --> 00:09:04.380
We understand that it's from God, so it's important, but at times, we can set it aside.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.940
So we see the importance of instruction.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.739
I want you to notice number 2, and really the lengthy part of the message this morning,

00:09:10.739 --> 00:09:14.299
the implementation of instruction.

00:09:14.299 --> 00:09:17.619
I believe this morning that instruction is given to be obeyed.

00:09:17.619 --> 00:09:18.619
Amen?

00:09:18.619 --> 00:09:23.460
When someone provides you with instruction, they are providing you with instruction with

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:30.099
details that if followed, when obeyed, the task can be fulfilled or satisfied.

00:09:30.099 --> 00:09:36.580
Oftentimes, we buy products that may have those little words, some assembly required,

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:41.619
and every time you see those words, you hope that they included the directions, the instructions

00:09:41.619 --> 00:09:47.179
for assembling that piece of furniture or whatever it might be, and then you're able

00:09:47.179 --> 00:09:49.580
to follow those instructions.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.859
And as you follow those instructions, you get to the end, and you find that you have

00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:59.979
a product that looks like, in theory, what the picture was on the box, and you follow

00:09:59.979 --> 00:10:03.919
those instructions. So instructions are given to be obeyed. In fact, in verse

00:10:03.919 --> 00:10:07.959
number one, notice that he says, now these are the commandments, the statutes, and

00:10:07.959 --> 00:10:11.679
the judgments which the Lord your God commanded to teach you. Notice this

00:10:11.679 --> 00:10:20.679
phrase, that ye might do them. Do them in the land whither you go to possess it.

00:10:20.679 --> 00:10:26.199
Later on in the sixth chapter here of this particular book, we find that in

00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:30.899
verse number 24, he concludes with saying this, and the Lord commanded us to do all

00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:37.859
these statutes to fear the Lord our God. Notice this phrase, for our good always,

00:10:37.859 --> 00:10:44.499
that he might preserve us alive as it is at this day. And it shall be our

00:10:44.499 --> 00:10:47.739
righteousness if we deserve to do all these commandments before the Lord our

00:10:47.739 --> 00:10:53.939
God as he hath commanded us. And I'm thankful that God has given it to us for

00:10:53.939 --> 00:10:58.679
our benefit, and that helps us to understand the importance of implementing

00:10:58.679 --> 00:11:02.519
the instruction that has been given. I believe that first we must acknowledge

00:11:02.519 --> 00:11:08.819
this morning the necessity to implement the instruction in our own lives, in our

00:11:08.819 --> 00:11:12.199
own lives. You know, it's really a difficulty when you try to instruct

00:11:12.199 --> 00:11:16.599
someone to do something that you're not actively doing. We're speaking about

00:11:16.599 --> 00:11:21.319
living life and following the instruction, and you begin to try to

00:11:21.339 --> 00:11:25.979
communicate to someone, whether it's a child or otherwise, you begin to instruct

00:11:25.979 --> 00:11:31.139
them on how they should behave or what they should do, but you yourself are not

00:11:31.139 --> 00:11:35.899
implementing that same body of instruction, that same body of truth in

00:11:35.899 --> 00:11:42.499
your own life, the effectiveness of your instruction can fail miserably. And so we

00:11:42.499 --> 00:11:47.419
must acknowledge that in these first six verses of Deuteronomy 6, that really the

00:11:47.439 --> 00:11:52.239
necessity, the responsibility to implement the instruction is first in

00:11:52.239 --> 00:11:57.799
the lives of these that Moses is directly speaking to, of course, that God

00:11:57.799 --> 00:12:03.639
is giving this instruction to. We note the instruction, it says, to teach you, in

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:09.239
verse number one, that ye might do them in the land whither you go to possess it,

00:12:09.239 --> 00:12:15.159
that thou mightest fear the Lord thy God. Notice it talks about the perpetuity in

00:12:15.159 --> 00:12:19.259
verse number two, but if you continue in verse number three, it says, hear therefore

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:26.139
O Israel, and observe to do it, that it may be well with thee, and that ye may

00:12:26.139 --> 00:12:31.699
increase mightily. Look at verse number five, and thou shalt love the Lord

00:12:31.699 --> 00:12:36.139
thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might, and

00:12:36.139 --> 00:12:44.019
these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart. The

00:12:44.019 --> 00:12:50.719
necessity of first implementing God's Word in our own lives. Those that teach

00:12:50.719 --> 00:12:56.139
the Word of God ought to be doers of the Word of God. We find that, as James would

00:12:56.139 --> 00:13:01.239
say this in the book of James, that we are to be doers of the Word, not hearers

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:07.039
only. I'm mindful of how the book of Acts begins as, what a great book, providing

00:13:07.039 --> 00:13:11.439
us with the history of the early church, but it begins by telling us this of the

00:13:11.439 --> 00:13:16.379
Lord Jesus Christ, the former treaties have I made, O Theophilus, of all that

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:23.979
Jesus began both to do and teach. We find that Paul would later say to the

00:13:23.979 --> 00:13:27.379
believers in Philippi, when he's instructing them and as he's giving

00:13:27.379 --> 00:13:32.299
them that final bit of instruction in Philippians chapter number four, he says

00:13:32.299 --> 00:13:36.859
those things which he have both learned and received and heard, and then he says

00:13:36.859 --> 00:13:45.439
this, and seen in me do, and the God of peace shall be with you. So we find the

00:13:45.439 --> 00:13:51.839
necessity of implementing this truth, this instruction in our own lives, how

00:13:51.839 --> 00:13:59.359
important it is that when our lives are observed that people see that

00:13:59.359 --> 00:14:06.619
our walk matches our talk. I read a sign not long ago, everyone seems like in the

00:14:06.619 --> 00:14:09.859
last 18 months that they've gotten serious about washing their hands. I've

00:14:09.859 --> 00:14:14.479
washed my hands all the time, amen? And man, I always am washing my hands, but I

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:20.019
was in a particular facility and I saw a sign and it said this, wash your

00:14:20.019 --> 00:14:24.139
hands like your mom's watching. And I thought, well that's kind of interesting.

00:14:24.139 --> 00:14:28.639
And you know, the reality is that we're to live our lives understanding that

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:33.859
people are watching us. Not only does God see everything and we're to live a life

00:14:33.859 --> 00:14:37.419
that's holy and pleasing to our Savior, but we understand this morning that

00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:41.379
there are people watching us. There are little eyes that are observing us and

00:14:41.379 --> 00:14:46.219
how vital it is that we would take the truth of God's Word. By the way, this

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:50.539
isn't just for parents. You say, man, I don't have any children, I can go to

00:14:50.539 --> 00:14:53.939
sleep on this message. No, no, my children are already raised, I can go to sleep on

00:14:53.939 --> 00:14:59.099
this message. No, no, this truth is to be implemented in our lives as individuals

00:14:59.099 --> 00:15:03.739
and then we see the application of teaching our children, for those that

00:15:03.739 --> 00:15:08.339
have children that are still in that circumstance of being able to train them

00:15:08.339 --> 00:15:14.699
and teach them. But how vital it is that we live this book, that we are people of

00:15:14.699 --> 00:15:19.219
the book. Notice as we think about the implementation of the instruction that we

00:15:19.219 --> 00:15:24.859
finally get to verse number seven where the Bible says this, and thou, so they've

00:15:24.899 --> 00:15:29.299
received the instruction, they understand the importance of the instruction, they

00:15:29.299 --> 00:15:33.859
understand and are implementing it in their own lives, and thou shalt teach

00:15:33.859 --> 00:15:41.739
them diligently unto thy children. I like that he uses the word diligently unto

00:15:41.739 --> 00:15:45.819
thy children. In fact, as we look at the remainder of verse number seven and even

00:15:45.819 --> 00:15:50.539
in verses eight and nine, you'll see the significance of what it means to do

00:15:50.539 --> 00:15:55.619
something diligently, and you'll see the the explanation that is provided in

00:15:55.619 --> 00:16:01.099
giving further detail to what it means to teach it diligently unto thy children.

00:16:01.099 --> 00:16:06.339
No doubt God could have ended verse number seven with a period at the end of

00:16:06.339 --> 00:16:10.339
thy children and just left us with the instruction that were to teach

00:16:10.339 --> 00:16:16.059
diligently these commandments, statutes, and judgments to our children, but yet he

00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:24.099
graciously provides us with what it looks like, practically speaking, to teach

00:16:24.099 --> 00:16:31.059
diligently these commandments, statutes, and judgments to our children. Notice

00:16:31.059 --> 00:16:36.139
there really are six references that are given in verses seven, eight, and nine with

00:16:36.139 --> 00:16:41.499
regard to what it looks like to to teach diligently. In verse number seven it says

00:16:41.499 --> 00:16:42.499
this,

00:16:42.499 --> 00:16:47.659
"...and shalt talk of them," talk of what? Talk of the commandments, the statutes, and

00:16:47.659 --> 00:16:52.579
the judgments. This that has been provided, the instruction, "...thou shalt talk of them,

00:16:52.579 --> 00:16:59.659
number one, when thou sittest in thine house." No doubt as we think about this in

00:16:59.659 --> 00:17:03.739
the home and the significance in the home and the importance of teaching the

00:17:03.739 --> 00:17:09.259
Word of God in the home, perhaps in view here when it speaks about when thou

00:17:09.419 --> 00:17:14.899
sittest in thine house, the idea of perhaps mealtime, having that opportunity

00:17:14.899 --> 00:17:21.299
during mealtime to teach diligently, to seize that opportunity, to teach the

00:17:21.299 --> 00:17:25.219
commandments, the statutes, and the judgments. There was a time in American

00:17:25.219 --> 00:17:32.019
history, and perhaps that time has has not been so much the case in recent

00:17:32.019 --> 00:17:36.539
years, where families had dinner together. They all just kind of got around

00:17:36.659 --> 00:17:41.139
the table and had a meal together, and it seems like the busyness of schedules and

00:17:41.139 --> 00:17:45.659
all that takes place in our society today, that Johnny has practice here and

00:17:45.659 --> 00:17:48.859
Susie has practice over here, and they got this thing and that thing, and

00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:54.939
sometimes that mealtime, that family gathering time, is a missing element in

00:17:54.939 --> 00:18:00.499
our homes today. But what a blessed opportunity to teach the commandments,

00:18:00.499 --> 00:18:05.739
the statutes, and the judgments, the instruction that God has provided. Notice

00:18:05.739 --> 00:18:10.179
he continues in verse number 7, he says, and shalt talk of them, not only when

00:18:10.179 --> 00:18:15.739
thou sittest in thine house, but number two, when thou walkest by the way. I think

00:18:15.739 --> 00:18:21.059
of this as really being the daily life, the routine, and the things that we

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:27.779
must take and take care of and minister to. I think about perhaps travel time

00:18:27.779 --> 00:18:32.459
when thou walkest, and of course we know the mode of transportation would be that

00:18:32.619 --> 00:18:37.179
thou walkest by the way. Many of these folks, of course, as you would begin to

00:18:37.179 --> 00:18:40.659
think about their time as they would enter into the land that God had

00:18:40.659 --> 00:18:44.659
promised them, that this instruction is being provided for them, many would have

00:18:44.659 --> 00:18:48.279
fields that they would have to care for. Many would have livestock that they

00:18:48.279 --> 00:18:53.019
would have to tend to. And when thou walkest, not only do you take the

00:18:53.019 --> 00:18:58.179
opportunity as a father, perhaps, to take your sons and to teach them how to take

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:02.699
care of the livestock and how to tend to all that the family has to take care

00:19:02.699 --> 00:19:07.699
of, but at the same time you're teaching them the commandments, the statutes, and

00:19:07.699 --> 00:19:13.859
the judgments when thou walkest in the way. And we think about the importance of

00:19:13.859 --> 00:19:18.820
this truth of just really, as we summarize, as we'll get to the end here,

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:24.699
it's really this truth of diligently seizing those opportunities and teaching

00:19:24.739 --> 00:19:29.779
the Word of God. Notice he continues and says, not only when thou sittest in thine

00:19:29.779 --> 00:19:35.059
house and when thou walkest by the way, number three, when thou liest down, when

00:19:35.059 --> 00:19:41.179
thou liest down. Bedtime. And you think about the importance of having the time

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:45.739
of devotion. Perhaps there are some, as families, that would have family devotion

00:19:45.739 --> 00:19:50.260
in the morning. For us, for all of the years of family devotions, we do our

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.859
family devotions in the evening. And the reason we do family devotions in the

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:57.219
evening is because we all have different schedules in the morning, and

00:19:57.219 --> 00:20:01.979
therefore we have family devotions in the evening.

00:20:01.979 --> 00:20:07.179
and we have that opportunity prior to bedtime that we're going to take some

00:20:07.179 --> 00:20:12.859
time and discuss the truth of God's Word and pray together as a family when thou

00:20:12.859 --> 00:20:18.419
liest down. Of course, we find the last part of verse number seven, it

00:20:18.419 --> 00:20:24.719
says, and when thou risest up. Now you think about this, not only the

00:20:24.719 --> 00:20:27.499
morning time that's given to us at the end of verse number seven, but when you

00:20:27.499 --> 00:20:32.779
really think about the entirety of verse number seven, when thou sittest in thine

00:20:32.779 --> 00:20:38.339
house, when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

00:20:38.339 --> 00:20:46.039
You know what he's saying? All the time. Thou shalt teach them, what's them? The

00:20:46.039 --> 00:20:49.779
commandments, the statutes, and the judgments. Thou shalt teach them

00:20:49.779 --> 00:20:54.979
diligently unto thy children. How do we teach them diligently? We're engaged in

00:20:54.979 --> 00:20:58.739
it all the time. We're seizing opportunities that present themselves to

00:20:58.739 --> 00:21:04.819
us as we would teach them the truth of God's Word, providing them understanding

00:21:04.819 --> 00:21:08.379
that the instruction that God has provided us with, that we in like manner

00:21:08.379 --> 00:21:12.939
want to provide that instruction to them, understanding that this is the Word of

00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:19.979
God. He continues in verse number eight, and he tells us this, and thou shalt bind

00:21:19.979 --> 00:21:25.619
them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine

00:21:25.619 --> 00:21:29.939
eyes. I think that it's very similar to what we see here in verse number six,

00:21:29.939 --> 00:21:33.779
where the Bible says, in these words which I command thee this day, notice

00:21:33.779 --> 00:21:39.259
what it says, shall be in thine heart. Do you remember what the psalmist said in Psalm 119?

00:21:39.259 --> 00:21:43.059
He answers the question that is asked in verse number 11, wherewithal shall a

00:21:43.059 --> 00:21:47.019
young man cleanse his way? We find that he says, by taking heed thereto according

00:21:47.019 --> 00:21:52.659
to thy word, thy word have I hid in mine heart that I might not sin against thee.

00:21:52.659 --> 00:21:58.019
And we find that really, when we think about the impact of verse six and

00:21:58.019 --> 00:22:01.699
verse number eight, and the implementation of the instruction that's provided, is

00:22:01.699 --> 00:22:05.459
that it would be in our hearts. In other words, that it would be continually before

00:22:05.459 --> 00:22:11.179
us. The Jewish custom or practice would be this thing of phylacteries that you

00:22:11.179 --> 00:22:14.379
read about even during the time of the Lord Jesus Christ, where they would

00:22:14.379 --> 00:22:19.899
literally wear scripture on them. On their person, on their robes, on their

00:22:19.899 --> 00:22:24.819
garments, they would literally wear scripture. And oftentimes when you read

00:22:24.819 --> 00:22:29.019
about the interactions that the Lord Jesus Christ would have with some of

00:22:29.019 --> 00:22:33.099
those individuals that he interacted with during his earthly ministry, and he

00:22:33.099 --> 00:22:38.459
would say something about what this means, really he's pointing to them

00:22:38.459 --> 00:22:43.859
wearing scripture, and they don't even know what it means. It's not just an

00:22:43.859 --> 00:22:49.659
outward action that we're taking, it's not just some type of religious roe

00:22:49.659 --> 00:22:55.539
activity. No, that we've taken this instruction, we've understood that it's

00:22:55.539 --> 00:22:59.739
the source, it's God's instruction, we've understood the importance, the

00:22:59.739 --> 00:23:03.619
significance of the instruction, and we say we want this to be in our heart,

00:23:03.619 --> 00:23:08.939
we want it to be continually before us. We've sought to

00:23:08.939 --> 00:23:13.139
diligently teach it when thou sittest, when thou walkest, when thou liest, when

00:23:13.179 --> 00:23:18.699
thou risest. I mean, all of the time we're seeking to give and to implement the

00:23:18.699 --> 00:23:23.179
instruction that has been provided. We see in verse number nine that he says,

00:23:23.179 --> 00:23:30.619
and thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house and on thy gates. You think

00:23:30.619 --> 00:23:36.179
about this truth in verse number nine of really, again, this visible reminder, the

00:23:36.179 --> 00:23:42.259
idea of it being on our walls. And many, I know, have had scripture posted

00:23:42.579 --> 00:23:47.499
in their homes, on their walls, and it's that reminder. And you think about the

00:23:47.499 --> 00:23:52.579
significance and the impact of being able to go through a home and go

00:23:52.579 --> 00:23:56.899
through your home and your children, hearing you give them the instruction,

00:23:56.899 --> 00:24:01.659
but then visibly seeing the reminder as perhaps they would walk through the home,

00:24:01.659 --> 00:24:06.139
as they would leave the house, and they would see visibly the scripture that's

00:24:06.139 --> 00:24:13.259
posted upon the walls. It's so important because it's God's instruction. And we

00:24:13.259 --> 00:24:16.179
think about the implementation of the instruction, and we think about the

00:24:16.179 --> 00:24:20.979
responsibility that is given, what great responsibility. I mean, really, when we

00:24:20.979 --> 00:24:25.939
consider the mandate, the instruction that has been given here, we understand

00:24:25.939 --> 00:24:31.819
even, as I said on Wednesday evening, that God has commissioned, God has given the

00:24:31.819 --> 00:24:36.779
responsibility of teaching children to their parents. There is no other

00:24:36.779 --> 00:24:41.019
individual, there is no other organization that has been given the

00:24:41.019 --> 00:24:46.499
responsibility of teaching our children. By the way, that's not popular in our

00:24:46.499 --> 00:24:50.739
society today. There are some that are in government positions, some that are

00:24:50.739 --> 00:24:56.259
running for office, that do not believe that you as a parent have any say over

00:24:56.259 --> 00:25:04.819
what your children are taught. But God, in His Word, says, thou shalt teach them

00:25:04.819 --> 00:25:13.779
diligently unto thy children. Children are an heritage of the Lord. Amen? God has

00:25:13.779 --> 00:25:19.579
blessed and given the fruit of the womb as His reward, and we find that as He's

00:25:19.579 --> 00:25:24.899
given children, He's given responsibility. And that responsibility is ours. By the

00:25:24.899 --> 00:25:28.979
way, I believe this morning with all of my heart that we're gonna give an

00:25:28.979 --> 00:25:34.499
account for how we teach our children, for how we raise our children, for how we

00:25:34.499 --> 00:25:37.699
instruct them. Now, you can't force your kids to do anything. When they're

00:25:37.699 --> 00:25:40.579
real little, you can force them to do some things, but there comes a time when

00:25:40.579 --> 00:25:45.619
you can't force your children to do something. Amen? Some of you that have

00:25:45.619 --> 00:25:48.339
older kids, can you help me out? You can't force your kids to do anything

00:25:48.339 --> 00:25:54.099
anymore, right? Blake, your parents are sitting there, but man, it ain't gonna

00:25:54.099 --> 00:25:58.899
happen like it did when you were two, right? And the reality is that there

00:25:58.899 --> 00:26:04.539
comes a time where they have their own responsibility and accountability, and

00:26:04.539 --> 00:26:08.139
they're going to answer for their decisions, but we as parents, we have a

00:26:08.139 --> 00:26:13.459
great responsibility. And God's not gonna let us off the hook by simply saying,

00:26:13.459 --> 00:26:20.219
well, we left that for fill-in-the-blank, whoever that for is. No, no, God said, I

00:26:20.219 --> 00:26:24.819
gave you the responsibility. And in giving you the responsibility, you're

00:26:24.819 --> 00:26:31.539
accountable for that. Now, we may choose to have a variety of methodologies for

00:26:31.539 --> 00:26:36.299
how our children would be educated, but we must understand that we play a vital

00:26:36.299 --> 00:26:41.059
role in that education process. And you understand this morning that even as I

00:26:41.059 --> 00:26:44.739
started that message or that series on Wednesday evening, and I'll be sending

00:26:44.739 --> 00:26:48.579
out an email tomorrow, I hope that you'd be, if you're not here on Wednesday

00:26:48.579 --> 00:26:51.979
night, and I wish you would be, that you would at least tune in on Wednesday

00:26:51.979 --> 00:26:55.979
night, so starting a series on the danger of deception. I believe that we are

00:26:55.979 --> 00:27:00.179
living in an age of deception. And here's the reality, I said it on Wednesday

00:27:00.179 --> 00:27:04.379
night, the thing that infuriates me about that truth is that they're starting with

00:27:04.379 --> 00:27:10.699
the kids this age. And they're indoctrinating them. And then they want

00:27:10.699 --> 00:27:14.579
to attack you for trying to teach them this book and say, you're just

00:27:14.579 --> 00:27:20.859
indoctrinating your kids, so it's better to let you indoctrinate my kids? Oh, we're

00:27:20.859 --> 00:27:25.339
living in an age of deception. And how important it is that we understand this

00:27:25.339 --> 00:27:30.259
morning that the implementation of the instruction that God has given us,

00:27:30.259 --> 00:27:38.219
first in our lives, but then as we would then take and actively teach our

00:27:38.499 --> 00:27:44.939
children. Diligently teach our children. I want you to notice with me the, number

00:27:44.939 --> 00:27:50.899
three, if you're taking notes, the impact of this instruction. What's the impact?

00:27:50.899 --> 00:27:58.259
Well, notice in verse number two, he says this, that thou mightest fear the Lord

00:27:58.259 --> 00:28:03.099
thy God. By the way, it's a good thing to fear God. Our God is a consuming fire.

00:28:03.099 --> 00:28:08.099
Amen? It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of an angry God. He is the judge

00:28:08.099 --> 00:28:13.419
of the universe. And I'm so thankful that he's given us instruction. And yes,

00:28:13.419 --> 00:28:18.179
that we have a godly fear and a godly reverence of who our God is. And as we

00:28:18.179 --> 00:28:23.019
take the instruction that he's given to us and we implement it in our lives, we

00:28:23.019 --> 00:28:28.139
don't have to fear the judgment of God. Isn't that a blessing? You know, how many

00:28:28.139 --> 00:28:32.819
times you see people that are driving down the highway and they see a Virginia

00:28:32.819 --> 00:28:37.059
State police officer, they see a county police officer, and all of a sudden, man,

00:28:37.059 --> 00:28:39.539
they're hitting their brakes and they're changing all of their behavior. Why?

00:28:39.539 --> 00:28:42.899
Because they're fearful of what the consequences are going to be of their

00:28:42.899 --> 00:28:46.739
disobedience to the law. But if you're not disobeying the law and you're

00:28:46.739 --> 00:28:49.099
driving, you don't have to hit your brakes when you're driving down the

00:28:49.099 --> 00:28:53.539
highway. You just keep on going. By the way, I've heard from some that are in

00:28:53.539 --> 00:28:57.019
that profession that when you hit your brakes and change your behavior, it makes

00:28:57.019 --> 00:29:01.859
you look more guilty. And that is the case, is it not? Because you're trying to

00:29:01.859 --> 00:29:08.459
hide something. But I don't have to fear when I've taken the truth that God has

00:29:08.459 --> 00:29:13.859
given, the instruction, and I've sought to diligently implement it in my own life

00:29:13.859 --> 00:29:18.899
and diligently instruct those that God has given to me to instruct. And I

00:29:18.899 --> 00:29:22.380
see the impact, not only will it be a fear, but it says this, to keep all his

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:28.059
statutes and his commandments, notice this, which I command thee, thou and thy

00:29:28.059 --> 00:29:35.139
son and thy son's son. The impact is generational. It's a generational impact.

00:29:35.139 --> 00:29:40.059
And by the way, it's supposed to be that way. You notice at the end of verse

00:29:40.059 --> 00:29:45.019
number six, it says this, all the days of thy life. There never comes a time where

00:29:45.019 --> 00:29:47.940
you say, I've arrived and I don't have to worry about implementing these things

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:53.179
anymore. No, no. Every day of our lives until we take that final breath here and

00:29:53.179 --> 00:29:57.579
we enter into the presence of our Savior, we must implement the truth that is

00:29:57.579 --> 00:30:03.779
given. And then it says this, and that thy days may...

00:30:03.779 --> 00:30:08.399
prolonged. Again, verse number three, I mentioned it earlier. Here, therefore, O

00:30:08.399 --> 00:30:12.679
Israel, and observe to do it that it may be well with thee, what we read in verse

00:30:12.679 --> 00:30:17.819
number 24, for our good always. Listen, the impact of this instruction, it's

00:30:17.819 --> 00:30:23.239
positive for us, it is beneficial for us. As Peter says, ye do well that ye take

00:30:23.239 --> 00:30:29.279
heed thereunto. It is in your best interest and in my best interest to obey

00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:34.999
the instruction that has been provided. The impact is given here, it's

00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:40.519
generational, as we see in verse number two, it's beneficial as it will be well

00:30:40.519 --> 00:30:44.039
with us. And I want you to think about the generational aspect of this

00:30:44.039 --> 00:30:47.959
particular instruction. Turn over to the book of Psalms, if you will, and then

00:30:47.959 --> 00:30:52.039
we'll close with a New Testament truth as well. But look at Psalm 78, if you will,

00:30:52.039 --> 00:30:57.839
and I want you to notice the first several verses of this great chapter. You

00:30:57.839 --> 00:31:01.919
know, the Bible has been given to us, and we can see not only

00:31:01.919 --> 00:31:06.959
through Bible history the failure of God's people to implement truth and to

00:31:06.959 --> 00:31:12.159
instruct a future generation, but we can see that even in contemporary history. We

00:31:12.159 --> 00:31:16.919
can find that as we have failed as the people of God to do what God has

00:31:16.919 --> 00:31:21.599
instructed us to do, that the consequences are grave. Do you remember

00:31:21.599 --> 00:31:26.719
that in the book of Joshua, we see the the great account of God's blessing and

00:31:26.719 --> 00:31:31.759
the entrance into the conquering of, the division of, and the inhabiting of the

00:31:31.759 --> 00:31:36.079
land, and what great truth is given to us in the book of Joshua? And then you open

00:31:36.079 --> 00:31:39.199
up into the book of Judges and you find that there's another generation that rose

00:31:39.199 --> 00:31:44.599
up that knew not the Lord. Wow. What sad commentary that is in the book of

00:31:44.599 --> 00:31:48.959
Judges, that there would be a generation that would rise up that did

00:31:48.959 --> 00:31:54.839
not know the Lord. They failed to give and to obey the instruction that is

00:31:54.839 --> 00:31:58.799
provided here in Deuteronomy 6 and Psalm 78. Notice what the Bible says,

00:31:58.799 --> 00:32:04.799
give ear, O my people, to my law. Incline your ears to the words of my mouth. I

00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:10.079
will open my mouth in a parable. I will utter dark sayings of old, which we have

00:32:10.079 --> 00:32:13.439
heard and known and our fathers have told us. Notice in verse number four, we

00:32:13.439 --> 00:32:18.839
will not hide them from their children, showing to the generation to come the

00:32:18.839 --> 00:32:25.319
praises of the Lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he hath

00:32:25.319 --> 00:32:31.239
done. Who's gonna teach our children how great God is? We better know how great

00:32:31.239 --> 00:32:35.719
God is and we better get busy teaching our children how great our God is. Amen?

00:32:35.719 --> 00:32:41.399
How do we discover the greatness of God? Through his word. He's revealed to us so

00:32:41.399 --> 00:32:46.039
many of his mighty acts and what a blessing to think about the the might

00:32:46.079 --> 00:32:51.439
and power and greatness of our God, but then we must declare his greatness. You

00:32:51.439 --> 00:32:54.959
understand that the schoolhouse and the White House and the Congress and

00:32:54.959 --> 00:32:59.439
Hollywood, they're not going to teach our children how great God is. No, on the

00:32:59.439 --> 00:33:06.159
contrary, they're going to attack the person of Jesus Christ. So we see that it

00:33:06.159 --> 00:33:10.239
says in verse number five, for he established a testimony in Jacob and

00:33:10.239 --> 00:33:14.639
appointed a law in Israel which he commanded our fathers that they should

00:33:14.639 --> 00:33:21.279
make them known to their children. Why? What's the what's the impact? Remember

00:33:21.279 --> 00:33:26.119
it's generational. That the generation to come in verse number six might know them,

00:33:26.119 --> 00:33:30.839
even the children which should be born who should arise and declare them to

00:33:30.839 --> 00:33:36.799
their children, that they might set their hope in God and not forget the works of

00:33:36.799 --> 00:33:45.679
God, but keep his commandments. Wow. God's given us the instruction. He's

00:33:45.679 --> 00:33:49.999
provided us with a pattern of how we're supposed to behave and how we're

00:33:49.999 --> 00:33:53.559
supposed to operate and how we're supposed to to give this truth to a

00:33:53.559 --> 00:33:59.079
future generation and how when we follow the instruction that God has given, we

00:33:59.079 --> 00:34:05.079
implement in our lives, we take heed to the truth of how we would

00:34:05.079 --> 00:34:09.879
further propagate these instructions, these commandments and statutes and

00:34:09.879 --> 00:34:14.639
judgments, that we find that the impact will be that this generation would set

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:20.239
their hope in God. By the way, don't you want a generation to believe God? To have

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:27.519
faith that God is able to set their hope in God? We find that it says this, and not

00:34:27.519 --> 00:34:35.839
forget the works of God, but keep his commandments. What a blessing it is when

00:34:35.839 --> 00:34:42.279
you see the generational impact that this instruction can have upon

00:34:42.279 --> 00:34:47.239
generations to come where they're still doing and still following and

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:51.839
still obeying and still heeding to the instruction of God's Word. What a

00:34:51.839 --> 00:34:56.679
blessing. Look at 2nd Timothy chapter number three in closing this morning and

00:34:56.679 --> 00:35:05.479
2nd Timothy chapter number three, I want you to notice that Paul is speaking

00:35:05.479 --> 00:35:12.519
here of course to Timothy, his son in the faith, and he begins really by providing

00:35:12.519 --> 00:35:17.719
us with an interesting piece of historical data in the first chapter of

00:35:17.719 --> 00:35:22.119
2nd Timothy when he tells us this in verse number five, when I call to

00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:28.119
remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, so in Timothy, which dwelt first

00:35:28.119 --> 00:35:33.599
in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that in thee

00:35:33.599 --> 00:35:38.559
also. Do you see the generational impact there? He says, listen, Paul says, I'm

00:35:38.559 --> 00:35:43.359
thankful when I call to remembrance your unfeigned faith. He says, but

00:35:43.359 --> 00:35:48.959
understand, I recognize that it dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and then

00:35:48.959 --> 00:35:55.359
in your mother Eunice and now in thee also. The passage that I had you turn to

00:35:55.359 --> 00:35:59.159
in chapter number three and beginning in verse number 14, Paul says this, but

00:35:59.159 --> 00:36:04.359
continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and has been assured of,

00:36:04.359 --> 00:36:09.599
knowing of whom thou hast learned them, and notice in verse number 15, and that

00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:18.439
from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures. From a child. Well, the

00:36:18.439 --> 00:36:23.919
impact that we read of in chapter number one of his mother and grandmother

00:36:23.919 --> 00:36:30.039
instructing him in the Holy Scriptures. We mentioned about the importance of the

00:36:30.039 --> 00:36:34.479
instruction, that we recognize that it was from God, the source determines the

00:36:34.479 --> 00:36:40.439
importance, and in Deuteronomy 6, Moses said, which the Lord your God commanded

00:36:40.439 --> 00:36:44.999
to teach you. Here we find that it says that from a child thou hast known

00:36:44.999 --> 00:36:55.239
the Holy Scriptures. What makes them holy? They're gods. God breathed inspiration.

00:36:55.239 --> 00:37:02.039
You see in the next verse, all Scripture is given by inspiration of God. The

00:37:02.039 --> 00:37:09.719
source is God. The understanding is that they're holy scriptures. Why? Because

00:37:09.719 --> 00:37:16.239
they come from a holy God. Amen? I'm thankful that our God is holy. In fact,

00:37:16.239 --> 00:37:19.679
we're instructed in the book of Psalms that we're to give thanks, the

00:37:19.679 --> 00:37:26.839
remembrance of his holiness. Our God is not becoming holy, he is holy. We read it

00:37:26.839 --> 00:37:30.399
in the book of Leviticus, we read in the book of 1st Peter when he says, I am

00:37:30.399 --> 00:37:35.719
holy, therefore you're to be holy. Be you holy as I am holy. We read that

00:37:35.759 --> 00:37:40.159
instruction. So we find that he says that from a child thou hast known the Holy

00:37:40.159 --> 00:37:43.919
Scriptures, and then notice this, which are able to make thee wise unto

00:37:43.919 --> 00:37:51.119
salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. Wow. We think about the

00:37:51.119 --> 00:37:57.059
impact of the the Word of God. These scriptures are holy scriptures, they're

00:37:57.059 --> 00:38:00.919
from God, and you've known them, Timothy, from the time that you were a child

00:38:00.919 --> 00:38:04.319
because of your mother and your grandmother and their faith, and

00:38:04.319 --> 00:38:08.679
they have diligently taught you the truth of the Word of God. And he says

00:38:08.679 --> 00:38:13.239
this, he says that these scriptures, these holy scriptures, are able to make thee

00:38:13.239 --> 00:38:19.039
wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. Aren't you thankful

00:38:19.039 --> 00:38:25.599
that the Word of God teaches us how to be saved? Where would we be without the

00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:30.959
instruction in the Word of God with regard to salvation? I am so thankful. I

00:38:30.999 --> 00:38:34.439
quote it in the beginning of the message, for the wages of sin is death in Romans

00:38:34.439 --> 00:38:39.239
6 and verse 23, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our

00:38:39.239 --> 00:38:43.959
Lord. You read the fifth chapter of the book of Romans and you'll find the

00:38:43.959 --> 00:38:48.679
impact of that disobedience of Adam upon all men, but then you read about the

00:38:48.679 --> 00:38:52.999
obedience of the Lord Jesus Christ and the impact upon all that would trust him

00:38:52.999 --> 00:38:57.999
as Savior. And what a wonderful truth and blessing that is. We continue and see

00:38:57.999 --> 00:39:02.319
that he says in verse 16, all scripture is given by inspiration of God. It is

00:39:02.319 --> 00:39:05.479
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in

00:39:05.479 --> 00:39:10.719
righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all

00:39:10.719 --> 00:39:18.839
good works. I am thankful that God has given us instruction, that God has given

00:39:18.839 --> 00:39:22.759
us commandments and statutes and judgments, that he has been faithful to

00:39:22.799 --> 00:39:28.239
provide us with the truth that we hold in our hands today. And as we understand

00:39:28.239 --> 00:39:33.359
the importance of this truth and the fact that the source causes it to be

00:39:33.359 --> 00:39:39.159
important, that it's from God, it's God's Word. And when I understand the importance

00:39:39.159 --> 00:39:43.239
of it and I find that I must implement it in my own life, that I need to be a

00:39:43.239 --> 00:39:47.919
doer of the Word and not a hearer only, that I need to dig into this book and

00:39:47.919 --> 00:39:51.879
find out what is it that God has for me. What are some commandments and some

00:39:51.999 --> 00:39:55.839
statutes and some judgments? What are some things that God has given me? As I

00:39:55.839 --> 00:40:00.799
look into the truth of God's Word and I allow the Word of God to examine me and

00:40:00.799 --> 00:40:03.759
to show me in my life things that I need to stop doing.

00:40:03.759 --> 00:40:08.199
doing and things that I need to start doing, and I seek to be obedient to His

00:40:08.199 --> 00:40:15.839
Word first in my life. Then as parents, I think about this child dedication today,

00:40:15.839 --> 00:40:21.479
this baby dedication, as parents we have that great responsibility of teaching

00:40:21.479 --> 00:40:27.159
them the commandment, statutes, and judgments, teaching them diligently unto

00:40:27.159 --> 00:40:35.239
our children. Listen, parenting is no easy job. Amen? Those of you that have

00:40:35.239 --> 00:40:39.719
children, parenting is not an easy job.

00:40:40.199 --> 00:40:49.559
Consistency is so vital. There are times, however, when we can be battle-weary, as

00:40:49.559 --> 00:40:54.039
Brother Wagar mentioned in the ministry, but sometimes as parents we can become

00:40:54.039 --> 00:40:58.079
battle-weary. We got all kinds of things going on, life has been thrown at us, it's

00:40:58.079 --> 00:41:02.519
been a tough week, it's been all sorts of, and we just, and I just don't, I just

00:41:02.519 --> 00:41:07.959
don't have the energy for this, but we understand the importance and we pray

00:41:07.959 --> 00:41:13.359
and we ask God to give us the energy and the strength, the determination to teach

00:41:13.359 --> 00:41:18.459
diligently the Word of God to our children. Why? Because we understand the

00:41:18.459 --> 00:41:23.879
impact of the instruction. We understand this morning that as we would teach

00:41:23.879 --> 00:41:30.319
the Word of God, that we would take and give to a future generation, that they

00:41:30.319 --> 00:41:39.359
will set their hope in God. It's our responsibility, and we must grab hold of

00:41:39.359 --> 00:41:45.959
and take seriously the responsibility that is before us, and what a great

00:41:45.959 --> 00:41:52.159
truth that God has given us in His Word. Thou shalt teach thy children. Let's

00:41:52.199 --> 00:41:55.919
pray. Father, we love you, we thank you for loving us, we thank you for the

00:41:55.919 --> 00:41:59.799
opportunity that you've given us to gather together this morning, we thank

00:41:59.799 --> 00:42:03.639
you for the truth of thy Word, and we thank you that you have been faithful to

00:42:03.639 --> 00:42:08.399
provide us with instruction, and what a what a wonderful blessing it is to have

00:42:08.399 --> 00:42:14.199
the Word of God, and that we can open the Scriptures and we can understand what

00:42:14.199 --> 00:42:19.439
you've commanded us, that we can prove what is acceptable unto the Lord, that as

00:42:19.519 --> 00:42:23.999
we find that truth in the book of Ephesians, and we understand the

00:42:23.999 --> 00:42:28.919
importance of proving what is acceptable, that we can allow your Word to be the

00:42:28.919 --> 00:42:35.919
guide and the lamp that you've designed it to be. I pray that a future generation

00:42:35.919 --> 00:42:42.759
would set their hope in God, not forget the works of God, keep His commandments.

00:42:42.759 --> 00:42:47.559
We thank you for these three families that have expressed their desire this

00:42:47.599 --> 00:42:52.479
morning to dedicate their children to thee, Lord, and I thank you for their

00:42:52.479 --> 00:42:57.639
desire to do that, but Lord, we understand in a greater sense the

00:42:57.639 --> 00:43:02.799
commitment that they're making to bring up their children in the nurture and

00:43:02.799 --> 00:43:07.199
admonition of the Lord. I pray for every family that's here, for every individual

00:43:07.199 --> 00:43:10.799
that's present this morning, God would you help us to be doers of the Word and

00:43:10.799 --> 00:43:15.839
not hearers only. We need a return to your Word, we need to understand the

00:43:15.839 --> 00:43:21.119
importance of allowing this book, the truth contained therein, to influence our

00:43:21.119 --> 00:43:27.479
behavior, to guide our steps, no longer being influenced by society and by

00:43:27.479 --> 00:43:35.039
culture, not allowing them to determine right and wrong, but we'd look to your

00:43:35.039 --> 00:43:43.959
Word and determine with clarity what thus saith the Lord, and then follow you.

00:43:44.079 --> 00:43:48.479
I pray that you'd move and work as only you can, for it's in Christ's name we pray,

00:43:48.479 --> 00:43:51.479
amen.
