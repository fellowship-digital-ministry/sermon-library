1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Chapter number 10, verses 26 through 39,

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,960
we're gonna try to finish this 10th chapter this morning.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,760
And I am so thankful for the book of Hebrews.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,239
I'm thankful for the opportunity that we've had so far

5
00:00:12,239 --> 00:00:15,000
in 2020 to study through the book of Hebrews.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,680
And we actually, in this particular passage of scripture,

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,739
we'll end a particular section of the book of Hebrews.

8
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:26,079
We'll end that section dealing with the superiority

9
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:28,159
of the priesthood of the Lord Jesus Christ.

10
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,959
And so as we think about the book of Hebrews

11
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:32,959
and we think about how it proves to us

12
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:35,000
the superiority of Christ,

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,939
we also must acknowledge this morning

14
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:41,599
that it reveals to us that biblical Christianity

15
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:43,400
also is superior.

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,880
Now understand what I mean when I say that

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,599
and don't make any judgments at this point.

18
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:50,520
Let me explain what I mean.

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,520
When we consider the fact that what the writer of Hebrews

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,599
is giving to these original recipients,

21
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:01,000
of course, they were Jewish people that had been saved

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,959
and there was this consideration,

23
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:06,800
this immense amount of pressure to go back to Judaism.

24
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,440
And so throughout the book of Hebrews,

25
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,919
we're finding that Christ is better, he's superior.

26
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:13,559
And we began that in chapter number one,

27
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:16,080
we're going through that and we're dealing with the fact

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,559
that he is superior.

29
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:22,360
And we understand that really the application of such

30
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,000
is therefore, if Christ is superior

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,480
or since Christ is superior,

32
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,440
that biblical Christianity in like fashion is superior.

33
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,599
It is superior than what Judaism could offer you.

34
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,599
It's superior to what that which was a shadow

35
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,239
of good things to come could offer you.

36
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,040
Now we must be careful,

37
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,419
you notice that I use the terminology biblical Christianity.

38
00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:50,059
We must acknowledge this morning

39
00:01:50,059 --> 00:01:52,120
that all that is called Christianity

40
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,360
does not line up with the Bible.

41
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,000
The term is used very loosely.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,239
In fact, many people will use the term Christendom

43
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:01,720
and they'll refer to themselves as being Christians

44
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,720
and Christianity and what have you.

45
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,400
But we understand this morning that is absolutely imperative

46
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,399
that we as Bible believing Christians,

47
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,839
that we follow the instruction given in the word of God

48
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:19,279
and that our beliefs and behavior are aligned properly.

49
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:22,500
Now we understand that as we go through

50
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,179
and looking at the society in which we're living,

51
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:27,100
in fact, you can see it all throughout history,

52
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,539
the church in Corinth faced this

53
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:32,979
and unfortunately they failed miserably.

54
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:34,860
But there's a grave danger

55
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,100
in watering down the clear teachings of God's word.

56
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,660
There is a clear danger in having this understanding

57
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,660
that the enemy would tell us and would like us to believe

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,339
that it would be necessary for us to adapt

59
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:54,740
so that we can be more relevant

60
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,740
and so that we can have a greater impact.

61
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,139
But I say baloney on that, amen?

62
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:03,500
And that's not good Greek nor Hebrew,

63
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,559
but the reality is that as we look at the truth

64
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:10,100
of the word of God, Jesus Christ is the head of the church.

65
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,199
He said that this is my church.

66
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:14,619
He said, I will build my church.

67
00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:17,619
And we understand that there is this pull.

68
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:21,919
There's this constant pull to waver

69
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,800
and to water down and to become more accommodating,

70
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,000
if you will.

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,300
But the reality is that God has called us to be different.

72
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,419
God has called us to make a difference.

73
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:36,839
And we understand that as we look at the truth

74
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:38,059
of the word of God,

75
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:40,919
when we consider biblical Christianity,

76
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,639
that it is imperative that we align

77
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,860
with what God's word teaches.

78
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,119
We do not want to waver

79
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:49,679
from what the clear teaching of God's word is.

80
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:53,919
We must stand where God stands, amen?

81
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:56,380
I understand that's not super popular today.

82
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,759
I understand that today we're living

83
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,320
in the midst of a generation

84
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,119
that wants to be able to waver and move

85
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,080
and sway and so on and so forth

86
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,199
and water down some of the teachings of the word of God,

87
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,220
but we must understand that it is imperative

88
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,919
that we follow the instruction of God's word.

89
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,619
Now, let me say this.

90
00:04:16,619 --> 00:04:19,279
It is important that we understand

91
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:22,019
that yes, Christ is superior,

92
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,140
therefore biblical Christianity is superior,

93
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,619
but we need to be careful

94
00:04:26,619 --> 00:04:29,299
that that perspective does not lead us

95
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:31,660
to a place of pride.

96
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,660
Can I tell you there's a danger in that?

97
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,459
There's a danger in thinking,

98
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:37,059
I'm right, I'm better,

99
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:39,119
I have something that's superior,

100
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:42,220
and therefore we elevate ourselves,

101
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,220
and that's a huge danger.

102
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,519
What we must acknowledge this morning

103
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,000
when we consider the fact

104
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,359
that those that have gone before us

105
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:53,359
have faithfully preached the truth of the word of God

106
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,760
and they've delivered it to us,

107
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,440
and then we have a responsibility

108
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,160
to deliver that to a next generation,

109
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,079
what we do is we don't allow that

110
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,799
to lead us to a place of pride,

111
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:06,880
but it leads us to have grateful hearts.

112
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,880
It leads us to have an understanding

113
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,040
of what our responsibility is.

114
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,880
Amen?

115
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,679
We understand that we live in a world

116
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,359
that's approaching a population

117
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,640
of nearly eight billion people.

118
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,559
It's amazing when you consider

119
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,079
that a vast majority of the number

120
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,920
of inhabitants upon the earth today

121
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,220
have never even heard the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,

122
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,739
nor understood the clear presentation of the gospel.

123
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:38,440
It's becoming more and more common

124
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,239
even here in the United States of America

125
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:43,640
to meet people, to interact with people

126
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,239
that have never heard the truth of God's word.

127
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:51,040
Again, because we understand biblical Christianity,

128
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,119
because we've been saved,

129
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,559
doesn't make us come to this place

130
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:58,660
of having this prideful air about us,

131
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,779
but it should cause us to recognize

132
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:04,480
the deep responsibility that has been given to us

133
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,959
to deliver a message to a lost and dying world.

134
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,040
Remember the principle Jesus taught this,

135
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,000
we find it throughout the word of God,

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,640
to whom much is given, much is required.

137
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,519
Amen?

138
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,320
As we think about these believers

139
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,320
that are being written to and we consider

140
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,440
all that has gone through in this particular section

141
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,079
that we've been studying for a number of weeks now,

142
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,920
really beginning in chapter number five,

143
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,880
with the superiority of the priesthood

144
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,399
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

145
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,959
we conclude that section here this morning

146
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,920
at the end of chapter number 10.

147
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,200
Let me read a verse of Scripture for you.

148
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,679
We'll get through the entire passage,

149
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:43,200
but let me draw your attention to verse number 37.

150
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,160
The Bible says this,

151
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,279
for yet a little while,

152
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:50,200
and he that shall come will come,

153
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,600
and will not tarry.

154
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,500
Aren't you thankful for that truth?

155
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,839
This morning if you're taking notes,

156
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,760
I've simply entitled the message,

157
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,279
he that shall come will come.

158
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:05,519
We notice that the Scripture says yet a little while.

159
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,480
Many have said, how long is a little while?

160
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,579
You can look in the Greek,

161
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:09,940
you can look in anywhere.

162
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,459
A little while is a little while.

163
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:13,200
It's an unstated period of time.

164
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,500
We find that Peter will use similar expression

165
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,540
at the end of his first epistle

166
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,980
in 1 Peter chapter number five.

167
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,660
He says, after that you have suffered a while.

168
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,380
And we understand here that a little while,

169
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,779
we don't know the period of time,

170
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:31,739
but we do know that Jesus is going to return right on time.

171
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:32,579
Amen?

172
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:34,880
And just as he came the first time,

173
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,420
when the fullness of time was come,

174
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,739
God sent forth his son.

175
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:39,459
We understand that in the book of Galatians.

176
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,059
We see the incarnation as you read through

177
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:44,059
and study the Gospel records.

178
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:47,220
And this morning when we are reminded of this truth,

179
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,660
that Jesus is going to come and his time is perfect.

180
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,140
He's never been late.

181
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,299
He's seldom early, right?

182
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:56,059
He's right on time.

183
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,459
And what a joy to understand that truth.

184
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:00,220
Let's dig into the passage this morning.

185
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,059
If you're taking notes, number one,

186
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:03,899
I want you to notice what is explained.

187
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:06,059
In verses 26 through 31,

188
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:08,220
these individuals that are being written to

189
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,820
are given some explanation.

190
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,220
Notice in verse 26, it says this,

191
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,739
for if we sin willfully after that we have received

192
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:16,299
the knowledge of the truth,

193
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:18,959
there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,

194
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,980
but a certain fearful looking for of judgment

195
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,299
and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries.

196
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:28,619
He that despised Moses' law died without mercy

197
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:30,420
under two or three witnesses.

198
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,940
Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye,

199
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,659
shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden underfoot

200
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:41,059
the Son of God and hath counted the blood of the covenant

201
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:45,059
wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing

202
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:48,299
and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace.

203
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:49,979
For we know him that hath said,

204
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:51,780
vengeance belongeth unto me.

205
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,619
I will recompense, saith the Lord.

206
00:08:53,619 --> 00:08:56,859
And again, the Lord shall judge his people.

207
00:08:56,859 --> 00:08:58,340
Notice verse 31.

208
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:02,140
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands

209
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,539
of the living God.

210
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:06,219
We understand that we serve the Lord God Almighty,

211
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:09,219
that he is omnipotent, that he ever liveth

212
00:09:09,219 --> 00:09:10,500
to make intercession for us.

213
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,979
And we understand the sacrifice that was made

214
00:09:13,979 --> 00:09:16,820
by the Lord Jesus Christ when he offered himself.

215
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,099
And we notice what is being explained.

216
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:20,700
First of all, I believe that we see

217
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,140
the efficacy of Christ's blood.

218
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,059
That word means that it's efficient,

219
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:29,580
it's effective to bring about the desired end.

220
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,880
And we understand this morning that it has the power,

221
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,320
the blood of Jesus Christ has the power

222
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,679
to change lives, to save souls.

223
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,520
And we understand there's power in the blood.

224
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,520
We sing about that truth and we look at the word of God

225
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,239
and we understand that he's gone through

226
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:52,359
these last several chapters dealing with the offering

227
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:55,880
of the Lord Jesus Christ and how the blood

228
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,159
of those bulls and goats that was offered

229
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,359
throughout the Old Testament,

230
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:00,200
that Old Testament,

231
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,320
sacrificial system that it was a picture, it was a type, it could never bring about

232
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,600
the salvation that the blood of Jesus Christ brings about. There was a constant

233
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,080
reminder of sin with that Old Testament sacrificial system, but with that one

234
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:23,880
sacrifice for sins forever, when Jesus, God in flesh, offered His precious blood,

235
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:30,920
He died, was buried, and rose in victory, He accomplished what was that that was

236
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,840
set out to be accomplished, and that is the redemption of mankind. We understand

237
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,560
this morning that the Bible tells us in verse number 18, now where remission of

238
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,200
these is, there is no more offering for sin, and we spoke about the fact that in

239
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:52,280
what Christ's offering provided for us was remission, not that remembrance of

240
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:57,480
the Old Testament sacrificial system, and we can rejoice in that truth. The

241
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,240
precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ is the only payment that is acceptable

242
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,360
for the sin debt of mankind. You believe that this morning? Notice what he says at

243
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,200
the end of verse number 26, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins.

244
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,200
There's nothing else that can be offered that can take care of your sin debt.

245
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,880
Nothing. Jesus's blood, that's it. The reality this morning is that when we

246
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,160
speak about the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, we speak about it and hold it in

247
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:38,040
great reverence of understanding what it is that Jesus did for us. I'm so thankful

248
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,800
this morning that He was willing to shed His precious blood, and that we have the

249
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,680
privilege of speaking about, teaching about, singing about, sharing with others

250
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,480
the truth of the redemption through the blood of Christ. There are a number of

251
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,640
people in our world today that have the understanding that there's some other

252
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,560
form of payment that is acceptable for their redemption. There are people that

253
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,920
think that they can follow some creed, there are people that think they can do

254
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,600
some deed, and that through these particular things they can find, can

255
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:17,760
obtain, redemption. My friends, they've been sold a bill of goods. They have been

256
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,360
deceived by the God of this world who has blinded the minds of them which

257
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,440
believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel should shine in unto

258
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,160
them. We speak with people regularly. I hope that you have the opportunity

259
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,400
regularly to interact with individuals, and I understand things have been

260
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,960
different here in 2020 with COVID and all that's going on, but we understand

261
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,080
this morning that God still gives divine appointments, God still uses His

262
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:49,120
people, and as we have opportunity to be His spokesman, to be His representative,

263
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,960
His ambassador, that we can speak to people. And I guarantee that as you would

264
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,080
go out this week, and if you would purpose in your heart and in your life

265
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,800
to confront some people about their need for Jesus, that you will meet some

266
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,880
people that believe that by being a good person, by following some religious creed,

267
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:17,000
that they can have salvation. My friends, Jesus paid it all. There's no other

268
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,440
sacrifice for sin. There's nothing else that could atone for the

269
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,920
sin of mankind. I'm thankful that someone gave me that truth. I hope this morning

270
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,720
that you're thankful that someone's given you that truth, that we can

271
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,920
understand that it's been settled. We sing that song, the old account was

272
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,040
settled long ago, right? Why? Because I came to the Lord Jesus Christ

273
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:50,360
understanding that He is God, and that He went to that cross and He paid for my

274
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,360
sin with His precious blood. He was buried and He rose again, conquering sin,

275
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,200
death, and the grave. The efficacy of Christ's blood. We notice that He then

276
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,640
quickly goes into an example from Old Testament Israel. Notice what He says

277
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:11,080
in verse number 28, He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two

278
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:18,000
or three witnesses. And so immediately in verse number 28, again understanding the

279
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,360
original recipients to the book of Hebrews and understanding their

280
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,840
knowledge of the Jewish history in Old Testament Israel, they would be able to

281
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,760
quickly relate to what is being said here. And it's important that we'd

282
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,600
understand that the law required many sacrifices and offerings, did it not? You

283
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,360
read through Old Testament law, you read through all of those offerings, in fact

284
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,080
Hebrews 10 was dealing with that. In verse number 11, and every priest standeth

285
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,440
daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which

286
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,880
could never take away sins, but they were following that which had been prescribed.

287
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,520
They were bringing the appropriate sacrifice or offering, but we understand

288
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,000
that though they would have some level of knowledge of these requirements, in

289
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,880
fact many of them, no doubt in my mind, had practiced many of these things

290
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:15,360
before they came to Christ. However, as the writer of Hebrews will say here in

291
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,240
verse number 28, He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three

292
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,320
witnesses. What he's saying is that there were certain offenses that demanded that

293
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,559
the offender be put to death. There was no sacrifice that could be brought for

294
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:34,520
that particular offense, rather the offender had to be put to death. Let me

295
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:39,000
share two examples with you. Number one is that of adultery. Look in Leviticus

296
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,880
chapter number 20. I use that example because we understand that Jesus was

297
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,760
confronted with that in John chapter number eight. You remember in John

298
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,080
chapter number eight that they come to Jesus. Turn over to Leviticus 20, I'm

299
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,160
going to just remind you of the event that took place in John chapter number

300
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,840
eight when Jesus is there and those men come and they say, hey, we've caught this

301
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,360
woman in the very act of adultery. She is to be put to death. That's what the law

302
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,800
says. What say ye? You remember the account, right? Jesus bends down, He begins

303
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,800
to write in the sand, and then all of a sudden all of the accusers are gone.

304
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:19,160
Right? You remember John 8. What they're referring to, those folks that came, was

305
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,360
this truth in Leviticus. Notice in chapter 20 in verse number 10, and the

306
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,960
man that commit adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth

307
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,000
adultery with his neighbor's wife, notice what it says, the adulterer and the

308
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,920
adulteress shall surely be put to death. There was no prescribed offering that

309
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,559
they would bring for that offense. The offender was to be put to death. Not only

310
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:45,960
that of adultery, but think about idolatry. Turn to the book of Deuteronomy,

311
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,240
if you will, in chapter number 17. Now we understand that the nation of Israel was

312
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,559
very often guilty of the sin of idolatry. Amen? You see it throughout their

313
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:02,120
history. In fact, we live in a society today where many people are idolatrous.

314
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,400
In fact, it's been interesting to me that in 2020, here in the United States of

315
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,559
America, through this pandemic, that many of the idols that Americans served have

316
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,400
been dealt with. What do I mean by that? Well, sports took a backseat in a hurry,

317
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,400
did it not? You can't tell me this morning that sports is not an idol for

318
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,760
many people in our land. We could continue to go on and deal with other

319
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,360
examples, but we understand this morning that John says that little children, keep

320
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:38,279
yourself from idols. We may not have some graven image as some other societies

321
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:43,800
have, but we have idols and we understand that an idol is anything that

322
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,800
takes the place of God, anything that is in front of God. The reality this

323
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:54,240
morning is that Paul said this in the book of Colossians in chapter 1 and verse

324
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,680
number 18, that in all things he, speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ, must have the

325
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:05,120
preeminence. When we understand all that he's done for us, we would understand the

326
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,040
unique opportunity that we have to live for him. Deuteronomy 17, notice in verse

327
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,559
number 1, thou shalt not sacrifice unto the Lord thy God any bullock or sheep

328
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:19,279
wherein is blemish or any evil favoredness, for that is an abomination

329
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,240
to the Lord thy God. If you want to do a study on your own, mark Deuteronomy 17

330
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,559
and study the book of Malachi with it. You'll be overwhelmed with joy as you

331
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:34,080
begin to see how God had warned them of these things and then confronts them

332
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,080
with their evilness. They're saying, well we are bringing offerings, yeah, but he is

333
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,359
a great king and they were bringing offerings that were not acceptable. In

334
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:46,200
fact, in Malachi he says, you wouldn't even take it to your governor but yet

335
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,239
you offer it to me. Go study it, it's a fascinating study. In verse number 2, if

336
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:54,400
there be found among you within any of thy gates which the Lord thy God giveth

337
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,400
thee man or woman that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the Lord thy

338
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,040
God and transgressing his covenant and hath gone, notice what it says, and served

339
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,799
other gods and worshiped them either the sun or moon or any of the host of

340
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,919
heaven which I have not commanded and it be told thee and thou hast heard of it

341
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,840
and inquired diligently and behold it be true and the thing certain that such

342
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:22,960
abomination is wrought in Israel then shalt thou bring forth that man or that

343
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,280
woman which have committed that wicked thing unto thy gates even that man or

344
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:33,320
that woman and shalt stone them with stones till they die at the mouth of two

345
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,239
witnesses or three witnesses shall he that is worthy of death be put to death

346
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:42,320
but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death and so we

347
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,440
understand that as we're here in Hebrews chapter number 10 and we see how that

348
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,960
this example of Old Testament Israel is being used and no doubt they would be

349
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,359
able to quickly relate back to these truths from the Pentateuch. You could

350
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:00,239
jot down in your notes Numbers chapter 15 verses 30 and 31 and reference that

351
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:05,639
as well and see how that he's dealing with this truth. Remember, throughout the

352
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:10,359
book of Hebrews the writer often refers back to the Old Testament. We have found

353
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:14,119
on many occasion that he refers back to the Old Testament and takes a messianic

354
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:19,199
prophecy and applies it properly to the Lord Jesus Christ. And we find that he's

355
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:23,079
used the Old Testament because they were familiar with the Old Testament. I'm

356
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:27,439
bothered deeply when people today would say something like this, we're New

357
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:30,879
Testament believers, we don't need the Old Testament, we've made a grave

358
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:36,319
mistake. There are people that believe that, there are people that that operate

359
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,199
in that fashion, oh we don't really need the Old Testament, we're New Testament

360
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:43,159
believers. But Paul said that the Old Testament, the things that were written

361
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:48,119
before time were written for our admonition, for our benefit, amen? And so

362
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:52,719
we understand here as we continue in looking here at this example from Old

363
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:57,079
Testament Israel, we see the the judgment, remember what he says in verse 28, that

364
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:00,519
they died without mercy under two or three witnesses. Then notice how he makes

365
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:05,999
the application of how much sore punishment, suppose ye, shall he be

366
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:10,399
thought worthy who hath trodden underfoot the Son of God, and hath

367
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:13,719
counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy

368
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:18,999
thing, and hath done despite under the Spirit of grace. To despise something is

369
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:25,479
to have the lowest opinion of something. And we notice here in verse number 29, he

370
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:28,919
is using this application, this illustration of Old Testament Israel, and

371
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:33,519
saying, look, they died without mercy, but what if somebody rejects that which

372
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:39,399
Christ has offered? They despise the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, he's

373
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:43,199
already dealt with the efficacy of Christ's blood, and now these ones that

374
00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:48,119
they, he says, how much sore or punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought

375
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:54,919
worthy who hath trodden underfoot the Son of God. To be exposed to the truth

376
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:01,719
and to reject it, to be confronted with the teaching of biblical Christianity, to

377
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:06,039
understand what Jesus Christ did on the cross of Calvary, paying for your sin

378
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:10,919
once and for all, not to have this attitude of, let me consider that, or

379
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:15,039
thinking about it, but saying, nope, I'm rejecting that. Oh, that's a dangerous

380
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:20,199
place. There's no other sacrifice, and you're gonna face the judgment of God.

381
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:24,519
The reality is, we understand as we compare Scripture with Scripture and

382
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:28,639
look throughout the whole of God's Word, that that penalty is the second death.

383
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:32,999
It is torment forever in the lake of fire. Notice verse 30, and it says this,

384
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:37,359
for we know him that hath said, vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, say

385
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:41,319
it the Lord, and again, the Lord shall judge his people. Deuteronomy 32 verses

386
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:46,599
35 and 36 are in view here as he quotes this in verse 30. Notice he says, it is a

387
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:52,319
fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. It's interesting, Peter

388
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:56,399
says this, you can jot down the reference, I'll read it for you, in 2 Peter

389
00:22:56,399 --> 00:23:01,359
chapter number 2, in verses 20 through 22, it says, for if after they have

390
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:04,039
escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and

391
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:08,199
Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome, the latter

392
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:12,319
end is worse with them than the beginning. For it had been better for

393
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:15,239
them not to have known the way of righteousness, than after they have

394
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:20,759
known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them. It says,

395
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,119
but it has happened unto them according to the true proverb, the dog has turned

396
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:29,519
to his own vomit again, and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.

397
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,919
We understand throughout the Word of God that there are false teachers, there are

398
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:40,239
people that pretend to outwardly identify as being followers of the Lord

399
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:44,199
Jesus Christ. In fact, if you read the book of Jude, you understand that Jude

400
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:47,999
says it's necessary for me to write these things unto you, that you earnestly

401
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:51,279
contend for the faith. Why? In verse number 4, he says that there are certain

402
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:57,959
men that have crept in unawares, unawares. And here's what he says that those

403
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:02,819
individuals do, he says that they turned the grace of our God into

404
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:08,159
lasciviousness, and they denied the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ. That

405
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:15,959
lasciviousness is unbridled lust. And we find here that we notice that the author

406
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,079
of Hebrews is explaining some very important truth to these that he's

407
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,079
writing to. Listen, there's no place to go. Who are we gonna go?

408
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:28,720
Remember what Peter said when all of them forsook him? They all forsook the

409
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,319
Lord, and we find that as they're there and Jesus speaks to them, it's

410
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:37,720
recorded for us in John chapter number 6 at the end of the passage, many

411
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,679
people left and they deserted them. And Jesus says, will you also go away? And

412
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,279
Peter stands up in John 6 and verse number 68, and he says to whom? He says

413
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:54,639
this, Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life, and we believe

414
00:24:54,639 --> 00:25:01,440
and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God. We notice not

415
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,799
only what was explained as we continue looking at the passage of Scripture in

416
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,119
Hebrews, notice what they endured. Number two, notice what they endured. Verses 32

417
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:14,799
through 35 reveal to us some of that which they suffered because of their

418
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,119
conversion. It says this, but call to remembrance the former days. And so we

419
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:24,319
see that there's a reminder here of what had been experienced, what they endured.

420
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:30,440
It says this, in which after you were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of

421
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:36,119
afflictions. We notice the afflictions of these individuals that is mentioned here

422
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:40,919
in verse number 32, a great fight of afflictions, these sufferings. We

423
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:44,799
understand that Peter, in fact, would write the book of 1 Peter to those that

424
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,039
were suffering, those that were dealing with hardship and difficulty because of

425
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:57,079
the very fact that they identified with the Lord Jesus Christ. This morning, for

426
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:01,479
most of my lifetime and most of your lifetime in the United States of America,

427
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:05,399
we have not really suffered because of our identifying with the Lord Jesus

428
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:12,720
Christ. Amen? We find that there are folks around the globe that suffer greatly

429
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,440
because they've identified with the Lord Jesus Christ. It was a very common thing

430
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,119
in the first century that as they would identify with the Lord Jesus Christ, you

431
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:26,000
find this still in many countries around the world today, that if you were to

432
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,319
identify with the Lord Jesus Christ that your family would consider you dead.

433
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:39,599
Because you have forsaken whatever your original religion was, and many nations

434
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:44,839
around the world would look at their culture and religion being one in the

435
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:50,759
same. And in those particular countries around the world, you find that believers

436
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:55,839
face great levels of persecution and great levels of suffering simply because

437
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:01,639
they've identified with the Lord Jesus Christ. When I trust that Christ is my

438
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:09,399
Savior, there were people that were rejoicing. Honestly. And I'm going to

439
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:12,599
assume this morning that when you trust that the Lord Jesus Christ is your

440
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:17,199
Savior, that there were people that were rejoicing. Tomorrow is my spiritual

441
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:23,160
birthday. I love being mindful of the day in which I trust that the Lord Jesus

442
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:29,160
Christ is my Savior. It was 23 years ago tomorrow. And I'm so thankful. And there

443
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,479
was rejoicing just a few weeks ago on a Sunday evening. We had a baptismal

444
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:39,880
service, and we baptized three young men. And we were rejoicing. We were thankful

445
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,679
for their following the Lord in believers' baptism. Amen? It doesn't

446
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:49,199
happen in some nations around the world. And that wasn't a common thing in the

447
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:51,919
first century. Yes, there'd be some that would rejoice, but we know that there'd

448
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:58,880
be some that would say, they're dead to me. You know that those that had shops

449
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,679
and various types of services, that if you identified with Christ, people would

450
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:07,919
stop buying from you. They would try to starve you. Do you know that the raw

451
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,079
materials that you would need for whatever occupation it was that you were

452
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:15,599
engaged in, that those suppliers of those raw materials in many cases would stop

453
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:20,319
selling to you. So that you would not have the ability to even make what you

454
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:25,959
had been making. Yet alone do you have those that would not buy from you, but

455
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:29,559
now you can't even get the raw materials that you need. It was a terrible

456
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:34,599
situation. But God took care of them. That's why you see so often in the New

457
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:40,479
Testament this truth about using hospitality and loving the brethren. And

458
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:45,080
we often say that our brothers and sisters in Christ, that we have this

459
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:52,279
bond. I'm so thankful for it. We can enjoy fellowship one with another. Why?

460
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:57,479
Because our common bond is the Lord Jesus Christ. We notice that it says here

461
00:28:57,479 --> 00:29:00,520
in verse number 32, but call to remembrance the former days in which

462
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,080
after you were illuminated you endured a great fight of afflictions. Notice this,

463
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,260
partly, part of what you suffered whilst you were made a gazing stock both by

464
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:15,039
reproaches and afflictions. And that idea of being a gazing stock is a spectacle.

465
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,119
He says here, notice what it says as we continue in verse number 33. It says,

466
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:29,039
and partly whilst you became companions of them that were so used. We see there

467
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,760
not only afflictions that they endured, but were mindful here of their

468
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,359
compassion as it kind of goes into verse number 34. It says, for you had compassion

469
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:43,640
of me in my bonds. The compassion that they had towards those that were

470
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,279
persecuted, to those that were in prison. We understand the Apostle Paul

471
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:53,039
often faced imprisonment. In fact, in a number of the letters that Paul penned

472
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:59,359
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, he penned from a prison. He

473
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:02,119
mentions how

474
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:04,959
We saw that specifically in the book of Philippians

475
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:06,559
to the believers at Philippi,

476
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,359
how they communicated with Him once and again

477
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:13,199
as you read Philippians 4.

478
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:15,919
We see here that they had compassion.

479
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:16,919
Notice what it says.

480
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:18,319
This is an interesting phrase

481
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,719
in the middle of verse 34.

482
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:26,039
"...And took joyfully the spoiling of your goods."

483
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:29,199
It's interesting to me that they took it joyfully.

484
00:30:29,199 --> 00:30:31,239
The spoiling of your goods.

485
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:34,479
You might take it and be disappointed.

486
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:35,679
Be overwhelmed.

487
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,079
What are we going to do?

488
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:39,359
I can't believe this happened.

489
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,999
But they took it joyfully.

490
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:42,079
Why?

491
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,159
Because of some knowledge that they had.

492
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,919
Look at the end of verse 34.

493
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,759
"...Knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven

494
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:54,799
a better and an enduring substance.

495
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,479
Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,

496
00:30:57,479 --> 00:31:00,439
where neither moth nor rust doth decay."

497
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:04,159
And what a joy to think about the fact

498
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,519
that these individuals,

499
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,759
how could they deal with the spoiling of their goods joyfully

500
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:10,279
because they had an understanding

501
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:12,479
that this world is not my home.

502
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:14,119
I'm just a passing through.

503
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:15,079
I'm not suggesting,

504
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:16,759
listen, if you weren't here Wednesday night,

505
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:18,279
you weren't tuned in on live stream,

506
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:19,599
listen to the message.

507
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:21,159
I trust it'll be a blessing to you.

508
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:21,919
It's on YouTube.

509
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,039
It's on our website.

510
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,879
And as you think about that message,

511
00:31:24,879 --> 00:31:26,919
I spoke about the fact in Acts 4

512
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:29,039
that they had been with Jesus.

513
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,639
And I said this in the message,

514
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:33,239
and I believe it's so important for us to understand

515
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:39,039
that being with Jesus does not prevent the hardship,

516
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:44,519
but it certainly will help you be prepared for the hardship.

517
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:45,639
Amen?

518
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:46,559
These folks, they had,

519
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,159
man, this world's not my home.

520
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,959
I'm just passing through.

521
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:51,479
I'm looking upward.

522
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:53,199
I'm looking for my Savior.

523
00:31:53,199 --> 00:31:54,559
I'm looking for heaven.

524
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,519
Amen?

525
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,999
And we find here that he goes

526
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:00,159
and we understand their confidence.

527
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,639
We see that here in verse number 35.

528
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:04,839
Cast not away therefore your confidence,

529
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,599
which hath great recompense of reward.

530
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,119
I remember back last Sunday morning,

531
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:11,479
we looked at verse 23.

532
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:13,879
Let us hold fast the profession of our faith.

533
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:16,239
And remember it says without wavering.

534
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,399
Having that confidence of that assurance.

535
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:20,239
Why?

536
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:23,159
Because he is faithful that promised.

537
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:25,879
Remember, biblical Christianity is not pie in the sky.

538
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:27,559
Let's hope everything's gonna work out.

539
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:30,679
No, we're basing it upon revealed truth

540
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:33,479
that Jesus has given us in His Word.

541
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:35,159
And we're taking God at His Word.

542
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:36,720
What does it mean to live by faith?

543
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,319
To believe God.

544
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:40,239
To trust Him.

545
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:41,959
To have nothing wavering.

546
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:42,799
Why?

547
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,319
Because I know that He that is promised is faithful.

548
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:49,839
And they could endure the things that they endured

549
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:52,799
because of their understanding.

550
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,479
Because they had an understanding of who Christ is.

551
00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:58,319
An understanding of their eternity.

552
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:04,519
What a joy to see those that have gone before us

553
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:07,799
that have suffered greatly that remain faithful.

554
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,399
It's a challenge to me.

555
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:10,279
It really is.

556
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:13,959
I'm challenged often when I read

557
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:17,000
about those that have gone before us

558
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
and have been faithful and suffered great afflictions.

559
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,239
Great difficulties.

560
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:25,080
And yet they remain faithful.

561
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,479
God's used them.

562
00:33:26,479 --> 00:33:28,119
What a joy.

563
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:31,399
We notice that there's, as we begin this passage,

564
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:32,679
we notice what is explained.

565
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:33,720
We notice what they endured.

566
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,239
Now I want you to see as we wrap up

567
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:38,199
in verses 36 through 39, number three this morning,

568
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:41,279
notice how they were encouraged.

569
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,559
Notice how they were encouraged.

570
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,360
You know, people need encouragement.

571
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,440
You know that?

572
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,679
There are times in which you need encouragement.

573
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,039
You say, oh, not me, I'm always positive.

574
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:53,879
There are times that you need encouragement.

575
00:33:53,879 --> 00:33:54,720
Amen?

576
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:57,599
There are times that we all need to be encouraged.

577
00:33:57,599 --> 00:33:59,399
Can I tell you that the Word of God,

578
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:01,000
the Word of God is powerful.

579
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,839
It's precious.

580
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,279
It's unique.

581
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,319
The reason that I say the Word of God is unique

582
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:07,599
is because I can read this book

583
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:11,080
and in a sitting of reading the Word of God

584
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,360
and a time of sitting

585
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,279
and hearing the preaching of the Word of God,

586
00:34:14,279 --> 00:34:17,119
God can use His Word to convict me.

587
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,679
Amen?

588
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,320
God can use His Word to challenge me.

589
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,119
To bring me to a place of decision.

590
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:26,959
But at the same time,

591
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:28,799
He can use the same Word to comfort me

592
00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:30,720
and to encourage me.

593
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,320
It's amazing how that God can use His Word

594
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,320
in so many ways in our lives.

595
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,079
And we find that as we wrap up

596
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,880
the 10th chapter of the book of Hebrews,

597
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,639
that there is some encouragement.

598
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,919
We notice how these recipients would be encouraged

599
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:47,639
by that which they have received.

600
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,160
I believe that there's a two-fold aspect

601
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,040
of the encouragement.

602
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,279
Number one, they are encouraged with a promise.

603
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:57,279
I'm thankful for the promises of God's Word, aren't you?

604
00:34:57,279 --> 00:34:59,479
In fact, we understand that even

605
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:01,359
as the ladies sang this morning,

606
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,040
that they sang a little bit about the promises, right?

607
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,639
About understanding that God has promised these things

608
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:10,119
and God will not falter.

609
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:11,639
The end of that first verse,

610
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:12,720
thank you for typing it out.

611
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,559
I could reference it.

612
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:15,760
Your promises are ever new.

613
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,760
I claim them for today.

614
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,119
Peter said that they're exceeding

615
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,679
great and precious promises, amen?

616
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:26,199
And we can look at the promises of God's Word

617
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:27,760
and they bring us encouragement.

618
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,919
They give us hope.

619
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:32,040
They give us reason and purpose.

620
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,519
And we see here in verses 36 and 37,

621
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:37,479
the first way in which they're encouraged

622
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:39,239
is with this promise.

623
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:41,479
It says in verse number 35,

624
00:35:41,479 --> 00:35:42,959
we just finished up and you kind of see

625
00:35:42,959 --> 00:35:44,799
how it segues right into verse 36.

626
00:35:44,799 --> 00:35:46,600
Cast not away therefore your confidence,

627
00:35:46,799 --> 00:35:49,160
which hath great recompense of reward,

628
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,839
for ye have need of patience,

629
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,559
that after ye have done the will of God,

630
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:57,679
ye might receive the promise.

631
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,720
And then he says this,

632
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,639
we used it as our title this morning,

633
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:01,880
for yet a little while,

634
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,600
and he that shall come will come

635
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,679
and will not tarry.

636
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:09,479
Have you ever heard somebody say

637
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,959
that the Lord's gonna tarry His return?

638
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:16,199
You ever heard anyone say that?

639
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:17,880
If the Lord does not tarry.

640
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,720
You never heard anyone say that?

641
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,239
I've heard it so many times.

642
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,559
If the Lord does not tarry.

643
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:22,720
You know what the word tarry means?

644
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,600
It means to delay.

645
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,320
It means to linger.

646
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,479
The Word of God says that He will not tarry.

647
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:31,119
So we don't have to say if the Lord tarries His coming.

648
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,160
No, He's not going to.

649
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,880
Based upon the authority of the Word of God,

650
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,359
it says He will not tarry.

651
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,239
For he that will come or shall come will come.

652
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,679
For he that shall come will come.

653
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:44,160
And we see that,

654
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,679
and we don't know the time of His return,

655
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:48,239
but we know that He promised

656
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,320
that He was going to come back.

657
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,199
Can I tell you this morning

658
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:53,040
that the promise of Christ's return

659
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,440
brings me encouragement?

660
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,399
It really does.

661
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:00,359
As we daily live with the understanding

662
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:02,320
that today could be the day,

663
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,679
as we daily understand that Jesus, my Savior,

664
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:07,799
He's coming back,

665
00:37:07,799 --> 00:37:10,119
it gives me encouragement.

666
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:10,959
Why?

667
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:13,600
Because this is not all there is.

668
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,359
Aren't you happy for that?

669
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,000
I mean, seriously.

670
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,440
I am so thankful that this world is not all,

671
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,160
it's done and over with.

672
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,279
No, no, no.

673
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:23,639
We have heaven.

674
00:37:24,919 --> 00:37:26,399
Now, He's richly blessed us

675
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:27,799
while we're here upon this earth.

676
00:37:27,799 --> 00:37:29,559
I'm so thankful that He's given us

677
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:31,679
all these wonderful blessings,

678
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:33,839
and He's blessed us with all spiritual blessings

679
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:34,799
in heavenly places.

680
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:36,720
But I understand this morning

681
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,239
that the promise of the return of the Lord Jesus Christ,

682
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:43,880
how this promise encourages the people of God.

683
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:47,199
Remind yourself of it often.

684
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:51,199
Do you remember in John chapter number 13,

685
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,799
Jesus is telling the disciples,

686
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:55,919
we often reference how that Jesus tells them

687
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:57,279
that He gives them a new commandment

688
00:37:57,279 --> 00:37:58,739
at the end of the passage,

689
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:01,160
that they're to love one another as He loved.

690
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,359
And He tells them how that He was going to be leaving, right?

691
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:05,479
He's going to the cross.

692
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:07,559
He's explaining to them the events

693
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:10,760
that are going to unfold in just hours and days ahead.

694
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,959
And we understand that then He says

695
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:14,880
to start the 14th chapter,

696
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,519
I understand chapter and verses have been inserted after,

697
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:18,880
so you think about the dialogue.

698
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,239
He says this, let not your heart be troubled.

699
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,119
Why was their heart troubled?

700
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,320
Because of the things that they had just heard.

701
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,639
Because of the fact that He was departing

702
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:31,679
and where He was going, they could not come.

703
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:34,380
And they didn't understand all of these things.

704
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,979
Remember, after the resurrection,

705
00:38:36,979 --> 00:38:39,619
the Gospel accounts reveal to us

706
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:42,179
that they remembered these things.

707
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,859
You know, there's a danger in the midst of difficulty

708
00:38:45,859 --> 00:38:48,179
that we forget some things.

709
00:38:48,179 --> 00:38:49,299
Amen?

710
00:38:49,299 --> 00:38:51,859
We're overwhelmed with all that's going on

711
00:38:51,859 --> 00:38:54,719
and we're kind of living under the circumstances,

712
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:59,200
if you will, and we forget the promises of God.

713
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,919
And Jesus says, let not your heart be troubled.

714
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:04,140
You believe in God, believe also in Me.

715
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,820
In My Father's house are many mansions.

716
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,119
If it were not so, I would have told you.

717
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,659
He says this, I go to prepare a place for you.

718
00:39:09,659 --> 00:39:11,159
And if I go and prepare a place for you,

719
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:14,099
I will come again and receive you unto Myself

720
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:17,219
that where I am, there ye may be also.

721
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:18,619
What a joy.

722
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:24,159
In 2 Peter 3, there's scoffers and mockers.

723
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:27,359
They're saying, where is His coming?

724
00:39:29,219 --> 00:39:31,020
All things remain the same.

725
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:33,900
This they're willingly ignorant of,

726
00:39:34,659 --> 00:39:35,580
and we see that.

727
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,859
But then we find that Peter says,

728
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:40,500
the Lord is not slack concerning His promise,

729
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
as some men count slackness.

730
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,619
But as longsuffering to us,

731
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:45,059
we're not willing that any should perish,

732
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:47,099
but that all should come to repentance.

733
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:48,700
In 2 Peter 3, verse number nine.

734
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,260
Listen, the Lord is not slack concerning His promise.

735
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,580
And we find that as these recipients would be encouraged,

736
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:58,140
they're encouraged through this promise

737
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,460
of the return of the Lord Jesus Christ,

738
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,099
for yet a little while,

739
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:02,940
yet a little while.

740
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:10,540
and he that shall come will come and will not tarry."

741
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,280
I'll be honest with you this morning,

742
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,700
I hope he comes in my lifetime.

743
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,120
I really do.

744
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,680
I think of a wonderful thing.

745
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,740
Not only a promise,

746
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,300
but I believe he encourages them with a principle.

747
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,980
Notice v. 38 and 39.

748
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,540
Now the just shall live by faith,

749
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,940
but if any man draw back,

750
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,300
my soul shall have no pleasure in him.

751
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,660
We are not of them who draw back unto perdition,

752
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:39,700
but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.

753
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,900
The principle that is given is really a reference

754
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,340
back to the book of Habakkuk.

755
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,860
In Habakkuk 2, verses 3 and 4,

756
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,940
this truth of the just shall live by faith.

757
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,380
And we find that this Old Testament principle

758
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,420
is used by the Apostle Paul

759
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:56,020
as he's speaking to those in Rome.

760
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,060
The book of Romans references

761
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,580
the just shall live by faith.

762
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,460
The emphasis in the book of Romans is the just.

763
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,740
How are we justified?

764
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,500
Through faith.

765
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,220
The book of Galatians deals with

766
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,620
the just shall live by faith.

767
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,380
And I believe in the book of Galatians,

768
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,779
faith is what is emphasized there in the book of Galatians.

769
00:41:15,779 --> 00:41:18,459
Again, they're dealing with those folks there

770
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:21,819
that were converted during the first missionary journey

771
00:41:21,819 --> 00:41:24,620
as the Apostle Paul went out from the church at Antioch

772
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:29,060
and they were able to go and see people saved

773
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,459
in the region of Galatia.

774
00:41:30,459 --> 00:41:31,300
And what a blessing,

775
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,260
but there were some Judaizers that came in that said,

776
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,139
hey, you have to keep doing these things

777
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:38,459
and unless you're circumcised after the law of Moses,

778
00:41:38,459 --> 00:41:39,459
you cannot be saved.

779
00:41:39,459 --> 00:41:41,180
I mean, they go through all of these things

780
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,459
and the just shall live by faith.

781
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,300
I'm saved by faith.

782
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,340
Here, he says,

783
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:52,660
now the just shall live by faith.

784
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,900
But if any man draw back,

785
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:59,139
notice my soul shall have no pleasure in him.

786
00:41:59,139 --> 00:42:01,779
But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition,

787
00:42:01,779 --> 00:42:05,779
but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.

788
00:42:07,779 --> 00:42:12,059
No retreat, no drawback, amen.

789
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:13,979
Onward, Christian soldier.

790
00:42:13,979 --> 00:42:16,619
That's what the songwriter said, isn't it?

791
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:17,660
Amen.

792
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,860
We're going onward and forward.

793
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,699
The book of Joshua, forward by faith,

794
00:42:22,699 --> 00:42:24,619
really is an idea of that book.

795
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:26,220
And you understand here,

796
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,540
I believe that the emphasis in the book of Hebrews

797
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,380
of this Old Testament principle

798
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,699
the just shall live by faith.

799
00:42:33,699 --> 00:42:36,020
I'm thankful that I've been saved by faith.

800
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,820
I'm thankful that I'm now justified and I'm redeemed.

801
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,180
I've been reconciled to the Lord

802
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:45,059
because of His precious blood,

803
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:47,820
but I'm to live by faith.

804
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,139
And we think about the theme of the book of Hebrews

805
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:52,419
as we got there in chapter number six.

806
00:42:52,419 --> 00:42:54,860
Remember the idea of chapter number six,

807
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,699
let us go on.

808
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,139
Right, that's what he says.

809
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,900
Go back to chapter six in verse number one

810
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,419
and notice what he says.

811
00:43:02,419 --> 00:43:04,860
Remember, he was dealing at the end of chapter number five.

812
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,660
He was ready to get into all of the truth

813
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,300
with regard to Melchizedek,

814
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,500
but he says you're not ready to receive these things.

815
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,339
Why?

816
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:12,500
Because you're slow of learning.

817
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,900
You're dull of hearing.

818
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,419
And he goes through and he gives this admonition,

819
00:43:17,419 --> 00:43:19,339
but he says in verse number one of chapter six,

820
00:43:19,339 --> 00:43:22,339
therefore, leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ,

821
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:25,979
let us go unto perfection.

822
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:27,540
Let us go on.

823
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,619
Let us continue.

824
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:31,779
Let us, we find here, live by faith.

825
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:34,059
Notice it says that if any man draw back,

826
00:43:34,059 --> 00:43:35,580
my soul shall have no pleasure in him.

827
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,940
Listen, the fact of the matter is that

828
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,779
when we live by faith, we please God.

829
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,660
In just a few verses,

830
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,979
a verse that I personally commonly reference

831
00:43:46,979 --> 00:43:50,260
and rehearse for you is found in Hebrews 11 six.

832
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,540
Without faith, it is impossible to please Him.

833
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,380
For he that cometh to God must believe that He is

834
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,940
a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.

835
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,460
And so here we find that these folks

836
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:03,979
are being encouraged by this promise that Jesus is coming.

837
00:44:03,979 --> 00:44:05,820
They're encouraged by this principle

838
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,059
that we're to live by faith.

839
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,500
We're not to draw back.

840
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,300
We are of them, I love how verse number 39 ends,

841
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:18,940
but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.

842
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,700
We believe.

843
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,540
Remember, Paul stood in Acts 27 and said, I believe God.

844
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:30,420
I've often said, belief impacts behavior.

845
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:35,779
That's why the just shall live by faith.

846
00:44:35,779 --> 00:44:39,140
What you believe will impact your behavior.

847
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:46,420
How you behave will reveal what you believe.

848
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,260
It's a two-sided coin.

849
00:44:50,179 --> 00:44:53,339
And this morning, this principle is given,

850
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:56,820
I believe that it's a great introduction to the content

851
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,980
that we find in Hebrews chapter 11, right?

852
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,420
The great hall of faith.

853
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,980
This one by faith and that one by faith

854
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,420
and this one by faith.

855
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:08,380
And here we find that as the people of God today

856
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,380
that we too are to live by faith.

857
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,420
Trusting God, believing Him.

858
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,980
We're in Genesis chapter number 12.

859
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,980
We studied the first nine verses last Sunday evening.

860
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:21,420
We'll study verses 10 through 20 this evening.

861
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,779
And we see that Abram, he exercised faith.

862
00:45:24,779 --> 00:45:26,820
He believed God.

863
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,380
God said, nope, not in Haran.

864
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,220
You're not staying here.

865
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,980
He had already traveled from the ear of the Chaldeans

866
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,100
up to Haran.

867
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,220
Nope, this isn't the place.

868
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,779
And he travels down the Canaan.

869
00:45:34,779 --> 00:45:38,380
And what a joy to see his faith and obedience.

870
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:40,700
And this morning as the people of God,

871
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,739
we are encouraged by this principle

872
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:45,059
that the just shall live by faith.

873
00:45:45,059 --> 00:45:46,459
We don't live by sight.

874
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,580
We live by faith.

875
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,220
It does not mean that we are not aware

876
00:45:51,899 --> 00:45:53,140
of the surroundings and the things

877
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,940
that we deal with in our life.

878
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,500
It just means that our perspective is heavenward.

879
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,299
It means that we're not looking at these things

880
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:03,500
which are temporal, but at those things which are eternal.

881
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,019
Second Corinthians four, verses 17 and 18.

882
00:46:07,019 --> 00:46:08,779
And you notice how the Apostle Paul,

883
00:46:08,779 --> 00:46:11,059
he makes note of the importance

884
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,339
of having that eternal focus.

885
00:46:13,339 --> 00:46:17,580
It's a truth that we find there in the epistles

886
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,700
as he's writing in the book of Colossians

887
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,779
in chapter number three.

888
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:22,420
If ye then be risen with Christ,

889
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:25,540
seek those things which are above,

890
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,860
where Christ is on the right hand of God.

891
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:30,299
Set your affection on things above,

892
00:46:30,299 --> 00:46:31,940
not on things of the earth.

893
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,779
Why?

894
00:46:32,779 --> 00:46:34,380
Because the just shall live by faith.

895
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:37,019
This world is not my home.

896
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,179
I'm so thankful for that.

897
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:42,059
As we wrap up Hebrews chapter number 10

898
00:46:42,059 --> 00:46:44,660
and really wrap up this entire section

899
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:47,059
that's covered from chapter five

900
00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:49,140
all the way through chapter number 10,

901
00:46:49,179 --> 00:46:51,380
that the Lord Jesus Christ is superior

902
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,580
in regard to his priesthood.

903
00:46:54,739 --> 00:46:58,059
He's superior to the Aaronic, the Levitical priesthood

904
00:46:58,059 --> 00:46:59,339
that they were so familiar with.

905
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:00,220
Why?

906
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,459
Because he's of a higher, a better priesthood.

907
00:47:02,459 --> 00:47:03,660
He's that of Melchizedek.

908
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,500
We studied all of that and understood that.

909
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,500
We find that he served in a better place.

910
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,420
He offered a better offering.

911
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,980
He presented a better offering when he offered himself.

912
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:15,739
He accomplished in one offering for sin forever

913
00:47:15,739 --> 00:47:19,299
what those Old Testament sacrifices could never do.

914
00:47:20,899 --> 00:47:22,899
This morning, we wrap up chapter number 10

915
00:47:22,899 --> 00:47:25,700
and we understand this truth.

916
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,779
There's no other offering.

917
00:47:27,779 --> 00:47:29,580
It's only the blood of Christ.

918
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,940
The efficacy of Christ's blood.

919
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,779
This morning, it's imperative that we understand

920
00:47:34,779 --> 00:47:36,580
that it's only the blood of Christ.

921
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:39,980
We can't, there's no other way to come, right?

922
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:40,820
What did it say?

923
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:44,660
We see the understanding after the children of Israel

924
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,540
when they're going through all of those plagues

925
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,899
and they come to the 10th plague

926
00:47:47,899 --> 00:47:49,500
before they would leave Egypt land

927
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,619
and really that picture of being brought out

928
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,299
and the exodus and all of that,

929
00:47:53,299 --> 00:47:54,140
what did they have to do?

930
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,980
They had the Passover was instituted.

931
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,700
When they killed that Passover lamb,

932
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,899
there was something specific

933
00:47:59,899 --> 00:48:02,420
that they had to do with the blood.

934
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,299
It had to be applied.

935
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:06,299
The doorpost and the lintel, right?

936
00:48:06,299 --> 00:48:07,820
Really, picture's a cross.

937
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,420
He said, when the angel came through,

938
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,540
he said, when I see the blood,

939
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,220
I will pass.

940
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:17,739
We sing the song.

941
00:48:17,739 --> 00:48:19,940
When I see the blood, right?

942
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,179
I'm not gonna sing for you.

943
00:48:21,179 --> 00:48:22,700
Everyone leave.

944
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,980
But the reality is that it says,

945
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,899
when I see the blood, I will pass.

946
00:48:26,899 --> 00:48:28,619
I will pass over you.

947
00:48:29,739 --> 00:48:30,580
Why?

948
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,019
Because the blood was applied.

949
00:48:32,019 --> 00:48:34,140
What if someone said, you know what?

950
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,260
I don't really think that's necessary.

951
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,820
I'm gonna do all of these things instead.

952
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,260
I mean, I'm gonna do the best I can.

953
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,520
I'm gonna clean up my house.

954
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,359
I'm gonna clean up this.

955
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:43,200
I'm gonna do this.

956
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,320
I'm gonna do all these things I'm gonna do,

957
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,760
but I didn't apply the blood.

958
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:49,960
There'd be death, right?

959
00:48:51,059 --> 00:48:51,960
There'd be death.

960
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:56,239
It was only because of the blood that was applied.

961
00:48:56,239 --> 00:48:59,119
And we see all throughout the Old Testament,

962
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,080
and we see the picture and the typology

963
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,200
and how it's showing us that Messiah

964
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,020
would one day come, God in flesh.

965
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,280
Christ, our Passover.

966
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,119
Isn't that what Paul said?

967
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,239
He's writing to the believers in Corinth.

968
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:14,039
He says, Christ, our Passover.

969
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,840
And he, the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

970
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:22,840
he went to the cross and he paid for your sin and mine.

971
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:24,659
Paid for the sin of the world.

972
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,720
And the only payment that is accepted by God Almighty

973
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,720
is the blood of his son.

974
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,520
That's it, there's no other payment.

975
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,520
There's some things that the folks in Hebrews

976
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,359
that are being written to,

977
00:49:38,359 --> 00:49:40,840
they endured because of their conversion.

978
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,720
Can I tell you this morning,

979
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:43,400
there may be some things that we have to endure.

980
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,720
Some hardships, some afflictions,

981
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,280
some reproaches, some difficulties.

982
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,599
Can I tell you that we can endure them joyfully

983
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:53,460
if we have the knowledge of this world is not my home?

984
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,080
If we have the knowledge that I'm seeking a better city.

985
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:58,919
Amen?

986
00:49:58,919 --> 00:50:00,080
We see that in Hebrews 11.

987
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,460
And this morning, would you be encouraged by that?

988
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:09,460
promises of God's Word. Be encouraged by the promise of a soon coming. A little

989
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:14,620
while. He that shall come will come and will not tarry. I hope that encourages

990
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:19,340
this morning. Hope you're encouraged by the principle that the just shall live

991
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:26,580
by faith. We are not of them that draw back. No, no. We're pressing on forward by

992
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:34,420
faith. Amen. We serve a great God. I am so thankful to have the truth of the Word

993
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:43,100
of God. I am so thankful that someone was willing to give the gospel to our family.

994
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:48,580
That someone gave the gospel to you. We sang to start our service this morning. I

995
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:55,420
love to tell the story. I really do. I love to talk about Jesus and what he did

996
00:50:55,420 --> 00:51:01,940
for me. I hope it doesn't grow old for you. When you recognize what he did for

997
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:07,860
you, what he can do for others, he is able to save. Amen. What a joy. Let's pray.

998
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:13,900
Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for the truth of

999
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:21,380
thy Word. We thank you for the efficacy of Christ's blood. Lord, I pray this

1000
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:26,660
morning that if there's one present in our property, there's one that's tuned in

1001
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:31,300
via live stream, that has never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal

1002
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:38,580
Savior. They're trying some other way. Trying to be a good person. They're

1003
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:44,700
trying to follow some religious creed or teaching. God, I pray this morning that

1004
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:51,380
the Holy Spirit of God would convince them of this truth. They're a sinner in

1005
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:56,780
need of a Savior. The only Savior is the Lord Jesus Christ. That he accomplished

1006
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:06,260
in the offering of himself remission of sin. And if this morning we accept the

1007
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:13,300
payment of Christ's blood to be applied to our account. That we believe that he

1008
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:18,940
is God and that he died on the cross. He was buried and rose in victory. And we

1009
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:26,860
receive the gift of God, which is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. We

1010
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:31,100
can have that assurance of heaven. Lord, I pray that you'd work in hearts and

1011
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:37,860
lives. Lord, I think of the many that are here that would stand and testify, I've

1012
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:43,460
been saved. I've been born again. I belong to Jesus. I've accepted Christ as

1013
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:48,420
my Savior. This morning I pray that you'd help us to be encouraged and

1014
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:52,940
strengthened. I pray God that you'd help us to have our eyes on Jesus, the author

1015
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:58,300
and finisher of our faith. I pray God this morning that you'd use us to reach a

1016
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:05,140
lost and dying world. Help us to be mindful on a daily basis that he that

1017
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:11,460
shall come will come. Lord, help us to live our days for thee. I pray that you'd

1018
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:15,620
work during this time of invitation as only you can. I pray that we would

1019
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:19,660
respond and do business with thee. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you

1020
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:22,580
stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's gonna play quietly on

1021
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:26,700
the piano. As she does, the altar's open. If you'd like to make your way to the

1022
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,620
altar, you're free to do so. If you want to pray in your seat right where you are,

1023
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:36,300
make your your pew an altar. It's perfectly acceptable. Let's respond to

1024
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:41,380
the Lord this morning. As Kimberly plays, the altar's open.
