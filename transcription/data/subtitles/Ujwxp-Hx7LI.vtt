WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.559
gives us the opportunity to record ahead of time and so Kimberly recorded and then playback

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:11.479
and so that's a blessing and that way they could stand up here as a trio and sing together

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:15.359
and 1st Samuel chapter number 7 verses 3 through 12 will be the text that we'll be looking

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:16.360
at this morning.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.319
Again, as I mentioned just a few minutes ago, tomorrow is the official observance of Memorial

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:26.120
Day here in the United States of America and you know, it's really sad and this has happened

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.299
not only with Memorial Day, with a lot of holidays in our country.

00:00:30.299 --> 00:00:35.400
They become commercialized, they really lose their meaning in what's going on.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.439
There's some real roots, there's actually, if you look at the history of Memorial Day

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:44.560
as to where it really originated, there's a very valid story for it originating right

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.080
here in the Commonwealth of Virginia and the first person to die during the Civil War was

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:57.279
actually right here in Fairfax and that was supposedly the first graveside that was decorated

00:00:57.279 --> 00:01:02.720
understanding their sacrifice and so there's some ties here to the Commonwealth of Virginia

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.959
but of course we know that there's such a distraction with the society in which we live.

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:14.480
You ask common people today, young people today, what's Memorial Day and many of them

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.260
just have no idea.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.779
In fact, I listened to a survey take place not long ago and they were asking about certain

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:24.540
holidays and the person finally just gave up and said, listen, as long as I get off

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.660
work and I get paid for it, I'm just happy and that's just sad.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.620
That's just the perspective of far too many and that's why we see obviously a lack of

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.580
appreciation in what takes place but I'm so thankful for memorials.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.019
You know, the word memorial is a word that means it's something designed to preserve

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:48.059
the memory of either a person or an event.

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:52.019
Throughout the Word of God, there are many times in which God specifically tells His

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:54.779
people to set up a memorial.

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:58.900
Probably one of the most common that we can think of in our minds is when they cross the

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.180
Jordan River and after they'd crossed the Jordan River, of course, specifically there

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.580
in the book of Joshua, they are given the responsibility, the command to set up stones

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.580
as a memorial.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.580
In fact, they do two, one in the midst of Jordan and then once in the place where they

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.699
would camp in Gilgal.

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:21.779
We read of that and we see that there was a very obvious purpose for the memorial.

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:25.699
Not only did God give them a plan and a place for where the memorial would be but He then

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:31.020
gave them the purpose and here's what He says there in Joshua 4 that when your children

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.860
should ask, what mean ye these stones?

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.100
Then you have an opportunity to teach them and to share with them all that God did and

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.539
how God moved and how God worked and what a wonderful truth that we find in that passage

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:45.699
of Scripture.

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:51.020
Of course, we can think about the Passover for the children of the nation of Israel and

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.779
the observance of the Passover, of course, a reminder of what God did in delivering them

00:02:55.779 --> 00:03:00.899
from Egyptian bondage and, of course, Christ, our Passover as we come to the New Testament

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:05.460
and understanding what He did and going to the cross of Calvary for our sin, paying that

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.820
awful price, rising, being buried and then rising again triumphantly.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.059
And in the New Testament, of course, we have two observances that we have as a local church,

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:21.419
the ordinances of the church, the Lord's Supper and that of baptism and we're thankful for

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:27.660
how even this table before me this morning, it says, this do in remembrance of me as we

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.460
observe the Lord's Supper.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.460
It's a memorial, it's a table of remembrance and I'm thankful for being reminded of some

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.419
things and, of course, most importantly, as we think about the ordinances for the church,

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:43.699
it's a reminder of the death, burial and glorious resurrection of our Savior.

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.259
And then, of course, you think about the Lord's Supper.

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:50.419
He says, as often as you eat this bread or drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.979
and then I love these words, till He come.

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:55.139
He's coming again.

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.300
We don't know the hour nor the day, but we ought to be diligent doing the work that God's

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.919
called us to do.

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:05.240
As we look at our place here this morning in 1 Samuel chapter number 7, we find that

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.160
here you will not find the word memorial, but I believe that as we look at the passage

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.000
of Scripture and we understand that a memorial is something designed to preserve the memory

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.040
of a person or of an event, I believe that as we look at this passage of Scripture in

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:27.079
this text, that Samuel takes a stone, he sets this stone up and he names this stone and

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:29.320
he names it Ebenezer.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.279
And he names it Ebenezer, why?

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:33.079
Because the Lord helped them.

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:37.720
In fact, we'd be familiar with this truth if you are mindful of the song that we sing

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.679
in our hymnals, number 26 in our hymnal, Come Thou Fount.

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:43.239
We're familiar with that song.

00:04:43.239 --> 00:04:47.320
In our hymnal, they've changed the words, but many of you that have sung this song may

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.959
be from another hymnal.

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:54.079
You would be mindful of the fact that in verse number 2 of this great hymn, it says, Here

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:58.540
I raise mine Ebenezer.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.660
Our songbook says, Here I raise my sign of victory.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.739
Whenever we sing this song, you probably hear both Dean and I say, Here I raise mine Ebenezer.

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:07.920
That's where I learned it.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.859
That's how I learned the song and this particular hymnal changed the wording.

00:05:13.859 --> 00:05:18.299
But we're familiar with this term or this word Ebenezer and we look in this passage

00:05:18.299 --> 00:05:24.559
of Scripture and I believe this morning that this is a memorial, a reminder for the people

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:25.700
of God.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.339
There's not much reference with regard to this particular stone that was raised outside

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:35.859
of this passage of Scripture, but I find as we look at this passage that I trust it'll

00:05:35.859 --> 00:05:40.579
be a blessing to you and encouragement to you as we see what God does and how God works.

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:44.540
Look in verse number 12 and then we'll get into the message starting back in verse number

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.540
3.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.940
But verse 12 is where we see the setting up of this stone.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.299
Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called the name of it

00:05:54.299 --> 00:06:00.100
Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.500
I am thankful that our God is a very present help in the time of trouble.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.700
I am thankful that our God is not only able to help, but He's available to help.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.459
I'm thankful that the Bible teaches us as we look in the book of Psalms, I will lift

00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:16.940
up mine eyes into the hills, from whence cometh my help?

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.179
My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.

00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:24.100
And I'm thankful that the Creator God is my God.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.339
He's my Savior, He's my Redeemer, but He is my Helper.

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:33.739
And as we look at this passage of Scripture, we find that Samuel, the prophet of God, he's

00:06:33.739 --> 00:06:40.500
being used of the Lord in this passage, and as he's used of God as they experience victory,

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.859
he takes some time, and we'll get to it at the end of the message, but he takes some

00:06:43.859 --> 00:06:51.140
time to select this stone, to set up this stone, and to even name the stone.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.140
Why?

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:55.700
So the people would be reminded of what God did.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:03.420
They'd be reminded of how God interceded and how He worked mightily on their behalf.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.859
As you look at the passage of Scripture, first I notice in verse number three, I notice first

00:07:07.859 --> 00:07:10.260
of all a promise of deliverance.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.820
Notice with me in verse number three, the Bible says that Samuel spake unto all the

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:18.619
house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put away

00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:24.420
the strange gods and Astaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the Lord,

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:30.100
and serve Him only, and He will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.420
As we look at this first verse of Scripture with regard to our message this morning, I

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:38.019
notice this promise of deliverance, but as Samuel begins to address the people, before

00:07:38.019 --> 00:07:43.380
we even get to the promise of deliverance, we find that God makes us aware of the condition

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:48.079
of the people, and we find that here in verse number three, the condition of the nation

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:50.239
of Israel is not a very good condition.

00:07:50.239 --> 00:07:51.239
It's not favorable.

00:07:51.239 --> 00:07:56.399
In fact, the Bible tells us that they were rebellious people, that they were an idolatrous

00:07:56.399 --> 00:07:59.200
people, and they were an oppressed people.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.359
And you think about those three distinctions and those explanations with regard to the

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:09.399
circumstances or the condition of the people of Israel at this particular time, this isn't

00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:12.920
a great time in Israel's history, that they would be rebellious.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.019
They had been given the truth of God's Word.

00:08:15.019 --> 00:08:17.619
They had been instructed in the ways of the Lord.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:24.019
They had been given the law of the Lord, and yet they chose to rebel.

00:08:24.019 --> 00:08:27.779
They refused to do what God had called them to do.

00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:31.179
We find that not only are they rebellious, but they're idolatrous.

00:08:31.179 --> 00:08:35.700
Now we understand as we study the Old Testament, as we study the nation of Israel, we find

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.679
that oftentimes they're guilty of this sin of idolatry.

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:46.140
You find that often they are just hindered because of this idolatrous worship that they

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.219
engage in.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.380
We find that God is a jealous God.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.559
He says, thou shalt have no other gods before me.

00:08:53.559 --> 00:08:58.960
We find that He will not and He should not share His glory with any other.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:04.140
We find that as the nation of Israel would be exposed to people that were idol-worshipping

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:10.940
people, people that were polytheistic in their beliefs, we find that God would instruct them

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:16.299
with regard to the Egyptians who were a polytheistic nation, with regard to the inhabitants of

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:21.659
the land that served strange gods, that God said, listen, you're not to do after the manner

00:09:21.659 --> 00:09:25.340
of the Egyptians and you're not to do after the manner of the people of the land.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.340
Why?

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:30.099
Because I'm your God and you're to serve me.

00:09:30.099 --> 00:09:34.700
But yet how often they serve idols.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.859
They're guilty of idolatrous worship.

00:09:36.859 --> 00:09:40.159
Here it says, if you do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, notice what He says

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:45.859
in the middle of the verse, then put away, notice what He says, the strange gods and

00:09:45.859 --> 00:09:47.900
Ashtaroth from among you.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.700
Isn't that sad?

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:55.340
That the prophet of God is writing to the people of God and He's calling them out on

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.580
their idolatry.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.739
I'm thankful for the boldness of Samuel.

00:09:58.739 --> 00:09:59.820
I'm thankful for the...

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:05.180
straightforward preaching, if we could call it that this morning, of Samuel

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.380
as he confronts the people of God about their sin.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:12.020
He's not sugarcoating it. He's not telling them they just made a little mistake.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:18.460
He's telling them, you're idolatrous and you need to put away these strange gods and Astaroth.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.740
It's good counsel, by the way.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.580
We notice that they're oppressed.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:30.460
The oppression, no doubt, is the result of their rebellion and their idolatry.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.660
The Bible tells us at the end of verse number three,

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.060
and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:40.740
It's the Philistines that were oppressing the nation of Israel at this particular time in their history.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:45.420
We find that as we study the history of Israel, especially in the book of Judges,

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:50.980
you will find that cycle of oppression in different people groups that God would use,

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:56.380
that God would allow to oppress His people because of their sinful behavior.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:01.020
And we find that here at this particular time in the life and ministry of Samuel,

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.260
it's the Philistines that are oppressing the people of God,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.180
and they are in this terrible circumstance,

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:10.740
and it's because of their idolatry, because of their rebellion.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.060
Listen, sin is a reproach to any people.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:17.260
This goes as a nation, this goes truly as an individual as well.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:21.940
The Bible tells us in the book of 1 John that we're to keep ourselves from idols.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:26.100
We find in the book of Colossians that in chapter number one, in verse number 18,

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.860
the Bible's speaking about the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the head of the church.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:36.500
It tells us that in all things, He must have the preeminence.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:41.020
There should be nothing that would take place of God in our lives.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.420
Not one thing.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:47.900
We don't have idols in this land like some other places would.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.940
We don't have shrines, for the most part,

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:56.220
in our homes with little different statues and what have you.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:00.020
We'd never, those that are under the sound of my voice this morning,

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.260
we would never have in our home some idol.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:10.380
We'd never have some thing, some shrine, something that we'd bow down to in our home.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:16.180
But we'd allow other things to take place of God.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.980
It doesn't have to be a little idol that's made of wood

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.380
in order for us to be guilty of idolatry.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:27.460
We find here that the people of God, they were guilty of idolatry.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.260
Oh, even in the New Testament, keep yourselves from idols.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.980
An idol is anything that takes place of God.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.780
Oftentimes today they talk about money being an idol.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.220
You know, for some it is.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.780
The Bible tells us that the love of money is the root of all evil.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.260
In fact, I was at a pizza shop not long ago,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.620
and just up here, King's Pizza,

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.980
and they have a little tip jar on the counter there,

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.980
and it says money is the root of all evil, therefore give us a tip.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.980
And I said, excuse me, could I help you with your sign here?

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:01.980
It actually says, the Bible says the love of money is the root of all evil, not money.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:06.420
And they said, well, whatever.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.260
But the fact of the matter is that they were loving the money,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.660
even as they were trying to use a Bible verse out of context, right?

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.100
Money can become an idol.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.660
Sports can become an idol.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.780
Your job can become an idol.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.900
A spouse or a child could become an idol.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.340
Think about it.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.580
How many things could become an idol in our lives?

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:33.020
Oh, in all things, He, Christ, must have the preeminence.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.620
As we notice here, the condition of the people,

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:39.860
let us not lose sight of the promise of deliverance that is given in verse number three.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.660
I'm so thankful that our God is a loving, gracious, merciful God.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.140
I'm thankful that He's slow to anger, that He's ready to pardon,

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.780
and He offers deliverance.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.900
And I'm thankful that though the condition of the nation of Israel is dim,

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:58.620
and though they're a rebellious, idolatrous people that are oppressed by the Philistines,

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.300
notice what God says through Samuel.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:06.940
He says, if you do return unto the Lord with all your hearts.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.260
Listen, God wants your heart.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.540
He wants all of it.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.740
He doesn't want part of you.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:11.660
He wants all of you.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.060
He died and saved all of you.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.339
And here, the Bible says, with all of your hearts.

00:14:16.339 --> 00:14:17.980
Notice what He says at the end.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:23.100
Prepare your hearts unto the Lord and serve Him only.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:30.339
And notice this, and He will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.

00:14:30.339 --> 00:14:34.619
When I notice this promise of deliverance, I notice that it's a conditional promise.

00:14:34.619 --> 00:14:37.220
You see there that little word, if.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.540
And often as we look at the Word of God, we find promises,

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.779
and how thankful we are for the promises of the Word of God,

00:14:43.779 --> 00:14:48.339
where God's Word, all of His promises are precious promises.

00:14:48.339 --> 00:14:51.380
We find that we sing the song standing on the promises,

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:57.220
and we ought to be mindful regularly of the promises that God has given us in His Word.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.140
Some promises are conditional, as this one.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.339
Some promises are unconditional.

00:15:02.339 --> 00:15:07.260
And I'm thankful for both promises, whether they be conditional or unconditional.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:11.020
But here we find that the promise before us is a conditional promise.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:17.420
For Samuel says, by the Word of the Lord, he says here to the house of Israel,

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.100
he says, if ye return unto the Lord with all your hearts,

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.179
and prepare your hearts unto the Lord and serve Him only,

00:15:24.179 --> 00:15:31.179
that He will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.

00:15:31.179 --> 00:15:33.660
I'm thankful for this promise of deliverance.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.380
The Lord had called these people to repentance.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:40.100
That's really what we see in verse number three, this idea of returning unto the Lord.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.860
They needed to repent because of their rebellion, because of their idolatry.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:48.940
And as they would repent, God was going to deliver them from the oppression of the Philistines.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:53.020
Listen, I believe this morning that as Samuel stood before the people of God

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:57.860
and spoke the message of God, and he told them how that God would deliver,

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.740
I believe that it brought them a level of excitement, a level of expectation

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:05.339
of how God would move and how God would work in their midst.

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:07.300
Listen, our God is able.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.380
Our God is able to deliver.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:13.140
And we read throughout the Word of God of so many wonderful examples

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.339
of how God has delivered His people.

00:16:16.339 --> 00:16:19.420
I'm thankful for the truth as you look in Daniel chapter number six

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.300
with Daniel in the den of lions.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:26.619
And he's there and Darius says, listen, I know that your God, whom you serve continually,

00:16:26.619 --> 00:16:28.740
is able to deliver you.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:34.899
Now think about that just for a moment, the impact and influence that Daniel had on the king.

00:16:34.899 --> 00:16:41.300
That the king had confidence that Daniel's God was able.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:45.940
And after he, the king, had a sleepless night, he comes to that place and he says,

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:49.740
hey Daniel, is your God, has He delivered you?

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:56.580
And Daniel responds in the affirmative, he says, yes, my God has delivered me.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:57.700
He's able.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.820
We sing the song, He is able to deliver thee.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.179
It's a wonderful song.

00:17:03.179 --> 00:17:07.059
Often as I think about the words of that song and I think about the truth that's carried

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:12.740
through that song, the reality is that He is able to deliver us from anything.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.779
And I'm thankful for that.

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:20.700
And I believe that as the nation of Israel would hear the words of Samuel as he spoke

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:28.220
to the house of Israel, that they would have rejoiced in hearing of this promise of deliverance.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:32.540
Not only as I look at the text of Scripture do I first notice this promise of deliverance,

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:38.940
but next if you're taking notes, number two, I notice a prayer for deliverance.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:44.300
I've often said this over the years, it's worth repeating, that prayer is our greatest

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.220
expression of dependence.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:51.100
You know, so often we look at what's wrong in our nation and I mentioned that this morning

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:56.220
a little bit of all the problems in our nation, but really, truly, judgment must begin at

00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.420
the house of God and so many of the problems in our nation are problems of a result of

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.619
a church that's failed to do what it's supposed to do.

00:18:04.619 --> 00:18:06.940
Truly is.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.880
We've stopped praying like we should pray.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:16.160
And churches all across this land, you know what the first service they take off the calendar

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.279
is prayer meeting.

00:18:18.279 --> 00:18:21.040
You know why prayer meeting is a service that people remove from their calendar?

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.720
Because it's the least attended service of the week.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:30.260
Traditionally, I mean, you just go across the whole land, you'll find that prayer meeting

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:34.160
is the least attended service of churches.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.280
And that's why churches are closing their doors on prayer meeting night.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.280
Why?

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.280
No one's coming.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.799
Why are we going to have church?

00:18:41.799 --> 00:18:44.440
Then they close church on Sunday nights.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.119
And when we ought to be having more church, we're having less church, right?

00:18:48.119 --> 00:18:55.320
And we find here that prayer, we need a revival of prayer, personally, corporately.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.840
And we see here that there's this prayer for deliverance.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.679
Notice in verse number four, then the children of Israel did put away Balaam and Ashtaroth

00:19:02.679 --> 00:19:03.880
and served the Lord only.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.140
Isn't that wonderful?

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:09.780
Notice in verse number four, how they respond to the call that was issued in verse number

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.100
three.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:15.780
They respond to the message that Samuel had delivered to them, and they put away these

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.700
strange gods, these idols, and they serve God.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:24.660
And notice what Samuel says in verse number five, gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.380
pray for you unto the Lord.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:32.220
Aren't you thankful for that commitment to prayer?

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:37.500
Samuel says, listen, you gather everyone, gather all Israel to Mizpah, and here's what

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.500
I'm going to do.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.020
I will pray for you unto the Lord.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.820
If you notice in your Bibles this morning, Lord, at the end of verse number five is all

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:46.820
caps.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.539
It's Jehovah God.

00:19:49.539 --> 00:19:56.700
The proper name of God is used here in this verse of Scripture, the self-existent one.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.900
We find that Samuel makes this commitment to prayer.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:05.980
And notice what happens after he voices this commitment to pray in verse number six. It says and they gathered together

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.400
to mispa

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:13.200
that's what he told him to do in verse number five and they drew water and poured it out before the Lord and fasted on

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:20.060
that day and said there we have sinned against the Lord and Samuel judged the children of Israel in mispa and when the

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.700
Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to mispa the Lords of the Philistines went up against Israel

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:31.620
And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines now just for a moment Lotus in verse number seven

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.080
How that the enemy is trying to seize the opportunity

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:42.680
The enemy really in verse number six seven sees that there's a perfect opportunity and therefore they're going to seize that

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.800
Opportunity why because they're all gathered together at the same place

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:51.000
And so this is gonna make our job a lot easier and we're gonna go in notice in verse number seven that the Lords of

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:58.020
the Philistines they went up against Israel and the children of Israel they heard it and they were afraid of the Philistines and

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:03.460
Notice what they do notice how they respond to that which has transpired in verse number eight

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.500
It says that the children of Israel said to Samuel notice what they say

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:14.500
cease not to cry under the Lord our God for us that he will save us out of the hand of

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:21.180
The Philistines so Samuel has made a commitment to pray we find that in verse number eight the nation of Israel

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:26.580
Voices a request for prayer and notice that it's very specific in nature

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:34.840
They say cease not to cry unto the Lord our God for us that he will save us out of the hand

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.840
of the Philistines

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.600
But I think about Samuel praying I

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.780
Think about his mom

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.280
Hannah

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.280
She prayed didn't she?

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.760
She prayed

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.760
Read first Samuel chapter number one

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:56.280
When they came to make offerings where you find Hannah is praying

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.600
in

00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.600
fact

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:05.840
Hannah describes her prayer this way if you turn back hold your place there in first Samuel chapter number seven

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.180
But look back if you will at first Samuel chapter number one

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:14.520
The Bible tells us in verse number ten that she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the Lord and wept sore

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:20.920
Eli thought that she had been drunk and why because she didn't pray audibly

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:27.560
But her lips were moving as she prayed and Eli assumed so erroneously

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.080
Notice what Hannah says in verse 15

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.080
She said no my lord. I am a woman of a soul

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.140
My lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:45.300
I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have noticed this poured out my soul

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.220
before the Lord

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.900
Hannah prayed

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.900
Samuel was brought to Eli to minister as a young boy

00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:02.700
Hannah would come back and visit bring a coat and I can't help but think that during that time of

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:10.560
Rearing him in those early years and even as she'd returned that he would see in his mother a praying mother a

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.600
Praying mother and now he's praying

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.840
He says gather to miss pot and I will pray for you unto the Lord and the circumstances

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:24.480
Changed the Philistine see that there are gathered together at miss pot

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:32.440
They're going to seize the opportunity and and they cry out they cry to Samuel and they say Samuel cease not

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:37.960
To pray for us to pray unto the Lord our God for us that he

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:46.120
Will save us out of the hand of the Philistines. I do not see here in verse number eight that there's any self-reliance whatsoever. I

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:51.000
Don't see amongst the children of Israel that they have this belief that they can

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.400
Go into battle against the Philistines and come out victorious

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.200
We find that there are times no doubt in which that's been the case

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:00.780
We find that with

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:06.540
The the nation of Israel as they go into the land of promise when they're going to go to AI after they'd been

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.940
Victorious at Jericho. We know that there was sin in the camp

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:15.100
But in addition to sin in the camp, do you remember what the people said to Joshua? Don't make all of us go

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:19.020
It's not that big of a city. Just let a few thousand of us go and we can handle it

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.820
Prayer is dependence upon God our

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.280
Sufficiency Paul says is in Christ

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.640
So often we speak and we understand

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.420
Humanly speaking how we talk about being independent

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:44.040
Not having any dependence on some other person

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:49.760
We try to raise our kids to be independent that they're not dependent on us as their parents forever

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.920
Amen or dependent on the government. Amen

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.060
But that they can go out and they can provide for themselves

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:01.220
but sometimes one of the dangers as Americans of talking about this thing of

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:07.620
Independence is that it can even seep into our thought with regard to church life and in our Christian life

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.300
and the reality is that

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:12.340
spiritually speaking

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:16.420
We absolutely have to be living in

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.400
Independence

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:25.540
Upon the Lord. We cannot be independent from him. We must be dependent upon him. Jesus said

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.320
What I am the vine?

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:33.920
Ye are the branches. That's what Jesus says. He as the Lord Jesus Christ as God in flesh

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:40.000
He says I am the vine ye my people my children those that I have saved

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.200
You're the branches and he says this without me

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:48.900
You can do nothing. I know sometimes we struggle with that we say man I can do a lot of things

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.300
You can't even breathe without God

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.900
Amen

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.660
God's not only the creator, but he's the sustainer. He holds it all together

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.700
And it's only by God's amazing grace

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.780
You know how fragile we are as human beings?

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.920
Seriously fragile Oh God's grace

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:19.120
Spiritually speaking we have to be dependent upon him and we see here in verse number eight that the the nation of Israel

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.120
They are dependent upon God

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:27.040
Not only did Samuel make a commitment to pray we find the people made requests for specific prayer

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:31.920
And then as I continue reading I find in verse number nine that there's fervent prayer

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.000
You know in the New Testament in the book of James

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.140
The Bible tells us that the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man of veileth much

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:44.140
He's using the example in that passage of Scripture of Elijah and you read in first Kings chapter 17

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:48.940
You begin to read about the life of Elijah and how he prayed and how God worked and he says this

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:54.940
I've prayed these things as he comes there to the place in chapter 18 where fire comes from heaven and consumes that offering

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:58.540
He says I've prayed all these things according to the law of God

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:06.680
And here we find that Samuel is praying fervently the Bible says in verse number nine and Samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it for a

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.680
Burnt offering holy unto the Lord and notice what it says Samuel cried

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.680
unto the Lord for Israel. I

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:18.680
Love the next words and the Lord heard him

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.680
I

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:26.680
Love the next words and the Lord heard him

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.620
Heard him

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:33.660
And the Lord heard him. Aren't you thankful that we serve a God who hears and answers prayer?

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.380
What a joy

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:40.200
It was just reading this morning how that King Solomon was

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.180
dedicating the temple

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:47.600
I was reading that this morning in my devotions and all the offerings that were brought but you know

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.740
God responds and he says I've heard your prayer

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.420
God hears us when we pray

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.720
I'm so thankful for that

00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:01.240
to use the example of Elijah which we mentioned from James 5 and in first Kings 17 and 18 and

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:06.980
First Kings 18 with all that's taking place. Remember all those bail worshipers. They're crying out to bail, aren't they?

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:13.580
Elijah kind of mocks them a little bit. Where is your God? He must be on a journey. I

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:19.480
Mean they're doing everything they can to try to get bail to respond with fire. They're cutting themselves

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.680
They're I mean they're doing everything they can but bail is just a false. God

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:28.420
It's just an idol made with the the made by with wood by the hands of man

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:36.340
God says of idols that they have ears, but they hear not they have eyes, but they see not you can fashion an idol

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.140
However you want

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.619
but we serve the Living God and he hears and

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.900
Samuel cries out to God

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:51.020
I see the fervency of his prayer and the Bible says that he cried unto the Lord for Israel and the Lord heard him and

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:57.640
I want you to notice in verse number 10, and it's just a little word, but it's so significant the Bible says and as

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:04.860
Samuel was offering up the burnt offering. What was he doing in addition to offering that burnt offering?

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:10.380
He was praying he was crying out to the Lord and the Bible says that as he was doing that as

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:18.260
Samuel was offering this burnt offering as Samuel was crying out unto the Lord as he was pouring his heart out to God

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:27.100
the Bible says in verse number 10 that the Philistines drew near to paddle against Israel and then notice these three words, but

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.800
The Lord what did he do?

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.660
He answered prayer

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.680
It says but the Lord

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:42.119
Thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines and discomfited them and they were smitten

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.280
before

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.280
Israel as

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:51.440
Samuel was praying God was working in that awesome

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.680
Listen God's always right on time

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:59.180
He's never late seldom early

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:06.940
right? How many of us have found we sometimes we think our timing is better, right? God,

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:14.220
but God's always on time. And as Samuel was offering this offering, this burnt offering,

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:19.820
and as Samuel is praying, he's crying out unto the Lord, the Lord heard him and the Lord moved.

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:26.140
And as this was taking place, the Lord thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:33.740
Philistines and discomfited them and they were smitten before Israel. It tells us that after

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:40.700
the Lord intervened in verse number 11, the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:47.020
the Philistines and smote them until they came under Beth-char. Wow, what a victory.

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:55.980
God had promised deliverance. God had used Samuel in verse number three to call out the people of

00:30:55.980 --> 00:31:02.460
God with regard to their sinful behavior, their rebellious, idolatrous behavior that led to

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:08.860
oppression. And he said, listen, if you turn, if you repent, if you get right and you serve God,

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:15.580
that God will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines, that God is able. And so we see that

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:21.180
there's the promise for deliverance. We find that there's the prayer for deliverance. And then I

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:27.100
want you to notice as we finish up this morning, I want you to notice that they praise the Lord

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:34.460
for deliverance. You know, this is an important aspect. How often does God move and work and how

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:42.060
often does God answer prayer? And sometimes we don't even pause to praise him. There are so

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:50.220
many things that we unfortunately take for granted in our lives. How many times have we prayed

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:56.620
that God would give us traveling mercies and we arrive and we see the loved ones that we're going

00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:01.900
to visit with and they're ready to greet us and they're standing at the door and we can't hardly

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:06.540
get the vehicle in park and they're at the door and we're jumping out and we never pause to thank

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:16.460
God. Right? But here we find in the verse of Scripture in verse 12 that I read by way of

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:22.380
introduction this morning that they praise the Lord for deliverance. See, they understood, Samuel

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:29.500
understood very plainly, he had this understanding that the Lord delivered his people. This was not

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:35.820
Samuel's victory. This was not the people of Israel just coming up with some wonderful plan

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:42.540
militarily to go and to defeat the Philistines and to have victory. No, see, Samuel understood

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:48.220
that it was God that delivered his people. He understood that God had demonstrated his power

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:57.820
in direct response to prayer. So, Samuel responds. And his response in verse number 12,

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:06.220
I believe, is both appropriate and exemplary. I believe that as we note what Samuel does here in

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:11.580
verse number 12 that we would agree that this is an appropriate response to what has taken place,

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:19.660
that there's a pause to praise God for what he did. It's exemplary in the fact that we, too,

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:29.020
should follow the example. Notice again in verse number 12 the actions of Samuel. The Bible says,

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:36.860
then Samuel took a stone. That's just such a simple statement, is it not? I'm not sure of

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:44.140
the size of the stone. I found one of these little, man, the flowers are gone. That tricked me.

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:49.260
Holly, thank you. There were some Easter lilies right here, right? They were here this morning.

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:54.540
It's still this morning, and they're gone. It's like flowers raptured or something. I don't know.

00:33:55.340 --> 00:34:00.540
But there were little stones in those flowers, and somehow or another one of those little stones

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:07.740
ended up at my house. How did that happen? I have no idea. I found one on the floor the other day

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:10.700
here in the auditorium. I don't know if a little kid was playing with it or what happened, but I

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:14.140
found one at my house, and so I brought it over this morning, and I put it in there.

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:19.100
But when I think about the stone, it's such a simple statement. I don't think it was just a

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:25.660
little tiny stone. I don't know the size of the stone. The Bible doesn't tell us how big or small

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:32.300
the stone is, but I want you to understand that Samuel took some time, and he found this stone.

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:37.740
I don't know what it looked like. I don't know its characteristics,

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:44.940
but as I find that he took the stone, and then the Bible says that he set it, the stone,

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:55.660
between Mizpah and Shen. So he selected a stone, and then he placed that stone in a particular

00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:03.420
area in between Mizpah and Shen, according to verse number 12, and he places that stone there,

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:10.860
and then the Bible says that he called the name of it Ebenezer. Now, this is a very purposed

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:19.180
procedure, is it not? I mean, Samuel is going through great lengths in order to put this stone

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:27.660
in this place. Samuel is taking some time after the victory has been taken place, after God moved

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:33.980
and worked, and he intervened on the behalf of his people, and he did what he said he would do,

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:40.620
as he always does, that Samuel very purposed in his actions, that Samuel takes some time,

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:47.580
and he gathers, he finds this stone, and he places it in this place, and then he names the stone

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:55.180
Ebenezer. How many of you have named a stone? I've never named a stone.

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:59.580
I know there are some people that have pet rocks. I never understood it.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:05.260
You can talk to me later, amen? I just don't get it. I don't understand that thing of invisible

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:11.260
friends either. I just don't have an imagination for it, amen? But listen, somebody already came

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:16.540
to me this morning and told me he wanted a pet. What does he want now? A tarantula. What's wrong

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:23.020
with that boy? I want a pet tarantula. Get him a pet rock, amen? But the reality is that I've never

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:29.900
named a stone before. There was something significant in this. There was something

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:38.300
purposed in what Samuel was doing. He took the time to find the stone, to place the stone in a

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:46.060
specific place, and then to name it, and in selecting the name, he was purposed. You know,

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:54.140
the names in the Bible are significant. In fact, still today in some cultures,

00:36:54.140 --> 00:37:01.020
names are significant. There's much thought that goes into the names that people give their

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:06.060
children. I've had conversation with the Ekinwin family in the past about the names of their

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:12.860
children and how they were selected and what they mean. It's awesome.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:19.420
Why did I name my daughter Juliana? Because we like the name. I mean, there's really no thought

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:27.660
put into it. But that's not how it is for a lot of countries, a lot of cultures.

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:35.900
When he named it Ebenezer, and we understand the culture of the times,

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:45.820
there's significance in why he named a stone Ebenezer. Notice what it says, saying,

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:55.420
hitherto hath the Lord helped us. You know the reality today, just as it was for the nation of

00:37:55.420 --> 00:38:05.820
Israel? In the time of victory, there is great danger in forgetting the Lord.

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:16.540
In the time of victory. See, listen, when we're on the mountaintop or when we're in the valley,

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:26.300
we need God. We need God just as much on the mountain as we do in the valley,

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:33.100
right? But what happens sometimes, if we're not careful, is when we're in the valley,

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:42.460
I know that I need God because my situation is desperate. The Philistines are gathering

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:46.620
against us, and we're all in one place, and this is no good.

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:57.180
But when I have victory, when I'm on the mountain, do you remember Gideon?

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:07.980
Why did God take His army down so far? When it started, when it started,

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:16.620
Gideon and the army were far outnumbered. But God said, you have too many. Excuse me?

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:23.020
You know how many of them there are? You know how many of us? What do you mean we have too many?

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:31.660
That's probably what I would say. God said, tell whoever wants to go home they can go home.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:42.060
Now, what military? Who does that? Right? Bam. All right, I'm going home.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:47.500
God says there's still too many. He made them drink some water.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:55.900
He took His army down to what? Three hundred. Three hundred. And God said, all right, now we're

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.860
ready. Now we're going to go.

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:06.460
go. Why? Because God was going to show them beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was God

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:13.160
who gave the victory. Because He told them, He said, listen, if I give you the victory

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:19.720
with that large army, you're going to vaunt yourself. You're going to say, we did it.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:28.960
There is danger on the mountain. There is danger in time of victory, of thinking we

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:37.880
did this. Do you remember King Uzziah? The Bible tells us of King Uzziah that he was

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:49.080
marvelously helped, and then there's these words, till he was strong. And what does he

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:57.160
do? He goes and does stuff he's not supposed to do, and he becomes leprous. Right? You

00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:06.560
can read it, King Uzziah. God helped him, but when he was strong, then he became dependent

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:13.240
on himself. And here, Samuel, he knows the people that God is calling him to minister

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:20.760
to, and so he purposefully takes the time to get this stone, to place this stone, to

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:29.440
name the stone, to remind the people, it's God who helped us. All that God would help

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:37.040
us this morning. As we think about this stone of help, this ebenezer, this memorial, if

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:45.920
I could call it that, this morning, it served as a recognition of God's power. Amen? It's

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:55.400
God who helped us, but it also served as a reminder to God's people, and how God's people

00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:02.720
needed to be reminded of God's power. Listen, this morning, Jesus said, I will build my

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:09.400
church. I'm thankful that He uses His people, but you understand this morning that we need

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:14.040
God. If we're going to make a difference in this world, if we're going to make a difference

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:21.080
in our community, we need God. It's not that we just go out and have this winsome personality

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:27.000
and we just attract people to ourselves. That's not what it's about. It's about pointing

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:34.600
people to the Savior, because I can't save anybody, and you can't save anybody. And here

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:41.680
in this passage of Scripture in 1 Samuel 7, Samuel says, here's a stone, and its name

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:50.040
is ebenezer. Why? Because God helped us. This morning, there's a promise of deliverance.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:55.680
There's a prayer for deliverance, and then the people, they pause and they praise God

00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:02.720
for the deliverance. Oh, that we would have some memorials in our lives. You say, people

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:11.120
are going to think I'm crazy if I name a stone. Samuel did. Have some memorials as a family,

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:17.240
reminding yourselves of what God did and how God worked, because in that moment of victory,

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:25.080
that mountaintop experience is really when we become so vulnerable to defeat, because

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:29.280
we're so full of ourselves and we think we got it. And in that moment of victory, we

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:36.800
need to be reminded God did it. God did it, so that we continue to be dependent upon Him.

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:43.320
Ebenezer, stone of help. I'm thankful that our God is our helper. Let's pray. Father,

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:48.840
we love You. Thank You for loving us. Thank You for the Word of God. Lord, I pray this

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:57.920
morning that You would help us to recognize Your ability to help. God, would You help

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:05.920
us to be mindful of our dependence upon Thee? Lord, we need You. The songwriter said, I

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:11.080
need Thee every hour. We would submit to You this morning that we need Thee every second

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:19.960
of every minute of every hour of every day. God, without You, we can do nothing. We do

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:27.160
not want to attempt to do any work in our own power. We thank You that You would use

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:33.380
us to accomplish Your will and Your purpose upon this earth, and what joy that is. I pray

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:39.360
that we would always acknowledge, even as Samuel does here in this passage of Scripture,

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:44.320
Your help. I pray, God, that You would move and work in the hearts of Your people this

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:51.760
morning, that You've taken Your Word and somehow ministered to each need that's represented.

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:55.800
I pray, God, that decisions would be made that would please Thee, that we'd make the

00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:02.020
determination to be dependent upon You, to return to prayer as we ought to, that we'd

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:09.980
set up some memorials in our own lives. Maybe we need to go name a stone to be reminded

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:15.300
the Lord helped us. I pray that You'd move and work as only You can, for it's in Christ's

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:19.140
name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. At the end of

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:24.060
each of our services we have a moment of invitation where we give you an opportunity to respond

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:28.780
as the Lord has moved and worked in your heart and life. Kimberly will play quietly on the

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:31.020
piano and as she does, the altar is open.
