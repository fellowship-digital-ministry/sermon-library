1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Chapter number three, Joseph was gonna sing with them,

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,199
but then we remembered that he was taking care

3
00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:06,440
of the sound this morning,

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,119
and so he wasn't able to sing with them,

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,319
but it was a blessing hearing them practice that this week

6
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:15,000
and kind of singing it, and I love that song.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,200
I'm so thankful that God has given us his word.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,079
Second Timothy chapter number three,

9
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:21,959
if you've already looked at the back of the bulletin

10
00:00:21,959 --> 00:00:23,319
this morning, we're gonna be dealing,

11
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:27,200
kind of shifting into a new series, if you will,

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,319
of how God has revealed his greatness.

13
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:33,680
We spent much of the year so far,

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,599
through the month of January

15
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:36,099
into the beginning of February,

16
00:00:36,099 --> 00:00:38,479
dealing with the truth that creation

17
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,479
reveals the greatness of God,

18
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:43,639
and we looked at a number of passages

19
00:00:43,639 --> 00:00:45,759
dealing with the truth of creation,

20
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,159
and then over the last two weeks,

21
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:49,200
we dealt with the fact as we would apply

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,340
that great truth in our lives,

23
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,599
that the creator God is my helper,

24
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:56,200
and what a blessing to know that the God

25
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,560
who spoke it all into existence is our helper personally,

26
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,439
and I'm thankful for that application.

27
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,440
This morning and over the next several weeks,

28
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,940
we're gonna shift our attention to the Bible,

29
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,519
and I'm thankful that God has given us a Bible,

30
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,599
and I believe as I will preach over the next several weeks

31
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:18,440
that as we hold in our hands this great book,

32
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,599
that it reveals to us that our God is great,

33
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,919
the way in which he gave it,

34
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:24,720
the way in which he's preserved it,

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,080
and all that's contained therein,

36
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,879
I believe that inspiration,

37
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:31,559
as we'll focus on this morning specifically,

38
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:35,599
that inspiration reveals the greatness of God.

39
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,400
The content of the Bible

40
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,800
obviously reveals that God is great,

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,120
but the means by which God gave us the Bible

42
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,760
reveals how great he is.

43
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,879
Let me understand this morning

44
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,599
that God could have just dropped a Bible out of the sky

45
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,699
and said, here it is, here's the Bible,

46
00:01:52,699 --> 00:01:56,699
but he chose to reveal it to us over a period of time,

47
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,900
and we'll focus and share some of those statistics here

48
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,919
in just a moment,

49
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,940
but we find this truth of progressive revelation,

50
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,779
if you will,

51
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:07,180
and we see how God in his infinite wisdom,

52
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,059
how he gave us what we hold in our hands this morning,

53
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:14,020
what we hold so dear and so precious,

54
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,940
and by the way, if you take this away, everything crumbles,

55
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,860
because everything that we know to be true about God

56
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,779
is a direct result of what we know

57
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:25,100
that he's given to us in this book,

58
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,460
and so it's absolutely imperative that we understand

59
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,500
the truth that is contained therein and what it is.

60
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,119
I mentioned this several times

61
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,220
a couple of Sunday nights ago

62
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,259
as we finished up with a final message on Ask the Pastor

63
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:42,100
until we resume in the summer,

64
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,860
but we dealt with a number of things,

65
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,619
and I said it many times at the end of the message

66
00:02:47,619 --> 00:02:49,419
that it's absolutely imperative

67
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,899
that we know what this book is

68
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:56,940
and then what this book says,

69
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,699
because if we do not have an understanding

70
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:00,660
of what this book is,

71
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,820
then what it says is open for debate,

72
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,960
but when we understand what this book is,

73
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,740
all of a sudden, this book is authoritative.

74
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,860
It's not open for debate.

75
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,240
It's not open for discussion.

76
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,300
We're not looking for any new revelation.

77
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,460
As they sang in the song,

78
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,460
there are many over the years

79
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,660
that have tried to water it down,

80
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,059
that have tried to change it,

81
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:22,720
but God's word endures.

82
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,940
God's word marches on, and I'm so thankful.

83
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,380
The Bible, as some have said,

84
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,300
is the greatest book of all time.

85
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,740
I agree.

86
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:35,740
It is estimated that about five billion copies of the Bible

87
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,520
have been sold, making it the best-selling book of all time.

88
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,440
Not only is it the best-selling book of all time,

89
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,539
but we would, as you look at the statistics,

90
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:49,100
you would find that it is the most translated book

91
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,039
of all time.

92
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,220
We obviously work with Beacon of Truth,

93
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,899
trying to get the Bible, the word of God,

94
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:57,699
around the world so that people can have the Bible

95
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:01,539
in their own language, so that their heart language,

96
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:03,500
the Bible would be available to them.

97
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,899
Unfortunately, still today, in 2023,

98
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:10,139
there are millions and millions of people

99
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:11,419
around the face of the world

100
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:16,420
that do not have the full Bible in their native tongue.

101
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,179
That's why the work is so important

102
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:20,100
to get the Bible translated.

103
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,579
We look at this quote.

104
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,019
Charles Ryrie said this,

105
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:26,100
that the Bible is the greatest of all books.

106
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,019
To study it is the noblest of all pursuits.

107
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,980
To understand it, the highest of all goals.

108
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,100
I would agree this morning

109
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,779
that the Bible is the greatest of all books.

110
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,140
Many books can inform,

111
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,980
but only this book can transform.

112
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,820
Of all the books that I have in my library,

113
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,380
and I have quite a few,

114
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,859
of all the books that I've ever read,

115
00:04:48,859 --> 00:04:50,579
and I've read quite a few,

116
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:52,140
this book stands alone.

117
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:56,660
This book is like no other book that I've ever read.

118
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,459
The content is precious.

119
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:01,779
We'd ask the question this morning is this,

120
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:05,799
what is it that sets this book apart from any other book?

121
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:08,380
What is it that makes this book, the Bible,

122
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,260
the Word of God,

123
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,540
the best-selling and most translated book of all time?

124
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:15,779
It's this very simple truth

125
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:19,160
that God, who alone is great,

126
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,859
is the author of this book.

127
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:25,260
And that's what sets this book apart from any other book.

128
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,940
And that's what makes this book so precious.

129
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,299
This morning we will note

130
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:31,140
that I believe,

131
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,980
and as we look at the passage of Scripture,

132
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,940
that inspiration reveals to us

133
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,500
the greatness of God.

134
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,540
Notice with me in 2 Timothy chapter number three.

135
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,579
Begin reading in verse number 14.

136
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:43,420
The Bible says,

137
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,059
but continue thou in the things which thou hast learned

138
00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:48,820
and hast been assured of,

139
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,019
knowing of whom thou hast learned them,

140
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,839
that from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures,

141
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,100
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation

142
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,820
through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

143
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,660
By the way, I'm thankful for the message of salvation.

144
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,220
The message of salvation in the pages of Scripture.

145
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,700
How is it that we could know how to get to heaven?

146
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,779
Well, because God's given us

147
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:18,779
the truth of salvation and redemption

148
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,980
in the pages of this book.

149
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,820
Then notice in verse 16,

150
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:27,059
all Scripture, not some, not most,

151
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:28,980
but all Scripture.

152
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,260
Very wise Bible college professor would say often,

153
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,540
all means all, and that's all that all means.

154
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,459
He said, that's pretty simple.

155
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:40,540
I know, he said it all the time.

156
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,700
Because the Bible says all Scripture

157
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,519
is given by inspiration of God.

158
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,359
Notice what it says,

159
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:51,260
and it's profitable for doctrine,

160
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,279
for reproof, for correction,

161
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:57,279
for instruction in righteousness,

162
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,540
that the man of God may be perfect,

163
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:05,579
throughly furnished unto all good works.

164
00:07:06,299 --> 00:07:09,700
Thus, Paul would give Timothy a charge

165
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,260
in the fourth chapter.

166
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,019
We know that the chapter divisions were inserted later

167
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:15,779
for our ease of being able to find

168
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:18,540
and reference portions of Scripture.

169
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,619
But he gives a charge to begin the fourth chapter,

170
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:23,579
and he says this in verse number two,

171
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:26,679
preach the word.

172
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:27,519
Why?

173
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,559
Because of what he just told us the word is.

174
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,279
And this morning, as we begin to think about this truth

175
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,000
of holding in our hands the precious Bible,

176
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,440
someone said this, I thought it was just so perfect

177
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,839
how they summarized this truth,

178
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:47,839
referring to the Bible as the word of God

179
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,799
is the most complete and impressive acknowledgement

180
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:55,000
of its significance,

181
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,720
reminding us that we should regard the Bible

182
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,040
as God speaking to man.

183
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,839
It's God's word.

184
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:07,440
This message from God to humanity

185
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,440
is the most powerful and trustworthy book ever written.

186
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,019
God assures us throughout the Bible

187
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:21,019
that these are His very words.

188
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:24,239
I'm thankful this morning that God's given us a Bible.

189
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:25,920
As we think about the greatness of God

190
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,839
and how inspiration reveals to us the greatness of God,

191
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,679
if you're taking notes,

192
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:33,039
I want you to consider with me the process of inspiration.

193
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,479
What is the process of inspiration?

194
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,599
The Bible tells us here in verse number 16

195
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,479
of 2 Timothy 3 that all Scripture

196
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,440
is given by inspiration of God.

197
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,039
As we begin to think about this statement of inspiration

198
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:49,400
and how all Scripture has been given in this manner,

199
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,900
we would ask ourselves this question,

200
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,739
what is the process?

201
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,320
How did God do this?

202
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,039
And the reality is that He answers that for us

203
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,400
in 2 Peter chapter number one.

204
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,239
Hold your place here, if you will,

205
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,599
in 2 Timothy chapter number three,

206
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:04,440
but turn over to 2 Peter chapter number one.

207
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,000
And it's interesting because Peter is the human penman

208
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,440
to the book of 2 Peter,

209
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:12,520
containing his name here in the particular epistle.

210
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,640
He is the human penman,

211
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,479
but remember all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

212
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:18,119
And as Peter is writing

213
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:19,760
in this particular passage of Scripture,

214
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,520
we'll actually visit this passage again in a few weeks

215
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,000
and look at this passage in its entirety.

216
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,559
But notice what Peter is saying.

217
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,440
He talks about the fact

218
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,440
that we have a more sure word of prophecy,

219
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,119
and he speaks with regard to an experience

220
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:36,640
that he had on the Mount of Transfiguration.

221
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,359
If you think back to the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ,

222
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:41,200
Peter, James, and John had the privilege

223
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,159
of going out on the Mount of Transfiguration with Jesus

224
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,640
and seeing Jesus in that time

225
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,200
and hearing the voice of the Father.

226
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:54,559
And Peter references this particular account

227
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,840
in this passage of Scripture,

228
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,039
and he speaks about hearing the voice of God Almighty,

229
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,080
but he says that we...

230
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,200
have a more sure word of prophecy. Notice what he says in verse number 19, we have also

231
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:13,880
a more sure word of prophecy, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light

232
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,100
that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts.

233
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,680
And then he's going to answer the question that we've posed this morning in verses 20

234
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,840
and 21, and that's with regard to the process of inspiration. If God tells us that all Scripture

235
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:34,040
is given by inspiration of God, how did God do that? This reveals His greatness. It says

236
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:43,780
in verse 20, knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation.

237
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:50,680
For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man. That's important for us to understand.

238
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,680
It's not that Isaiah just decided one day, I'm going to write Scripture. It's not that

239
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,840
Jeremiah or one of the other prophets just decided on a whim, on their own, that they're

240
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,520
going to write Scripture. No, the Bible says that the prophecy came not in old time by

241
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:13,400
the will of man. But holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. We've

242
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,560
got to think about this truth of inspiration. The Bible is not man's words. Many people

243
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,720
today would make that false claim about the Bible. They would say, hey listen, the Bible,

244
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,120
that's just a bunch of people that wrote the Bible. How can you trust that? No, they

245
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,520
don't understand what the Bible is. The Bible is not just a compilation of individuals of

246
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:39,000
men that wrote things. No, the Bible is God's Word. And all Scripture is given by inspiration

247
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:48,240
of God, and we find this morning that He used men to record His Word. He used men to record

248
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,280
His Word. The word inspiration literally means God-breathed. We think about the truth

249
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,980
of inspiration, and we'll deal with this also when we deal with the subject of preservation

250
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,240
next week, but when we think about the truth of inspiration, we would believe and hold

251
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:09,360
to that the Bible teaches clearly this truth of verbal plenary inspiration. You say, I've

252
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,960
not heard that term before. I'm not familiar with that term. The word verbal means the

253
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,920
very words. The very words. And the word plenary means the entirety of it. So when we think

254
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,400
about the Bible, the Word of God that we hold in our hand this morning, and we think about

255
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,080
this truth of inspiration, the Bible says that all Scripture is given by inspiration

256
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:35,440
of God, that it's the entirety, the whole of the Bible, and it's the very words. God

257
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,000
did not just give thoughts. He did not just tell Paul, write on this subject, or tell

258
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,200
Isaiah to write on this theme, or Ezekiel to write on this thought. No, God gave the

259
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:52,040
very words. It's important for us to understand that this morning, because again, before we

260
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,640
are going to talk about what the Bible says, we must understand what the Bible is. And

261
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,000
as we consider the truth of inspiration this morning, we see that inspiration reveals to

262
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,560
us the greatness of God. Consider with me a truth from the book of Deuteronomy in chapter

263
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,400
4. And you don't need to turn there. I'll read the verse for you. You can if you want.

264
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,600
But Deuteronomy chapter 4, of course God is preparing His people for entrance into the

265
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,580
land of promise, and He's using Moses. And Moses is given this final charge, and it says

266
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,800
in verse number 1 of Deuteronomy 4,

267
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,640
Now therefore hearken, O Israel, under the statutes and under the judgments which I teach

268
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,060
you, for to do them that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the Lord

269
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,860
God of your fathers giveth you. Notice what He says,

270
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:41,460
Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish aught from

271
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,940
it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.

272
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:52,260
God's concerned about the very word. A jot and a tittle is what the Bible speaks about,

273
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,280
that heaven and earth shall pass, but not a jot nor a tittle from God's Word is going

274
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:03,320
to pass. And we find this morning that God has given the individual words. That's important

275
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,120
for us to understand, because we cannot just take a pen knife and just start carving things

276
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,800
out of the Bible that we say we just don't like or doesn't kind of fit with what we want

277
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:19,680
to do. No, every word. I've often said over the years, I'm reminded of times in Bible

278
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,280
college and preparation, even in high school, with term papers that were required to be

279
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,640
written, and how often you were told that you had to have a paper written that contained

280
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,600
a certain number of words. I'm not sure if you had that experience as I did, but I remember

281
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,500
having that experience, and I remember coming to a place where I'd have that paper just

282
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:47,800
about written, and you'd check your word count and find out that you were short. I got to

283
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:56,760
know a lot of different words that I could just kind of plug in and just fill. Admittedly,

284
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:04,560
I did that. Can I tell you this morning that this book has no filler? No filler. No one

285
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:13,960
told God how many books, how many words, how many verses, how many chapters. No, no. God

286
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:19,680
gave us exactly what He wanted us to have. And that's why we understand with this truth

287
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:27,840
of verbal plenary inspiration that every word is important. And we study the Word of God.

288
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:33,160
We study and we learn and we're helped and we're encouraged and we're strengthened. We

289
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,920
find this morning that He speaks about the whole of the Bible. In the New Testament,

290
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,640
you know that Jesus often referred to the Old Testament. We find that Paul, in 1 Corinthians

291
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,280
chapter number 10, in referring back to the Old Testament through the things that were

292
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,320
written before. He says this in verse number 11 of 1 Corinthians 10, now all these things

293
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,380
happened unto them for in samples, and they are written for our admonition upon whom the

294
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:03,160
ends of the world are come. Romans, Paul says the same thing over in Romans about the things

295
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,040
that were written aforetime were written for our learning. And I'm thankful this morning

296
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,440
that as we look back, and even in our text of Scripture this morning, in 2 Timothy chapter

297
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,840
number 3, when Paul is giving Timothy this charge and he's giving him this instruction,

298
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:22,680
he says that from a child, in verse number 15, thou hast known the Holy Scriptures, which

299
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,080
are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus. And

300
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,160
what Paul would be referring to is the Old Testament. He refers to them as being Holy

301
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,480
Scriptures. He then tells Timothy in chapter number 4 to preach the Word. He's referring

302
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,840
to the same thing, the Bible, the Word of God, the Scriptures. And we find here this

303
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:48,520
morning that he gives us this truth and he reveals to us that every word and then the

304
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:57,200
entirety is given by inspiration of God. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

305
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:04,160
Now how does this truth of inspiration reveal the greatness of God? Well you recognize this

306
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,280
morning that as we look at this book that we hold in our hands that there are about

307
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:16,440
40 different human penmen over a span of time of about 1,500 years, three different languages

308
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:27,480
and three different continents, yet we have one perfect book. It's amazing. It's amazing.

309
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,560
I'm not sure how many people are in the auditorium this morning, but if we were to just have

310
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:38,160
a topic been given to each of us that we would write a one page, not a certain number

311
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,240
of words, but just write one page on a particular subject, I'm sure we'd come up with some contradictions

312
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:52,120
amongst ourselves. Over 1,500 years, 40 different people, three different languages, three different

313
00:17:52,120 --> 00:18:00,000
continents and you have one complete perfect book. Why? Because of the author. Because

314
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,400
inspiration reveals the greatness of God. That God is able to take the different personalities

315
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:14,080
of the human penmen and he's able to communicate his very word to us. It's amazing. You think

316
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,080
about God's greatness being revealed in that manner. This morning as we think about the

317
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,760
process of inspiration, I want you to consider with me number two, the product of inspiration.

318
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,200
The product of inspiration. Because the Bible is given by inspiration, it is literally the

319
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,559
word of God and is therefore profitable. Notice what it says in 2 Timothy 3 and verse number

320
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:43,739
16. Because the scripture is given by inspiration, and we've looked there just for a moment,

321
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:49,440
the process of inspiration, you find that the truth is given to us with regard to the

322
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:57,119
product of inspiration. Because it is God-breathed, because it is the word of God, it is profitable.

323
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:05,600
It is profitable. There are certain things that we look to and we gain a measure of profit

324
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:12,480
from something and we can think about owner's manuals and how-to type of books. And the

325
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,400
reality is that if you were to get a particular manual on something, you had a particular

326
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,920
product that you were trying to operate and you wanted to operate that thing properly,

327
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:29,600
you would hope to have a manual written about that product by someone who knew something

328
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,520
about the product. Make sense? Right? Otherwise, it's probably not going to be really profitable.

329
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,840
So I can be very helpful. Hey, would you write a manual on how-to? And you're like, I've

330
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,799
never done that before. How am I supposed to write a manual on that? When I worked at

331
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,440
Sikorsky in the corporate world for a number of years, we would have standard operating

332
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,480
procedures. Many of you in the workplace, you understand standard operating procedures

333
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,000
and instructions. We'd also have work instructions. And I was regularly tapped and would…

334
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,019
within our department to write work instructions.

335
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:07,480
The idea of writing a work instruction at Sikorsky

336
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,720
was that someone that was considered

337
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,960
to be a subject matter expert in a particular area

338
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,440
would write a work instruction that someone

339
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,360
that had no knowledge of that particular field or work

340
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,479
could take that work instruction and complete the task.

341
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:25,440
That was the objective.

342
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,040
That's what we're seeking to do.

343
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,639
And I had the privilege during that period of time

344
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:33,040
to author several work instructions,

345
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,439
and we'd go through the process,

346
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:37,139
and it was quite enjoyable, actually.

347
00:20:37,139 --> 00:20:41,400
We look at this book that we hold in our hands this morning.

348
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,159
It is given by inspiration.

349
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:50,159
Therefore, it is God's word, and it is profitable,

350
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:52,360
because God is the creator.

351
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,560
He knows everything.

352
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,880
He has all wisdom, and he has all power,

353
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,040
and so he's given us exactly what we need

354
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,200
within the pages of this book.

355
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,400
We find that here in 2 Timothy 3 and verse number 16,

356
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,919
he specifies in four different areas

357
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,360
how God's word is profitable.

358
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,080
Notice he says it's profitable for doctrine, for teaching.

359
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,919
We speak about doctrine.

360
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:18,760
Let me say this.

361
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,220
Doctrine matters.

362
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,360
Doctrine is important.

363
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,519
We find that the book of Titus is written,

364
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,519
if you were to read just the first chapter

365
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,919
and enter just a couple of verses

366
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,639
in the second chapter of the book of Titus,

367
00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:32,279
you'll find three or four different references

368
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:36,800
that Paul is making to Titus about sound doctrine.

369
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,360
In fact, here, even within the context

370
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,400
of this passage of Scripture,

371
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,919
he says how the Bible is given by inspiration of God

372
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:46,760
and is profitable for doctrine.

373
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,519
He then says this in verse number two.

374
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:50,319
Preach the word of chapter four.

375
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:52,279
Be instant in season, out of season.

376
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:54,879
Reprove, rebuke, exhort.

377
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:58,639
Notice when he says with all longsuffering and doctrine,

378
00:21:58,639 --> 00:22:02,879
for the time will come when they will not endure

379
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:06,360
sound doctrine, but instead, after their own lusts,

380
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,399
shall they keep to themselves teachers having itching ears.

381
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:14,440
Far too often today, doctrine is set aside

382
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,779
as people seek to say, well, let's just have unity.

383
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:21,500
The best way to have unity is to agree on this book.

384
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:23,919
Let me rephrase that.

385
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,039
It's not the best way to have unity.

386
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,960
It's really the only way to have unity

387
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,960
is by agreeing as to what God has said in this book.

388
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,839
We must be students of the book.

389
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:39,100
We often understand that we would speak about our faith.

390
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,279
Our faith.

391
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:43,320
The Bible says that we're to earnestly contend

392
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,699
for the faith that was once delivered,

393
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:48,199
that body of doctrine, that teaching,

394
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:51,679
and the Bible is given by inspiration of God

395
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,360
and therefore, the Bible is profitable for doctrine.

396
00:22:57,399 --> 00:23:01,779
As a Baptist person, we would say, without any shame,

397
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:06,779
the Bible is our sole authority for faith and practice.

398
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:10,960
Why do you believe what you believe?

399
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,800
Well, let's look at what the Bible says.

400
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,320
And as we agree as to what God has given us in his word,

401
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,440
because God's word is authoritative

402
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,039
because it's given by inspiration,

403
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,059
it is therefore profitable for doctrine.

404
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:24,279
Notice he says this.

405
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,039
Not only is it profitable for doctrine,

406
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,720
but it's for reproof.

407
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,399
You know, reproof, to reprove someone,

408
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:34,179
to rebuke someone is to expose error.

409
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:38,199
It shows us, the Bible,

410
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:40,240
because it's given by inspiration of God,

411
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,500
the product of inspiration is that it's profitable.

412
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,960
It's profitable for doctrine,

413
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,919
but it's also profitable for reproof.

414
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:48,839
It shows us where we're wrong.

415
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:52,679
Before you began reading the Bible,

416
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,800
before you trust that Christ is your savior,

417
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,479
maybe you had ideas and thoughts about spiritual matters,

418
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,639
about heavenly things.

419
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:03,360
And then you got saved and you started reading the Bible

420
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,039
and you found out, man, I was wrong about some stuff.

421
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,820
I, like many people, had this idea, my belief.

422
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,300
I don't know where I got the belief.

423
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,300
I can't pinpoint that anyone ever sat me down

424
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,119
and taught me this, but my understanding,

425
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:20,440
if you were to ask me before I trust that Christ

426
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,880
is my savior, before I started reading the Bible,

427
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,679
hey, if you're to die, you're gonna go to heaven.

428
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,859
My thought, my belief, my understanding

429
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:31,660
of how I would get to heaven is by being a good person.

430
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,679
I kind of had this idea that if my good deeds

431
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,279
outweighed my bad deeds,

432
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,380
that somehow I would gain entrance to heaven.

433
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:44,200
I know a lot of people that still think that today.

434
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,160
A lot of people that I talk to and ask them about heaven,

435
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,679
that that's their understanding, that's their belief.

436
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,559
But you know what?

437
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:53,839
This Bible exposed that error.

438
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,600
Because the Bible says,

439
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,320
not by works of righteousness, which we have done,

440
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,579
but according to his mercy, he has saved us.

441
00:25:01,579 --> 00:25:03,600
The Bible says, for by grace are you saved through faith

442
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,399
and that not of yourselves, it's the gift of God,

443
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:09,519
not of works, lest any man should boast.

444
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,880
And I had to be confronted with the truth

445
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,959
that what I thought was wrong.

446
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:17,559
But why was it wrong?

447
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,720
Because of this book.

448
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,399
Because this book is God's word

449
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:24,359
and it's given by inspiration and it's profitable,

450
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:26,600
not only for doctrine, but for reproof,

451
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,079
and it exposes error.

452
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:30,239
We could go on and on with error that's exposed,

453
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:32,239
but I need to move forward.

454
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,399
Notice it says this, for correction.

455
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:36,359
For correction.

456
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,079
I'm so thankful for this.

457
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,700
Because not only does God's word expose error,

458
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,140
but it corrects us.

459
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,359
Isn't that wonderful?

460
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:46,959
I mean, isn't it a terrible thing

461
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:48,640
when someone says, nope, that's wrong?

462
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,720
Okay, well then tell me how to do it right.

463
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,260
Correct it, right?

464
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,399
So God says, no, through his word,

465
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:58,079
he exposed the error in my thinking

466
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,859
with regard to salvation,

467
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:03,799
but then also at the same time gave me the truth

468
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:07,720
of salvation, corrected my wrong thinking.

469
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,200
Isn't that wonderful?

470
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,160
It's a blessing.

471
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,359
Sometimes, watching some basketball yesterday,

472
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,519
been watching a lot of basketball

473
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:19,000
over the last couple of months with the kids,

474
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,679
both Joseph and Brianna playing,

475
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,040
and going to a lot of games,

476
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:27,040
and sometimes a ref will keep calling a violation.

477
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,160
It's always exciting.

478
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,839
Sometimes they get whistle happy.

479
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,839
Let's just play the game, you know?

480
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:35,359
And sometimes, every once in a while,

481
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:37,500
Brianna didn't do it this year, she did it last year,

482
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,959
she kept getting called for this violation.

483
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:42,200
It wasn't a foul, just getting called for travel.

484
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,640
So in between quarters, she went to the referee

485
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,200
and she said, can you tell me what I'm doing wrong?

486
00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:53,200
That referee was the authority on that court.

487
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:56,040
And you keep calling me for a travel,

488
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,519
but I wanna understand how am I traveling

489
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:00,160
with what I'm doing?

490
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,399
And guess what the referee did?

491
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:03,279
Explained it to her,

492
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,519
so that she could correct

493
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:10,279
and thus not get called for the violation.

494
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:13,200
God's word is profitable for doctrine,

495
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,559
for reproof, for correction.

496
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,079
How to correct that which is wrong,

497
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,359
that which has been exposed.

498
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,480
But then also the Bible says,

499
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,200
for instruction in righteousness.

500
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,359
How to stay right.

501
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:29,760
How to live a life that pleases God.

502
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,920
For instruction in righteousness.

503
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,760
I'm thankful that God's given us this book,

504
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,880
and this book provides us with instruction for living.

505
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:42,679
You wanna know how to be a good husband?

506
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:46,600
Read the Bible, seriously.

507
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,119
You say, oh, I got this really good book

508
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:51,160
on so-and-so wrote about being a good husband.

509
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,519
I'm not suggesting that there's not

510
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,880
any other good books out there,

511
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,679
but I'm suggesting that if you read other books

512
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,920
and not this book, you failed to get the proper source.

513
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,920
If someone's gonna write a book on being a father,

514
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,559
being a husband, being a wife, being a mother,

515
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,040
being fill-in-the-blank,

516
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,440
they better have gotten some truth from this book first.

517
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,519
Amen?

518
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:18,440
Dean's got a book on the back desk over there,

519
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,079
or on the back table, about how to song lead.

520
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:24,720
I've never read the book.

521
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,119
I'm sure there's some good things in there.

522
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:28,799
But you have to understand that we're talking about

523
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,279
song leading, we're talking about in the context

524
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:33,559
of a church, that there are some spiritual truths

525
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:36,320
that need to be understood before you're going

526
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,840
to just write about how to lead singing.

527
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,799
In the context of pleasing God,

528
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:47,840
in the context of doing things decently and in order,

529
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,960
in the context of they that worship him, John 4,

530
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,119
must worship him in spirit and in truth.

531
00:28:55,119 --> 00:29:00,119
We find that the word of God is profitable.

532
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,000
The Bible not only is profitable,

533
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,799
the product of inspiration, but notice what the Bible says

534
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:09,760
in 2 Timothy 3 and verse 17.

535
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,239
The Bible equips the child of God.

536
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:14,119
He says that it's profitable for these things,

537
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,039
for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,

538
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,200
for instruction in righteousness.

539
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,320
Then notice verse 17, that the man of God may be perfect,

540
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:26,320
throughly furnished unto all good works.

541
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,400
The Bible equips the child of God.

542
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,280
It equips us.

543
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,239
I'm so thankful for the equipping.

544
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,000
I'm so thankful that the Holy Spirit of God

545
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,320
who lives within me, the Holy Spirit of God,

546
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,479
if you've been saved this morning that lives within you,

547
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:42,880
that he will guide you into all truth

548
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,719
and that he will help you to be in that place

549
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:48,000
where you're equipped, where you're complete

550
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,200
and throughly furnished unto all good works.

551
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:54,640
We mentioned on Wednesday evening,

552
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,679
as we've studied through Psalm 37,

553
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:58,039
a couple of different references

554
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:00,000
where the psalmist says, do good.

555
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:08,079
We ask the question this way, how do you know what's good? Who determines good? God alone.

556
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:13,359
The only one who is good, He's the one that determines what is good.

557
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:17,760
And we find this morning that the Bible is profitable, the Bible equips.

558
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:24,479
But the truth of inspiration, we talked about the process of inspiration, the product of inspiration,

559
00:30:24,479 --> 00:30:28,239
and we think about the truth that it's profitable, that it equips us.

560
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:33,200
But I want you to consider this morning that the truth of inspiration results in several things.

561
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:40,880
Number one, it results in this, that this book, the Bible, is pure. It's pure.

562
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:48,400
In Proverbs 30 and verse number 5, it's a precious verse that deals with the fact that the Bible is pure

563
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:53,599
and also deals with the truth that we mentioned about verbal plenary inspiration.

564
00:30:53,599 --> 00:31:02,319
The Bible says this in Proverbs 30 and verse number 5, every word of God is pure.

565
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,440
He is a shield unto them that put their trust in Him.

566
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,720
The psalmist says this in Psalm 119 and verse number 140,

567
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,879
thy word is very pure, therefore thy servant loveth it.

568
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:19,919
Whew, man, it's a pure book.

569
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:27,519
Everything that is contained within the pages of this Bible from Genesis 1-1 through Revelation 22-21,

570
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,559
it is absolutely pure in everything that is contained therein.

571
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:40,400
And we look at the Bible and we understand that the Bible says that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

572
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,199
And because it is the word of God, it's pure.

573
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:52,319
There are some that say they don't agree with what God's word is.

574
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:59,279
So then they have difficulty with what God's word says because they don't agree with what God's word is.

575
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,919
We talk about the word of God being pure, the Bible being pure.

576
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,800
It is pure in all that it records.

577
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,759
The record that is provided is reliable.

578
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:13,919
It is trustworthy.

579
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,800
How do we know what happened?

580
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,520
We dealt with Hezekiah a couple of weeks ago.

581
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,800
How do we know what Sennacherib and Rabshakeh really said?

582
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,639
How do we know if it's true?

583
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:29,360
How do we know if Hezekiah didn't just make something up, if Isaiah was just making something up?

584
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,559
No, every word of God is pure.

585
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:42,240
So what Sennacherib and Rabshakeh said we can trust and we can say is a reliable source because every word of God is pure.

586
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:49,839
How do you know what happened in the garden?

587
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:51,520
We look at Genesis chapter number 3.

588
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,800
Is Genesis 3 foundational?

589
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,800
It's absolutely foundational.

590
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:02,800
If we don't have Genesis chapter number 3 understood, so many things fall apart.

591
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:08,960
But in Genesis chapter number 3, the Bible says that the serpent, who's more subtle than any beast of the field,

592
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,360
he enters into the garden and he says,

593
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,479
yea, hath God said.

594
00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:16,399
How do we know if that's true?

595
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,720
Because every word of God is pure.

596
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,479
And the record of Genesis 3 is given to us.

597
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:32,479
Yes, it's the serpent that's speaking to Eve, but God has recorded it to us in the Bible because all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

598
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:35,279
Thus, the Bible is pure.

599
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,720
It is trustworthy.

600
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,160
It is reliable.

601
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:46,320
And we can say we understand with absolute certainty what happened in the garden in Genesis 3.

602
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,960
Why? Because God's given us a record.

603
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,440
He's given us a pure record.

604
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,759
The psalmist said this in Psalm 33 in verse number 14.

605
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:01,119
Notice what the Bible says, excuse me, verse number 4 in Psalm 33 and verse number 4.

606
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:08,960
For the word of the Lord is right and all his works are done in truth.

607
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,119
I'm thankful this morning that I can trust this book.

608
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,960
It's pure.

609
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,040
Every word of God is pure.

610
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,480
And we couple that and we understand that all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

611
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:29,839
And since all scripture is given by inspiration of God, this is the word of God and God's word is pure.

612
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:36,000
It is a trustworthy, reliable record that God has given to us.

613
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,160
And that's the product of inspiration.

614
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:44,640
Not only is it pure, we would say this, this book, the Bible, is incapable of error.

615
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,480
It's incapable of error.

616
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,359
By the way, I'm thankful for that truth.

617
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:57,200
We live in a time today that so many people want to say, well, this is an error and that's an error and there's a problem over here.

618
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,119
I read a theologian of yesteryear many, many years ago.

619
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,600
I don't remember who it was at this point.

620
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,799
But he said this, if you think the Bible's got a mistake, then you're wrong.

621
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:10,799
You're mistaken.

622
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:12,480
And he said, you need to go back to the drawing board.

623
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,519
You need to dig in.

624
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:15,839
You need to study more.

625
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:20,079
See, there are nuggets that God has given us within his word.

626
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:25,200
As we study it and we dig in and we don't just look at some surface thing.

627
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:32,399
By the way, this morning, the reality is that there are so many things that can be found on the internet.

628
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:34,079
Be careful about the internet.

629
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,160
I mentioned this on Wednesday evening.

630
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,320
Oh, how careful we must be.

631
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:55,119
I've spoken to some people over the last couple of years that have come to me with errors, contradictions.

632
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:07,279
People that I know, and I'm not saying this prideful here boastfully, I know from their testimony, all right, so I'm not saying something that they've not said, that they don't read this book.

633
00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:09,519
They don't read the Bible.

634
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:18,480
And yet, they're going to come to me with some contradictions of some, this verse says this, but way over here in this chapter, it says this.

635
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,519
Say, where did you find that?

636
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:28,079
And all of a sudden, if you just go on Google and type in biblical contradictions, it's like the first two that pop up.

637
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,160
That's where they found it.

638
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,799
And be careful, because God's word is incapable of error.

639
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:35,440
Why?

640
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,679
Because our God is perfect, and our God is incapable of error.

641
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:44,399
Titus, in chapter 1 and verse number 2, says this, the book of Titus 1-2,

642
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:50,320
and hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie promised before the world began.

643
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,600
I'm thankful that God is truth.

644
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,880
He cannot lie.

645
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,600
This book, the Bible, is incapable of error.

646
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:57,920
Why?

647
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,799
Because it's God's word.

648
00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:08,000
See, if you write something, if you say something, if you speak as much as I speak, you're going to say something wrong.

649
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,440
We're humans.

650
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,679
But God is perfect.

651
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:20,399
He has given us a book that's perfect, because all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

652
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:27,119
This book, because of the truth of inspiration, we talked about the process and the product,

653
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,799
because of the truth of inspiration, this book is authoritative.

654
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:33,279
It's authoritative.

655
00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:38,000
See, notice what the psalmist says, and we'll finish here in Psalm 19.

656
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,760
Notice what the psalmist says.

657
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:48,160
We talk about this book being authoritative.

658
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,760
In Psalm 19 and verse number 7, the Bible says,

659
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,040
The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.

660
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,320
The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.

661
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,040
The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart.

662
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,559
The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.

663
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:07,600
The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever.

664
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,799
The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.

665
00:38:10,799 --> 00:38:12,799
Notice verse 10 of Psalm 19.

666
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:18,399
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold.

667
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:22,399
Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

668
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:32,799
Moreover, verse 11, by them is thy servant warned, and in keeping of them there is great reward.

669
00:38:32,799 --> 00:38:38,400
God's Word is authoritative because of what it is, because it's God's Word.

670
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:47,200
Begin to think about people, humans, interactions that we have, one with another.

671
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,440
Someone's word that might be authoritative.

672
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,200
Someone that has some position of authority.

673
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,799
The word that they give is authoritative because of the position that they hold.

674
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:04,880
We understand that in life. We deal with that.

675
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,479
I mentioned a reference a moment ago about on the basketball court.

676
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:12,320
The coaches can disagree, the players can disagree,

677
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,559
but that guy with that black and white striped shirt and that whistle,

678
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:20,080
he is the authority on that court.

679
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:24,640
Like it or not, it's just the way it works.

680
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:31,840
We can think about a number of positions that people hold and the word that they speak having authority,

681
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,799
but I want you to understand that God is the eternal God.

682
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:40,320
He's the omnipotent God. He rules. He reigns.

683
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:46,799
He is the Lord God Almighty, and He's given us the Bible.

684
00:39:46,799 --> 00:39:53,520
And because He's given it to us by inspiration, because every word of God is pure,

685
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:00,000
because of the truth of inspiration, then we understand that this book is authoritative.

686
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
You can say, I disagree with it.

687
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
That's up to you.

688
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,880
You've got a problem with God because God's Word is authoritative.

689
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,079
God's Word is authoritative.

690
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,760
I think this morning that it's in our best interest as we find in Psalm 19 and also in

691
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,559
2 Peter 1, it's in our best interest to take heed.

692
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:25,479
It says, moreover by them is my servant warned.

693
00:40:25,479 --> 00:40:28,680
You know, warnings are good for us.

694
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,280
People get warnings.

695
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,799
We're familiar with warnings, by the way.

696
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:37,759
Go home this afternoon and you look at some products that you have at home and you look

697
00:40:37,759 --> 00:40:45,599
at the labels, especially cleaning supplies, warning labels, right?

698
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,279
We're familiar with warnings.

699
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:52,340
I was sharing with someone this past week about warnings.

700
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,720
We see warnings on the road.

701
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,720
Bridge out ahead.

702
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,500
Aren't you thankful for that warning?

703
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:04,959
Can you imagine if no one took the time to put the sign up, you just kept on driving?

704
00:41:04,959 --> 00:41:07,959
It'd be a problem.

705
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:09,919
God's given us warnings in His Word.

706
00:41:09,919 --> 00:41:13,400
Moreover by them is my servant warned.

707
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:18,559
This is this, and in keeping of them, there is great reward.

708
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,720
Wow.

709
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,760
Who's the reward come from?

710
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:27,680
The one who gave us the book.

711
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:34,279
He said this to Joshua, this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou

712
00:41:34,279 --> 00:41:37,080
shalt meditate therein day and night.

713
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,080
Why?

714
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,800
Why is it so important that this book not depart out of my mouth?

715
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,980
Why is it so necessary that I meditate in it day and night?

716
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,220
Because it's God's Word.

717
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,120
Because it's God's Word.

718
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:56,279
Then shalt thou find good success, have thy way prosperous and find good success.

719
00:41:56,279 --> 00:41:59,139
Think about the truth of Psalm 1.

720
00:41:59,139 --> 00:42:01,760
He shall be like a tree that's planted by the river.

721
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,760
Who is it?

722
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:09,279
The one that meditates on the Word day and night because they understand what it is.

723
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:16,160
This morning, we thank the Lord for giving us the Bible.

724
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,559
What a blessing.

725
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:23,759
This book, someone said this, this book is the mind of God, the state of man, the way

726
00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:28,240
of salvation, the doom of sinners, the happiness of believers.

727
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,000
Its doctrines are holy, its precepts are binding, its histories are true, its decisions are

728
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
immutable.

729
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,880
Read it to be wise, believe it to be safe, practice it to be holy.

730
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:45,399
This morning, I believe that inspiration reveals the greatness of God.

731
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:52,520
God used, we talked about the process, 40 men, over 1500 years, 3 languages, 3 continents

732
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:56,759
to give us one complete pure book.

733
00:42:56,759 --> 00:43:04,360
It's precious and it reveals to us how great God is that He could do that.

734
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:09,559
The one that transcends time, the one that's outside of time was able to do that because

735
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:14,800
all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

736
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:22,080
This morning, I hope that we have a newfound appreciation for the Bible.

737
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:27,279
We'll talk about it as we go over the next few weeks of understanding how God's greatness

738
00:43:27,279 --> 00:43:31,000
is revealed through giving us the Bible, but then what is my response to it?

739
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,800
We already gave a little indication of that with Joshua 1 and verse number 8.

740
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:41,380
How I approach the Bible, what I do with the Bible, how I live by the precepts that are

741
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,820
contained there and why?

742
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,339
Because I understand it's from God.

743
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:52,020
It's not just Paul speaking, it's not just Isaiah speaking, it's not just David speaking,

744
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:57,139
it's God speaking because all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

745
00:43:57,139 --> 00:44:01,979
What a joy, what a blessing that every day you have the opportunity in your life to open

746
00:44:01,979 --> 00:44:10,460
up this book to hear from God, to hear from God, to be benefited because it's profitable,

747
00:44:10,539 --> 00:44:12,740
to be helped.

748
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,759
This book is precious.

749
00:44:14,759 --> 00:44:23,619
This book is the greatest of all books because God, who alone is great, is its author.

750
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,619
Let's pray together.

751
00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:25,619
Father, we love you.

752
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:27,820
Thank you for loving us.

753
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,619
We thank you this morning for the Bible.

754
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:36,899
We thank you that in your infinite wisdom, you determined that you would give us the

755
00:44:36,899 --> 00:44:37,899
Bible.

756
00:44:37,899 --> 00:44:40,019
You would give us your word.

757
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:44,779
I thank you that the Bible says of itself that we're to take the sword of the Spirit,

758
00:44:44,779 --> 00:44:50,260
which is the word of God, that your word is quick and powerful and sharper than a two-edged

759
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:53,339
sword, that your word endures forever.

760
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:58,700
Forever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven.

761
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,739
Heaven and earth shall pass away.

762
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:04,339
All this book will endure.

763
00:45:04,339 --> 00:45:09,500
Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.

764
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:18,420
Lord, I pray this morning, you'd help us to see your greatness revealed through inspiration.

765
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:26,100
We'd understand with a newfound appreciation how precious this Bible is.

766
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:36,660
I pray, God, that you would help us to allow it to be profitable in our lives for doctrine,

767
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,859
for reproof, for correction, for instruction.

768
00:45:38,859 --> 00:45:44,779
God, I pray that we'd be equipped, thoroughly furnished.

769
00:45:44,779 --> 00:45:51,540
Pray, God, that we would submit ourselves, understanding the authority of this book.

770
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,980
It's pure, free of error.

771
00:45:54,980 --> 00:46:02,700
Oh, how thankful each of us ought to be this morning to have a Bible.

772
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:08,619
I pray, Lord, that if there's one that's not sure of heaven, Lord, we spoke this morning

773
00:46:08,619 --> 00:46:16,940
how the Holy Scriptures make thee wise unto salvation, the truth that's contained therein

774
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,739
with regard to eternal life.

775
00:46:18,739 --> 00:46:23,940
Lord, I pray that if one's not sure of heaven, that we'd have an opportunity to take a Bible

776
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,859
and show them how they could know for sure that heaven's their home.

777
00:46:26,859 --> 00:46:31,980
Lord, someone this morning, many that may be struggling with a variety of areas in their

778
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:41,820
lives, because of understanding the preciousness of this book, it's been given by inspiration

779
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:42,820
of God.

780
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:46,260
It is the very Word of God, and it's profitable for us.

781
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:53,299
God, you would help us that you'd meet the needs that are represented amongst the congregation

782
00:46:53,299 --> 00:47:00,100
this morning, understanding that we must run to your Word to get the answer, to understand

783
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:05,019
the path that should be before us.

784
00:47:05,019 --> 00:47:08,739
I pray, Lord, that you'd move and work in this few moments of invitation as only you

785
00:47:08,739 --> 00:47:09,739
can.

786
00:47:09,739 --> 00:47:13,619
I pray that decisions would be made that would please thee, for it's in Christ's name we

787
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:14,619
pray.

788
00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:14,619
