00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
Chapter number three, Joseph was gonna sing with them,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.199
but then we remembered that he was taking care

00:00:05.199 --> 00:00:06.440
of the sound this morning,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.119
and so he wasn't able to sing with them,

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:12.319
but it was a blessing hearing them practice that this week

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:15.000
and kind of singing it, and I love that song.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.200
I'm so thankful that God has given us his word.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.079
Second Timothy chapter number three,

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:21.959
if you've already looked at the back of the bulletin

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:23.319
this morning, we're gonna be dealing,

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:27.200
kind of shifting into a new series, if you will,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.319
of how God has revealed his greatness.

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.680
We spent much of the year so far,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.599
through the month of January

00:00:34.599 --> 00:00:36.099
into the beginning of February,

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:38.479
dealing with the truth that creation

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:40.479
reveals the greatness of God,

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:43.639
and we looked at a number of passages

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:45.759
dealing with the truth of creation,

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:47.159
and then over the last two weeks,

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:49.200
we dealt with the fact as we would apply

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.340
that great truth in our lives,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.599
that the creator God is my helper,

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:56.200
and what a blessing to know that the God

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.560
who spoke it all into existence is our helper personally,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.439
and I'm thankful for that application.

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:05.440
This morning and over the next several weeks,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.940
we're gonna shift our attention to the Bible,

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.519
and I'm thankful that God has given us a Bible,

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:14.599
and I believe as I will preach over the next several weeks

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:18.440
that as we hold in our hands this great book,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.599
that it reveals to us that our God is great,

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:22.919
the way in which he gave it,

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:24.720
the way in which he's preserved it,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.080
and all that's contained therein,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.879
I believe that inspiration,

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:31.559
as we'll focus on this morning specifically,

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:35.599
that inspiration reveals the greatness of God.

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:37.400
The content of the Bible

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.800
obviously reveals that God is great,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.120
but the means by which God gave us the Bible

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.760
reveals how great he is.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.879
Let me understand this morning

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:50.599
that God could have just dropped a Bible out of the sky

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:52.699
and said, here it is, here's the Bible,

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:56.699
but he chose to reveal it to us over a period of time,

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:58.900
and we'll focus and share some of those statistics here

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.919
in just a moment,

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:02.940
but we find this truth of progressive revelation,

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:03.779
if you will,

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:07.180
and we see how God in his infinite wisdom,

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.059
how he gave us what we hold in our hands this morning,

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:14.020
what we hold so dear and so precious,

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.940
and by the way, if you take this away, everything crumbles,

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.860
because everything that we know to be true about God

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.779
is a direct result of what we know

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:25.100
that he's given to us in this book,

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.460
and so it's absolutely imperative that we understand

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.500
the truth that is contained therein and what it is.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.119
I mentioned this several times

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:35.220
a couple of Sunday nights ago

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.259
as we finished up with a final message on Ask the Pastor

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:42.100
until we resume in the summer,

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.860
but we dealt with a number of things,

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.619
and I said it many times at the end of the message

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:49.419
that it's absolutely imperative

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.899
that we know what this book is

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:56.940
and then what this book says,

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.699
because if we do not have an understanding

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:00.660
of what this book is,

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.820
then what it says is open for debate,

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:08.960
but when we understand what this book is,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.740
all of a sudden, this book is authoritative.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.860
It's not open for debate.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.240
It's not open for discussion.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.300
We're not looking for any new revelation.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.460
As they sang in the song,

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.460
there are many over the years

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.660
that have tried to water it down,

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.059
that have tried to change it,

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:22.720
but God's word endures.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.940
God's word marches on, and I'm so thankful.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.380
The Bible, as some have said,

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.300
is the greatest book of all time.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.740
I agree.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.740
It is estimated that about five billion copies of the Bible

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.520
have been sold, making it the best-selling book of all time.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.440
Not only is it the best-selling book of all time,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.539
but we would, as you look at the statistics,

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:49.100
you would find that it is the most translated book

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.039
of all time.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.220
We obviously work with Beacon of Truth,

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.899
trying to get the Bible, the word of God,

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:57.699
around the world so that people can have the Bible

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:01.539
in their own language, so that their heart language,

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:03.500
the Bible would be available to them.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.899
Unfortunately, still today, in 2023,

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:10.139
there are millions and millions of people

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:11.419
around the face of the world

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:16.420
that do not have the full Bible in their native tongue.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.179
That's why the work is so important

00:04:18.179 --> 00:04:20.100
to get the Bible translated.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.579
We look at this quote.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.019
Charles Ryrie said this,

00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:26.100
that the Bible is the greatest of all books.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.019
To study it is the noblest of all pursuits.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:32.980
To understand it, the highest of all goals.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.100
I would agree this morning

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.779
that the Bible is the greatest of all books.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.140
Many books can inform,

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.980
but only this book can transform.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.820
Of all the books that I have in my library,

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.380
and I have quite a few,

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.859
of all the books that I've ever read,

00:04:48.859 --> 00:04:50.579
and I've read quite a few,

00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:52.140
this book stands alone.

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:56.660
This book is like no other book that I've ever read.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.459
The content is precious.

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:01.779
We'd ask the question this morning is this,

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:05.799
what is it that sets this book apart from any other book?

00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:08.380
What is it that makes this book, the Bible,

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.260
the Word of God,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.540
the best-selling and most translated book of all time?

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:15.779
It's this very simple truth

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:19.160
that God, who alone is great,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.859
is the author of this book.

00:05:21.859 --> 00:05:25.260
And that's what sets this book apart from any other book.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.940
And that's what makes this book so precious.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.299
This morning we will note

00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:31.140
that I believe,

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.980
and as we look at the passage of Scripture,

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.940
that inspiration reveals to us

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.500
the greatness of God.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.540
Notice with me in 2 Timothy chapter number three.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.579
Begin reading in verse number 14.

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:43.420
The Bible says,

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.059
but continue thou in the things which thou hast learned

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:48.820
and hast been assured of,

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.019
knowing of whom thou hast learned them,

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:55.839
that from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures,

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:58.100
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.820
through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.660
By the way, I'm thankful for the message of salvation.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.220
The message of salvation in the pages of Scripture.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.700
How is it that we could know how to get to heaven?

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.779
Well, because God's given us

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:18.779
the truth of salvation and redemption

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:20.980
in the pages of this book.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.820
Then notice in verse 16,

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:27.059
all Scripture, not some, not most,

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:28.980
but all Scripture.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.260
Very wise Bible college professor would say often,

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.540
all means all, and that's all that all means.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.459
He said, that's pretty simple.

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:40.540
I know, he said it all the time.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.700
Because the Bible says all Scripture

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.519
is given by inspiration of God.

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:48.359
Notice what it says,

00:06:48.359 --> 00:06:51.260
and it's profitable for doctrine,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.279
for reproof, for correction,

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:57.279
for instruction in righteousness,

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:00.540
that the man of God may be perfect,

00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:05.579
throughly furnished unto all good works.

00:07:06.299 --> 00:07:09.700
Thus, Paul would give Timothy a charge

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.260
in the fourth chapter.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.019
We know that the chapter divisions were inserted later

00:07:14.019 --> 00:07:15.779
for our ease of being able to find

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:18.540
and reference portions of Scripture.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.619
But he gives a charge to begin the fourth chapter,

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:23.579
and he says this in verse number two,

00:07:23.579 --> 00:07:26.679
preach the word.

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:27.519
Why?

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:30.559
Because of what he just told us the word is.

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:33.279
And this morning, as we begin to think about this truth

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:37.000
of holding in our hands the precious Bible,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.440
someone said this, I thought it was just so perfect

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.839
how they summarized this truth,

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:47.839
referring to the Bible as the word of God

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.799
is the most complete and impressive acknowledgement

00:07:52.799 --> 00:07:55.000
of its significance,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.720
reminding us that we should regard the Bible

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.040
as God speaking to man.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.839
It's God's word.

00:08:04.839 --> 00:08:07.440
This message from God to humanity

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.440
is the most powerful and trustworthy book ever written.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.019
God assures us throughout the Bible

00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:21.019
that these are His very words.

00:08:21.119 --> 00:08:24.239
I'm thankful this morning that God's given us a Bible.

00:08:24.239 --> 00:08:25.920
As we think about the greatness of God

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.839
and how inspiration reveals to us the greatness of God,

00:08:28.839 --> 00:08:29.679
if you're taking notes,

00:08:29.679 --> 00:08:33.039
I want you to consider with me the process of inspiration.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.479
What is the process of inspiration?

00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:36.599
The Bible tells us here in verse number 16

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:39.479
of 2 Timothy 3 that all Scripture

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:42.440
is given by inspiration of God.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.039
As we begin to think about this statement of inspiration

00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:49.400
and how all Scripture has been given in this manner,

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.900
we would ask ourselves this question,

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:51.739
what is the process?

00:08:51.739 --> 00:08:53.320
How did God do this?

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.039
And the reality is that He answers that for us

00:08:56.039 --> 00:08:58.400
in 2 Peter chapter number one.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.239
Hold your place here, if you will,

00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:01.599
in 2 Timothy chapter number three,

00:09:01.599 --> 00:09:04.440
but turn over to 2 Peter chapter number one.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.000
And it's interesting because Peter is the human penman

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.440
to the book of 2 Peter,

00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:12.520
containing his name here in the particular epistle.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.640
He is the human penman,

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.479
but remember all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:09:16.479 --> 00:09:18.119
And as Peter is writing

00:09:18.119 --> 00:09:19.760
in this particular passage of Scripture,

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.520
we'll actually visit this passage again in a few weeks

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.000
and look at this passage in its entirety.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.559
But notice what Peter is saying.

00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:28.440
He talks about the fact

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.440
that we have a more sure word of prophecy,

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.119
and he speaks with regard to an experience

00:09:34.119 --> 00:09:36.640
that he had on the Mount of Transfiguration.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.359
If you think back to the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:09:39.359 --> 00:09:41.200
Peter, James, and John had the privilege

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.159
of going out on the Mount of Transfiguration with Jesus

00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:46.640
and seeing Jesus in that time

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.200
and hearing the voice of the Father.

00:09:50.719 --> 00:09:54.559
And Peter references this particular account

00:09:54.559 --> 00:09:55.840
in this passage of Scripture,

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.039
and he speaks about hearing the voice of God Almighty,

00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:00.080
but he says that we...

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:06.200
have a more sure word of prophecy. Notice what he says in verse number 19, we have also

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:13.880
a more sure word of prophecy, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.100
that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.680
And then he's going to answer the question that we've posed this morning in verses 20

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.840
and 21, and that's with regard to the process of inspiration. If God tells us that all Scripture

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:34.040
is given by inspiration of God, how did God do that? This reveals His greatness. It says

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:43.780
in verse 20, knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:50.680
For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man. That's important for us to understand.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.680
It's not that Isaiah just decided one day, I'm going to write Scripture. It's not that

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:59.840
Jeremiah or one of the other prophets just decided on a whim, on their own, that they're

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.520
going to write Scripture. No, the Bible says that the prophecy came not in old time by

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:13.400
the will of man. But holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. We've

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.560
got to think about this truth of inspiration. The Bible is not man's words. Many people

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:21.720
today would make that false claim about the Bible. They would say, hey listen, the Bible,

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.120
that's just a bunch of people that wrote the Bible. How can you trust that? No, they

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:31.520
don't understand what the Bible is. The Bible is not just a compilation of individuals of

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:39.000
men that wrote things. No, the Bible is God's Word. And all Scripture is given by inspiration

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:48.240
of God, and we find this morning that He used men to record His Word. He used men to record

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:53.280
His Word. The word inspiration literally means God-breathed. We think about the truth

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.980
of inspiration, and we'll deal with this also when we deal with the subject of preservation

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:02.240
next week, but when we think about the truth of inspiration, we would believe and hold

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:09.360
to that the Bible teaches clearly this truth of verbal plenary inspiration. You say, I've

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.960
not heard that term before. I'm not familiar with that term. The word verbal means the

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.920
very words. The very words. And the word plenary means the entirety of it. So when we think

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:25.400
about the Bible, the Word of God that we hold in our hand this morning, and we think about

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.080
this truth of inspiration, the Bible says that all Scripture is given by inspiration

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:35.440
of God, that it's the entirety, the whole of the Bible, and it's the very words. God

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:40.000
did not just give thoughts. He did not just tell Paul, write on this subject, or tell

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:45.200
Isaiah to write on this theme, or Ezekiel to write on this thought. No, God gave the

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:52.040
very words. It's important for us to understand that this morning, because again, before we

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:56.640
are going to talk about what the Bible says, we must understand what the Bible is. And

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.000
as we consider the truth of inspiration this morning, we see that inspiration reveals to

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.560
us the greatness of God. Consider with me a truth from the book of Deuteronomy in chapter

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:11.400
4. And you don't need to turn there. I'll read the verse for you. You can if you want.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:16.600
But Deuteronomy chapter 4, of course God is preparing His people for entrance into the

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:21.580
land of promise, and He's using Moses. And Moses is given this final charge, and it says

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.800
in verse number 1 of Deuteronomy 4,

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.640
Now therefore hearken, O Israel, under the statutes and under the judgments which I teach

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.060
you, for to do them that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the Lord

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.860
God of your fathers giveth you. Notice what He says,

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:41.460
Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish aught from

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.940
it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:52.260
God's concerned about the very word. A jot and a tittle is what the Bible speaks about,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.280
that heaven and earth shall pass, but not a jot nor a tittle from God's Word is going

00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:03.320
to pass. And we find this morning that God has given the individual words. That's important

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:08.120
for us to understand, because we cannot just take a pen knife and just start carving things

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:12.800
out of the Bible that we say we just don't like or doesn't kind of fit with what we want

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:19.680
to do. No, every word. I've often said over the years, I'm reminded of times in Bible

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:25.280
college and preparation, even in high school, with term papers that were required to be

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:30.640
written, and how often you were told that you had to have a paper written that contained

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.600
a certain number of words. I'm not sure if you had that experience as I did, but I remember

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.500
having that experience, and I remember coming to a place where I'd have that paper just

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:47.800
about written, and you'd check your word count and find out that you were short. I got to

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:56.760
know a lot of different words that I could just kind of plug in and just fill. Admittedly,

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:04.560
I did that. Can I tell you this morning that this book has no filler? No filler. No one

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:13.960
told God how many books, how many words, how many verses, how many chapters. No, no. God

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:19.680
gave us exactly what He wanted us to have. And that's why we understand with this truth

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:27.840
of verbal plenary inspiration that every word is important. And we study the Word of God.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:33.160
We study and we learn and we're helped and we're encouraged and we're strengthened. We

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.920
find this morning that He speaks about the whole of the Bible. In the New Testament,

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:41.640
you know that Jesus often referred to the Old Testament. We find that Paul, in 1 Corinthians

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.280
chapter number 10, in referring back to the Old Testament through the things that were

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:50.320
written before. He says this in verse number 11 of 1 Corinthians 10, now all these things

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:56.380
happened unto them for in samples, and they are written for our admonition upon whom the

00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:03.160
ends of the world are come. Romans, Paul says the same thing over in Romans about the things

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.040
that were written aforetime were written for our learning. And I'm thankful this morning

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.440
that as we look back, and even in our text of Scripture this morning, in 2 Timothy chapter

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:16.840
number 3, when Paul is giving Timothy this charge and he's giving him this instruction,

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:22.680
he says that from a child, in verse number 15, thou hast known the Holy Scriptures, which

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:27.080
are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus. And

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:31.160
what Paul would be referring to is the Old Testament. He refers to them as being Holy

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:36.480
Scriptures. He then tells Timothy in chapter number 4 to preach the Word. He's referring

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:41.840
to the same thing, the Bible, the Word of God, the Scriptures. And we find here this

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:48.520
morning that he gives us this truth and he reveals to us that every word and then the

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:57.200
entirety is given by inspiration of God. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:04.160
Now how does this truth of inspiration reveal the greatness of God? Well you recognize this

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.280
morning that as we look at this book that we hold in our hands that there are about

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:16.440
40 different human penmen over a span of time of about 1,500 years, three different languages

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:27.480
and three different continents, yet we have one perfect book. It's amazing. It's amazing.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:32.560
I'm not sure how many people are in the auditorium this morning, but if we were to just have

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:38.160
a topic been given to each of us that we would write a one page, not a certain number

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:44.240
of words, but just write one page on a particular subject, I'm sure we'd come up with some contradictions

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:52.120
amongst ourselves. Over 1,500 years, 40 different people, three different languages, three different

00:17:52.120 --> 00:18:00.000
continents and you have one complete perfect book. Why? Because of the author. Because

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.400
inspiration reveals the greatness of God. That God is able to take the different personalities

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:14.080
of the human penmen and he's able to communicate his very word to us. It's amazing. You think

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:20.080
about God's greatness being revealed in that manner. This morning as we think about the

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:25.760
process of inspiration, I want you to consider with me number two, the product of inspiration.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:31.200
The product of inspiration. Because the Bible is given by inspiration, it is literally the

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.559
word of God and is therefore profitable. Notice what it says in 2 Timothy 3 and verse number

00:18:36.559 --> 00:18:43.739
16. Because the scripture is given by inspiration, and we've looked there just for a moment,

00:18:43.739 --> 00:18:49.440
the process of inspiration, you find that the truth is given to us with regard to the

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:57.119
product of inspiration. Because it is God-breathed, because it is the word of God, it is profitable.

00:18:57.119 --> 00:19:05.600
It is profitable. There are certain things that we look to and we gain a measure of profit

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:12.480
from something and we can think about owner's manuals and how-to type of books. And the

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:18.400
reality is that if you were to get a particular manual on something, you had a particular

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:23.920
product that you were trying to operate and you wanted to operate that thing properly,

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:29.600
you would hope to have a manual written about that product by someone who knew something

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:35.520
about the product. Make sense? Right? Otherwise, it's probably not going to be really profitable.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.840
So I can be very helpful. Hey, would you write a manual on how-to? And you're like, I've

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:44.799
never done that before. How am I supposed to write a manual on that? When I worked at

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.440
Sikorsky in the corporate world for a number of years, we would have standard operating

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.480
procedures. Many of you in the workplace, you understand standard operating procedures

00:19:54.480 --> 00:20:00.000
and instructions. We'd also have work instructions. And I was regularly tapped and would…

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.019
within our department to write work instructions.

00:20:04.019 --> 00:20:07.480
The idea of writing a work instruction at Sikorsky

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.720
was that someone that was considered

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.960
to be a subject matter expert in a particular area

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.440
would write a work instruction that someone

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.360
that had no knowledge of that particular field or work

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:24.479
could take that work instruction and complete the task.

00:20:24.479 --> 00:20:25.440
That was the objective.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.040
That's what we're seeking to do.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.639
And I had the privilege during that period of time

00:20:30.639 --> 00:20:33.040
to author several work instructions,

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.439
and we'd go through the process,

00:20:34.439 --> 00:20:37.139
and it was quite enjoyable, actually.

00:20:37.139 --> 00:20:41.400
We look at this book that we hold in our hands this morning.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.159
It is given by inspiration.

00:20:45.159 --> 00:20:50.159
Therefore, it is God's word, and it is profitable,

00:20:50.479 --> 00:20:52.360
because God is the creator.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.560
He knows everything.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.880
He has all wisdom, and he has all power,

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.040
and so he's given us exactly what we need

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.200
within the pages of this book.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.400
We find that here in 2 Timothy 3 and verse number 16,

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.919
he specifies in four different areas

00:21:07.919 --> 00:21:10.360
how God's word is profitable.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:15.080
Notice he says it's profitable for doctrine, for teaching.

00:21:16.319 --> 00:21:17.919
We speak about doctrine.

00:21:17.919 --> 00:21:18.760
Let me say this.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.220
Doctrine matters.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.360
Doctrine is important.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.519
We find that the book of Titus is written,

00:21:24.519 --> 00:21:26.519
if you were to read just the first chapter

00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:27.919
and enter just a couple of verses

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:29.639
in the second chapter of the book of Titus,

00:21:29.639 --> 00:21:32.279
you'll find three or four different references

00:21:32.279 --> 00:21:36.800
that Paul is making to Titus about sound doctrine.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.360
In fact, here, even within the context

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.400
of this passage of Scripture,

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.919
he says how the Bible is given by inspiration of God

00:21:44.919 --> 00:21:46.760
and is profitable for doctrine.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.519
He then says this in verse number two.

00:21:48.519 --> 00:21:50.319
Preach the word of chapter four.

00:21:50.319 --> 00:21:52.279
Be instant in season, out of season.

00:21:52.319 --> 00:21:54.879
Reprove, rebuke, exhort.

00:21:54.879 --> 00:21:58.639
Notice when he says with all longsuffering and doctrine,

00:21:58.639 --> 00:22:02.879
for the time will come when they will not endure

00:22:02.879 --> 00:22:06.360
sound doctrine, but instead, after their own lusts,

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:10.399
shall they keep to themselves teachers having itching ears.

00:22:10.399 --> 00:22:14.440
Far too often today, doctrine is set aside

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.779
as people seek to say, well, let's just have unity.

00:22:18.639 --> 00:22:21.500
The best way to have unity is to agree on this book.

00:22:22.679 --> 00:22:23.919
Let me rephrase that.

00:22:23.919 --> 00:22:25.039
It's not the best way to have unity.

00:22:25.039 --> 00:22:26.960
It's really the only way to have unity

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:32.960
is by agreeing as to what God has said in this book.

00:22:33.119 --> 00:22:34.839
We must be students of the book.

00:22:34.839 --> 00:22:39.100
We often understand that we would speak about our faith.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.279
Our faith.

00:22:41.279 --> 00:22:43.320
The Bible says that we're to earnestly contend

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.699
for the faith that was once delivered,

00:22:45.699 --> 00:22:48.199
that body of doctrine, that teaching,

00:22:48.199 --> 00:22:51.679
and the Bible is given by inspiration of God

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.360
and therefore, the Bible is profitable for doctrine.

00:22:57.399 --> 00:23:01.779
As a Baptist person, we would say, without any shame,

00:23:01.779 --> 00:23:06.779
the Bible is our sole authority for faith and practice.

00:23:08.839 --> 00:23:10.960
Why do you believe what you believe?

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.800
Well, let's look at what the Bible says.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.320
And as we agree as to what God has given us in his word,

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.440
because God's word is authoritative

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.039
because it's given by inspiration,

00:23:21.039 --> 00:23:23.059
it is therefore profitable for doctrine.

00:23:23.059 --> 00:23:24.279
Notice he says this.

00:23:24.279 --> 00:23:26.039
Not only is it profitable for doctrine,

00:23:26.039 --> 00:23:28.720
but it's for reproof.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.399
You know, reproof, to reprove someone,

00:23:31.399 --> 00:23:34.179
to rebuke someone is to expose error.

00:23:35.759 --> 00:23:38.199
It shows us, the Bible,

00:23:38.199 --> 00:23:40.240
because it's given by inspiration of God,

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.500
the product of inspiration is that it's profitable.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.960
It's profitable for doctrine,

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.919
but it's also profitable for reproof.

00:23:46.919 --> 00:23:48.839
It shows us where we're wrong.

00:23:49.839 --> 00:23:52.679
Before you began reading the Bible,

00:23:52.679 --> 00:23:54.800
before you trust that Christ is your savior,

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:59.479
maybe you had ideas and thoughts about spiritual matters,

00:23:59.479 --> 00:24:01.639
about heavenly things.

00:24:01.639 --> 00:24:03.360
And then you got saved and you started reading the Bible

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.039
and you found out, man, I was wrong about some stuff.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:10.820
I, like many people, had this idea, my belief.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.300
I don't know where I got the belief.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.300
I can't pinpoint that anyone ever sat me down

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.119
and taught me this, but my understanding,

00:24:18.119 --> 00:24:20.440
if you were to ask me before I trust that Christ

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.880
is my savior, before I started reading the Bible,

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.679
hey, if you're to die, you're gonna go to heaven.

00:24:25.679 --> 00:24:28.859
My thought, my belief, my understanding

00:24:28.859 --> 00:24:31.660
of how I would get to heaven is by being a good person.

00:24:32.799 --> 00:24:35.679
I kind of had this idea that if my good deeds

00:24:35.679 --> 00:24:37.279
outweighed my bad deeds,

00:24:37.279 --> 00:24:40.380
that somehow I would gain entrance to heaven.

00:24:41.359 --> 00:24:44.200
I know a lot of people that still think that today.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.160
A lot of people that I talk to and ask them about heaven,

00:24:47.279 --> 00:24:49.679
that that's their understanding, that's their belief.

00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:51.559
But you know what?

00:24:51.559 --> 00:24:53.839
This Bible exposed that error.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.600
Because the Bible says,

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.320
not by works of righteousness, which we have done,

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.579
but according to his mercy, he has saved us.

00:25:01.579 --> 00:25:03.600
The Bible says, for by grace are you saved through faith

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.399
and that not of yourselves, it's the gift of God,

00:25:06.399 --> 00:25:09.519
not of works, lest any man should boast.

00:25:09.519 --> 00:25:12.880
And I had to be confronted with the truth

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.959
that what I thought was wrong.

00:25:15.959 --> 00:25:17.559
But why was it wrong?

00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:19.720
Because of this book.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.399
Because this book is God's word

00:25:21.399 --> 00:25:24.359
and it's given by inspiration and it's profitable,

00:25:24.359 --> 00:25:26.600
not only for doctrine, but for reproof,

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.079
and it exposes error.

00:25:28.079 --> 00:25:30.239
We could go on and on with error that's exposed,

00:25:30.239 --> 00:25:32.239
but I need to move forward.

00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:35.399
Notice it says this, for correction.

00:25:35.399 --> 00:25:36.359
For correction.

00:25:36.359 --> 00:25:38.079
I'm so thankful for this.

00:25:38.079 --> 00:25:40.700
Because not only does God's word expose error,

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.140
but it corrects us.

00:25:43.119 --> 00:25:44.359
Isn't that wonderful?

00:25:44.359 --> 00:25:46.959
I mean, isn't it a terrible thing

00:25:46.959 --> 00:25:48.640
when someone says, nope, that's wrong?

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.720
Okay, well then tell me how to do it right.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.260
Correct it, right?

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.399
So God says, no, through his word,

00:25:55.399 --> 00:25:58.079
he exposed the error in my thinking

00:25:58.079 --> 00:25:59.859
with regard to salvation,

00:25:59.859 --> 00:26:03.799
but then also at the same time gave me the truth

00:26:03.799 --> 00:26:07.720
of salvation, corrected my wrong thinking.

00:26:09.359 --> 00:26:11.200
Isn't that wonderful?

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.160
It's a blessing.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.359
Sometimes, watching some basketball yesterday,

00:26:16.359 --> 00:26:17.519
been watching a lot of basketball

00:26:17.519 --> 00:26:19.000
over the last couple of months with the kids,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.679
both Joseph and Brianna playing,

00:26:20.679 --> 00:26:22.040
and going to a lot of games,

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:27.040
and sometimes a ref will keep calling a violation.

00:26:27.119 --> 00:26:28.160
It's always exciting.

00:26:29.279 --> 00:26:30.839
Sometimes they get whistle happy.

00:26:30.839 --> 00:26:32.839
Let's just play the game, you know?

00:26:32.839 --> 00:26:35.359
And sometimes, every once in a while,

00:26:35.359 --> 00:26:37.500
Brianna didn't do it this year, she did it last year,

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.959
she kept getting called for this violation.

00:26:39.959 --> 00:26:42.200
It wasn't a foul, just getting called for travel.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.640
So in between quarters, she went to the referee

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.200
and she said, can you tell me what I'm doing wrong?

00:26:49.239 --> 00:26:53.200
That referee was the authority on that court.

00:26:54.119 --> 00:26:56.040
And you keep calling me for a travel,

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.519
but I wanna understand how am I traveling

00:26:58.519 --> 00:27:00.160
with what I'm doing?

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.399
And guess what the referee did?

00:27:01.399 --> 00:27:03.279
Explained it to her,

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.519
so that she could correct

00:27:07.519 --> 00:27:10.279
and thus not get called for the violation.

00:27:10.279 --> 00:27:13.200
God's word is profitable for doctrine,

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.559
for reproof, for correction.

00:27:16.559 --> 00:27:18.079
How to correct that which is wrong,

00:27:18.079 --> 00:27:19.359
that which has been exposed.

00:27:19.359 --> 00:27:20.480
But then also the Bible says,

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.200
for instruction in righteousness.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.359
How to stay right.

00:27:26.839 --> 00:27:29.760
How to live a life that pleases God.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.920
For instruction in righteousness.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.760
I'm thankful that God's given us this book,

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.880
and this book provides us with instruction for living.

00:27:40.679 --> 00:27:42.679
You wanna know how to be a good husband?

00:27:44.239 --> 00:27:46.600
Read the Bible, seriously.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.119
You say, oh, I got this really good book

00:27:48.119 --> 00:27:51.160
on so-and-so wrote about being a good husband.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.519
I'm not suggesting that there's not

00:27:53.519 --> 00:27:55.880
any other good books out there,

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.679
but I'm suggesting that if you read other books

00:27:57.679 --> 00:28:01.920
and not this book, you failed to get the proper source.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.920
If someone's gonna write a book on being a father,

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.559
being a husband, being a wife, being a mother,

00:28:08.559 --> 00:28:11.040
being fill-in-the-blank,

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.440
they better have gotten some truth from this book first.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.519
Amen?

00:28:16.519 --> 00:28:18.440
Dean's got a book on the back desk over there,

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.079
or on the back table, about how to song lead.

00:28:23.559 --> 00:28:24.720
I've never read the book.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.119
I'm sure there's some good things in there.

00:28:27.119 --> 00:28:28.799
But you have to understand that we're talking about

00:28:28.799 --> 00:28:30.279
song leading, we're talking about in the context

00:28:30.279 --> 00:28:33.559
of a church, that there are some spiritual truths

00:28:33.559 --> 00:28:36.320
that need to be understood before you're going

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.840
to just write about how to lead singing.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.799
In the context of pleasing God,

00:28:43.799 --> 00:28:47.840
in the context of doing things decently and in order,

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.960
in the context of they that worship him, John 4,

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.119
must worship him in spirit and in truth.

00:28:55.119 --> 00:29:00.119
We find that the word of God is profitable.

00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:05.000
The Bible not only is profitable,

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.799
the product of inspiration, but notice what the Bible says

00:29:07.799 --> 00:29:09.760
in 2 Timothy 3 and verse 17.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.239
The Bible equips the child of God.

00:29:12.239 --> 00:29:14.119
He says that it's profitable for these things,

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:16.039
for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,

00:29:16.039 --> 00:29:17.200
for instruction in righteousness.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.320
Then notice verse 17, that the man of God may be perfect,

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:26.320
throughly furnished unto all good works.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:30.400
The Bible equips the child of God.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.280
It equips us.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.239
I'm so thankful for the equipping.

00:29:34.239 --> 00:29:36.000
I'm so thankful that the Holy Spirit of God

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.320
who lives within me, the Holy Spirit of God,

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.479
if you've been saved this morning that lives within you,

00:29:40.479 --> 00:29:42.880
that he will guide you into all truth

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.719
and that he will help you to be in that place

00:29:45.719 --> 00:29:48.000
where you're equipped, where you're complete

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.200
and throughly furnished unto all good works.

00:29:53.239 --> 00:29:54.640
We mentioned on Wednesday evening,

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.679
as we've studied through Psalm 37,

00:29:56.679 --> 00:29:58.039
a couple of different references

00:29:58.039 --> 00:30:00.000
where the psalmist says, do good.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:08.079
We ask the question this way, how do you know what's good? Who determines good? God alone.

00:30:08.079 --> 00:30:13.359
The only one who is good, He's the one that determines what is good.

00:30:13.359 --> 00:30:17.760
And we find this morning that the Bible is profitable, the Bible equips.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:24.479
But the truth of inspiration, we talked about the process of inspiration, the product of inspiration,

00:30:24.479 --> 00:30:28.239
and we think about the truth that it's profitable, that it equips us.

00:30:28.239 --> 00:30:33.200
But I want you to consider this morning that the truth of inspiration results in several things.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:40.880
Number one, it results in this, that this book, the Bible, is pure. It's pure.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:48.400
In Proverbs 30 and verse number 5, it's a precious verse that deals with the fact that the Bible is pure

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:53.599
and also deals with the truth that we mentioned about verbal plenary inspiration.

00:30:53.599 --> 00:31:02.319
The Bible says this in Proverbs 30 and verse number 5, every word of God is pure.

00:31:02.319 --> 00:31:05.440
He is a shield unto them that put their trust in Him.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:10.720
The psalmist says this in Psalm 119 and verse number 140,

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:16.879
thy word is very pure, therefore thy servant loveth it.

00:31:16.959 --> 00:31:19.919
Whew, man, it's a pure book.

00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:27.519
Everything that is contained within the pages of this Bible from Genesis 1-1 through Revelation 22-21,

00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:32.559
it is absolutely pure in everything that is contained therein.

00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:40.400
And we look at the Bible and we understand that the Bible says that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:45.199
And because it is the word of God, it's pure.

00:31:45.199 --> 00:31:52.319
There are some that say they don't agree with what God's word is.

00:31:52.319 --> 00:31:59.279
So then they have difficulty with what God's word says because they don't agree with what God's word is.

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:03.919
We talk about the word of God being pure, the Bible being pure.

00:32:03.919 --> 00:32:06.800
It is pure in all that it records.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:11.759
The record that is provided is reliable.

00:32:11.759 --> 00:32:13.919
It is trustworthy.

00:32:13.919 --> 00:32:16.800
How do we know what happened?

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.520
We dealt with Hezekiah a couple of weeks ago.

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.800
How do we know what Sennacherib and Rabshakeh really said?

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.639
How do we know if it's true?

00:32:24.639 --> 00:32:29.360
How do we know if Hezekiah didn't just make something up, if Isaiah was just making something up?

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.559
No, every word of God is pure.

00:32:32.559 --> 00:32:42.240
So what Sennacherib and Rabshakeh said we can trust and we can say is a reliable source because every word of God is pure.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:49.839
How do you know what happened in the garden?

00:32:49.839 --> 00:32:51.520
We look at Genesis chapter number 3.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.800
Is Genesis 3 foundational?

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.800
It's absolutely foundational.

00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:02.800
If we don't have Genesis chapter number 3 understood, so many things fall apart.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:08.960
But in Genesis chapter number 3, the Bible says that the serpent, who's more subtle than any beast of the field,

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.360
he enters into the garden and he says,

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.479
yea, hath God said.

00:33:14.479 --> 00:33:16.399
How do we know if that's true?

00:33:16.399 --> 00:33:18.720
Because every word of God is pure.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.479
And the record of Genesis 3 is given to us.

00:33:22.479 --> 00:33:32.479
Yes, it's the serpent that's speaking to Eve, but God has recorded it to us in the Bible because all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:33:32.479 --> 00:33:35.279
Thus, the Bible is pure.

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:36.720
It is trustworthy.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.160
It is reliable.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:46.320
And we can say we understand with absolute certainty what happened in the garden in Genesis 3.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.960
Why? Because God's given us a record.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.440
He's given us a pure record.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:55.759
The psalmist said this in Psalm 33 in verse number 14.

00:33:55.759 --> 00:34:01.119
Notice what the Bible says, excuse me, verse number 4 in Psalm 33 and verse number 4.

00:34:01.119 --> 00:34:08.960
For the word of the Lord is right and all his works are done in truth.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:13.119
I'm thankful this morning that I can trust this book.

00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:14.960
It's pure.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.040
Every word of God is pure.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:22.480
And we couple that and we understand that all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:29.839
And since all scripture is given by inspiration of God, this is the word of God and God's word is pure.

00:34:29.839 --> 00:34:36.000
It is a trustworthy, reliable record that God has given to us.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.160
And that's the product of inspiration.

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:44.640
Not only is it pure, we would say this, this book, the Bible, is incapable of error.

00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.480
It's incapable of error.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.359
By the way, I'm thankful for that truth.

00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:57.200
We live in a time today that so many people want to say, well, this is an error and that's an error and there's a problem over here.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.119
I read a theologian of yesteryear many, many years ago.

00:35:01.119 --> 00:35:03.600
I don't remember who it was at this point.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:08.799
But he said this, if you think the Bible's got a mistake, then you're wrong.

00:35:08.799 --> 00:35:10.799
You're mistaken.

00:35:10.799 --> 00:35:12.480
And he said, you need to go back to the drawing board.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.519
You need to dig in.

00:35:13.519 --> 00:35:15.839
You need to study more.

00:35:15.839 --> 00:35:20.079
See, there are nuggets that God has given us within his word.

00:35:20.079 --> 00:35:25.200
As we study it and we dig in and we don't just look at some surface thing.

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:32.399
By the way, this morning, the reality is that there are so many things that can be found on the internet.

00:35:32.399 --> 00:35:34.079
Be careful about the internet.

00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:36.160
I mentioned this on Wednesday evening.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:40.320
Oh, how careful we must be.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:55.119
I've spoken to some people over the last couple of years that have come to me with errors, contradictions.

00:35:55.119 --> 00:36:07.279
People that I know, and I'm not saying this prideful here boastfully, I know from their testimony, all right, so I'm not saying something that they've not said, that they don't read this book.

00:36:07.279 --> 00:36:09.519
They don't read the Bible.

00:36:09.519 --> 00:36:18.480
And yet, they're going to come to me with some contradictions of some, this verse says this, but way over here in this chapter, it says this.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.519
Say, where did you find that?

00:36:21.519 --> 00:36:28.079
And all of a sudden, if you just go on Google and type in biblical contradictions, it's like the first two that pop up.

00:36:28.079 --> 00:36:30.160
That's where they found it.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:34.799
And be careful, because God's word is incapable of error.

00:36:34.799 --> 00:36:35.440
Why?

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:39.679
Because our God is perfect, and our God is incapable of error.

00:36:39.679 --> 00:36:44.399
Titus, in chapter 1 and verse number 2, says this, the book of Titus 1-2,

00:36:44.399 --> 00:36:50.320
and hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie promised before the world began.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:53.600
I'm thankful that God is truth.

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.880
He cannot lie.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.600
This book, the Bible, is incapable of error.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:57.920
Why?

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.799
Because it's God's word.

00:37:00.799 --> 00:37:08.000
See, if you write something, if you say something, if you speak as much as I speak, you're going to say something wrong.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.440
We're humans.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.679
But God is perfect.

00:37:13.679 --> 00:37:20.399
He has given us a book that's perfect, because all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:37:20.399 --> 00:37:27.119
This book, because of the truth of inspiration, we talked about the process and the product,

00:37:27.119 --> 00:37:30.799
because of the truth of inspiration, this book is authoritative.

00:37:30.799 --> 00:37:33.279
It's authoritative.

00:37:33.279 --> 00:37:38.000
See, notice what the psalmist says, and we'll finish here in Psalm 19.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.760
Notice what the psalmist says.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:48.160
We talk about this book being authoritative.

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:51.760
In Psalm 19 and verse number 7, the Bible says,

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:55.040
The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:58.320
The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.040
The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:04.559
The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.

00:38:04.559 --> 00:38:07.600
The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.799
The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.

00:38:10.799 --> 00:38:12.799
Notice verse 10 of Psalm 19.

00:38:12.799 --> 00:38:18.399
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold.

00:38:18.399 --> 00:38:22.399
Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

00:38:22.399 --> 00:38:32.799
Moreover, verse 11, by them is thy servant warned, and in keeping of them there is great reward.

00:38:32.799 --> 00:38:38.400
God's Word is authoritative because of what it is, because it's God's Word.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:47.200
Begin to think about people, humans, interactions that we have, one with another.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:51.440
Someone's word that might be authoritative.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.200
Someone that has some position of authority.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:39:00.799
The word that they give is authoritative because of the position that they hold.

00:39:00.799 --> 00:39:04.880
We understand that in life. We deal with that.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:08.479
I mentioned a reference a moment ago about on the basketball court.

00:39:08.479 --> 00:39:12.320
The coaches can disagree, the players can disagree,

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:16.559
but that guy with that black and white striped shirt and that whistle,

00:39:16.559 --> 00:39:20.080
he is the authority on that court.

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:24.640
Like it or not, it's just the way it works.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:31.840
We can think about a number of positions that people hold and the word that they speak having authority,

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:36.799
but I want you to understand that God is the eternal God.

00:39:36.799 --> 00:39:40.320
He's the omnipotent God. He rules. He reigns.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:46.799
He is the Lord God Almighty, and He's given us the Bible.

00:39:46.799 --> 00:39:53.520
And because He's given it to us by inspiration, because every word of God is pure,

00:39:53.520 --> 00:40:00.000
because of the truth of inspiration, then we understand that this book is authoritative.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
You can say, I disagree with it.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
That's up to you.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.880
You've got a problem with God because God's Word is authoritative.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.079
God's Word is authoritative.

00:40:12.079 --> 00:40:17.760
I think this morning that it's in our best interest as we find in Psalm 19 and also in

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:22.559
2 Peter 1, it's in our best interest to take heed.

00:40:22.559 --> 00:40:25.479
It says, moreover by them is my servant warned.

00:40:25.479 --> 00:40:28.680
You know, warnings are good for us.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.280
People get warnings.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.799
We're familiar with warnings, by the way.

00:40:33.799 --> 00:40:37.759
Go home this afternoon and you look at some products that you have at home and you look

00:40:37.759 --> 00:40:45.599
at the labels, especially cleaning supplies, warning labels, right?

00:40:45.599 --> 00:40:47.279
We're familiar with warnings.

00:40:47.279 --> 00:40:52.340
I was sharing with someone this past week about warnings.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.720
We see warnings on the road.

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:56.720
Bridge out ahead.

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.500
Aren't you thankful for that warning?

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:04.959
Can you imagine if no one took the time to put the sign up, you just kept on driving?

00:41:04.959 --> 00:41:07.959
It'd be a problem.

00:41:07.959 --> 00:41:09.919
God's given us warnings in His Word.

00:41:09.919 --> 00:41:13.400
Moreover by them is my servant warned.

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:18.559
This is this, and in keeping of them, there is great reward.

00:41:18.559 --> 00:41:20.720
Wow.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.760
Who's the reward come from?

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:27.680
The one who gave us the book.

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:34.279
He said this to Joshua, this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou

00:41:34.279 --> 00:41:37.080
shalt meditate therein day and night.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.080
Why?

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:41.800
Why is it so important that this book not depart out of my mouth?

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.980
Why is it so necessary that I meditate in it day and night?

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:47.220
Because it's God's Word.

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.120
Because it's God's Word.

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:56.279
Then shalt thou find good success, have thy way prosperous and find good success.

00:41:56.279 --> 00:41:59.139
Think about the truth of Psalm 1.

00:41:59.139 --> 00:42:01.760
He shall be like a tree that's planted by the river.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:02.760
Who is it?

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:09.279
The one that meditates on the Word day and night because they understand what it is.

00:42:09.279 --> 00:42:16.160
This morning, we thank the Lord for giving us the Bible.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.559
What a blessing.

00:42:17.559 --> 00:42:23.759
This book, someone said this, this book is the mind of God, the state of man, the way

00:42:23.759 --> 00:42:28.240
of salvation, the doom of sinners, the happiness of believers.

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:33.000
Its doctrines are holy, its precepts are binding, its histories are true, its decisions are

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
immutable.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.880
Read it to be wise, believe it to be safe, practice it to be holy.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:45.399
This morning, I believe that inspiration reveals the greatness of God.

00:42:45.399 --> 00:42:52.520
God used, we talked about the process, 40 men, over 1500 years, 3 languages, 3 continents

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:56.759
to give us one complete pure book.

00:42:56.759 --> 00:43:04.360
It's precious and it reveals to us how great God is that He could do that.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:09.559
The one that transcends time, the one that's outside of time was able to do that because

00:43:09.559 --> 00:43:14.800
all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:22.080
This morning, I hope that we have a newfound appreciation for the Bible.

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:27.279
We'll talk about it as we go over the next few weeks of understanding how God's greatness

00:43:27.279 --> 00:43:31.000
is revealed through giving us the Bible, but then what is my response to it?

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.800
We already gave a little indication of that with Joshua 1 and verse number 8.

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:41.380
How I approach the Bible, what I do with the Bible, how I live by the precepts that are

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:42.820
contained there and why?

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:45.339
Because I understand it's from God.

00:43:45.339 --> 00:43:52.020
It's not just Paul speaking, it's not just Isaiah speaking, it's not just David speaking,

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:57.139
it's God speaking because all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:43:57.139 --> 00:44:01.979
What a joy, what a blessing that every day you have the opportunity in your life to open

00:44:01.979 --> 00:44:10.460
up this book to hear from God, to hear from God, to be benefited because it's profitable,

00:44:10.539 --> 00:44:12.740
to be helped.

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.759
This book is precious.

00:44:14.759 --> 00:44:23.619
This book is the greatest of all books because God, who alone is great, is its author.

00:44:23.619 --> 00:44:24.619
Let's pray together.

00:44:24.619 --> 00:44:25.619
Father, we love you.

00:44:25.619 --> 00:44:27.820
Thank you for loving us.

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:30.619
We thank you this morning for the Bible.

00:44:30.619 --> 00:44:36.899
We thank you that in your infinite wisdom, you determined that you would give us the

00:44:36.899 --> 00:44:37.899
Bible.

00:44:37.899 --> 00:44:40.019
You would give us your word.

00:44:40.579 --> 00:44:44.779
I thank you that the Bible says of itself that we're to take the sword of the Spirit,

00:44:44.779 --> 00:44:50.260
which is the word of God, that your word is quick and powerful and sharper than a two-edged

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:53.339
sword, that your word endures forever.

00:44:53.339 --> 00:44:58.700
Forever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven.

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:00.739
Heaven and earth shall pass away.

00:45:00.739 --> 00:45:04.339
All this book will endure.

00:45:04.339 --> 00:45:09.500
Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:18.420
Lord, I pray this morning, you'd help us to see your greatness revealed through inspiration.

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:26.100
We'd understand with a newfound appreciation how precious this Bible is.

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:36.660
I pray, God, that you would help us to allow it to be profitable in our lives for doctrine,

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.859
for reproof, for correction, for instruction.

00:45:38.859 --> 00:45:44.779
God, I pray that we'd be equipped, thoroughly furnished.

00:45:44.779 --> 00:45:51.540
Pray, God, that we would submit ourselves, understanding the authority of this book.

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:54.980
It's pure, free of error.

00:45:54.980 --> 00:46:02.700
Oh, how thankful each of us ought to be this morning to have a Bible.

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:08.619
I pray, Lord, that if there's one that's not sure of heaven, Lord, we spoke this morning

00:46:08.619 --> 00:46:16.940
how the Holy Scriptures make thee wise unto salvation, the truth that's contained therein

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.739
with regard to eternal life.

00:46:18.739 --> 00:46:23.940
Lord, I pray that if one's not sure of heaven, that we'd have an opportunity to take a Bible

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:26.859
and show them how they could know for sure that heaven's their home.

00:46:26.859 --> 00:46:31.980
Lord, someone this morning, many that may be struggling with a variety of areas in their

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:41.820
lives, because of understanding the preciousness of this book, it's been given by inspiration

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:42.820
of God.

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:46.260
It is the very Word of God, and it's profitable for us.

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:53.299
God, you would help us that you'd meet the needs that are represented amongst the congregation

00:46:53.299 --> 00:47:00.100
this morning, understanding that we must run to your Word to get the answer, to understand

00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:05.019
the path that should be before us.

00:47:05.019 --> 00:47:08.739
I pray, Lord, that you'd move and work in this few moments of invitation as only you

00:47:08.739 --> 00:47:09.739
can.

00:47:09.739 --> 00:47:13.619
I pray that decisions would be made that would please thee, for it's in Christ's name we

00:47:13.619 --> 00:47:14.619
pray.

00:47:14.619 --> 00:47:14.619
