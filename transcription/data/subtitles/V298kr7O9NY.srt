1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Revelation chapter number two,

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,960
and I'm thankful for God's word,

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,360
and I know that you are as well.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,359
It's a tremendous blessing to be able to have a Bible.

5
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:13,380
I'm reminded of so many people around the globe

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,200
that do not have a Bible in their own language,

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,200
and what a sad thing that is.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,479
I'm reminded of those around the globe

9
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,520
that are forbidden to have a Bible,

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,040
that if they're found with a Bible,

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,219
it's criminal, it's a problem,

12
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:29,940
and I'm thankful that we can freely carry our Bibles

13
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,939
with us, that we can declare the truth

14
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:35,319
that God has given to us in his word,

15
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:38,619
that we can read it and study it, be challenged by it,

16
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:39,860
and I'm so thankful.

17
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,599
Last week, as we started Revelation chapter number two,

18
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:44,700
we had the opportunity to review

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,080
much of what God has given us in his word

20
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,259
with regard to the church at Ephesus.

21
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:52,540
Of course, we know that the church there in Ephesus,

22
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,200
God gave us some information with regard to

23
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,400
the ministry of the Apostle Paul in the book of Acts

24
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,799
with regard to the city of Ephesus and his ministry there.

25
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,000
There's a letter that is written to the church

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,680
there at Ephesus, the book of Ephesians,

27
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,080
and then of course, the two books that we've been studying

28
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,279
throughout this calendar year,

29
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:14,440
of 1st and 2nd Timothy are written to Timothy,

30
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,080
who's ministering in Ephesus,

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,680
and so there's an abundance of information

32
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,080
that God gives us about the church at Ephesus,

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,019
and we have the opportunity to study those things

34
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:27,339
really as helpful background information

35
00:01:27,339 --> 00:01:30,019
to this letter that is written, the first of seven.

36
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:31,980
It's interesting, as we looked last week,

37
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,739
we noted that the church at Ephesus was commended.

38
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:37,860
What was it that led to the Lord

39
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,680
commending the church at Ephesus?

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,779
Well, they were faithfully serving the Lord,

41
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:45,139
they were separated from evil,

42
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:47,620
and they were doctrinally sound.

43
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,019
Notice with me in verse number two,

44
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:51,580
I know thy works and thy labor and thy patience

45
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,540
and how thou canst not bear them which are evil

46
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,580
and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles

47
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,980
and are not and has found them liars

48
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,339
and has borne and has patience and for my name's sake

49
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:05,900
has labored and has not fainted.

50
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,379
Notice in verse number six,

51
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:10,300
but this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds

52
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,259
of the Nicolaitans which I also hate.

53
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:16,619
And so they're commended for their faithful service

54
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:19,660
to the Lord, they're commended for being separated

55
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,419
from evil, they're commended for being doctrinally sound,

56
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:26,339
and quite honestly, the assessment that God gives

57
00:02:26,339 --> 00:02:27,820
to the church at Ephesus,

58
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,699
the church there that's in Ephesus,

59
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:32,899
I find that at this point, if we just stopped,

60
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:36,300
it would be a positive assessment, amen?

61
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,139
Man, you're faithfully serving the Lord,

62
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:41,139
you're separated and you're doctrinally sound,

63
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:42,179
man, that's good stuff.

64
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:45,460
Let's just close it up and stop the assessment, right?

65
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,880
That's probably how you'd like to feel,

66
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,220
that's how I'd like to feel,

67
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,020
and the reality is that the assessment doesn't end.

68
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,699
The Lord is going to give more to us,

69
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:58,220
to the church at Ephesus, but also to us

70
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,300
by way of preservation with regard to a full assessment.

71
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,740
You know what I'm thankful is that God is able

72
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,460
to fully assess your life, my life, and our church.

73
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,300
See, our assessment is not always accurate.

74
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,539
Would you agree with that?

75
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:17,220
Your assessment, my assessment, is not always accurate.

76
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,220
In fact, it is very possible that we could deceive ourselves

77
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,419
while we're trying to have an assessment,

78
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:26,500
we're trying to go through that process of examination,

79
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,500
we could deceive ourselves, but when God examines a man,

80
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:35,320
a child of his, when he goes through that process

81
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,320
of examination, he leaves no stone unturned, amen?

82
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:46,660
He knows every thought, he knows everything about you.

83
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,460
Good, bad, he knows it all.

84
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,000
He says, I know thy works.

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,940
The review, the assessment doesn't end in verse number three.

86
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,940
We read in verse number four where the Bible says,

87
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,699
nevertheless, we'll get into the text here in just a moment,

88
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:05,600
but I wanna remind you of two very important things.

89
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,220
Number one is each of these churches,

90
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,899
the Bible says that God says, I know thy works.

91
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:15,899
Then in each of these letters to these churches,

92
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:19,940
the Bible says, he that hath an ear, let him hear.

93
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,420
And so we find that this text, as best we can tell,

94
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:28,540
all of these churches would have received these letters,

95
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,440
one addressed to the church at Ephesus,

96
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,200
but received by all, and so on and so forth.

97
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,420
They've been preserved for us and for Christians

98
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,899
throughout the generations so that we also,

99
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:43,220
having an ear, can hear what the Spirit saith.

100
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,100
And I'm thankful that we have these records

101
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,579
that God has provided to us, and we must take heed.

102
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:52,119
As we begin looking in verse number four,

103
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:54,260
the Bible says, nevertheless.

104
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,859
How many of you wish there wasn't a nevertheless?

105
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:59,820
You get the commending, you get the applause,

106
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,859
you get the man, you're doing well, however, nevertheless.

107
00:05:03,859 --> 00:05:07,500
And God says this, I have somewhat against thee,

108
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,059
because thou hast left thy first love.

109
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:13,540
Remember, therefore, from whence thou art fallen,

110
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,019
and repent and do the first works,

111
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:18,779
or else I will come unto thee quickly

112
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:21,480
and will remove thy candlestick out of his place,

113
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,959
except thou repent.

114
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:27,100
This, verse number six, part of the commendation, really,

115
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,899
but this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds

116
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:32,859
of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate, verse seven.

117
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:35,299
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith

118
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:36,140
unto the churches.

119
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,980
To him that overcometh will I give to eat

120
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,720
of the tree of life, which is in the midst

121
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,660
of the paradise of God.

122
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,940
Notice with me, if you're taking notes this evening,

123
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,299
number one, the correction for the church at Ephesus.

124
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:53,459
We looked last week how they were commended,

125
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:56,100
but we notice a correction that is given.

126
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,420
First, they were commended, now they're corrected.

127
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,859
Can I tell you this evening that the reality of this

128
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:06,380
is that we need both, we need both.

129
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,260
There are times in which we really like

130
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,679
when it's a time of commending.

131
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,420
We don't so much like the time of correction,

132
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,380
but can I tell you this evening that as the people of God,

133
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,220
we must take both properly.

134
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,380
We must not allow when God commends,

135
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,420
as he does for the church at Ephesus here,

136
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,700
we must not allow that to go to our heads.

137
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,959
We must not allow that to puff us up

138
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,679
and to cause us to be prideful.

139
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:36,059
We must not allow that to impact us in that manner.

140
00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:37,700
No, we need to take it properly,

141
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,260
but on the same side, when we deal with the correction,

142
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,179
we must recognize that there are times

143
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:43,700
in which we need correction,

144
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,820
that there are times in which we must receive

145
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,559
that correction properly,

146
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:51,220
that we must take heed to what God is saying.

147
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,260
I mentioned this morning as we studied there

148
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,179
through that passage in 2 Timothy

149
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:57,660
that God's word is always right.

150
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,940
God's word corrects us, we do not correct God's word.

151
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,179
And so here as we look at this text of scripture,

152
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:05,880
we see that very same thought.

153
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,779
The reality is that in verse number four,

154
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:09,839
as the correction begins, the Bible says,

155
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,799
nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee notice

156
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:17,799
because thou hast left thy first love.

157
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,760
I would say this evening that the church in Ephesus

158
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,279
was a church that was backslidden,

159
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:28,619
a church that was doing, but they were not loving.

160
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,500
A church where the motive, their heart,

161
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,739
was not where it needed to be.

162
00:07:36,739 --> 00:07:38,179
You know, it's interesting because oftentimes

163
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:40,540
when we think about somebody being backslidden,

164
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,500
we think about that idea of backsliding,

165
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,760
we think about an individual

166
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,700
that's not in church any longer,

167
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,100
an individual that's missing, that's fallen away,

168
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,220
that's apart from the body of Christ,

169
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,700
and no doubt that could be an individual

170
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,779
that is backslidden, but when we look

171
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:00,940
at the church at Ephesus, they were serving God.

172
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,660
They were serving faithfully.

173
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,940
They were obviously sound in doctrine.

174
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,019
They were, it seems as you could look at here,

175
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:10,779
and I do not think it would be a far stretch to say

176
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:13,059
they were faithfully attending church.

177
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,660
They were faithfully worshiping the Lord.

178
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,859
They were faithfully serving the Lord,

179
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:21,859
but God says, your heart, your heart, the motive,

180
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:26,220
you're doing, but you're not loving.

181
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,420
You know, the reality is as we do the work of the Lord,

182
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,500
we must not forget the Lord of the work.

183
00:08:33,619 --> 00:08:35,219
As we do the work of the Lord,

184
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,460
we must not forget the Lord of the work.

185
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,380
We must not forget who we're serving.

186
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,539
We must not forget why we're doing

187
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,719
the things that we're doing.

188
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,260
Our service for the Lord must be born

189
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,059
out of our love for the Lord.

190
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:52,340
The Bible says, and I've often quoted it,

191
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,700
and it's true that we deal with it.

192
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,679
The Bible says, if you love me, keep my commandments,

193
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,320
but the reality is that we could get so much

194
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,159
like the Pharisees of old that it's just

195
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,880
this outward rote religion type of thing,

196
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,359
and there's no love.

197
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:12,440
There's a proper balance when we come to God's word.

198
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,840
It's not all love and who cares about all the other stuff,

199
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,000
but it's not just duty.

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,520
There's a, I'm doing it because I love my Savior,

201
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,840
and what is that motive?

202
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,919
Is the motive pure?

203
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,799
He says, I have somewhat against thee

204
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,919
because thou hast left thy first love.

205
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:30,840
Now, I wonder this evening when the people at Ephesus,

206
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,359
when they receive this instruction or this correction here,

207
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:36,200
when they begin reading this letter,

208
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,119
I think if I could put myself in the place

209
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:41,599
of being Timothy or someone else there at Ephesus,

210
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,919
that as I would read it, I know thy works

211
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,559
and thy labor and thy patience,

212
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:47,679
and it's like, yeah, we've been serving God.

213
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,880
I mean, we've been laboring.

214
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,239
I know that you cannot bear them which are evil.

215
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:53,080
That's right.

216
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,119
I know that you've tried them which say

217
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,559
that they're apostles and are not

218
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,679
and have found them liars.

219
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,400
Yes, we've done that.

220
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:05,900
I know that you have patience, that you've endured, that you're laboring, you've not fainted.

221
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,900
Yes, Lord, we're serving you.

222
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:14,900
But then when God says, you've left your first love, I wonder if there were some that would say, no.

223
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,900
That's not true.

224
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,900
Who knows best?

225
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,400
God is the one that's speaking to the church at Ephesus.

226
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:31,900
And he says to the church at Ephesus, you have left your first love.

227
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,900
Can I tell you that God is right?

228
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,400
God is right.

229
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,400
God's assessment is true.

230
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:49,900
And we find this evening that these individuals here at the church at Ephesus, they had left their first love.

231
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,900
They were still serving God, they were still hating evil, they still had good doctrine.

232
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,900
They forgot what they were doing it for.

233
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,900
They forgot the Lord in all of it.

234
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,900
Why do I sing? Why do I preach? Why do I run a vacuum cleaner?

235
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,900
Why do I clean a bathroom? Why do I tell somebody about Jesus?

236
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,400
Why do I fold a cover to send out a John and Romans?

237
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,900
Why do I... just ask yourself those questions.

238
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,900
Why am I doing what I'm doing?

239
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,900
What is the motive? It must not be for recognition.

240
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:27,900
It must not be for the applause of man, for the praise of men.

241
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,900
No, it must not be for prestige or for position.

242
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:37,900
Can I tell you this evening, it should not even be out of duty.

243
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:43,900
I know that we sing a song, duty demands it, and I understand the thought behind the song

244
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,900
and the songwriter with the words that they chose.

245
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,900
And I understand that we have a duty, a responsibility,

246
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:56,900
but we must not get to the place where we forget that we're doing it because we love him.

247
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,900
You know, it's interesting, the Bible says that God, and it's not all about this subject tonight,

248
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:07,900
but I just want you to remember that God says that he loveth a cheerful giver.

249
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,900
And I want you to think about that.

250
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,900
When we think about giving, am I giving because I love God?

251
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,900
Am I giving because I want somebody else to know that I'm giving,

252
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,900
that I want the recognition that I'm doing it because I simply think that it's a requirement?

253
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,900
No, I get to give back to God a portion of what he blessed me with.

254
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,900
And I do it because I love him.

255
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,900
We come to this place this evening when we look at this correction

256
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,900
and we find again that the church at Ephesus, they needed this correction,

257
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:41,900
they needed to face the reality, they needed the head of the church,

258
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,900
the one that died for them, the one who lives for them,

259
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:52,900
they needed him to give them an honest assessment, evaluation.

260
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:58,900
He says, you're doing all these things, but you left your first love.

261
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,900
I think it'd be hard to receive that, don't you?

262
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,900
I want you to think about the believers in Ephesus tonight when they receive that.

263
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,900
I think that there are probably some that would say, no, that's not right.

264
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,900
No, but God's always right. So it has to be right.

265
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,900
It must be our love for Christ that motivates us.

266
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,900
I want you to go back to the book of Ephesians, if you will, just for a moment.

267
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:29,900
I want you to read a couple of passages with me that God gives us with regard to the love

268
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,900
that they were spoken to by the Apostle Paul with regard to this subject.

269
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,900
In Ephesians chapter three, notice with me, if you will, just very quickly,

270
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,900
it's a familiar passage of scripture, but I want you to pick it up with me.

271
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,900
This is Paul's second prayer for the believers at Ephesus.

272
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:50,900
It really begins in verse 14, but I'm going to pick it up in verse number 17.

273
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,900
Notice in Ephesians, excuse me, three in verse 17,

274
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,900
that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.

275
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,900
Notice when it says that ye, being rooted and grounded in what?

276
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:08,900
In love, may be able to comprehend with all saints.

277
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:15,900
Notice what it says, what is the breadth and length and depth and height

278
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:21,900
and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge,

279
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,900
that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.

280
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:30,900
Notice in chapter six, in verse number 24, notice what the Bible says,

281
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:36,900
grace be with you all, be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ.

282
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:44,900
Notice what it says, in sincerity, amen.

283
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,900
Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ, in sincerity.

284
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,900
We're told in this book that we're to walk in love.

285
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:59,900
We're told many things about love, but we understand that here as we look at this passage in Revelation 2,

286
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,900
although Jesus said to the disciples that we're to love one another

287
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,900
and that by this all men shall know that you're my disciples,

288
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:14,900
here in the church at Ephesus he's not talking about that they're not loving the brethren.

289
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:19,900
It's about not loving Jesus the way that we ought.

290
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:26,900
And the reality this evening is that the correction hits deep.

291
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:33,900
It causes every child of God, I believe, that reads this passage of Scripture to say

292
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,900
and to examine their own hearts and their own lives and say,

293
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,900
do I love Jesus like I ought to?

294
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,900
Do I love him supremely?

295
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:50,900
Is there anything that is in the way of my love for the Lord?

296
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,900
But sometimes we don't want to answer the question because we want to say,

297
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,900
well I'm serving, well I'm doing this and I'm doing that.

298
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,900
The question isn't, are you doing anything?

299
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:03,900
The question is, do you love Jesus supremely?

300
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,900
Do you love him with all your heart, with all your being?

301
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:15,900
I've often said, I'll share this testimony, I sat in a room of preachers.

302
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,900
I've been here for 13 years and a few months and so it was about 13 years ago,

303
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,900
I was here just for a few months and I sat at a pastor's meeting

304
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:28,900
and they said they were going to have a special meeting after the lunch

305
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,900
for preachers that wanted to go over and talk about church finances.

306
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,900
And so I was a new preacher and thought, hey, there's a potential benefit for me to go

307
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,900
and maybe learn something.

308
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,900
There was somebody that was going to speak and kind of give some information

309
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,900
with regard to budgeting and whatever else.

310
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,900
And so I thought this would be advantageous for me.

311
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:52,900
So I went into that room after the lunch and sat in the midst of probably 15 or 20 preachers.

312
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,900
And as I looked around, I was by far the youngest one in the group.

313
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,900
And I don't say that for any prideful reason,

314
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,900
but I was in the midst of some senior men that had pastored for a long time.

315
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:14,900
And the man that was giving the talk that afternoon began his session by saying this,

316
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:21,900
how do you approach the subject of giving for your church?

317
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,900
And it was very interesting because I immediately had a thought,

318
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,900
but I'm the youngest guy in the room and the most green, if you will.

319
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,900
I'd only been pastoring for a few months.

320
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,900
And so I didn't really say anything and I let other people speak up.

321
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,900
And there were some that say, oh, man, I preach on giving once a month.

322
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:43,900
I mean, I do this and I do that and all these kind of things. Right.

323
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,900
And I kind of sat back and I thought, it's not what it's all about.

324
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:54,900
Because if we teach people to love Jesus, then they'll do what they're supposed to do.

325
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:01,900
If you teach people to love Jesus, we'll do what we're supposed to do.

326
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:07,900
You know that there are people, I've been told by others that live in this area,

327
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,900
you can drive on Germantown and you can see a parking lot full of people

328
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,900
that are going out and doing church-related things.

329
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,900
I hate to even use the word church. It's not a church, it's a cult.

330
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,900
But they're doing it for the wrong reasons.

331
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,900
You can get people to do things.

332
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,900
But my motive for serving Christ must be my love for Christ.

333
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,900
And here he says you've left your first love.

334
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,900
The Bible tells us in Colossians chapter 3,

335
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:47,900
If ye then be risen with Christ, set your affection on things above,

336
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,900
not on things of the earth.

337
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,900
The Bible tells us in 1 John 4, in verse number 19, we're familiar with the verse,

338
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,900
we love him, why? Because he first loved us.

339
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,900
We love him because he first loved us.

340
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,900
And so when we think about this, thou hast left thy first love,

341
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,900
we see the correction, we see the problem, we see that the Lord Jesus Christ

342
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,900
is going directly to the heart of the matter.

343
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,900
And by the way, the heart is always the heart of the matter.

344
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:29,900
Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life.

345
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,900
Is that not what Proverbs 4 tells us?

346
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,900
And so we find that Jesus corrects them.

347
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,900
The reality is that when Jesus says through this letter,

348
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,900
nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love,

349
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:49,900
we find that then, number two, if you're taking notes, there's a choice to be made.

350
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,900
The choice to be made.

351
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,900
The church is made up of individual members.

352
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,900
The church, as we look at these passages of Scripture, is not talking.

353
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,100
They're speaking about a universal church.

354
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,340
The Bible's talking about individual churches.

355
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,820
It says write these letters to the churches,

356
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,740
which are in Asia.

357
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,140
They're in local places.

358
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,100
They're literal churches.

359
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,300
But we understand, as I said multiple times

360
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,340
in the last couple of weeks,

361
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,060
the church is not the building.

362
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,340
The church is the people.

363
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,080
The individual believers are those

364
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,480
that are to gather together.

365
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,220
God has blessed us with a building, with a property,

366
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,560
and we find that we have a meeting place,

367
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,440
but this place is a church

368
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,680
because of the people that meet here.

369
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,040
We're the church.

370
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,280
Does that make sense?

371
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,280
And we find this evening that each member has a choice.

372
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,440
Notice the Bible says in verse seven,

373
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,280
he that hath an ear, let him hear

374
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,760
what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

375
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,800
So we find that when the correction is given,

376
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,720
there's a choice to be made.

377
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,300
We find in verse number five,

378
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,420
the first reference that's given

379
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,740
is this truth of remember.

380
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,140
Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen.

381
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,540
Now notice with me that in verse number four,

382
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,100
he says thou hast left thy first love.

383
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,180
In verse number five, he says remember therefore

384
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,420
from whence thou art fallen.

385
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,780
Jesus didn't leave them.

386
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,980
He'll never leave us nor forsake us.

387
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,140
Jesus didn't change.

388
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,800
He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.

389
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,300
Something changed for the believers in Ephesus.

390
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,220
They left their first love.

391
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,420
The Lord Jesus Christ says remember therefore

392
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,700
from whence thou art fallen.

393
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,060
I think about this choice and taking

394
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,300
and dealing with the subject of remembering

395
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,740
and the self-examination, the process of being able

396
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,580
to evaluate my own life with humility and with honesty.

397
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,060
And when the Lord Jesus Christ says

398
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,540
thou hast left thy first love,

399
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,820
that I don't immediately say no, that's not true

400
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,620
because it's the Lord speaking, so it has to be true.

401
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,300
So then I have to remember, I have to evaluate,

402
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,180
I have to examine where did I fall from?

403
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,020
What happened?

404
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,780
When did I leave my first love?

405
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:09,040
How did I not even know that I left my first love?

406
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,980
How is it that I got so far along in my Christian journey

407
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,980
that I just kinda was going through the motions?

408
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,380
Do you understand what I'm saying this evening?

409
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,660
It's simple, it happens.

410
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,060
You've been married for any length of time.

411
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,340
For those that are married tonight,

412
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,780
you can come to a place where you just expect

413
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,540
your spouse to be what your spouse is to be

414
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,100
and you just kind of have these expectations

415
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,740
and you've not had that honeymoon love, if you will.

416
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,820
Do you understand what I mean

417
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,420
for those that are married tonight?

418
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,340
And we find here that he says, remember, listen,

419
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:56,980
the process of self-examination is not an easy process.

420
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,620
Can I tell you tonight that the process

421
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,220
of self-examination is not one

422
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,100
that anyone really loves to go through?

423
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,780
When the Bible tells us in the book

424
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,660
of 1 Corinthians chapter number 11,

425
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,660
but let a man examine himself,

426
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,140
how many times when we've observed the Lord's Supper here

427
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,500
at Fellowship Baptist Church have you heard me say,

428
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,140
listen, the problem is that I would rather examine you

429
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,940
and you would rather examine me

430
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,100
than for us to examine ourselves.

431
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,220
You know why?

432
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:30,100
None of us want to acknowledge our downfalls,

433
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,420
our shortcomings.

434
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,900
None of us want to acknowledge our sin, our problems.

435
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,060
We want to look at ourselves in a light

436
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,300
that's a positive light

437
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,500
and we don't want that self-examination.

438
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,540
It requires that honesty and that humility.

439
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,300
Jesus says, remember,

440
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:53,260
but then notice he says, and repent, and repent,

441
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,700
and do the first works.

442
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,940
And what's interesting because they were still working,

443
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,140
they were still serving,

444
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,940
but they were serving in a different fashion

445
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,540
than how they first were serving.

446
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,420
We find that Jesus says, remember, then he says, repent.

447
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,820
Remember, I've said this multiple times already

448
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,940
that God is right and we are wrong.

449
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,140
If God says to you, if God says to me,

450
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,620
you've left your first love,

451
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,620
then God is right and I am wrong.

452
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,140
If you want to debate it, if you want to disagree with it,

453
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,220
you're just fighting a losing battle

454
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,060
because God is right and you are wrong.

455
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,900
I said it this morning, our hearts are deceitful.

456
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,420
They're desperately wicked.

457
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,620
Who can know it?

458
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,020
The Lord, verse 10 answers the question of Jeremiah 17.

459
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,100
It's the Lord that searcheth the hearts.

460
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,100
God knows your heart and he knows my heart.

461
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,980
He knows why we do the things that we do.

462
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,660
He knows why we serve and why we give and why we sing

463
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,820
and why we clean and why we, he knows it all.

464
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,300
And he says, repent, we must change our thinking,

465
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,100
which will have an effect on how we live.

466
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:09,380
Repenting is a change of mind that changes our course,

467
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,780
that changes our direction.

468
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,940
Repentance is necessary for salvation.

469
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,180
We find that repentance is also needed

470
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,140
in the life of a child of God, of an individual.

471
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,100
In fact, many times throughout these letters,

472
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,980
we see the word repent.

473
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,940
Repent, change your mind.

474
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,660
Your mind, your thinking, my mind, my thinking

475
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,580
needs to be aligned with God's thinking,

476
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,700
with God's truth, with God's way.

477
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,700
We find that we need to fall in love with our Savior again.

478
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,460
We really need to fall in love with our Savior again.

479
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,100
How is it that we can do that?

480
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,500
What is it that causes us to get to a place

481
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,100
where we've left our first love,

482
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,700
where we come to that place where it would be said

483
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,300
of the church at Ephesus, again, a good church.

484
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,540
I mean, you start reading with regard

485
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,220
to those introductory comments

486
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,900
and the way in which God commends the church.

487
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,940
You say, man, this is great.

488
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,580
I mean, if I was looking for a church to go,

489
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,900
I moved to a new area and I went to the church at Ephesus,

490
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,820
I mean, the church of Ephesus checks all the boxes, man.

491
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,420
They got good preaching, they got sound doctrine,

492
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,700
they got, man, they're separated from evil,

493
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,020
they're living right, they're teaching right,

494
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,980
they're going and reaching a lost world with the gospel,

495
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,820
they're serving.

496
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,980
I mean, they got activity after activity

497
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,260
and service opportunity after service opportunity.

498
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,420
This is what I'm looking for.

499
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,300
But they left their first love.

500
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,500
They left their first love.

501
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,860
It can happen to any child of God

502
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,300
that we leave our first love.

503
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,940
And the reality this evening is that we must understand

504
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,500
how important it is if we have,

505
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,980
as the church at Ephesus had, left their first love,

506
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,900
that we fall in love with God again.

507
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,980
That we love Him like we should.

508
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,300
It is that if we've not,

509
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,860
if we're not in that position of the church at Ephesus

510
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,180
where we've left our first love,

511
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,260
if Jesus wouldn't say that to us,

512
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,020
can I tell you tonight that we must guard ourselves,

513
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,460
that we stay in love with our Savior.

514
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,220
You say, how do we do that?

515
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,500
I believe that the best way to stay in love

516
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,660
with your Savior, the best way for me to stay in love

517
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:34,340
with my Savior is to spend more time in His Word

518
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,620
and in His presence.

519
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,980
To spend more time in His Word and in His presence.

520
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,660
We begin to think about this correction

521
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,500
and the choice that's been made.

522
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,780
The reality is that we must not refuse

523
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:56,260
or ignore the correction that's been given.

524
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,300
No, we must take heed.

525
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,380
There's a choice to be made.

526
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,980
Listen, you understand this evening

527
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,420
that someone can correct us and we can ignore it.

528
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,620
Someone can correct us and we can refuse the correction.

529
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,580
In fact, the Lord Jesus Christ can correct us

530
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,660
and we can ignore it.

531
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,900
It's a choice whether we take heed or we refuse.

532
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,300
In this evening, I want you to understand

533
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,580
that if you spend more time in the Word

534
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:27,900
and in His presence, man, we love Him

535
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,140
because He first loved us.

536
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:30,980
So you know what we do?

537
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,619
Listen, here's a great remedy.

538
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:33,700
I thought about it all week.

539
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,140
What's the best remedy?

540
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,940
Read the last few chapters of every gospel.

541
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,740
You know why I say to read the last few chapters

542
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,700
of every gospel?

543
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,420
Because it records all that Jesus did to save you.

544
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,660
You just read it and you reread it and you reread it

545
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,740
and you say, as we sang this morning,

546
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:58,740
and can it be that thou, my God, didst die for me?

547
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,619
And we see how much He loved us.

548
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:07,500
And I say, I love Him more and more.

549
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,740
I love Him because He first loved me.

550
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:17,140
We must not love the work more than we love the Lord.

551
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,380
Does that make sense?

552
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,220
Listen, you get to a place

553
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,700
where you just love doing the work.

554
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,619
I love to sing.

555
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,340
I love to play the piano.

556
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,180
I love to do this.

557
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,020
And I'm not picking on anybody

558
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,860
and mentioning these things.

559
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,500
I'm just saying we can't love the work

560
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,380
more than we love the Lord.

561
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:35,900
It's gotta be our love for the Lord

562
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,820
that causes us to work for the Lord,

563
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,220
to serve the Lord, to stand for the Lord.

564
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,020
I want you to be mindful of this.

565
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,860
Look in Luke 22, if you will.

566
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,860
I use this passage with purpose tonight.

567
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,180
In Luke 22, I find that Jesus

568
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,540
is having this conversation with Peter.

569
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,180
And Jesus.

570
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,280
Jesus reveals truth to Peter,

571
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:07,800
but Peter's response is not what it should be.

572
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,260
I hope that you can see

573
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,560
what I seek to communicate with you this evening.

574
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,600
In Luke 22, verse 31,

575
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,500
the Bible says,

576
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,500
"...and the Lord said..."

577
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,700
Who is that?

578
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,340
It's Jesus.

579
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,640
Who is Jesus?

580
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,240
Well, He's God.

581
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,780
Amen? Do you believe that tonight?

582
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,720
"...So the Lord said, so God said,

583
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,680
so Jesus said to Peter..."

584
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,580
He says this,

585
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:39,860
"...Simon, Simon, behold,

586
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,320
Satan hath desired to have you,

587
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,960
that he may sift you as wheat.

588
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,000
But I have prayed for thee,

589
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,540
that thy faith fail not.

590
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,700
And when thou art converted,

591
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,740
strengthen thy brethren."

592
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,000
He goes on, and I'm going to skip one verse

593
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,480
and then go back.

594
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,380
Jesus, verse 34, notice it says,

595
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,340
"...and He said..."

596
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,040
That's Jesus still speaking in response to Peter,

597
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,880
what Peter says in verse 33.

598
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,180
He says, "...I tell thee, Peter,

599
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,560
the cock shall not crow this day,

600
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,700
before thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest Me."

601
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,360
Now, let me ask you this question.

602
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,060
Is Jesus right?

603
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,360
Does Jesus know everything?

604
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,600
Is He God?

605
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,800
And He says to Peter,

606
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,800
"...Satan hath desired to have you,

607
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,840
that he may sift you as wheat."

608
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,440
You know, Peter says to the Lord in verse 33,

609
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,700
"...I am ready to go with thee,

610
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,940
both into prison and to death."

611
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:48,080
Peter is given this warning in verse 31 and 32

612
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,480
with regard to the work that Satan is going to do

613
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,780
to tempt him and to try him.

614
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,020
And really, as Peter would later write in 1 Peter 5,

615
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,480
he wants to devour us.

616
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,280
And Peter does not say,

617
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,420
Lord, help me through this.

618
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,020
Lord, give me the strength for this.

619
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,860
Lord, I don't want to do this.

620
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,680
He says, no, I'm not going to do that.

621
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,360
And Jesus says, you're going to deny me thrice.

622
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,200
Now, think about it.

623
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,600
What happens?

624
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,560
Well, Peter denies him thrice, does he not?

625
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,640
And on the third time,

626
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,100
the Bible tells us that Jesus caught the eyes of Peter,

627
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,880
or Peter caught the eyes of Jesus,

628
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,640
however you want to look at it.

629
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:30,200
The Bible says that he went out and wept bitterly.

630
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,600
He went out and wept bitterly.

631
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,140
Listen, this evening we can live in a state of denial

632
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,580
and say, no, I'm never going to stop loving Jesus

633
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,420
like I should.

634
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,240
No, I love him.

635
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,480
I don't want to hear the warning.

636
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,480
I don't want to hear the correction.

637
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,380
But oh, that God would help us tonight

638
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:51,420
to not get in a place where the church at Ephesus was,

639
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,900
where God says, you have left your first love.

640
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,000
Read some verses with me here in the gospel of Luke.

641
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,420
Go back to chapter seven.

642
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,340
In chapter seven, notice what the Bible says.

643
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,720
I'm just going to pick up in the middle

644
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,400
of a couple of texts of scripture

645
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,040
to just kind of share some thoughts with you.

646
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,720
Here we find in Luke chapter number seven,

647
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,680
this statement that is made because this one is wiping.

648
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,280
The Bible tells us in verse 43,

649
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,120
Simon answered and said,

650
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,440
I suppose that he whom he forgave the most,

651
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,360
look in verse 44,

652
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,420
and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon,

653
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,540
see as thou this woman, I entered into thine house,

654
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,300
thou gavest me no water for my feet,

655
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,260
but she hath washed my feet with tears

656
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,560
and wiped them with the hairs of her head.

657
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,660
Thou gavest me no kiss,

658
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,260
but this woman since the time I came in

659
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,100
hath not ceased to kiss my feet.

660
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,860
My head with oil, thou didst anoint,

661
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,060
but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.

662
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,460
Notice verse 47,

663
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,740
wherefore I say unto thee,

664
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,460
her sins which are many are forgiven,

665
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,620
for she loved much,

666
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,860
but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.

667
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,580
Let me break this down for you.

668
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,500
It was not her love that led to her forgiveness.

669
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,620
It was her forgiveness that led to her love.

670
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,380
We must understand that in its proper context.

671
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,460
It was not that she loved more,

672
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,500
so therefore she was forgiven.

673
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,820
No, it was that she was forgiven so much that she loved.

674
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,340
Listen, when you truly understand this evening,

675
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,460
that without Jesus,

676
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:22,460
you'd die and go to hell, the lake of fire.

677
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,460
When you recognize tonight,

678
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,180
I don't care how young you were when you got saved,

679
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,340
I don't care how old you were when you got saved,

680
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,460
I don't care how many wicked things you didn't do

681
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,440
or how many wicked things you did do,

682
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,660
we're all deserving of the lake of fire.

683
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,220
And when we understand that he forgave us,

684
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,060
not only did he forgive us,

685
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,880
but he adopted us and he calls us sons and daughters

686
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,180
and we're his children and we have that adoption,

687
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:57,040
oh, it should cause us to love him supremely.

688
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,820
Because I recognize what he did for me.

689
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,340
I was 17 when I got saved.

690
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,540
I wasn't that old.

691
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:09,540
I didn't ruin my whole life and all sorts of things,

692
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,300
but I want you to understand that I knew in a very real way

693
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,700
that if I died, I was going to the lake of fire.

694
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,660
And I needed a savior.

695
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,860
Joseph, I think was four, almost five when he got saved.

696
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,300
A four or five year old

697
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,500
couldn't do as much wickedness as I did at 17

698
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,220
or some of you did when you got saved at your age,

699
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,020
but he needed to be saved just as much as anyone else.

700
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,700
Why? For we're all born sinners and we need a savior.

701
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,220
And when I understand what he did for me,

702
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,380
man, it caused me to love him.

703
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,700
Notice in Luke chapter 10 in verse 27.

704
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,880
Luke 10 in verse 27 tonight, the Bible says this.

705
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,060
Jesus asked this question.

706
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,540
The man asked in verse 25,

707
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,420
what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

708
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,460
What is written in the law?

709
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,300
How readest thou?

710
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,140
And he answering said,

711
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:05,140
thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,

712
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,540
with all thy soul, with all thy strength

713
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:11,020
and with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself.

714
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,740
Tonight, do we love the Lord with all our hearts,

715
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,820
souls, with our strength, with our mind.

716
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:23,500
Luke 16 in verse 13, the Bible says this.

717
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:30,060
No servant can serve two masters.

718
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,540
For either he will hate the one and love the other

719
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,660
or else he will hold to the one and despise the other.

720
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,820
Notice this, he cannot serve God and mammon.

721
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,460
You say, well, I'm going to, I'm gonna prove it wrong.

722
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,800
No, you're not, you're just gonna prove yourself wrong.

723
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,100
Because God's word is true.

724
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,480
And he says, no man can serve two masters.

725
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,900
For either he will hate the one and love the other.

726
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,240
And do we love God supremely?

727
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,660
See, they left their first love.

728
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,700
There was a choice that they had to make.

729
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,740
Jesus says, remember, Jesus says, repent.

730
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,460
But notice this evening, number three quickly,

731
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,000
the consequences.

732
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,060
In verse number five, as we continue reading

733
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:20,380
the verse of Scripture, the Bible says that Jesus says,

734
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:23,260
remember, therefore, from whence thou art fallen,

735
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,160
repent and do the first works or else.

736
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,140
Here's the consequences of disobeying,

737
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,660
of hearing the correction but ignoring the correction.

738
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,820
He says, or else I will come unto thee quickly

739
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,700
and will remove thy candlestick out of its place

740
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,980
except thou repent.

741
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,460
He says two things, number one,

742
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,160
I will come unto thee quickly.

743
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,480
And number two, I will remove thy candlestick.

744
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,020
God's not playing games.

745
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,260
God's not playing games.

746
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:58,260
God's serious about this thing of loving him

747
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,200
and loving him as we ought.

748
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,100
Say, but I'm serving.

749
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,900
But if you're serving and not loving,

750
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,960
it's not what God wants.

751
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,380
You say, but I thought you said that God wants us to serve.

752
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,460
Well, he does want us to serve,

753
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,180
but he wants us to serve out of a pure heart

754
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:19,320
and a pure motive because of our love for him.

755
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:26,540
When he exposes something here for the church of Ephesus

756
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,060
that they left their first love,

757
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:31,540
he expects for his people to deal with it.

758
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,260
When he exposes something in your life,

759
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,980
when he exposes something in my life,

760
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,020
he expects that we deal with it,

761
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,100
that there be no delay, that there be no covering,

762
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,900
that it's an immediate response, why?

763
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,900
Because he will forgive.

764
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,340
He offers the mercy and the forgiveness.

765
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,700
The consequences were known.

766
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,340
The consequences were serious.

767
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,340
They were severe.

768
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,460
Understand with me this evening that if the church,

769
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:57,180
if the people responded favorably, appropriately,

770
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,860
they repented and they returned and they did the first works

771
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:04,780
then they would continue to have the blessing of God.

772
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,060
They would continue to serve God

773
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,380
with all of his favor and all of his blessing.

774
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,540
But if they did not, then Jesus said,

775
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,120
I'm gonna remove thy candlestick.

776
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,840
Remember, if you will, back in chapter one in verse 20,

777
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,980
the end of the verse says the seven stars

778
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,780
are the angels of the seven churches

779
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,900
and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest

780
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,280
are the seven churches.

781
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,820
Listen, he's in the business of planting churches,

782
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,980
of growing churches,

783
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,860
but if a church stops loving Jesus, he says,

784
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,480
Ichabod, the glory of the Lord has departed.

785
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,220
He says, I'll come quickly

786
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,740
and I'm gonna remove thy candlestick.

787
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,180
You know, there's no church in Ephesus today

788
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,540
like there was then.

789
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:45,900
It's not there.

790
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,780
It lasted for a few centuries

791
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,500
after the writing of this particular letter,

792
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,640
but then it ceased to exist.

793
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,280
If they repented, they would enjoy that sweet fellowship.

794
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:08,320
fellowship, His bountiful blessings. What a joy. I'm so thankful that our God loves,

795
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:13,840
our God forgives. I'm so thankful that our God corrects and He exposes and He says, you've

796
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:20,080
left your first love. So it doesn't mean that it's all over and there's no hope, it just

797
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:27,960
means remember, repent, and return. Return to Me. Return to the Lord. Enjoy that fellowship

798
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,400
once again. Do all that you do out of a pure heart and a pure motive, out of love for the

799
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:39,880
Lord Jesus Christ. In verse number 7 it says, He that hath an ear, let him hear what the

800
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:47,240
Spirit saith unto the churches. How do we respond to such a message? How do we respond

801
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:53,960
to the correction that is given to the church at Ephesus? Again, if we're in the position

802
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,880
where if we honestly evaluate our lives, we'll say, I've left my first love just like

803
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:08,520
they did. I don't love Jesus like I should. Oh, run to Jesus. Get in His Word. Spend time

804
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:17,040
with Him. Get in those Gospels. Read the last chapters of each Gospel. And love Him again

805
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,280
like you should. You say, as far as I know, honestly evaluating my life, I believe that

806
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:30,800
I love Him like I should. Do everything in your power to keep that love for Jesus. The

807
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:36,160
Bible says, love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. The reality

808
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,680
is that there are many things that are pulling on every single one of us in different directions

809
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:47,840
to try to get us to not love Jesus the way that we should. And this evening, I don't

810
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:55,920
want to drift away from my Savior. I want to draw nigh to my Savior. And when I do,

811
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,080
I'll stay in love with my Savior. I hope that every day of your life when you begin praying,

812
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:09,400
that you pray and you thank God for saving your soul, for recognizing who He is to you.

813
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,860
Every day when I pray, I start and you hear me publicly pray often, Lord, we love you

814
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:18,860
and we thank you for loving us. I don't say that as a cliche. I truly love the Lord and

815
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:27,980
I'm thankful that He loved me. And He loves me. I begin to remind myself as I pray of

816
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:32,700
who the Lord is to me and all that He does for me. You know what it does? It helps me

817
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:42,500
to love Him more, to love Him more, to love Him as I ought. I'm not perfect. I could love

818
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:49,720
Him more and I hope every day I would love Him more and more and more. It says, to Him

819
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:54,460
that overcometh at the end of verse number 7, will I give to either the tree of life,

820
00:42:54,460 --> 00:43:00,740
which is in the midst of the paradise of God. The word overcometh means to be victorious.

821
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:06,900
This phrase, he that overcometh is given to all seven churches. We find that in 1 John

822
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:14,260
chapter number 2, 3 and 5, sorry, 2, 4 and 5, the Bible talks about the overcomer. In

823
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:18,780
chapter 2 and verse 13 of 1 John, it says, I write unto you fathers, because you have

824
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:22,880
known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you young men, because you have overcome

825
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,580
the wicked one. I write unto you little children, because you have known the father. Verse 14,

826
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,380
I've written unto you fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning.

827
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:34,260
I've written unto you young men, because you're strong and the word of God abideth

828
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:40,420
in you and you have overcome the wicked one. In chapter 4, a verse that we're very familiar

829
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:45,340
with in verse number 4, you're of God, little children, and have overcome them. Why? Because

830
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:49,660
greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. And in chapter 5, in verse

831
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:55,180
number 4, the Bible says, for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world. I'm thankful

832
00:43:55,180 --> 00:44:00,100
that we are overcomers. We are victorious. It says, for whatsoever is born of God overcometh

833
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,940
the world, and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. You ever sing the

834
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:09,220
song? Faith is the victory. It comes from this verse of scripture. Who is he that overcometh

835
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:13,980
the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God. I'm so thankful that this

836
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:18,900
world has no power over us. I'm so thankful that I've been born again, that I've been

837
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:24,540
saved by the grace of God. This aspect of blessing that is noted here in Revelation

838
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:28,100
chapter 2, in verse number 7, to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree

839
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:32,700
of life. I want you to think about the reference back to the book of Genesis in the third chapter.

840
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,540
We won't turn there, but man was expelled from the garden and from access to the tree

841
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:43,860
of life. Why? Because of sin. But in Revelation chapter 22, verses 1 through 5, and then again

842
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:49,340
in verse number 14, there's reference to the tree of life, to being in heaven, and all

843
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:55,420
that would take place, and we rejoice in understanding that the work of reconciliation brings back

844
00:44:55,420 --> 00:45:03,060
possible what was removed because of sin. And that's a wonderful truth. And this evening,

845
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:07,460
we look at this passage of scripture. We say, well that's good for the church at Ephesus.

846
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:14,460
I mean, they received an evaluation and they were commended and then they were corrected.

847
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:18,940
Can I tell you this evening, the Bible says, he that hath an ear, let him hear. It's been

848
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:24,980
preserved for us tonight. And we must honestly evaluate our lives and say, do I love him

849
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:32,020
like I should? Do I love him as much today as I did the first day that I got saved? I

850
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:39,740
hope that we love him more and more and more and more. And we understand that because we

851
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:46,840
love God, it's evidenced in so many areas. Again, if you love me, keep my commandments.

852
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,540
But there were many that were keeping the commandments of the Lord without loving the

853
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:57,540
Lord. The Pharisees were known well for it. They knew what the law said and they tried

854
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:02,860
to be letter of the law. I mean, they followed it, but they had no heart relationship. They

855
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:09,740
had no love. This evening, if we evaluate our lives, if we examine our hearts, do we

856
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:17,020
love God supremely? Do we love him as we ought? Let's pray together. Father, we love you.

857
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:22,480
We thank you for loving us. We thank you for this evaluation that you give to the church

858
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:33,380
at Ephesus. And God, I pray you would help us this evening to take heed. Perhaps there's

859
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:40,460
one or many this evening that if they honestly evaluate their lives that they would say,

860
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:46,220
that's me. I've left my first love. Oh, I'm still in church. I'm still here. I'm still

861
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:54,620
serving. I've left my first love. God, I pray that you'd help them. Help them to return

862
00:46:54,620 --> 00:47:01,620
to you, Lord, to remember and to repent. No doubt there's some here this evening that

863
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:12,300
would say, I love him. I love you, Lord. God, would you help us to be diligent to protect

864
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:19,900
that, to guard that, to stay in your Word, in your presence, that we would love you as

865
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:26,340
we should. I pray, God, that you'd move and work as only you can. Well, thank you, God,

866
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,620
for the work that you'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me?
