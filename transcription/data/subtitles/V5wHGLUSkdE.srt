1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,679
and I'll be looking at a passage of scripture, really a character that God

2
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:10,119
gives us the opportunity to read about from this text of scripture that is

3
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:15,479
familiar to many of us. In fact, I am going to guarantee this evening that the

4
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:21,719
youngest among us are going to know this character, right? James up here, he's gonna

5
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:27,639
know, and Zachary and Natalie, they're gonna know the character, and they're

6
00:00:27,639 --> 00:00:30,600
gonna be excited about it, and I'm sure that many of you will know him as well.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,119
As we look at Luke chapter 19, we're gonna look at verses 1 through 10. The

8
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:41,599
title of the message is this, A Man Named Zacchaeus. James, do you know who Zacchaeus

9
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:48,520
is? Zacchaeus was a wee little man, amen? And so I told you they'd know Zacchaeus,

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,319
right? Natalie and Zachary, you guys know about Zacchaeus, you sing the song, and

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,560
you've heard this passage of scripture, no doubt, as you've had the opportunity

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,840
in Sunday School, Children's Church, Awana, whatever, maybe at home, in the car,

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,279
sometimes, maybe too often for the parents liking, singing the song over and

14
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:13,279
over and over, but the reality is that as we look and study the Word of God,

15
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:18,599
especially as we read through the gospel accounts here, we find that God gives us

16
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,199
the opportunity to be introduced to a number of people. There are times in

17
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:28,360
which we are introduced to folks that had just brief passing interactions with

18
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,000
the Lord Jesus Christ, and there are times in which we find that some of the

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,360
characters that were introduced to throughout the gospel records, they had

20
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,400
multiple interactions, prolonged interactions with the Lord Jesus Christ,

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,839
and we find that as we would go to these texts of scripture, that there are times

22
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:50,639
in which we will find some of these characters that are more well-known than

23
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:55,120
others. Of course, when we think about Zacchaeus and this particular text of

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:01,400
scripture, again, he's a Bible character that is known by many, and I think

25
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:07,440
mostly because of the song that is sung about him and about his life, and we find

26
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,160
here in Luke 19, I want to read the first couple of verses, we'll get into the

27
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,559
study this evening. The Bible says this,

28
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:19,720
"...and Jesus entered and passed through Jericho." And it says this in verse number

29
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:27,279
two, "...and behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the

30
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:32,919
publicans, and he was rich." Look at verse number 10, skip down if

31
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:36,479
you will. The Bible says in verse number 10, "...for the Son of Man," speaking of

32
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:44,160
Jesus, "...is come to seek and to save that which was lost." As we look at this

33
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,199
passage of scripture, we've titled the message, A Man Named Zacchaeus. If you're

34
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:52,639
taking notes this evening, I want you to notice first how Zacchaeus is described.

35
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:58,600
Notice how the scriptures describe this man to us. We find that the Bible begins

36
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,759
in verse number one by telling us about Jesus, who would enter and pass through

37
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:10,360
Jericho. Now, we understand the fact that Jesus had folks that were well aware of

38
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,919
his life and ministry. In fact, as you study the life of Christ, you'll find

39
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:19,039
that on a number of occasion, there are people that desired to go and be where

40
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,279
Jesus was. They wanted to hear him teach. Mainly, they wanted to receive the

41
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:28,000
bread, the miracles, be partakers of those things. And we find here that in verse

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,720
number one, that God sets the scene for us to tell us that Jesus was coming and

43
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,000
he was going to pass through Jericho. This is the home place of this one,

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,839
Zacchaeus, and thus we're introduced to Zacchaeus. And the Bible tells us this,

45
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:48,279
the description is given here in verse number two. Notice what it says, first of

46
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:54,360
all, that Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans. I want you to notice

47
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,759
that in the first level of description that is given to us about this man,

48
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:03,839
Zacchaeus, is we're told about his position. We are told that this man,

49
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:10,880
Zacchaeus, was chief among the publicans. Now, no doubt if you've read the Gospels

50
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,720
and you've read about the interactions between the Jewish folks and the

51
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,519
publicans, the publicans were not well-liked. The publicans were tax

52
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:27,839
collectors, and they were tax collectors for the Roman government, and as such,

53
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,839
they would not have had a great deal of popularity amongst the Jewish people.

54
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:37,519
And we find that these tax collectors, they would, of course, be ridiculed and

55
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,600
looked down upon, but they did have a level of power, and they did have this

56
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,760
authority. And we find that the Bible says that this man, Zacchaeus, as we're

57
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,559
introduced to him, as we're reading the description of him, that he was the chief

58
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:57,760
among the publicans. I want you to understand that though he might not have

59
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,600
been popular amongst the Jewish people, that this man prospered in his position.

60
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,959
This man had position. And the Bible ends in verse number two by saying this,

61
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:16,959
and he was rich. Not only did he have position, but this man had possession.

62
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:22,359
And we find that as we would look at the description of this man as it's given to

63
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:25,959
us in verse number two, this man Zacchaeus, that we're told that he is

64
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:30,799
chief among the publicans, that he has this position. We're told that he is rich,

65
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:37,399
that he has these possessions. As James told us to begin the study this evening,

66
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:42,600
that Zacchaeus was a wee little man, we read in verse number three that he

67
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:49,679
sought to see Jesus, who he was, and could not for the press notice because he was

68
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:55,279
little of stature. And so he was little of stature. We see that description given

69
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,839
to us in verse number three. But I want you to focus upon these first two

70
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:04,760
elements that are given to us in verse number two with regard to how this man

71
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:08,519
is described. And I want you to understand something when we enter into

72
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:12,399
this passage of Scripture. I want you to understand this evening that there are a

73
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:17,720
number of people that may not have the name Zacchaeus, but fit the description

74
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,480
of Zacchaeus. They may not have that name. In fact, I've never met an individual

75
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,399
named Zacchaeus. I don't know if you have, but I've never met... I didn't go to school

76
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,320
with anyone named Zacchaeus. I never went to Bible college with anyone named Zacchaeus.

77
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,559
I've never met somebody named Zacchaeus. But I would say to you this

78
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:42,119
evening that when we notice how this man is described in verse number two as

79
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:50,640
having position and having possession, that there are many today that fit the

80
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:57,760
the same characteristics as this man Zacchaeus. In fact, there are many

81
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:04,359
today that they strive to have what Zacchaeus had. They're looking for

82
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:09,600
position. They're looking for possession. They believe that if they can get

83
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,839
position, if they can get possession, that it will bring some level of joy, that it

84
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:20,600
will bring some level of satisfaction in their lives. If I could just get that

85
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,839
promotion. Oh, but you didn't know that with that promotion comes a whole lot of

86
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,440
headache, a whole lot of responsibility. But we think we want that

87
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,559
position. Oh, if I could have those possessions, if I could just have that,

88
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:39,920
whatever that thing is, it would bring me some level of satisfaction. And we live

89
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,880
in the midst of a generation that are seeking position and possession. And as

90
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:51,399
we look at the description of Zacchaeus, we find that this could describe your

91
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:56,480
neighbor. This could describe my neighbor. It could describe your co-worker. It

92
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,519
could describe a family member, someone that's looking for position, that's

93
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:05,359
looking for possession. But I want you to notice not only how Zacchaeus is

94
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:11,160
described, but I want you to notice number two this evening, what Zacchaeus

95
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:17,679
desired. What did he desire? As we read verse number three in our text of

96
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:24,440
Scripture, the Bible says this, and he, speaking of Zacchaeus, sought to see

97
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:33,479
Jesus, who he was, and could not for the press. So you understand that there were

98
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,400
a great host of people that were gathered together with the knowledge

99
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,320
that Jesus would pass through that way, that Jesus had entered, as it says in

100
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,840
verse number one, and that he would pass through Jericho. And no doubt there was a

101
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:51,520
great number of people that had gathered together, and the Bible tells us that he

102
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,159
could not for the press. And as we have found, even as you look in the

103
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,039
Gospel of Mark, and you don't need to turn there, but in Mark chapter number

104
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,200
two, the Bible describes to us the miracle of the man that was born of four,

105
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,840
and we're told about that particular miracle that these men desired to bring

106
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:14,000
their friend to Jesus, and they knew that Jesus was in the house. But the Bible

107
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,880
says that when they brought him there, there was no way that they could get

108
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,239
in, and so they had to go up on the rooftop, and they had to lower him down

109
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:27,799
through the roof. And so there were many times in the life and ministry of Jesus

110
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:32,200
Christ that there was a great host of people that would gather, and here on

111
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,719
this particular day, as they heard that Jesus was passing that way, and that he

112
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:41,640
was going to pass through Jericho, that there was a great host of people that

113
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,559
came, but Zacchaeus desired something. No doubt in my mind this evening that

114
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:52,599
Zacchaeus had heard some things about Jesus. If he had not heard some things

115
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:58,880
about Jesus, I'm not thinking that he has any desire to go see him. But because he

116
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,159
had heard some things about Jesus,

117
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,159
he had a desire to go see him.

118
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:10,919
about Jesus. He desires to see Jesus. Notice what it says. I think these three

119
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:17,279
words are of great importance. The Bible says, and he sought to see Jesus who he

120
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:25,399
was. Can you imagine being Zacchaeus in hearing about Jesus and hearing about

121
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:30,419
the miracles and hearing about the feeding of the five thousand and hearing

122
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:35,039
about the lame man that was able to walk the blind man that could now see the

123
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,019
death man that can now hear. And you begin to hear these things and you say I

124
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:46,339
want to know who this man is. And the Bible says that he sought to see Jesus

125
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:56,999
who he was. He's God. He's God in flesh. He came to seek and to save as we read

126
00:10:56,999 --> 00:11:02,219
in verse number 10 already. But he comes and he manifests the Father. He makes

127
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:07,839
known his his deity and we find that through those miracles. Remember John the

128
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,039
Baptist when he's in prison he said sent some disciples and said ask Jesus are

129
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:16,879
are you the water do we look for another. And Jesus said tell him this and what he

130
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,599
did is he gave him truth from the Old Testament prophecies regarding the

131
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:26,459
Messiah and what he would do and say tell him that the lame walk and the

132
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:33,039
deaf hear and the blind see. And now Zacchaeus he hears that Jesus is coming

133
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:39,839
through his own town. He's got the position. He's got the possession. The

134
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,599
Bible tells us that he was the chief among the publicans. The Bible tells us

135
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:51,659
that he was rich but he was wanting. The Bible says that he sought to see Jesus

136
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:57,999
who he was and could not for the press because he was little of stature. And so

137
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:04,319
he turned around and went home and said well I tried. No. That's what the Bible tells us.

138
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:12,319
We find that he was determined to see Jesus. We understand his determination. We

139
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:17,559
can zero in on verse number four and we can gauge the level of determination by

140
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:23,499
the actions that he took. The Bible says that he ran before and he climbed up

141
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:30,899
into a sycamore tree to see him for he was to pass that way. Now I understand we

142
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,939
sing the song with the kids and it's like it's a fun song but I want you to

143
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:41,579
think about Zacchaeus and we see how he's described but notice what he

144
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:46,959
desires. He's going to want to see Jesus and there's so many people and because

145
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,579
of his stature he just can't see. Have you ever gone to a parade? I mean pre-COVID

146
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:56,739
right? Back in in ancient days in 2019 when there were parades and you could go

147
00:12:56,739 --> 00:13:00,819
and I remember a number of years ago Samantha I don't know how many years ago

148
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:04,659
it was but you rode the the horse and the parade here in Fairfax City and I

149
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,859
remember going down there and we walked and walked and walked and we're trying

150
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:10,899
to get there and we're trying to move around and try to be able to see where

151
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:15,059
Samantha was gonna be riding the horse. Do you remember? And you know the the

152
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:19,479
reality is that there were some that were little kids that when certain

153
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:23,679
people were going by they're trying to push to the front. You're trying to get

154
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:30,039
on higher ground. Zacchaeus was determined to see Jesus and so he ran

155
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:36,679
ahead and he found a tree and he climbed up in the tree because he knew that

156
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:40,979
Jesus was gonna pass that way and he wanted to see him. He wanted to see who

157
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:46,719
he was. We find that this evening as we think about the description of Zacchaeus

158
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:50,559
and I've said to you this evening that the description is provided to us in

159
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:55,319
verse number two could be suitable to describe your neighbor, your co-worker,

160
00:13:55,319 --> 00:14:01,559
your friend, your relative that they're seeking and maybe they have position in

161
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:08,879
possession but I find this evening and we speak about it often that no one and

162
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:17,459
no thing will satisfy like Jesus. Nothing will. The enemy tries to convince the

163
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:22,739
unregenerate man that they can satisfy their longings through a whole host of

164
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:29,419
things but they're left wanting and when I look at this passage of Scripture and

165
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:34,379
I think about what this man Zacchaeus desired and you say look at all of the

166
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:41,639
things that he had. Yeah but he didn't have Jesus. He didn't have remember this

167
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:46,379
morning I was speaking about a whole host of things actually and one of the

168
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:49,259
things that I mentioned in the message this morning was about the peace and the

169
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:55,239
joy that we have through Jesus and that that joy no man can steal from you. No

170
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:59,899
man can take your joy. The Bible tells us about a peace that passeth all

171
00:14:59,979 --> 00:15:05,259
understanding. In this man Zacchaeus though he had position though he had

172
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:13,819
possession he's wanting and he desires to see Jesus who he was. As we look at

173
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:17,699
the passage of Scripture and we think just for a moment of Zacchaeus in these

174
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:22,139
first four verses of Luke 19 as he's introduced to us in the Word of God and

175
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:26,579
we find how he's described and what he desires I wonder this evening how many

176
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:31,859
people you come into contact with how many people I come into contact with

177
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:37,779
that would fit this description of being wanting. Now they might not know that

178
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:43,099
it's Jesus that they're missing. You understand that. Zacchaeus no doubt had

179
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:49,059
heard about Jesus. That's why he desired to see him who he was and this evening

180
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:53,859
there might be some people in your sphere of influence that don't know that

181
00:15:53,859 --> 00:15:58,539
what they're missing is Jesus but God's allowed you to be in their sphere of

182
00:15:58,539 --> 00:16:03,419
influence so that as you magnify and glorify the Lord Jesus Christ in your

183
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:07,859
life that they realize that the position and the possession that they have leaves

184
00:16:07,859 --> 00:16:14,219
them wanting and they want what you have. They want Jesus. They want to know more

185
00:16:14,219 --> 00:16:19,859
about this Jesus. So you understand this evening don't we think about the

186
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:23,339
responsibility that has been given to us as the children of God as being

187
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:27,739
ambassadors representatives of being those that would go out and sow the seed

188
00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:31,859
of the gospel that we have this response. Listen we're not salesmen. We're not

189
00:16:31,859 --> 00:16:36,979
trying to just build some kind of numbers in some type of following. No.

190
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:40,619
We're trying to tell people about the Lord Jesus Christ that has done

191
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:47,419
something for them that no other could ever do. And this man Zacchaeus we find

192
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:54,219
that he is described and we find that his desire is revealed to us. As we look

193
00:16:54,219 --> 00:16:58,139
at verses 5 through 10 I want you to notice number 3 if you're taking notes I

194
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:04,159
want you to notice what Jesus declares. We notice how he is described in what he

195
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:09,579
desires and then Jesus is going to speak. And I want you to notice a host of

196
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:14,899
things that Jesus declares in this passage of scripture and I hope this

197
00:17:14,979 --> 00:17:19,699
evening that it would have a profound impact in your life and in mine. The

198
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:31,259
Bible says in verse number 5, and when Jesus came to the place he looked up and

199
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:40,139
saw him and said unto him Zacchaeus. Now stop right there. Can you imagine being

200
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:48,939
Zacchaeus? You never met Jesus before. You didn't know who he was. In fact you

201
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:53,539
heard that Jesus was coming through your town and you heard about some of the

202
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:58,139
miracles that Jesus had performed and you heard about some of these amazing

203
00:17:58,139 --> 00:18:03,379
things that that had been taking place and this man named Jesus and now he's

204
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:07,339
coming through Jericho and you want to see him and you try to make your way to

205
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:10,939
see him and you've left your duties for the day to be able to see Jesus but

206
00:18:10,939 --> 00:18:16,659
you're too short. And so you run and you get into a tree and you knew that Jesus

207
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:22,619
was gonna pass that way and the Bible says that when Jesus came to the place

208
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:32,259
that he looked up and he saw him and said Zacchaeus. He called him by name. I

209
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:39,259
love that because we find that Zacchaeus, he's never met Jesus before. He wants to

210
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:47,299
see him and Jesus says Zacchaeus. Now can you imagine? I hope this evening I

211
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:51,419
understand that we know about Zacchaeus and we we can sing the song most of us

212
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:58,899
you could sing it better than I could. But the reality is in that moment, can

213
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:05,059
you imagine how Zacchaeus must have felt? I mean he didn't expect for Jesus

214
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:11,259
to stop and speak to him. He didn't expect to have this interaction that he's

215
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:16,659
going to have with the Son of God with God in flesh and we find that Jesus

216
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:23,219
comes to the place and he looks up and he says Zacchaeus. I mean I'm amazed that

217
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:30,859
Zacchaeus heard the rest of what Jesus said. I mean honestly, the Bible says that

218
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:36,339
Jesus continues when we think about what Jesus declares. First he spoke his

219
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:42,619
name. What a precious truth. In fact if you were to look into the gospel

220
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:46,699
accounts of the resurrection of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and you would

221
00:19:46,699 --> 00:19:50,539
read about Mary in the tomb and she thought she had supposed that he had

222
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:56,699
been the gardener. She said if you just tell me where you've laid him and she

223
00:19:56,699 --> 00:20:07,099
Jesus turns and says Mary. And at the spoken name of Mary she said, Master.

224
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:09,619
He's a master.

225
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:12,519
He knows who we are.

226
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:14,899
And Zacchaeus is up in that tree.

227
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:18,379
And Jesus says, Zacchaeus?

228
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:19,579
And then He says,

229
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:22,119
make haste and come down.

230
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:24,039
Now, I'm not sure if He jumped out of the tree

231
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:24,959
or what He did,

232
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,279
but I don't like climbing trees personally.

233
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:28,419
I never did.

234
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:30,179
I never climbed trees as a kid.

235
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:31,539
My dad's afraid of heights

236
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:32,919
and he passed that on to me,

237
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:34,499
and now my brother flies airplanes,

238
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,799
and so I don't understand how all that thing works.

239
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:40,419
But the reality is that I just never was a tree climber.

240
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:41,759
I like going into the mountains.

241
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:42,779
I like climbing mountains.

242
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:44,359
I've gotten myself in places

243
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,099
where I didn't know how to get back down

244
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:47,199
because I scaled up

245
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:49,339
and I was really in a pickle.

246
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:51,379
But I never climbed trees.

247
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:52,819
I just didn't.

248
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:54,979
But I think about this man, Zacchaeus,

249
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:57,019
as he climbed into this tree,

250
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:58,399
and then Jesus says,

251
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:02,859
make haste and come down.

252
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:07,859
For today, I must abide at thy house.

253
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:11,999
I mean, I hope this evening, again,

254
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:15,279
I understand that we know this account,

255
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,319
but can you imagine being Zacchaeus?

256
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,919
I read this just a few weeks ago

257
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:20,759
as I was reading through,

258
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:23,279
and I don't know how many times I've read Luke.

259
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:25,479
I don't know.

260
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:27,679
I know this year, in 2020,

261
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,359
I've read it at least five times.

262
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:32,079
Just this year.

263
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:33,339
I'm not saying that I pat myself on the back.

264
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:34,459
What I'm saying to you

265
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,859
is that when I read it just a couple of weeks ago,

266
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:39,819
I just stopped dead in my tracks.

267
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:42,299
And I thought about Zacchaeus

268
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:45,139
and how he must have felt.

269
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:49,019
And the emotions that he must have experienced.

270
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:52,019
When Jesus spoke his name

271
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,619
and then said, make haste, come down,

272
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:58,339
I must abide at thy house.

273
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:01,299
This is not what he expected.

274
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,159
Would you agree?

275
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:07,199
This is not a situation where Zacchaeus says,

276
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:10,239
hey, master, I made a meal.

277
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:11,079
I have it prepared.

278
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,119
I want you to come back.

279
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:14,359
This is not how it happened.

280
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:19,119
Zacchaeus had a desire to see Jesus, who he was.

281
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:21,919
Jesus knew who Zacchaeus was.

282
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,759
Can I tell you that the seeking Savior

283
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,799
will never miss an appointment with a seeking sinner?

284
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:32,099
And we find that Zacchaeus is there in that tree

285
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:35,619
and all he's expecting from my perspective

286
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:36,899
as I read the Scriptures,

287
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:39,259
I believe that all that he's expecting on this day

288
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:41,099
is to simply see Jesus.

289
00:22:43,699 --> 00:22:47,139
And Jesus stops and speaks his name

290
00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:49,839
and says, come down because I have to be,

291
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,139
I must abide at thy house.

292
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,679
Today, I must abide at thy house.

293
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,219
I can't imagine the excitement I have

294
00:23:01,219 --> 00:23:02,599
as I look at verse number six.

295
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:04,599
I can see how the Bible describes it,

296
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:06,079
but I'm wondering this evening

297
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,119
how Zacchaeus actually experienced it.

298
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:12,079
And to think the Bible tells us in verse number six

299
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:14,039
that he, speaking of Zacchaeus,

300
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,159
that he made haste and came down

301
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,559
and received Him joyfully.

302
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,179
I don't know how far Zacchaeus was from his house.

303
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:26,279
I don't know where this tree was.

304
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,759
I don't know how far of a journey,

305
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:31,759
of a walk they had to make to get to his house,

306
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:36,599
but we find that Zacchaeus

307
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:39,239
follows the direction of the Lord.

308
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:40,839
He made haste and came down

309
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:42,999
and received Him joyfully.

310
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:44,839
Can I tell you this evening

311
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:50,399
that Zacchaeus could have stayed in that tree?

312
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:52,459
Right? He could have.

313
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:57,019
That would have been really a monumental mistake.

314
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:01,539
The height of stupidity.

315
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:03,239
I mean, honestly,

316
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:05,359
I don't use that word often,

317
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:08,699
but I think it's appropriate in this particular context.

318
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:11,039
I mean, it really would have been

319
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,899
a missed opportunity.

320
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:14,199
For him to desire to see,

321
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:17,039
oh, you know, I didn't clean the house this morning.

322
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,839
You know, people make excuses.

323
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:22,439
Do they not?

324
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:25,219
Listen, I don't know how many people

325
00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:27,119
I've shared the Gospel with in my life.

326
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:27,839
Not enough.

327
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:29,339
But I know that there are times

328
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:31,339
in which I've shared the Gospel with people

329
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:32,619
and they make excuses.

330
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:34,079
They don't have time. Not now.

331
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,879
Some other time. Some other situation.

332
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:36,879
Whatever it might be.

333
00:24:36,879 --> 00:24:40,219
I'm thankful that Zacchaeus didn't make an excuse.

334
00:24:40,219 --> 00:24:42,439
I'm thankful that as we understand

335
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,479
what's taking place,

336
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:45,999
that Zacchaeus has this opportunity

337
00:24:45,999 --> 00:24:48,479
where he hears his name spoken,

338
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:50,839
he receives the command of the Lord,

339
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:51,959
and he makes haste.

340
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:57,139
He comes down and he receives Him joyfully.

341
00:24:57,139 --> 00:25:00,019
You know that Jesus

342
00:25:00,019 --> 00:25:04,719
does not force Himself upon anyone.

343
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:05,639
He doesn't.

344
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:07,759
He doesn't force Himself upon anyone.

345
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:10,999
In fact, if you're His child today,

346
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:14,679
He didn't make you read His Bible today.

347
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,839
Right? He didn't make you.

348
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:19,519
He didn't make you come to church.

349
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,919
He made a decision.

350
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,879
Don't you agree?

351
00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:26,199
He wants to have fellowship with you.

352
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:28,239
He wants to feast with you.

353
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:29,999
He wants to have that fellowship

354
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:31,039
around His Word.

355
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,879
He wants to minister to your needs.

356
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:35,119
He wants to enjoy that time of communion

357
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:35,959
through prayer.

358
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:37,599
But He doesn't force it.

359
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:40,119
He doesn't make you.

360
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:43,759
And He didn't force Himself upon Zacchaeus.

361
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:45,639
He said to Zacchaeus, come down.

362
00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:47,319
Make haste. Come down.

363
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,719
And He says this,

364
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:53,479
Today, I must abide at thy house.

365
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:55,919
And he, Zacchaeus, received Him joyfully.

366
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,359
Notice what it said in v. 7.

367
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:00,639
And when they,

368
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:02,679
some of those that were part of that press

369
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:04,519
that prevented Zacchaeus from being able

370
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,999
to get up and see Jesus

371
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:08,119
that resulted in him having to climb up

372
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:09,199
into that tree,

373
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:12,599
these folks saw it and they all murmured,

374
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:14,359
notice what they said,

375
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:16,599
that he was gone to be guessed

376
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:20,839
with a man that is a sinner.

377
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:24,279
As if they weren't.

378
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:26,199
As if they weren't.

379
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:28,759
But you understand that the religious leaders

380
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:30,999
of the day, they were so full of themselves,

381
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:33,039
the scribes, the Pharisees, the Sadducees,

382
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,559
they were so full of themselves.

383
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,759
In fact, the text of Scripture

384
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:39,879
would reveal to us in a previous passage

385
00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:41,879
where the man stands and says,

386
00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:44,479
I'm so thankful I'm not like this publican.

387
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:45,399
Here's what I do.

388
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:47,879
I fast and I do this and I tithe

389
00:26:47,879 --> 00:26:49,119
and so on and so forth.

390
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:51,519
And we find here that these

391
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:52,679
that are gathered there,

392
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:55,359
this group of people,

393
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:57,759
they murmured and they said of Jesus,

394
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:59,239
the Son of God,

395
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:00,879
that He is gone to be guessed

396
00:27:00,879 --> 00:27:05,879
with a man that is a sinner.

397
00:27:05,879 --> 00:27:08,039
It's too bad that they

398
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,879
did not recognize their own condition.

399
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,959
It's too bad that they didn't show up

400
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:16,359
on the streets of Jericho

401
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:19,999
with the same desire that Zacchaeus had.

402
00:27:19,999 --> 00:27:23,879
Amen?

403
00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:27,559
The Bible says that Zacchaeus stood.

404
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:29,719
I don't know if that means that he fell

405
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:31,479
and had to stand up. I don't know.

406
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:32,879
I don't want to read into it.

407
00:27:32,879 --> 00:27:35,439
I'm just saying the Bible says that he stood

408
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:36,759
and said unto the Lord,

409
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:39,839
Behold, Lord...

410
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:42,999
Now, I want you to understand

411
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:46,039
this manner in which Zacchaeus refers

412
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,119
to the Lord Jesus Christ.

413
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:50,319
He calls Him Lord.

414
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:52,719
We find that as we have mentioned

415
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:55,559
and we've dealt with in previous studies

416
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:58,399
throughout the years of ministry here,

417
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,399
the Bible tells us in the book of Philippians

418
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:03,759
that God hath highly exalted Him

419
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:05,719
speaking of Jesus in Philippians 2

420
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:06,799
and verse 9,

421
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,919
given Him a name which is above every name,

422
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:10,159
that in the name of Jesus,

423
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,239
every knee should bow,

424
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:12,639
things in heaven and things in earth

425
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:14,759
and every tongue should confess

426
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:19,319
that Jesus Christ is Lord.

427
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:21,919
To the glory of God the Father.

428
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,839
You know what Zacchaeus is doing here?

429
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:27,399
He's recognizing that Jesus is Lord.

430
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:31,999
He's recognizing that He is the Messiah.

431
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:34,639
That He is God in flesh.

432
00:28:34,639 --> 00:28:37,239
We mention this when we study and read

433
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:39,119
about the passage of Scripture

434
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,639
with the conversion of Saul

435
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:41,919
and Saul says,

436
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:42,919
who art thou Lord?

437
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:43,679
And the Lord said,

438
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,839
I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.

439
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:47,719
It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.

440
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:50,159
And then Saul at this time,

441
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,399
he responds and he says,

442
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:55,319
Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?

443
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,959
And here Zacchaeus in Luke 19

444
00:28:57,959 --> 00:28:59,759
and verse 8,

445
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,199
he said, behold, Lord,

446
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:06,519
the half of my goods I give to the poor,

447
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:08,399
and if I have taken anything from any man

448
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,359
by false accusation,

449
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,719
I restore him fourfold.

450
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:14,799
I want you to understand

451
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,279
that in verse 8,

452
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:18,319
the actions that Zacchaeus takes,

453
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:20,399
the things that he says he's going to do,

454
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,000
that's not what brought him salvation.

455
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,239
That's the result of his salvation.

456
00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:31,399
That is the outworking of his changed life.

457
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:34,759
The power of the Gospel to transform a life.

458
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:37,759
Listen, when you trusted Christ as your Savior,

459
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:39,959
there were some things that changed.

460
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,599
There were some things that you started to do

461
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:43,959
that you desired to do in obedience to God

462
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:47,279
that you had not done when you were lost.

463
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,440
Why? Because now,

464
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,399
I'm not doing it to get saved,

465
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,479
to stay saved.

466
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:54,000
I'm doing it because I am saved.

467
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,959
And we find here that Zacchaeus says,

468
00:29:56,959 --> 00:30:00,199
Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor,

469
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:02,039
and if I have taken anything from any man

470
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,079
by false accusation,

471
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:04,279
I restore him fourfold.

472
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:07,039
Notice what Jesus says as we continue with this thought.

473
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,619
of our final point, what Jesus declares.

474
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:14,279
In v. 9, notice what Jesus says.

475
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:19,879
This day is salvation come to this house.

476
00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:24,639
For so much as he also is a son of Abraham.

477
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:26,959
As we begin to notice what is declared

478
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:28,799
by the Lord Jesus Christ,

479
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,599
we find that in v. 9

480
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:32,759
that Jesus declares that salvation

481
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:35,719
has come to the house of Zacchaeus.

482
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:37,559
And we find that then,

483
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:40,039
Jesus makes this declaration of verse

484
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:42,119
that we read by way of introduction

485
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:44,279
this evening in v. 10,

486
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:47,479
a verse that some no doubt have memorized

487
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,479
where the Bible says that the Son of Man

488
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:53,279
has come to seek and to save

489
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,399
that which was lost.

490
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:57,239
What a great declaration we find

491
00:30:57,239 --> 00:31:00,639
in v. 10 of our text of Scripture this evening.

492
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:03,479
We begin to see what Jesus is declaring

493
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:05,679
that He is the Messiah

494
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,799
and that He came to seek and to save

495
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,679
that which was lost.

496
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,039
I'm so thankful that He's the seeking Savior.

497
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,639
I'm so thankful this evening,

498
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:15,079
as I mentioned a moment ago,

499
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:16,759
that the seeking Savior will never

500
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:18,919
miss an appointment with a seeking sinner.

501
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,719
Zacchaeus desired to see Him who He was,

502
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:24,599
and we find that Jesus stopped at that tree

503
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,959
at the place where He was.

504
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:27,079
He spoke His name.

505
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:28,439
He gave Him direction.

506
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:30,319
The Bible says that He went to His home

507
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:32,639
and He then declares that salvation

508
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:37,039
has come to that home.

509
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,159
And then Jesus says,

510
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:41,319
this is the purpose for My coming,

511
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:45,639
to seek and to save that which was lost.

512
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:48,479
As we look at these ten verses this evening,

513
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:51,879
I believe that we can rejoice

514
00:31:51,879 --> 00:31:53,119
in several things.

515
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,679
I believe that we can be encouraged

516
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:55,719
with several things.

517
00:31:55,719 --> 00:31:58,119
I believe that we should be challenged as well.

518
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,279
Why should we rejoice?

519
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,319
Because salvation has come to the house of Zacchaeus.

520
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:03,919
The Bible tells us that there's rejoicing in heaven

521
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,839
and the angels rejoice in heaven

522
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,919
when a sinner repents.

523
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,079
So when we read about somebody getting saved,

524
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:11,839
when we hear about somebody getting saved,

525
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,399
we have the opportunity to hear somebody

526
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:14,999
give a testimony about being saved,

527
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:18,239
we ought to rejoice.

528
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:22,679
We can be encouraged this evening

529
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:27,319
that God has created mankind

530
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,599
with a need for God.

531
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:34,279
This man had position,

532
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:36,079
and he had possession,

533
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,919
but he was wanting.

534
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,639
You know, we've been given a message to deliver

535
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:44,199
that is a message that will bring

536
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:46,599
a level of contentment and satisfaction

537
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:51,199
to mankind that nothing else is able to do so.

538
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:54,559
Nothing else can satisfy like Jesus.

539
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,079
And that ought to encourage us this evening

540
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:59,319
to know that there are times,

541
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:01,919
listen, there are times I think about this man Zacchaeus

542
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,719
and as I was preparing the message

543
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:04,719
and thinking about it,

544
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:08,679
I wondered how many people that I have come in contact with

545
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:10,279
that their name wasn't Zacchaeus,

546
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:13,079
but how he is described in our text of Scripture

547
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:16,759
would fit the people that I've come into contact with

548
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:18,239
that they have position,

549
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:19,479
that they have possession,

550
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:22,679
and maybe in my life and perhaps in yours as well,

551
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:23,719
that we have thought,

552
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:26,039
well, they really don't need what I have.

553
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:30,159
They're really not interested in what I have to give them

554
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,159
with what I have to share with them.

555
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,359
There are times in which in my own life

556
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:36,519
and perhaps in yours as I would be transparent

557
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:37,519
with you this evening,

558
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,079
that we look at certain people and say,

559
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:40,599
well, they really don't need what we have.

560
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:42,679
We know that they do,

561
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:44,799
but we make the excuse for them thinking

562
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,199
that they're not gonna be interested in hearing.

563
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,439
There are times,

564
00:33:50,439 --> 00:33:52,999
and if you wanna tell me that I have little faith,

565
00:33:52,999 --> 00:33:53,959
feel free,

566
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:56,719
there are times in which I will knock on somebody's door

567
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:58,279
to share the Gospel with them

568
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:01,199
with the full expectation of hearing I'm not interested.

569
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:03,399
Why?

570
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:05,239
Because I'm thinking in the wrong way.

571
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:07,799
I'm thinking about the position and the possessions

572
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,399
that these individuals have,

573
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:10,999
and I think they're not gonna be interested

574
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:13,719
in what I'm trying to share with them.

575
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,679
And there are other times in which I knock on the doors

576
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,199
and maybe I have this expectation,

577
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,359
same kind of house, same area, same everything,

578
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:25,119
and I can't understand why they wouldn't wanna listen.

579
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:28,119
It really just, what's our frame of mind?

580
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:29,239
How are we dealing with things?

581
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,559
What are we comprehending?

582
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:33,719
See, what I'm thinking this evening is,

583
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,399
has there been a time in my life,

584
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:36,519
has there been a time in your life

585
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:39,959
when you made the excuse for someone else?

586
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:42,159
When maybe you thought, you know, they really don't,

587
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,559
they're not gonna be interested in hearing this.

588
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,199
But God has designed each person

589
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,279
with a need for God.

590
00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:54,639
And we have a lot of people in our world

591
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,519
that are missing that.

592
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:58,159
They don't know Him.

593
00:34:58,159 --> 00:34:59,639
They've never been born again.

594
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:02,759
They may, on the outside,

595
00:35:02,759 --> 00:35:05,039
look like they have everything put together.

596
00:35:05,999 --> 00:35:08,399
They have the position, the title,

597
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:11,079
they have the possessions.

598
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,719
They're keeping up with the Joneses

599
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:15,519
or whomever you wanna say that they're keeping up with,

600
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:17,839
but they're empty.

601
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:18,759
They're wanting.

602
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:19,879
They're wanting.

603
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:23,839
And we can be challenged this evening

604
00:35:25,279 --> 00:35:29,399
because this seeking Savior who came to this earth

605
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:30,959
to seek and to save that which was lost,

606
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:33,119
to pay for the redemption of mankind,

607
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,199
to go to the cross of Calvary,

608
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,519
to shed His precious blood,

609
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:38,319
to be buried in a borrowed tomb,

610
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:39,919
to rise in victory,

611
00:35:39,919 --> 00:35:42,679
has given each one of us a commission,

612
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:45,399
a mandate, a responsibility

613
00:35:45,399 --> 00:35:47,759
to go and preach the gospel to every creature.

614
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:51,639
And when we consider that this evening,

615
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:55,079
we consider what a great privilege it is.

616
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:57,559
Well, it's a responsibility, no doubt,

617
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:00,239
but you know it's a tremendous privilege

618
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:02,279
to be able to share Christ with someone,

619
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:06,599
to share with them what Christ has done for you

620
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:09,279
and what He could do for them.

621
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:11,359
I think about Zacchaeus.

622
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,599
Do you think he talked about what happened on this day?

623
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,119
I mean, I'm not trying to be extra biblical this evening,

624
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,359
but I'm just asking,

625
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:22,559
do you think that after an experience

626
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:24,479
like what we read about this evening,

627
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:27,239
do you think that Zacchaeus probably talked about that?

628
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:30,439
I would think so.

629
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:34,159
We know that Saul talked about his conversion regularly.

630
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:37,199
I mean, every time he had the opportunity

631
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:39,679
to stand before people and to give an answer,

632
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,079
he says, I find it great that I can speak today.

633
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:44,879
I think this is a great opportunity.

634
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:45,719
And what does he do?

635
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:48,519
He gives his testimony about his conversion,

636
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:49,759
about his salvation.

637
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:52,239
And I think that Zacchaeus,

638
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:53,919
I mean, I would have loved to hear Zacchaeus

639
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:56,719
tell the story firsthand, wouldn't you?

640
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,719
I mean, honestly, I've done my best

641
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:02,119
to try to be in the text this evening,

642
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:07,119
but I wonder how it would sound from Zacchaeus' perspective

643
00:37:07,279 --> 00:37:09,999
to hear him talk about the excitement

644
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:12,199
at the moment when Jesus stopped.

645
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,839
I mean, what's going through his mind?

646
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:14,959
Why is he stopping?

647
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,079
Oh, he's looking at me.

648
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,479
I mean, can you understand?

649
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:23,839
He begins to share all the things that Jesus,

650
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,159
again, I don't know how long the walk was to his home.

651
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:27,919
I don't know what transpired.

652
00:37:27,919 --> 00:37:29,759
I know how Zacchaeus responds,

653
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:32,959
and I know what Zacchaeus declares that he's going to do.

654
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,999
And I know what Jesus declares

655
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:36,639
about salvation coming to his house.

656
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:38,639
And I just wonder this evening,

657
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:42,239
how many people Zacchaeus shared this with?

658
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:44,319
I wonder this.

659
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:49,079
I mean, can you, just for a moment this evening,

660
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:52,159
understand that as a publican,

661
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:55,679
as a chief among the publicans,

662
00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:00,119
that he would have taken many things by false accusation?

663
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:02,959
Those are what they were known for.

664
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:05,279
Your taxes are this much,

665
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:06,399
but I'm gonna charge you this much

666
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:07,919
because that's how I make my money.

667
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:09,879
That's what they did.

668
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:11,799
That's how it worked.

669
00:38:11,799 --> 00:38:15,239
And so Zacchaeus says,

670
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:18,839
behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor.

671
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:21,199
If I've taken anything from any man by false accusation,

672
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,199
I restore him fourfold.

673
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,479
If we could do just a role play

674
00:38:23,479 --> 00:38:25,399
just for a moment this evening,

675
00:38:25,399 --> 00:38:26,919
can you imagine being a poor person

676
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:28,599
and Zacchaeus coming to you and saying,

677
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:30,199
here, I wanna give you this?

678
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:31,039
Why?

679
00:38:32,999 --> 00:38:34,799
Because Christ changed my life.

680
00:38:35,759 --> 00:38:37,879
I mean, there was this day,

681
00:38:37,879 --> 00:38:40,159
and he goes through the whole story

682
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:41,399
about what happened.

683
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:43,279
Can you imagine being one of the people

684
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:47,119
that he took something from by false accusation

685
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,320
that he charged many people?

686
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,199
Zacchaeus, I just paid my taxes last month.

687
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:56,119
Like, what are you here for?

688
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:57,320
I mean, seriously, right?

689
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,839
Can you?

690
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,039
He says, I'm not coming to collect taxes today.

691
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,440
I'm coming to restore to you

692
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,199
that which I took from false accusation.

693
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,599
What?

694
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,119
Zacchaeus, you've been coming here all the time

695
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:11,839
taking tax money from me.

696
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,559
He was a chief amongst the publicans.

697
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:17,000
He wasn't new at this game.

698
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,759
No doubt, he was known amongst the people.

699
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,119
Zacchaeus, what happened to you?

700
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:27,479
Let me tell you what happened to me.

701
00:39:27,479 --> 00:39:29,279
Jesus was coming through Jericho,

702
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:32,119
and I wanted to see who he was.

703
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:38,199
There were so many people, I couldn't see him.

704
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:41,239
So I ran up, and I got up into a tree.

705
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:45,000
And you know, Jesus stopped, and he spoke my name,

706
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,559
and he said he was gonna come to my house.

707
00:39:49,919 --> 00:39:51,440
And he changed my life.

708
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:56,000
That's the testimony of this man.

709
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,759
But you have a testimony too.

710
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:00,399
And I think this evening

711
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,279
that Zacchaeus probably talked about this quite a bit.

712
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:06,039
I mean,

713
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:11,919
He's just excited about being saved.

714
00:40:11,919 --> 00:40:17,839
And I believe this evening that there are probably people in heaven today because of

715
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:20,599
the testimony of Zacchaeus.

716
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:22,639
I believe that.

717
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:29,199
And I wonder tonight, how many people are in heaven because of my testimony?

718
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:33,439
How many people are in heaven because of your testimony?

719
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:42,159
I mean, do we really see and understand what Christ has done for us?

720
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:46,599
I understand you might not have climbed in a tree, I get it.

721
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:50,399
But there was a day that you got saved.

722
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:54,879
And we ought to talk about that day, and we ought to share with people, because listen,

723
00:40:54,879 --> 00:40:58,799
there are people like Zacchaeus that you come into contact with.

724
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:05,479
Oh, they have the position, they have the possessions, but they're empty.

725
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:10,399
And we can relate to Zacchaeus in both the beginning and the end of the passage that

726
00:41:10,399 --> 00:41:11,719
we look at.

727
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:21,359
And I want to be challenged this evening to be faithful in sharing my testimony and sharing

728
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,959
with others what Christ did for me, because He changed my life.

729
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:29,879
And if you're saved tonight, He changed your life.

730
00:41:29,879 --> 00:41:36,559
And those people that Zacchaeus interacted with, I'm just bringing you money back that

731
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:40,559
I took wrongly.

732
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:41,559
Can you imagine?

733
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:43,559
You're what?

734
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:45,319
Yeah.

735
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:48,999
God changed my life, and He can change your life too.

736
00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:49,999
Let's pray.

737
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:50,999
Father, we love You.

738
00:41:50,999 --> 00:41:54,199
Thank You for loving us.

739
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:00,959
I pray that You would work in hearts and lives tonight as only You can.

740
00:42:00,959 --> 00:42:06,519
We see how this man is described and what he desires, and we see what Christ declared.

741
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:10,759
God, I'm challenged tonight, personally.

742
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:19,639
I think I'm challenged as much tonight as I was just a few weeks ago when You just stopped

743
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:22,639
me in this passage of Scripture.

744
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:35,879
Lord, I pray You'd help us tonight to rejoice in our salvation, to rejoice in knowing that

745
00:42:35,879 --> 00:42:39,319
You are the seeking Savior.

746
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:46,439
Help us to be challenged tonight, to share our testimony.

747
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:55,479
I wonder if we really would allow that question to probe our hearts, to be honest about answering

748
00:42:55,479 --> 00:42:57,679
that question.

749
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:02,719
How many people are in heaven because of my testimony?

750
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:05,999
You've called us to be Your ambassadors.

751
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:10,399
You've commissioned us to go and to preach the gospel to every creature.

752
00:43:10,399 --> 00:43:13,519
I pray the Holy Spirit of God would have His will in way this night.

753
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:17,919
First, in Christ's name we pray, would You stand with me, heads are bowed, eyes are closed.
