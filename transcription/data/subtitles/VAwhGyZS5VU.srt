1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,119
this morning. Psalm 119, we'll begin in verse number 97, and we'll be looking at a number

2
00:00:06,119 --> 00:00:10,939
of portions of Scripture this morning. But I believe that as we sit here this morning,

3
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:18,079
we hold in our hands, you hold in your lap, a treasure. And the reality is that the Word

4
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:23,360
of God, this Bible, the precious book that we hold in our hands and sit in our laps this

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,659
morning is more precious than gold. And I know that there's a number of people that

6
00:00:28,659 --> 00:00:34,619
would disagree with that statement. There are people that would love to argue and differ

7
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:41,299
on that proclamation. But the psalmist declares in a number of portions of Scripture that

8
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:49,139
this book, the Word of God, is more precious than gold, yea, than much fine gold. And I'm

9
00:00:49,139 --> 00:00:55,400
so thankful that God has given us this book. We understand that He gave it to us by inspiration.

10
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:02,880
We understand this morning that He has divinely preserved this book. This morning, we are

11
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,279
blessed to have a Bible. There are many people around the globe this morning that do not

12
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:15,199
have a Bible. We've heard stories from our own missionaries who have sat in meeting places

13
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:21,639
such as we're seated in this morning, and they did not have a Bible for those that were

14
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:27,879
present. And Brother Savalle testifies of the very first time ever in his church after

15
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:33,680
years of ministry in Samoa, after that first time when Bibles were printed and delivered

16
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,680
and given to the people that for the first time in his ministry, he had the opportunity

17
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:45,519
to say, take your Bibles and turn to. And he heard the pages of the precious Word of

18
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:54,120
God as people were finding their place in the Bible. This morning, many of us have multiple

19
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:00,040
copies of the Bible. This morning, we, if we're not careful, we can get used to the

20
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:06,120
fact that we have a Bible, but it's a treasure. I would say this, this morning, I have not

21
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:12,800
always appreciated this book like I do today. Before I was saved, I didn't know anything

22
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,279
about the Bible. I didn't appreciate the Bible. I didn't know that the Bible was God's

23
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:23,399
Word. I didn't know that it contained the truth of redemption and the love that God

24
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:30,440
had for me. I had no idea. I didn't appreciate it then like I appreciate it now. The longer

25
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:38,619
I walk with the Lord, the more I appreciate this book, the more I love this book. We're

26
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:43,539
in Psalm 119, but I want to remind you of what Peter said. You don't need to turn there,

27
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:47,979
but in 1 Peter 1, in verse 23-25, it says,

28
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:53,779
Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God,

29
00:02:53,779 --> 00:03:01,339
which liveth and abideth forever. For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man

30
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:05,940
is the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away. But the

31
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:14,380
Word of the Lord endureth forever. And this is the Word which by the gospel is preached

32
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:21,380
unto you. I am thankful that I can place my hope, my confidence in the finished Word of

33
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:28,500
God, the eternal Word of God. I'm not dependent on your opinion, my opinion, someone else's

34
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,179
opinion. I just get to run to the Word of God and say, what does God say? What does

35
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:40,380
God say on this subject, on that subject? And what God said settles the matter. I know

36
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:46,179
for years there's been that statement, God said it, I believe it, that settles it. And

37
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:51,880
I think that's a nice little saying. But the reality is whether you believe it or not really

38
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,179
doesn't change the truth that God said it and that settles it. Now it's better for us

39
00:03:56,179 --> 00:04:03,580
if we believe it, amen? But if some disagree with it, if some reject it, oppose it, it's

40
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:10,100
still truth. And for that we ought to rejoice. Notice with me what the psalmist says in Psalm

41
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:16,059
119. Of course this whole chapter is devoted to the love and to the truth of God's Word

42
00:04:16,059 --> 00:04:23,140
and the love of God's Word. And here the psalmist comes in verse number 97, oh how love I thy

43
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:31,260
law, it is my meditation all the day. When I come to verse 97 as I read this precious

44
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,540
chapter in the Word of God and I see all that he mentions in the preceding verses about

45
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,420
God's Word and all that will be said after about God's Word, I understand why the psalmist

46
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:47,100
declares almost right in the middle, it's not exactly the middle verse, but how he declares

47
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:54,739
and I think it's with great excitement, there's emotion behind it, oh how love I thy law,

48
00:04:54,739 --> 00:05:01,540
it is my meditation all the day. I've used as our title this morning as you've seen in

49
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:06,700
the bulletin, oh how love I thy law. This morning I would say this if you're taking

50
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:12,700
notes, number one, as a follower of Jesus, I should love the Scriptures. As a follower

51
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:18,739
of Jesus, I should love the Scriptures. Not only here in verse number 97, but I want you

52
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:23,820
to walk with me through Psalm 119 and look at a number of verses, skip down if you will

53
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:32,100
to verse number 140. Notice what the psalmist says, thy word is very pure, therefore thy

54
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:41,380
servant loveth it. This book is pure. Every word of God is pure, every single word. He's

55
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:47,420
given it by inspiration, he's divinely preserved it, and we find here that the psalmist acknowledges

56
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:53,899
that the Word of God is very pure and his response to that truth is therefore thy servant

57
00:05:53,899 --> 00:06:04,700
loveth it. Look at verse number 159. The Bible says this, consider how I love thy precepts.

58
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:10,260
Thy precepts is another word term that is used here in Psalm 119 referring to the Word

59
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:17,019
of God. And it says, consider how I love thy precepts. Quicken me, O Lord, according

60
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:21,700
to thy lovingkindness. Thy word is true from the beginning and every one of thy righteous

61
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:28,619
judgments endureth forever. I look at verse number 159 and I consider it from this perspective

62
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:34,700
that the psalmist has already declared his love for God's Word and as followers of the

63
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,540
Lord Jesus Christ, we ought to love the Scriptures, we ought to love this book. But the reality

64
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,019
is that I can stand with the psalmist and you can stand with the psalmist and say, oh,

65
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:53,059
how love I thy law. But in verse number 159, the psalmist says, consider how I love thy

66
00:06:53,059 --> 00:07:00,179
precepts. It's one thing to say that we love it, it's another thing when our life proves

67
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:07,739
that we love it. That the psalmist can really, I believe, cry out in prayer to God and say,

68
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:16,420
consider how I love thy precepts. It's not just an expression that the psalmist is using,

69
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:22,420
but know his behavior aligns with the claim. Often we find throughout the truth of God's

70
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:29,299
Word, we've said this over the years, that people can claim a lot of things. If you're

71
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:34,899
reading the devotion book, we read just a couple of nights ago about a man that in his

72
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:40,179
will he willed lots of money to all sorts of places and cities and organizations and

73
00:07:40,179 --> 00:07:45,420
so on and so forth. And man, what a great thing. But the reality is that the man died

74
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:55,380
poor. He had nothing to leave to anyone. We can say whatever we want to say. Jesus said,

75
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:02,059
if you love me, keep my commandments. The proof of our love is through our behavior.

76
00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:11,940
The psalmist says, consider how I love thy precepts. Notice in verse 163, I hate and

77
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:22,739
abhor lying, but thy law do I love. I love it. Notice verse 165, great peace have they

78
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:30,500
which love thy law, and nothing shall offend them. You think about the peace that is absent

79
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:38,580
in so many people's lives today. We live in a world where people do not know the peace

80
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:47,539
of God. But our God, we understand we're able to make peace with God, according to Romans,

81
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:53,739
through the Lord Jesus Christ. But then we have the peace of God that passeth all understanding.

82
00:08:53,739 --> 00:09:00,580
And we find here that the psalmist says, great peace have they which love thy law,

83
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:07,099
and nothing shall offend them. And as we meditate and we feast upon the truth of God's Word,

84
00:09:07,099 --> 00:09:15,039
it impacts us to the place where we come, and we have that peace. My soul, verse 167,

85
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:23,020
my soul hath kept thy testimonies. And notice what he says, and I love them exceedingly.

86
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,700
I think about the expression that is used in verse 167. He's mentioned, as we've looked

87
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:33,219
at all of these verses very quickly this morning, and we've noticed how the psalmist has expressed

88
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:38,859
the fact that he loves the law, he loves the Word of God. And here in verse 167, he says,

89
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:46,580
I love them exceedingly. I mean, you think about saying, I love something, I love someone,

90
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,659
and we use that expression, and really that's the culmination of our emotions, and we make

91
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:57,059
that statement, and it carries great weight. But then for the psalmist to say, I love them,

92
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:58,940
but I love them exceedingly.

93
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,780
This book is precious.

94
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:07,420
And this morning, as followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, we ought to love the Scriptures.

95
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,220
We ought to love the Word of God.

96
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:15,380
But not only do we love the Word of God, number two, as a follower of Jesus, I should learn

97
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,500
the Scriptures.

98
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,900
I should learn the Scriptures.

99
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,820
I think about it from this perspective.

100
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,180
I love my wife, but I want to learn things about my wife.

101
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:31,540
I want to learn what she, or her interests, and what she likes, and so on and so forth.

102
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,400
And because I love her, I want to learn about my wife.

103
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,380
And as I think about the love that we should have for the Word of God, the love that we

104
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,420
have for the Scriptures, the reality is that as a follower of Jesus Christ, not only should

105
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,820
I love the Scriptures, but I should learn the Scriptures.

106
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,420
And it's amazing to me because I believe that there's a connection between these first two

107
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,980
thoughts this morning, and it's this.

108
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:02,060
The more I love the Word of God, the more I desire to learn the Word of God.

109
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,940
And the more I learn the Word of God, the more I love the Word of God.

110
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,139
And it just kind of continues in that cycle.

111
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:11,220
I love it, so I want to learn it.

112
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,540
I learn it, and I love it more, and so I want to learn more, and I love more.

113
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:23,620
And we come to that place of 167 where the psalmist says, I love thy law exceedingly

114
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:34,180
because I've learned the Scriptures, having that deeper, more intimate walk with God.

115
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:44,100
It's sad, but I know that probably none of us have been contacted about these studies

116
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,420
and surveys and what have you, but there are studies, surveys that are done regularly

117
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:56,100
with regard to the American population and their relationship to the Word of God.

118
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,940
I've never been called.

119
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:04,020
I've never been surveyed, and I'm sure that many of you have not been either.

120
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:11,460
But the statistics based upon those that have been surveyed are alarming.

121
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:20,860
A continual decline over the last several decades of people who even, they claim, the

122
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,820
people that are polled, the people that are surveyed, they claim to attend church at least

123
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:31,500
somewhat regularly, but yet when they answer the question about the Bible, they very rarely

124
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,059
ever pick it up to read it.

125
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:37,740
It's sad.

126
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,860
Statistics tell us that a number of people that have sat in churches for decades have

127
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,740
never read the Bible in its entirety, from Genesis to Revelation.

128
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,460
I hope that wouldn't be true of any of us.

129
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,460
Why?

130
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:55,059
Because we not only love the Bible, but we want to learn the Scriptures.

131
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:58,380
How is it that I can learn the Word of God?

132
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:05,580
How is it, as I know what the psalmist says and I understand the treasure that I hold

133
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,839
in my hand and I begin to develop this love for the Word of God, how is it that I go about

134
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:13,119
learning the Word of God?

135
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:17,400
Number one, through our personal devotions, our personal Bible study.

136
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,880
You know that the Word of God tells us, we referenced this verse in our Sunday school

137
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,600
this morning in 1 Peter 2 and verse number 2, as newborn babes desire the sincere milk

138
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,720
of the Word that ye may grow thereby.

139
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,779
Paul instructs Timothy in 2 Timothy 2 and verse number 15, study to show thyself approved

140
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:40,119
unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of truth

141
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:47,160
And the reality this morning is that we need to learn personally to dig in and to study

142
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,960
the Scriptures.

143
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:55,919
Can I say to you this morning that you ought to learn the Scriptures in church?

144
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,520
Through church attendance, you ought to learn the Scriptures.

145
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,919
But if the only learning you get is what's given from this pulpit, you're not getting

146
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:04,919
enough.

147
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:09,360
You're not getting enough.

148
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,559
Try to just eat physical food twice a week.

149
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,640
See how that works for you.

150
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,880
Many of us would never even attempt it.

151
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,899
But spiritually speaking, there are those that come to church just a couple of times

152
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:29,119
a week and then they don't have any other spiritual sustenance.

153
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:35,000
Oh, we need to learn personally through our personal devotions, through our personal Bible

154
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,119
study, digging into the Word of God, feasting upon the manna that God has given us and every

155
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:48,040
single day getting into the Word of God and saying, God, what do you have for me?

156
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,880
We should learn it through attending church.

157
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,959
Number two, yes, the personal devotions, but through church attendance.

158
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,480
You know that a church has been instructed throughout the New Testament, there are many

159
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,880
instructions that are given to the church and we understand that God has equipped the

160
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,959
church with spiritual leaders.

161
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:08,200
In fact, as you read Ephesians chapter number four, he says that He gave some pastors and

162
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,640
teachers and God has given the instruction in His Word in the New Testament with regard

163
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,399
to church polity and the setup of a church.

164
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:23,799
And not only has He given the responsibility, the office, the officers of a local church,

165
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:28,619
the office of a pastor, the office of a deacon, but He's given what the responsibility is

166
00:15:28,619 --> 00:15:31,660
of those that would hold such position.

167
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:36,019
In Acts chapter number 20, the apostle Paul is on his way to Jerusalem and as he's on

168
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:42,220
his way to Jerusalem, he calls for the church leaders from Ephesus to come and to meet him.

169
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:47,299
And as they meet, he begins to give them instruction, he begins to provide them with some details

170
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:52,660
with regarding to his ministry there in Ephesus and he challenges these religious leaders

171
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,779
of the church at Ephesus, the elders and the overseers is what they're referred to in verse

172
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,500
17 as elder and verse 28 as the overseer.

173
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,820
And we find that as Paul is writing to these or speaking to these and as Luke would record

174
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:16,820
the interaction, notice in Acts 20 and verse number 28, Paul says this to these leaders

175
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:23,459
of the church at Ephesus, take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock, notice,

176
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:31,100
for the witch the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church of God which

177
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,140
He hath purchased with His own blood.

178
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:40,540
He doesn't mean to set up a banquet table with a potluck dinner.

179
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,559
I like potluck dinners, but that's not what Paul's referring to.

180
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:52,299
When he says to these church leaders, these pastors at the church at Ephesus, he says

181
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:54,739
feed the church of God.

182
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:57,779
God has given you an entrusted position.

183
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:03,260
God has placed you in this place of being an overseer and God has called you and God

184
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:10,500
has placed you there and now your responsibility is to feed the church of God.

185
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,299
Notice what he says, which He hath purchased with His own blood.

186
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:18,860
We must always remember that it's God's church.

187
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:24,600
We must always remember that the Lord Jesus Christ is the head of the church.

188
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,299
We find that He continues and He says in verse 29, for I know this, that after my departing

189
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:34,940
shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.

190
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,380
Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after

191
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,380
them.

192
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:46,100
Therefore, watch and remember that by the space of three years I cease not to warn everyone

193
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,860
night and day with tears.

194
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,980
The responsibility of the pastor to feed the church of God is because of the false teaching

195
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,220
that is prevalent in those that would rise up and he says, you as a pastor, you have

196
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,500
the responsibility.

197
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,820
So when I say that as a follower of Jesus, I should love the Scriptures, but then I should

198
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,100
learn the Scriptures, I not only learn them through my personal Bible study, but I learn

199
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,739
them by church attendance.

200
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:17,660
Instead I go to a church that preaches the Word of God.

201
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:26,100
I desire, it's my prayer every single week that God would use me to preach the Word.

202
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:31,119
Someone asked that was a visitor to our church a couple of years ago, and I do not say this

203
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,419
except to say glory to God.

204
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:38,020
They were visitors to our church, the purpose for them visiting our church is because they

205
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:42,580
were looking for a place for their church to rent.

206
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,299
They're looking for a facility to rent.

207
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:53,580
They were not pastors, but they were in position of leadership at the particular church that

208
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,059
they were representing.

209
00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:02,500
The close of the service in that back lobby, they said this, do you always feed the flock

210
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,940
this way?

211
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,460
That's humbling.

212
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:12,140
And here's what I said, it's my responsibility.

213
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:18,900
Listen, there's no reason to go to a church that's not feeding the church.

214
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,460
There's no reason to go to a church where they're not preaching the Word of God.

215
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,140
It's not my opinion that's going to change anybody's life.

216
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:32,500
It is this book that is going to change lives.

217
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:40,059
Paul says to Timothy in 2 Timothy chapter number 4, he says, listen, preach the Word.

218
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:45,539
Be instant in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and

219
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:46,539
doctrine.

220
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:51,419
Oh, the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine.

221
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:57,619
But it does not change the responsibility, Timothy, to preach the Word of God.

222
00:19:57,619 --> 00:19:59,020
In 1 Timothy chapter number 4.

223
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:03,700
I want you to turn there and notice what is said in 1 Timothy chapter number 4 with regard

224
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,880
to this responsibility, and I believe that as a pastor is to fulfill the responsibility

225
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:16,020
of feeding the church and feeding the flock of God that you can learn the Scriptures sitting

226
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:22,140
in the pew at church, sitting in the Sunday school class, sitting in the morning service,

227
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:28,140
the evening service, the midweek service, the opportunity to grow and to learn the Word

228
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:35,740
of God. In 1 Timothy 4 and verse number 6, notice what Paul says to his son of the faith,

229
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:41,540
Timothy. He says, If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt

230
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:47,620
be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine,

231
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:57,020
whereunto thou hast attained. You know that God does not use as His measuring, if you

232
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:04,580
will, for who a good minister is by the size of a congregation, by the number of ministries

233
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:14,020
that a church has. Those are not the parameters that God uses. Paul says to Timothy under

234
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:19,300
the inspiration of God, he says, This is what would make you a good minister of Jesus Christ,

235
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,500
that you're putting the brethren in remembrance of these things, that you're teaching the

236
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:30,100
Word of God, that you're preaching the Word of God. Peter would say this in 1 Peter 5

237
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:37,140
and verse number 2. We looked at verse number 1 a couple of weeks ago, dealing with the

238
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,260
fact that he, Peter, was a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and he mentions about

239
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:47,380
his own position of being an elder, and as he's writing to the elders, the leaders of

240
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:52,100
the church, he says to them in verse number 2, again, similar to what Paul said to the

241
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:58,300
church leaders in Ephesus in Acts 20, he says, Feed the flock of God, which is among

242
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:03,140
you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly, not for filthy

243
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:10,820
lucre, but of a ready mind. Feed, feed the flock of God. How is it that I learn the Scriptures?

244
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:15,420
Well, number one, through your own personal Bible study, your own personal devotion. Number

245
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:21,020
two, through church attendance, into a church that teaches and preaches the Word of God,

246
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:27,900
we can learn the Scriptures, we can learn the Word of God. We know that the truth of

247
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,660
discipleship would really be my third thought of how we can learn the Scriptures. In Matthew

248
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:37,220
chapter 28, we read the Great Commission, and we, often as we speak about the Great

249
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:42,180
Commission, we're mindful of our responsibility to preach the gospel to every creature, and

250
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:48,060
we know that after conversion, they're to be baptized. But we find that as Jesus would

251
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:55,100
give, really in this passage that is recorded by Matthew, the fullest teaching with regard

252
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:01,780
to the Great Commission, Mark simply says, Preach the gospel to every creature. But we

253
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:06,940
find that Matthew, as he's recording the words of Christ, it says, All power is given unto

254
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:11,300
me in heaven and earth, in verse 18, Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing

255
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,820
them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. And then he says

256
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:20,940
this, teaching them, what? Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded

257
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:26,780
you. And lo, I am with you all the way, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

258
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:32,420
I remember we were in California just after I got saved. We were in a church for just

259
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:37,900
a short time, but we were involved in a discipleship program as a family. The four of us attended

260
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:44,940
a discipleship program, my parents, my brother, and I. And we would learn. It was a very detailed

261
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:50,340
discipleship program that we were involved in, just for a short period of time. But it

262
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:55,860
was very interesting, and I love discipleship. I love the opportunity to sit in my office

263
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:00,940
or to sit at some other, I don't like Starbucks, but go to Panera or something like that, and

264
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:07,940
be able to sit and just use some Bible teaching and just disciple someone one-on-one and teach

265
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,340
them the Word of God. You know, one way that you can learn the Scriptures is through getting

266
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:19,060
involved in discipleship. Sometimes we don't learn the Scriptures because we're, please

267
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:23,180
forgive me, I don't mean to be unkind, but at times we're too prideful to even acknowledge

268
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:30,180
that we need to learn. You know, the reality is that as we go to the Word of God and we

269
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:35,340
love the Scriptures, say, I want to learn the Scriptures, and we begin to have with

270
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:42,340
a measure of humility that I need to learn God's Word. I want to learn the truth that

271
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:51,940
God has given within His Word. We begin to go through the process of learning the Scriptures.

272
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,900
Again, as I mentioned, the more I learn of God's Word, the more I love God's Word. The

273
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:01,940
more I love it, the more I want to learn it. But as we finish this morning, I want

274
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:07,980
you to think about this truth. As a follower of Jesus Christ, I should live the Scriptures.

275
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:14,980
Yes, we ought to love the Word of God. It's precious. It's a treasure. Yes, we ought to

276
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:22,460
learn the Word of God. But if we're not living the Word of God, it's not what it's about.

277
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:28,020
It's not what it's about. I'm not learning it just so that I can have some measure of

278
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:33,700
head knowledge, just so that I can win some Bible trivia game and be able to answer some

279
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:39,860
questions. No, I'm learning it so that I would live it. And we find that as we look to the

280
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:45,300
Word of God, we find, of course, and we often quote James 1 and verse 22, that we're to

281
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:51,500
be doers of the Word and not hearers only. And the reality is that as I love the Book

282
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:58,180
and as I learn the Book, I should be living the Book. You know, for years, perhaps even,

283
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:03,660
you could look at decades, even some could look at and mention centuries, where Baptist

284
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:10,660
people were called this, people of the Book. People of the Book. What a great compliment.

285
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:18,460
Amen? What a great compliment. I've had people over the years say, well, you just believe

286
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:26,380
the Bible. Thank you. Right? I mean, what else do you want me to believe? Yes, I believe

287
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:33,740
the Bible. It's been given by inspiration of God. It is His Word. He is authoritative,

288
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:40,740
and He has given us the authoritative Word. You're too narrow-minded. I'm as broad as

289
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:48,620
the Word of God is. Amen? Where God has given us truth, we don't need to try to be more

290
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:54,100
open-minded about it. It's not that we don't want to be kind and gracious. It's not that

291
00:26:54,100 --> 00:27:00,260
we don't want to reach people. But the reality is that truth is truth. When's the last time

292
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,780
a student sat in a classroom, I don't know, things are crazy in our world today. Maybe

293
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:08,620
it's happening, I don't know. But back in my day, and I'm not that old, but somebody

294
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,100
told me that yesterday. You're a pretty young man. I said, thank you very much. I appreciate

295
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,340
that. That was right after they told me they weren't sure who was my daughter when they

296
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:22,340
were singing and who was my wife. But anyway, it's, you know, some good, some bad. Anyway,

297
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:27,940
you know, there was never a teacher that I had in school that when I got the math problem

298
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,960
wrong that I was able to just tell them, well, that's just, you've got to be more open-minded

299
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:38,960
about it. No, it's wrong, right? Isn't that what they say? It's wrong. This is the right

300
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:46,880
answer. Well, I want this to be the right answer. Well, I'm sorry. It doesn't matter

301
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:53,880
if we're sincere. You know, people can be sincerely wrong. They can be. People can be

302
00:27:53,880 --> 00:28:00,880
sincere. People can be sincerely wrong. And it's God that uses His Word that convinces

303
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:08,360
us of truth. And this morning, as I live the Scriptures, as I live out the Word of God,

304
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,880
remember what Joshua was told. Turn back to Joshua chapter 1, and I want you to see what

305
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,160
God told Joshua. And really, I believe that as you come to the book of Joshua that, of

306
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:23,720
course, Moses has died. And who is it that was the human penman to the Pentateuch? It's

307
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,860
Moses. He was the human penman of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.

308
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:34,960
It was God that used Moses to write those books. And we find that Moses has now died.

309
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:41,520
Moses, my servant, is dead. The Bible plainly tells us that. And Joshua is now the man that

310
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:48,760
God would use to lead His people, God's people, into the land of promise. And I want you to

311
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,760
notice, we're familiar with the verse of Scripture, but I want you to notice in verse number 8,

312
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:00,420
this book of the law. This is the first time after the death of Moses and after the writing

313
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:06,640
of the law, the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible, that God now says, this

314
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,880
book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth. Notice what he says, but thou shalt

315
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:21,400
meditate therein day and night. Remember, how do I learn the Scriptures? Through my

316
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:27,440
personal devotion. You don't come here day and night. Now, on Sunday, you can. Amen?

317
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,239
We have service in the morning and in the evening on Sundays. You can come day and night,

318
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:36,520
and you can feast on the Word of God. But in our own personal lives, he says, thou shalt

319
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:41,040
meditate therein day and night. Notice what he says, that thou mayest observe, what are

320
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:48,040
the next two words? To do. I love it, I learn it, but I must live it. To do according to

321
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,840
all that you want to do. Nope. According to all that you want to do.

322
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,960
that is written therein," right?

323
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,060
Then notice what he says, for then.

324
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,640
Now what is then?

325
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,040
It is the result of the process that is laid out.

326
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,960
Then does not come if we do not fulfill the process that is laid out, right?

327
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
It's the result.

328
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,720
It's the outcome.

329
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,240
Would you agree?

330
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:34,560
For then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.

331
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,720
How many people today in our world are looking for prosperity and success?

332
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:45,920
Thousands, millions, they're looking for prosperity and they're looking for success.

333
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:54,360
I would submit to you that they're using a different measurement for success and prosperity.

334
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:00,640
Their perspective of being prosperous and being successful is different than what God's

335
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,400
Word says.

336
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:08,120
Many people today have the idea that prosperity and success is primarily based upon the size

337
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,640
of your bank account.

338
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,480
It's a very common belief.

339
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:19,720
But you know there are some people that have some really big bank accounts and are miserable?

340
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:26,880
Riches make themselves wings and fly away, that's what the Word of God says.

341
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:35,480
Listen, when we take the truth of Joshua 1 and verse 8, and we take the Book of God,

342
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,920
the Word of God, the Book that He has given us, the precious Bible, and we meditate there

343
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:45,240
in day and night, and we're learning the Scriptures and we're loving the Scriptures, but we're

344
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:52,160
going and seeking the Scriptures for the purpose of obedience, to do according to

345
00:31:52,160 --> 00:32:01,920
all that is written therein, then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt

346
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,840
have good success.

347
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,440
Psalm 19 and verse number 11, I want you to notice in this psalm, of course, we begin

348
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:14,960
with the declaration of the glories of heaven and how the heavens declare the glory of God

349
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,120
and the firmament showeth His handiwork.

350
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,280
And you think about the way in which Psalm 19 begins with the creation and the glory

351
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,640
of creation, but how the creation declares the glory of God.

352
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,640
Why?

353
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,240
Because the creation requires a creator.

354
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:38,400
People have just thrown away that simple truth wholesale today in our society.

355
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,560
You ask somebody that denies a creator, ask them if they have a watch on.

356
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:46,680
Well, yeah, well, who designed the watch?

357
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:51,440
The watch requires a designer, right?

358
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,440
It didn't just...

359
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,800
Somebody didn't just put all the pieces...

360
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,280
First of all, where'd you get the pieces?

361
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,800
But even if they could, they didn't just put all the pieces in a box and then came out

362
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,520
a watch.

363
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,120
If that could happen, they wouldn't be able to sell them for as much as they sell them

364
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
for.

365
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
Amen?

366
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:12,800
But the reality is that the heavens declare the glory of God.

367
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,080
And then the psalmist goes into the Word of God, beginning in verse number 7, the law

368
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,280
of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.

369
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,080
The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.

370
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,520
The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart.

371
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,440
The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.

372
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,800
The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever.

373
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,080
The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.

374
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,080
Notice what he says.

375
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:43,260
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold, sweeter also than honey

376
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,260
and the honeycomb.

377
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:50,600
But then notice what he says in verse number 11, moreover by them, by the Scriptures, by

378
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,100
the Word of God, moreover by them is thy servant warned.

379
00:33:55,100 --> 00:34:00,800
Many people don't like warnings, but I'm thankful for warnings.

380
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:08,400
You have containers at home that have warning labels, right?

381
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,040
Those warning labels are there for a reason.

382
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:16,840
Sometimes the elements that are contained within that package could kill you.

383
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,400
They're poison, right?

384
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,920
They have warning labels.

385
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:25,760
The Word of God contains warnings, but then notice what he says at the end of verse number

386
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,760
11.

387
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:32,280
In keeping of them, there is great reward.

388
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
Great reward.

389
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,420
I'm so thankful that God blesses obedience to His Word.

390
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:44,200
In keeping of them, living out the Scriptures, doing what God has said in His Word, there

391
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,640
is great reward.

392
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:51,520
The psalmist cries out in Psalm 86 and verse number 11 his desire to learn the Scriptures.

393
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,060
Of course, we've mentioned already that I love the Word of God, so I desire to learn

394
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,120
the Word of God.

395
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,420
And as I learn the Word of God, I love the Word of God, and I learn more of the Word

396
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,420
of God.

397
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:05,740
And here the psalmist says in Psalm 86 and verse number 11, teach me thy way, O Lord.

398
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,100
I want to learn it.

399
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,100
Why?

400
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:13,820
I will walk in thy truth, unite my heart to fear thy name.

401
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,820
I want to live it.

402
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:18,760
I want to live out the Word of God.

403
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,280
We started in 1 Peter by quoting a portion of Scripture of being born again, not of corruptible

404
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,700
seed but of incorruptible.

405
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,620
The Word of God which liveth and abideth forever.

406
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:34,620
I want you to notice what Peter then says in 2 Peter chapter number 1.

407
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:41,260
We'll finish with this portion of Scripture, and I want you to consider the truth that

408
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:46,100
Peter is expressing to these that he's writing to.

409
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:51,060
Now understand contextually in 2 Peter chapter number 1, Peter is just speaking about being

410
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,700
an eyewitness of the majesty of God.

411
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,700
He's speaking about his experience at the Mount of Transfiguration.

412
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,460
We don't have time to develop all of that this morning, but that's what he's referring

413
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:05,180
to in verse 15 down through verse number 18.

414
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:10,740
Peter, James, and John, they went up on that day and they saw the glory of the Lord Jesus

415
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,060
Christ and the Mount of Transfiguration.

416
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:21,580
And Peter, after speaking about that experience, he says this in verse number 19, we have also

417
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:27,200
a more sure word of prophecy.

418
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:35,820
Now notice what he says, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth

419
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,020
in a dark place, unto the day that dawn and the day star arise in your hearts.

420
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:44,700
I remember speaking with Doc actually a number of years ago about this verse of Scripture.

421
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,780
And it's interesting the analogy that is used, the imagery that is given to us when he talks

422
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,980
about as unto a light that shineth in a dark place.

423
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,340
You know what's interesting?

424
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:59,100
If we're in this place, and it'd have to be late now because of the time change, but if

425
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:06,580
we're in this room and it's completely dark, and your attention immediately would turn

426
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:09,220
if there was a light that was turned on.

427
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,980
If someone just had a little flashlight, those little flashlights that we give out that the

428
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,980
kids love so much.

429
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,220
I guess it was the missionaries last week, and man, that little kid pointed it right

430
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,220
in his eye.

431
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,220
The oldest of the kids.

432
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,660
He's like, come on, man, seriously?

433
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:25,020
He's like, it's bright, you think?

434
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:29,540
But anyway, if we're in a completely dark place, and you just turn on a little light,

435
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,540
you know where your attention is going to go?

436
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,540
It's going to go to the light.

437
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:37,620
It's going to go to the light.

438
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:44,580
And Peter says that we have a more sure word of prophecy, whereunto ye do well that ye

439
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,580
take heed.

440
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:50,300
You know, it's in our best interest to obey the Word of God, to live the Word of God in

441
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,700
our best interest.

442
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:58,420
We're not going to take the time to go there, but in Acts 27, Paul is going to be shipwrecked,

443
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,900
and it's a terrible situation.

444
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:08,060
You know, it's interesting, before they ever set sail, Paul said we shouldn't go.

445
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,060
You read it.

446
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,060
Go back and read Acts 27.

447
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,740
He says we shouldn't go.

448
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,580
But the other people that were there, the owners of the ship and others, they said,

449
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,580
you know, it's fine.

450
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,580
We should go.

451
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,340
It didn't work out so well for them.

452
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,420
And I've often thought about this when I read that passage of Scripture.

453
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:29,260
You know, everyone believes something, and everyone believes someone, right?

454
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:36,660
The people that would like to criticize you for believing the Bible, they believe something.

455
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:43,940
Whether they themselves are their own authority, or some other person is their authority, some

456
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:49,100
other religion, some other science, whatever it might be, humanism.

457
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,100
Somebody is their authority.

458
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,100
They believe somebody.

459
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:57,100
And this morning, we need to believe God.

460
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:01,140
The psalmist declares, oh, how love I thy law.

461
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:06,980
I wonder this morning, can we stand with the psalmist and say, I love the Word of God.

462
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:11,660
I love it exceedingly.

463
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:17,220
And that love that I have for the Word of God results in me learning the Word of God

464
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,740
through my personal devotions.

465
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,660
Every day, I can't wait to get to my time of devotion.

466
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,780
You know, there are some people that have certain things that they do every day.

467
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,780
They can't wait to get to read the news.

468
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:33,380
I hate the news.

469
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,500
I like to try to keep myself aware of what's going on, but man, I don't like it.

470
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,940
I'd rather read the Word of God.

471
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:48,020
And do we have that longing for I can't wait to get to God and His Word?

472
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:52,380
I'm learning the Scriptures, but then I'm living the Scriptures.

473
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:56,300
Every day when I go to the Word of God, God, what is it that You're showing me in Your

474
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,420
Word that I need to apply in my life?

475
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:02,820
How can I be a doer of Your Word?

476
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:07,900
How do I take this truth and apply it in my life?

477
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:13,700
As believers, as followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, I hope that it'd be said of us that

478
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:18,180
we love the Word of God, that we're learning the Word of God, and that we're living the

479
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,180
Word of God.

480
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,180
Let's pray.

481
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,180
Father, we love You.

482
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,180
We thank You for loving us.

483
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:25,340
We thank You so much for this precious book, the Bible.

484
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:30,580
How thankful we are to have the Word of God.

485
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:35,620
And I pray this morning that as we've spent just a little while speaking about our relationship

486
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:40,620
to Your Word, I pray that each of us could say that we love Your Word and we're learning

487
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,980
Your Word, we're living Your Word.

488
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:49,420
God, I pray that Your Spirit would speak to us as individuals.

489
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:55,620
Maybe we need to learn it more.

490
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,080
Maybe we need to live it more.

491
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:05,780
Maybe there's some things that we're not applying in our lives.

492
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:10,100
Maybe our devotion life is not what it ought to be.

493
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:14,500
Maybe our church attendance is not what it ought to be.

494
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:23,780
And we're missing out on those meals, those spiritual meals, the milk and meat of the

495
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,060
Word of God.

496
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:30,740
God, I pray that You'd move in the moments of invitation.

497
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:35,640
You'd help us, Lord, to respond in obedience.

498
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:40,140
If there's one that's present with us that's not sure of heaven, they've never trusted

499
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,980
the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

500
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:51,700
God, I pray that today they would understand the love that You have for them.

501
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,420
We sang about being ransomed.

502
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:59,020
We sang about the love, and can it be?

503
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:03,340
We started with speaking about being born again, not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible

504
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,300
by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever.

505
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:11,540
If there's one present that's not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible, the authoritative

506
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:16,260
Word of God, and show them how they can know for sure that heaven is their home.

507
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,100
I pray that You'd move and work, have Your way.

508
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,460
In Christ's name we pray.
