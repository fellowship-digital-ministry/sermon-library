1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
45. Lord willing, we'll make it through all 28 verses this evening. Genesis chapter 45,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,319
sorry, yeah, chapter 45. Genesis chapter 45, verses 1 through 28, and we'll look at the

3
00:00:13,319 --> 00:00:18,079
entirety of this chapter. Beginning in verse number 1, we find that the Bible says,

4
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:25,079
Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him, and he cried,

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,479
Cause every man to go out from me, and there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself

6
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:37,240
known unto his brethren. I've used that phrase at the end of verse number 1 for the title

7
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,680
of the message this evening, Joseph made himself known unto his brethren, so that we can catch

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,520
it in context and understand what's going on. Joseph's brothers came to Egypt for the

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,279
second time for the purpose of buying food. We, of course, studied last time when we looked

10
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:55,759
at this portion of Scripture two Sundays ago, we had a missionary last Sunday evening,

11
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:01,500
but chapters 43 and 44, and we looked at that second journey of Joseph's brothers coming

12
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,440
to Egypt, and after they had been treated to a meal at Joseph's house, they departed

13
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:13,440
for homeland. Soon thereafter, the steward of Joseph's house overtakes them and finds

14
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:19,959
the cup in Benjamin's sack. Back to the city they go, and there they find themselves standing

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,239
before Joseph. All the while, Joseph knew who they were, but he had not yet revealed

16
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:32,720
himself to them. Judah pleads with Joseph. We find that at the end of chapter 44, it

17
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,360
seems like a wonderful picture of brokenness, where Judah, as he's pleading, standing there

18
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,360
before Joseph, he demonstrates complete brokenness as he offers to bear the punishment himself.

19
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:52,760
Do not punish Benjamin. Punish me instead. Let him go free. The scene is set for Genesis

20
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:58,519
chapter 45, and we find that in this passage of Scripture that God records for us the great

21
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:05,519
moment when Joseph makes himself known to his brethren. I would say this, what a scene.

22
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:12,759
What a scene Genesis 45 is. We find that in this passage of Scripture, we learn of forgiveness

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,880
and we learn of restoration. We learn of God's providence and we learn of submission. There

24
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,160
are some great life lessons that we learn in Genesis chapter 45. Of course, as we go

25
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,839
through the text this evening, we seek to learn the historical context of what's taking

26
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:33,960
place historically, but then seek to make application in our own lives so that we might

27
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,960
learn from this portion of Scripture. As we begin looking at this text this evening, if

28
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:45,000
you're taking notes, number one, I want you to notice that Joseph reveals his person.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,880
Joseph reveals his person. Verses 1-4, I read verse 1. Notice in verse number 2, after he

30
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,639
caused all the men to leave from him in verse number 1. In verse number 2, the Bible says

31
00:02:53,639 --> 00:03:00,639
that he wept aloud. He wept aloud. And the Egyptians in the house of Pharaoh heard. And

32
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:07,639
Pharaoh heard. And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph. Can you imagine? The Bible says

33
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:17,520
that he asked this question, doth my father yet live? Now, he's asked this question repeatedly

34
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:23,119
in the very first time that they come to Egypt. And of course, Joseph recognizes them immediately.

35
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:30,119
They do not know who he is. And he asks about his father. He asked about his younger brother

36
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:35,399
Benjamin. And we find that, of course, in that first interaction, he says, unless you

37
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:39,800
bring Benjamin back, your youngest brother, you can't have any food. And that was the

38
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,679
big debate between the sons of Jacob and Jacob before they would return for the second journey.

39
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:50,759
But we know that he asked this question, doth my father yet live? Notice the Bible says

40
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:57,759
that his brethren could not answer him, for they were troubled at his presence. And Joseph

41
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:04,720
said unto his brethren, come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said,

42
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,919
I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.

43
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,520
As we notice that Joseph reveals his person, I can't help but see in these four verses

44
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:21,600
of Scripture to begin chapter 45, the emotions that are here, that are present in this particular

45
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,119
time. We find that the Bible says that he, Joseph, he wept aloud, so loud that the Egyptians

46
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:32,720
in the house of Pharaoh heard it when Joseph weeps and he makes himself known. We find

47
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,119
that it had been welled up. I believe that as you look through the text of Scripture,

48
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:43,019
through these chapters that we've studied, these emotions have been welled up in Joseph.

49
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:48,799
We find that he no longer could contain it, and it's as if there's an eruption that takes

50
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:56,200
place. And he says, I am Joseph. Notice with me, hold your place here in chapter 45, but

51
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:02,959
turn back to chapter 42, if you will. And notice in verse number 24, this is in the

52
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:08,720
situation where the brothers are talking after that, during that first visit. And they say

53
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,440
in verse 21, we are verily guilty concerning our brethren that we saw the anguish of a

54
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,320
soul when he besought us and we would not hear. Therefore, is this distress come upon

55
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,519
us? And they're talking amongst themselves there. And Joseph is hearing it. Joseph understands.

56
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,760
And in verse 24, the Bible says that he, speaking of Joseph, turned himself about

57
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:35,799
from them and wept and returned to them again and communed with them and took from them

58
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:42,000
Simeon and bound him before their eyes. In chapter 43, this is the second visit. We find

59
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,600
that Joseph gives instruction with regard to them coming to his home for that meal that

60
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,279
he would have prepared. And the Bible says that they come and they enter in. Of course,

61
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:56,359
there's some level of fear in verse 18. It says they were afraid because they were brought

62
00:05:56,359 --> 00:06:03,359
to Joseph's house. But notice in verse number 30, the Bible says that Joseph made haste

63
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:09,119
for his bowels did yearn upon his brother and he sought where to weep and he entered

64
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:14,200
into his chamber and wept there. And then he says he washed his face and went out and

65
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:19,519
refrained himself and said, set on bread. And then they ate. And we find that Joseph

66
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:26,000
is there and these interactions, and of course, as we've mentioned in previous messages, Joseph

67
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,359
was not living in Egypt in a state of bitterness. Joseph was living in Egypt understanding that

68
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:39,440
God is sovereign and that God had a plan. And we find that as his brothers come, that

69
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:47,600
he now is able, the time was right, if you will, and Joseph reveals his person. We find

70
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,239
that as Joseph says, I am Joseph, doth my father yet live in verse number three, that

71
00:06:52,239 --> 00:07:00,279
they cannot answer him. Can you imagine the shock of these boys with everything that they

72
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:07,359
knew that had transpired, thinking back to their original or their time with Joseph when

73
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:12,720
they originally sold him into slavery and standing there now and hearing Joseph saying,

74
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,679
I am Joseph. There's a measure of shock. There's a measure of fear. The Bible tells

75
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:24,000
us that they could not answer why they were troubled at his presence. Can you imagine?

76
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,559
You ever been in a situation and it seems like a million thoughts go through your mind

77
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:32,640
in just a moment? You've been in that circumstance, in that situation. I can't even imagine what

78
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:39,519
floods the minds of these brothers with regard to the revelation that is made here in Genesis

79
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:47,579
45, when Joseph reveals his person. He says, I am Joseph. I want you to see something sweet.

80
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:50,559
The Bible says that they were troubled at his presence. They could not answer him in

81
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:55,760
verse number three. And then notice what Joseph says in verse number four. He says, come near

82
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:04,200
to me. Come near to me. He says, I pray you. And notice what the Bible says, and they came

83
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:12,079
near. The Bible tells us here that he then says to them as they come near, I think probably

84
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:19,079
in a different tone, if you will, with a different set of emotions. He says, I am Joseph, your

85
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:27,839
brother, whom you sold into Egypt. It's interesting as you notice, and we'll get to it as we continue

86
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:33,200
through the message, but notice in verse 14, the Bible says this, that he fell upon his

87
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,679
brother Benjamin's neck and wept. Benjamin wept upon his neck. Moreover, he kissed all

88
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:47,679
his brethren and wept upon them, and after that his brethren talked with him. This was

89
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,719
a sweet reunion, and you think about all that had transpired, and you think about those

90
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:58,640
emotions that could have welled up, and Joseph is a great picture here of someone who can

91
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:06,440
forgive. A picture of forgiveness and restoration. An individual that was, he was treated wrongly.

92
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,960
He was treated poorly. He was sold into slavery. His brothers wanted to kill him. They could

93
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:20,520
not speak peaceably unto him. He has all of this power, but he's not seeking retribution.

94
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:27,039
He's not seeking revenge. He's forgiven them. He's understood that there's a plan that God

95
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:34,479
has, and we see in this passage of Scripture so beautifully illustrated when Joseph says,

96
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:42,159
come near to me I pray you, and there's this embrace that we read in verses 14 and 15 as

97
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:48,099
they have this greeting where they kiss one another and they weep and they wept upon one

98
00:09:48,099 --> 00:09:56,000
another's neck. How precious the scene in Genesis chapter 45 as Joseph reveals his presence.

99
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
A sweet reunion. A wonderful picture of forgiveness we see.

100
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,160
as we open Genesis chapter 45.

101
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,659
We find not only does Joseph reveal his person,

102
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:09,439
but number two, Joseph revealed his perspective.

103
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:11,060
Notice in verse number five,

104
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,119
and really down through verse number eight,

105
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:17,040
we read of Joseph revealing to his brothers his perspective.

106
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,200
He says this, now therefore be not grieved.

107
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,760
Now it's interesting that he would say that.

108
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,600
You know why?

109
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,879
That's probably a response that they would have

110
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:26,680
given the circumstances.

111
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,520
And Joseph says be not grieved,

112
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,119
nor be angry with yourselves, why?

113
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:33,279
Well, he's gonna tell them why.

114
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,159
He's gonna reveal the perspective that he has

115
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,099
in his understanding.

116
00:10:37,099 --> 00:10:39,400
He says now therefore, be not grieved,

117
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,000
nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither.

118
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,720
Then notice what he says.

119
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,720
For God did send me before you to preserve life.

120
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:54,439
For these two years hath the famine been in the land,

121
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:56,200
and yet there are five years in the which

122
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,000
there shall neither be earring nor harvest.

123
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,319
And notice again, he says this,

124
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:05,839
and God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity

125
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,839
in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

126
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,959
So now, notice in verse number eight,

127
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,720
it was not you that sent me hither, but God.

128
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,440
And he hath made me a father to Pharaoh,

129
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,959
and Lord of all his house,

130
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,879
and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.

131
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,000
As Joseph is speaking to his brothers,

132
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,440
he's revealed his person, his identity.

133
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,879
He says, I am Joseph.

134
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:35,800
He says, come near, and they come.

135
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,639
And he says, I am Joseph, your brother,

136
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,959
whom you sold into slavery.

137
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,919
But then he reveals his perspective.

138
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,919
Three times in the passage of Scripture,

139
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:45,680
in these few verses, he declares that it was God

140
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,360
who sent him to Egypt.

141
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,800
Now we know we can go back just a few chapters,

142
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,120
and we can read of the circumstances

143
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,680
that led to Joseph being sold into slavery.

144
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,279
We can read of the conspiracy of the brothers.

145
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,959
We can read of how they were going to kill him.

146
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:03,559
And then they said, well, why should we kill him?

147
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:06,519
I mean, we could sell him, and we can read all of that.

148
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,080
We can understand that.

149
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,600
But Joseph says, it wasn't you.

150
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,440
It was God.

151
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,839
It wasn't you.

152
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:16,160
It was God.

153
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,360
He notes the reason for which God sent him.

154
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:21,839
He says in verse number seven,

155
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,759
and God sent me before you, why?

156
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:29,160
To preserve you a posterity in the earth,

157
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,240
and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

158
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,919
God knew that there was going to be a great famine

159
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,080
that he was going to send.

160
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,520
He knew God is the one that revealed to Pharaoh

161
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,960
through the dreams about the great harvest

162
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,399
and about the great famine that would come.

163
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:48,960
And we find that God, in advance of revealing

164
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,600
any of that to Pharaoh,

165
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,360
we find that God had already placed Joseph in Egypt.

166
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,559
Now understand with me that the circumstances

167
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,399
by which Joseph got to Egypt may not be very favorable.

168
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:05,839
We can look at the things that he dealt with,

169
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,639
and we can see what's taking place.

170
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,679
But I would submit to you this evening

171
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,919
that as we look at our own lives,

172
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:14,639
and as we understand Joseph speaking here,

173
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,399
and all the things that he had dealt with

174
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,960
and that he had experienced,

175
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,240
yet he's able to see God at work.

176
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,520
And I wonder this evening, as we evaluate our lives,

177
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,240
as we begin to take inventory in our lives,

178
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,839
do we understand the providence of God?

179
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,679
Do we understand that God is a sovereign God,

180
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:42,039
that God has a plan that is beyond you and beyond me,

181
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:44,800
it's beyond our ability to fully comprehend,

182
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,080
and how God can move, and how God can work.

183
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,039
And we find that when things that happen in our lives

184
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,960
that are less than desirable,

185
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,360
when we understand that our God is sovereign,

186
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,199
and that our God has allowed it,

187
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,399
and that our God has a plan,

188
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:04,839
then we can have joy, and we can serve,

189
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,320
and we can see God do what he plans to do.

190
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,500
But at times in our lives,

191
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,000
when those circumstances are less than desirable,

192
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,240
when the pathway is difficult,

193
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,920
and there's great turmoil and challenges,

194
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,480
we can respond to that with great anger,

195
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,880
and we can be bitter, and we can be hurt,

196
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,359
and we can respond in such a way

197
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:31,760
that we're no longer usable for the Lord,

198
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,880
to fulfill what he desires to fulfill.

199
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,799
And we need to be careful with that,

200
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,100
because it's very easy as human beings,

201
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,600
when we deal with adversity and difficulty,

202
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,359
it's easy for us to react and to respond inappropriately.

203
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:50,760
It's very easy for us to get bitter, and to get upset,

204
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,239
and to say why, and this isn't fair, and life isn't,

205
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:57,799
how many times have you heard people say life isn't fair?

206
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,920
I'm saying tonight, how many times have you heard

207
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,799
God's people say life isn't fair?

208
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,679
That's a bad perspective.

209
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:08,399
See, as we understand the providence of God,

210
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,720
as we understand the sovereignty of God,

211
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,239
if I could use an illustration this evening,

212
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:14,959
and I in no way, shape, or form,

213
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,399
I wanna preface it by saying in no way, shape, or form

214
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,799
do I intend for it to have any lack of reverence.

215
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:25,200
Our God is a thrice holy God, he sits on his throne,

216
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,760
the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

217
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,920
But if I could use an illustration this evening

218
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,880
that would help us maybe, when we consider the things

219
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,160
that happen in our lives, even as we look at Joseph here,

220
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,920
as he reveals his perspective,

221
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,799
and as he says to his brothers

222
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,880
that it was God who sent him to Egypt,

223
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,519
I would say this, the things that happen in your life,

224
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,000
the things that happen in my life,

225
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,160
what happened in Joseph's life

226
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,200
has to receive the approval of God.

227
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,760
It has to go past, quote, unquote, his desk,

228
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,279
if I could use that analogy or illustration tonight.

229
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,040
Now, I understand God doesn't have a desk in heaven,

230
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,279
I understand that, and I don't mean to be irreverent

231
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,679
in any way, shape, or form,

232
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,440
but what I'm saying is that

233
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,239
it goes through God's approval process.

234
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:16,160
God has allowed it, and when God has allowed it,

235
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,079
God has a purpose in it, and God's purpose is greater

236
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:24,359
than anything we could fully comprehend.

237
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,600
See, God's purpose being accomplished

238
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,160
is more important than my comfort or than your comfort.

239
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:32,559
Amen?

240
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,480
See, we live in an era in biblical Christianity

241
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,559
that is unlike any other era of Christian history.

242
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,679
If you look at Christian history,

243
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:48,040
if you study biblical Christian history,

244
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:53,040
you find that it is full of persecution and hardship

245
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,239
and all of those things, and what's born out of that

246
00:16:57,239 --> 00:16:59,359
is the advancement of the church,

247
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:00,839
the advancement of the kingdom,

248
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:02,640
the advancement of the gospel,

249
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,559
the way, do you know how we got our Bibles

250
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,279
that we hold in our hand this evening?

251
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,839
Do you know how many people died

252
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,399
so that we could have a Bible?

253
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,880
I mean, it was wrought with persecution and with difficulty,

254
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,040
but we find that through it, God was working

255
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:22,040
and God was reaching the plan and the goal that he had,

256
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,559
and we find that for us this evening

257
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,799
in this era of really comfort and ease,

258
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:30,559
things don't go our way, it gets a little sideways,

259
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,079
and all of a sudden, we have this view of God doesn't know,

260
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,640
God has forgotten me, woe is me,

261
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:39,679
I can't, no, no, God's still in control,

262
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,920
God still has a plan, and I would say this,

263
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,799
God's plan is perfect,

264
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,000
and this perspective that Joseph has

265
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,359
is a perspective that is beyond himself,

266
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:56,399
it is a perspective that sees the glory of God,

267
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:59,119
he says that God sent me with a purpose

268
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,760
to preserve you a posterity.

269
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,480
Notice we understand the line of Messiah,

270
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,440
and you begin to consider even how it's woven

271
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,760
in this portion of Scripture

272
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,119
and how God was providentially sending someone ahead

273
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,279
that would preserve that life in the Messianic line,

274
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:22,000
it's amazing, and ultimately,

275
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,720
often what happens in our lives,

276
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,119
and it's amazing how many times this might have to happen

277
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,720
before we truly learn it,

278
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,159
is that we look back at our life and we say,

279
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:33,979
oh, that's what God was doing.

280
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:38,780
In the midst of it, we may not have had that perspective

281
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,619
that we see here of Joseph, that God's at work,

282
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:43,900
God's up to something, I don't know what God's doing,

283
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,659
but I'm trusting him, I know that he is able,

284
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,340
and I believe this evening

285
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,900
that Joseph understood the providence of God,

286
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,380
hold your place here and look quickly

287
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,020
at Philippians chapter number one,

288
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,059
Paul too understood this, in fact, he mentioned,

289
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:00,419
we'll look at Philippians one,

290
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,179
but in 2 Corinthians four,

291
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:04,559
he talked about having an eternal perspective

292
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,780
and not a temporal perspective

293
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,760
and understanding the plan of God,

294
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,960
but notice how he says it here

295
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,020
in Philippians chapter number one,

296
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,739
he's writing to these believers at the church at Philippi,

297
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,340
by the way, a church that was started

298
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,179
during the second missionary journey,

299
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:23,820
wrought with great persecution and difficulty,

300
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,460
and we find that Paul understood a truth,

301
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,099
the same truth that we're speaking of here this evening

302
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:33,020
about the providence of God and having that perspective,

303
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,619
but notice how Paul says it in Philippians 1, 12,

304
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,859
but I would, ye should understand, brethren,

305
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:44,460
who does Paul want to understand?

306
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,460
The church at Philippi,

307
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,760
he wants the believers at Philippi to understand this truth

308
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,859
that he himself has already understood,

309
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:55,820
Paul has already gained this perspective in his life,

310
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,580
he already understands this,

311
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,179
but he wants the believers to grasp.

312
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:03,679
He grasps this concept and He says to them,

313
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,099
the things that happened unto Me.

314
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:08,959
Now, we don't have time this evening

315
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,039
to discuss what all those things are,

316
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,679
but if you know even a little bit

317
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,179
about the life of Paul,

318
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,079
when he simply says the things that happened unto Me,

319
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:19,699
that's a lot.

320
00:20:19,699 --> 00:20:22,039
A lot of adversity, a lot of difficulty,

321
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:26,399
a lot of persecution.

322
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:30,139
Notice what he says.

323
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:32,859
He's fallen out rather unto the

324
00:20:32,859 --> 00:20:36,959
furtherance of the Gospel.

325
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:38,699
Where's Paul writing from

326
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:41,659
when he writes the book of Philippians?

327
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:44,339
He's writing from jail.

328
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:45,719
He's writing from jail.

329
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:47,979
They knew that. They were aware of that.

330
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:50,499
If you look at the end of the book,

331
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,819
he says they of Caesar's household greet you.

332
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,099
I believe that as you connect the dots there,

333
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:57,979
there were people in Caesar's household

334
00:20:57,979 --> 00:21:00,659
that heard the Gospel and got saved

335
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:04,699
as a result of Paul being imprisoned.

336
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:06,859
Now that's a perspective that understands

337
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:08,859
the providence of God.

338
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:11,499
That understands that God has a purpose.

339
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:15,619
The reality of God's providence is true

340
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:19,539
through every circumstance of your life and my life.

341
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,619
Our God is a good God.

342
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:23,859
And His goodness is not dependent

343
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:25,939
on your circumstances or mine.

344
00:21:25,939 --> 00:21:27,539
He's a good God.

345
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,619
And He has a purpose.

346
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:31,179
As we look here at the text of Scripture,

347
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:33,059
we see that Joseph reveals his person.

348
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,579
He reveals his perspective.

349
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:36,419
And then we notice that Joseph 3

350
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:39,659
reveals his plan.

351
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:40,939
He reveals his plan.

352
00:21:40,939 --> 00:21:43,699
Beginning in v. 9 and down through the end of the chapter,

353
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:45,779
we find that Joseph reveals his plan.

354
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:48,299
There's yet five years of famine that remain.

355
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,219
And so therefore, he has a plan

356
00:21:50,219 --> 00:21:52,739
that he's going to lay out for his brethren.

357
00:21:52,739 --> 00:21:54,579
He said this in v. 6,

358
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,059
for these two years hath the famine been in the land,

359
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:58,499
and yet there are five years

360
00:21:58,499 --> 00:22:00,819
in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.

361
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,219
And so notice in v. 9,

362
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:06,019
as he begins to outline the plan for his family,

363
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:06,859
he says this,

364
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,859
Haste ye, and go up to my father,

365
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:10,699
and say unto him,

366
00:22:10,699 --> 00:22:12,419
Thus saith thy son Joseph,

367
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:15,339
God hath made me Lord of all Egypt.

368
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:17,699
Come down unto me, tarry not.

369
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:19,779
Now that's a great greeting

370
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:23,699
that they are really commanded to give to Jacob.

371
00:22:23,699 --> 00:22:26,219
Go to the land of Goshen

372
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:28,659
and tell my father I'm alive.

373
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:30,419
Can you imagine?

374
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:33,099
In v. 10, and obviously in v. 9, he says,

375
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:34,579
Haste ye, do it quickly.

376
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:37,859
V. 10, and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen,

377
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:39,579
and thou shalt,

378
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:40,939
so there to go there,

379
00:22:40,939 --> 00:22:42,139
dwell in the land of Goshen,

380
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:44,099
and thou shalt be near unto me,

381
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:45,179
thou and thy children,

382
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:46,259
and thy children's children,

383
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:47,659
and thy flocks, and thy herds,

384
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,099
and all that thou hast,

385
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:51,259
and there will I nourish thee.

386
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:55,179
So his plan is that they would come back from Canaan,

387
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:58,339
and they would come back into Goshen,

388
00:22:58,339 --> 00:22:59,739
and that he would,

389
00:22:59,739 --> 00:23:04,019
Joseph says, I will nourish thee.

390
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:05,699
For yet there are five years of famine,

391
00:23:05,699 --> 00:23:07,579
lest thou and thy household,

392
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:10,539
and all that thou hast, come to poverty.

393
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:13,500
Behold, your eyes see in the eyes of my brother Benjamin,

394
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,419
that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.

395
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:20,099
And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt,

396
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:22,019
and of all that ye have seen.

397
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:25,179
And ye shall haste, and bring down my father hither.

398
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:27,179
And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck,

399
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:29,179
and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck.

400
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:31,579
Moreover, he kissed all his brethren,

401
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:32,859
and wept upon them,

402
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:35,819
and after that his brethren talked with him.

403
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:38,939
The fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house,

404
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:41,379
saying, Joseph's brethren are come.

405
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:42,699
And it pleased Pharaoh well,

406
00:23:42,699 --> 00:23:43,979
and his servants."

407
00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:47,739
Notice that now as Joseph has given this plan,

408
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:50,539
he's revealed that he's there to go back to his father,

409
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,659
to declare that Joseph is alive,

410
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:54,299
and then come back to the land,

411
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,859
and that Joseph would nourish him, do it with haste.

412
00:23:56,859 --> 00:23:59,139
But now we find beginning in verse 17,

413
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:01,459
the provision that is given,

414
00:24:01,459 --> 00:24:03,939
the provision really for the journey.

415
00:24:03,939 --> 00:24:06,539
What an amazing blessing.

416
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:09,419
In verse 17, Pharaoh said unto Joseph,

417
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:11,739
Joseph didn't have to go ask Pharaoh,

418
00:24:11,739 --> 00:24:12,939
God was at work,

419
00:24:12,939 --> 00:24:14,779
and Pharaoh says to Joseph,

420
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:16,699
say unto thy brethren,

421
00:24:16,699 --> 00:24:17,699
this do ye,

422
00:24:17,699 --> 00:24:19,459
lay your beast and go,

423
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,500
get you unto the land of Canaan,

424
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,539
and take your father and your households,

425
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:24,619
and come unto me,

426
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:27,059
and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt,

427
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:29,100
and ye shall eat the fat of the land.

428
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,779
Now thou art commanded this do ye,

429
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:34,139
take you wagons out of the land of Egypt

430
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,940
for your little ones and for your wives,

431
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,859
and bring your father and come.

432
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:39,660
Also regard not your stuff,

433
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,859
for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.

434
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:44,820
The children of Israel did so,

435
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,539
and Joseph gave them wagons

436
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:48,100
according to the commandment of Pharaoh,

437
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,019
and gave them provision for the way.

438
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:55,259
To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment,

439
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:59,299
but to Benjamin he gave 300 pieces of silver

440
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:01,820
and five changes of raiment.

441
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,820
To his father he sent after this manner

442
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,299
10 asses laden with the good things of Egypt,

443
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:09,179
and 10 she-asses laden with corn and bread and meat

444
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:10,619
for his father by the way.

445
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:12,899
So he sent his brethren away,

446
00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:14,100
and they departed.

447
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,940
And he said unto them,

448
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,380
see that you fall not out by the way.

449
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,940
Don't get in a fight along the way,

450
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,539
make sure you fulfill what I've given you to fulfill.

451
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:24,820
The Bible says in verse 25,

452
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,579
and they went up out of Egypt

453
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:28,739
and came into the land of Canaan

454
00:25:28,739 --> 00:25:30,899
unto Jacob their father.

455
00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:32,739
I want you to think just for a moment,

456
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:37,699
this great group of young men that are traveling,

457
00:25:37,699 --> 00:25:39,419
older men really at this time in their lives,

458
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:40,500
but they're traveling,

459
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,059
that they have these wagons,

460
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:43,259
they have all these goods,

461
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:44,940
all of this that's been sent,

462
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,579
and we find that Jacob,

463
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:50,220
as he was no doubt anxiously awaiting their return,

464
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,059
why was he anxiously awaiting their return?

465
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:54,459
Well he wanted to know if Benjamin was coming back.

466
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:56,179
Remember before he gave approval,

467
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,179
he's concerned about Benjamin.

468
00:25:58,179 --> 00:25:59,419
I've already lost one son,

469
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:00,380
and now this one,

470
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,419
and it's gonna take me down to the grave,

471
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:05,619
and I believe that Jacob was anxiously awaiting.

472
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:08,739
And he sees this host.

473
00:26:08,739 --> 00:26:10,500
He sees these wagons.

474
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,820
I mean they're coming back with more

475
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,539
than they went out with.

476
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:16,299
And maybe there's a level of excitement,

477
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:18,699
maybe there's a level of uncertainty,

478
00:26:18,699 --> 00:26:20,459
and he's inquisitive,

479
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:21,299
what's going on?

480
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:24,220
And we find that the Bible says in verse 26,

481
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,699
and they told him,

482
00:26:25,699 --> 00:26:29,699
notice Joseph is yet alive.

483
00:26:29,699 --> 00:26:31,220
Can you imagine?

484
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,940
I mean I can't even imagine Jacob hearing those words.

485
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:40,259
Joseph is yet alive.

486
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:41,539
You ever hear somebody tell you something

487
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:42,940
and you can't believe it?

488
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,059
You say, I don't believe that.

489
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:46,739
I mean I'm not saying you're lying to me,

490
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,139
it's just hard for me to believe.

491
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:49,940
You've been in that situation.

492
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,579
And here the Bible says that they say to Jacob,

493
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:55,660
Joseph is yet alive,

494
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,419
and he is governor over all the land of Egypt,

495
00:26:58,419 --> 00:26:59,579
and Jacob's heart,

496
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:00,419
what does it do?

497
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:01,779
It says it fainted,

498
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:03,820
for he believed them not.

499
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:11,299
Jacob was convinced that Joseph was dead.

500
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:13,459
Long ago,

501
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,339
these same boys bring a coat.

502
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:22,179
And they said, do you know whose this is?

503
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:24,500
They bring it after they dip it in blood.

504
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:29,619
And Jacob says, it's my son's.

505
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,699
An evil beast hath devoured him.

506
00:27:34,699 --> 00:27:35,739
He's dead.

507
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:37,299
I mean that's what he believes.

508
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:41,619
And now these same boys are coming back saying,

509
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:42,979
he's alive.

510
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:44,579
Can you imagine?

511
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:47,579
I mean the situation,

512
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:49,820
the scene that's here is amazing.

513
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,100
It says in verse 27,

514
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:55,500
and they told him all the words of Joseph.

515
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,779
We see submission and obedience to the plan

516
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:00,259
as Joseph outlined there.

517
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:02,899
He revealed his person, his perspective,

518
00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:05,139
but then he gives them a plan and they carry it out.

519
00:28:05,739 --> 00:28:08,059
And it says that they, these brothers,

520
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:09,699
they tell Jacob, their father,

521
00:28:09,699 --> 00:28:11,220
all the words of Joseph,

522
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,380
which he had said unto them.

523
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,019
And when he saw the wagons,

524
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:16,019
which Joseph had sent to carry him,

525
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:19,820
the spirit of Jacob, their father, revived.

526
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,019
He sees the evidence.

527
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:23,419
It says that his heart fainted,

528
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:24,380
for he believed them not.

529
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,339
Verse 26, he hears their words,

530
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:28,059
but then he sees all the wagons.

531
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:31,899
And it says that the spirit of Jacob there is revived.

532
00:28:31,899 --> 00:28:34,380
And notice in verse 28 what he says.

533
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:36,820
It is enough.

534
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,899
Joseph, my son, is yet alive.

535
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:44,260
I will go and see him before I die.

536
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,580
Next week, actually in two weeks,

537
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,859
we'll look at chapter 46

538
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:53,539
and see that journey that Jacob takes down to Egypt

539
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:55,500
and the opportunity that he has

540
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,260
to have a reunion with his son.

541
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:00,219
I mean, what a wonderful passage of Scripture.

542
00:29:00,219 --> 00:29:03,500
But this evening as we look at Genesis chapter 45

543
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:05,500
and we see the historical account,

544
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,700
we see what happens.

545
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,219
And Joseph makes himself known to his brethren.

546
00:29:10,219 --> 00:29:11,460
He reveals his person.

547
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,460
He reveals a plan.

548
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,339
But I want you to think about that middle part

549
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:17,419
of the message this evening

550
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:20,179
when Joseph reveals his perspective.

551
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:22,099
And I wonder this evening,

552
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:23,940
what's our perspective in life?

553
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,979
What's our perspective in life?

554
00:29:26,979 --> 00:29:30,059
Do we truly believe that God is sovereign?

555
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,820
Do we truly believe in the providence of God,

556
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,380
that God has a plan,

557
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,580
that everything that happens in your life

558
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,580
and in my life has a purpose,

559
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,299
that God is the one who allows it?

560
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:45,020
You can read in the book of Job,

561
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:49,979
Satan had parameters by which he was bound.

562
00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:50,820
Why?

563
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,859
Because God is sovereign.

564
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:55,859
And God is all-powerful.

565
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:58,059
And we may have some things that happen in our life

566
00:29:58,059 --> 00:29:59,460
that we may not understand,

567
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,460
but the reality is that God is all-powerful.

568
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,200
is that there's enough that we understand about who God is

569
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,580
that it should shape our perspective.

570
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:12,300
And I cannot focus on the little that I don't understand,

571
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,340
I must focus on the much that I do understand.

572
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,340
And when I understand that God is good

573
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:22,880
and that God has a plan and that God always does what's best,

574
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,800
and I take that perspective that even in the midst

575
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,300
of a great turmoil tragedy, I can have that perspective

576
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,340
and I can say, as Joseph said,

577
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,720
if we were to deal with the same circumstances,

578
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,300
you didn't send me here, God did, God did.

579
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,560
That's powerful.

580
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,060
We serve a great God.

581
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,580
And he knows everything about your life and my life.

582
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,220
He has a plan for us.

583
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,180
And everything that happens receives his approval.

584
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,440
And we ought to rejoice in that.

585
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,500
And next time we deal with it,

586
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,660
listen, it's not just the good things that we say,

587
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,040
oh, look at God's goodness.

588
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,460
No, no, in everything, God is good.

589
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,020
And he has a plan and he has a purpose.

590
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:09,220
I hope that our perspective, as we look at Genesis 45,

591
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,660
would be shaped to see the providence of God.

592
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,480
Let's pray.

593
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,900
Father, we love you.

594
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,980
We thank you for loving us.

595
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,480
We thank you for the opportunity to study your word.

596
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,740
We thank you for the passage of scripture.

597
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,500
We thank you for the perspective of Joseph.

598
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,660
And God, I pray that you'd help us

599
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,060
to have a biblical perspective.

600
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,100
Help us, Lord, to see your hand at work in our lives

601
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,380
through every circumstance.

602
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,340
Help us, Lord, to focus on that.

603
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,140
And, Lord, to trust you.

604
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,180
I pray that you'd move and work in hearts and lives

605
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,420
as only you can.

606
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,340
We'll thank you for it.

607
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,340
In Christ's name we pray.
