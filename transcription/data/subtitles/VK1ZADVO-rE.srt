1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
of Acts. I'm so thankful for this book. God has given us the Bible, the Word of God. He's given

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,439
us the Book of Acts. And really, as we study through and read the Book of Acts, what an

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:15,920
exciting book it is, and to see how that God is working through His servants. And I'm thankful

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:22,079
that God is still using His people today, aren't you? And what a blessing to be His servants. What

5
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:27,920
a blessing to be used to bring honor and glory to His name. It's not about us. It's not about

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,080
our name, our reputation. It's all about lifting up the Lord Jesus Christ, that He would be

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,639
exalted, that all the world would know that He is the Savior of the world. And I'm so thankful for

8
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:46,240
the privilege of reading this book. It tells us, really, the record of the Gospel advancing during

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:54,080
the first century. It begins in the first chapter, recording for us the ascension of Jesus Christ.

10
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,599
And of course, as you end the Book of Acts, you find that the Apostle Paul is in Rome on house

11
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:05,760
arrest. And those events that are covered in the Book of Acts are approximately 30 years of church

12
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,360
history. You think about the 30 years that are condensed into 28 chapters of the Book of Acts,

13
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,720
and it is a power-packed, action-filled book with the advancement of the Gospel. The first seven

14
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,319
chapters of the book roughly record about three years before we get to Acts chapter number eight,

15
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,720
the text of Scripture in which we'll be looking at specifically this morning. But I want to remind

16
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,839
you that not only in Acts 1 did we read of the ascension of Jesus Christ, but we know that

17
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:39,680
they're there in Jerusalem. The Bible tells us in verse number 14 of Acts 1, these all continued

18
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,559
with one accord in prayer and supplication with the women and Mary, the mother of Jesus,

19
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:49,120
and with the brethren. It tells us in verse number 15 that the number of names together

20
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,879
were about 120. And so you see that they're gathered there, they're obeying what the Lord

21
00:01:54,879 --> 00:02:01,279
Jesus Christ had told them in the beginning of Acts 1. They're there in Jerusalem, they're praying,

22
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,199
they're just having fellowship one with another. And then we understand that we come to the second

23
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:11,759
chapter. As we come to Acts chapter number two, God gives us the record. We often refer to the

24
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,880
day of Pentecost, and you read about the day of Pentecost, and Peter, as he stands up, he's filled

25
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,839
with the power of the Holy Spirit of God, and he preaches with great boldness and with great power.

26
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:27,440
And we see that the Bible tells us that there were 3,000 that were added to the church. Look

27
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,520
in Acts 2 in verse number 41, it says, then they that gladly received his word were baptized,

28
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:41,199
and the same day there were added unto them about 3,000 souls. Now in Acts 1, we read that the

29
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:46,720
Bible told us that there were about 120 of them, and now at the end of the day of Pentecost,

30
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,279
in Acts chapter number two, there are 3,000 that were added. Isn't that amazing? It's miraculous

31
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:58,240
to see the way in which God is working. It tells us, and they, if you read verse number 42,

32
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,360
so not only the 120 that were there in Acts 1, but now these 3,000, they continued

33
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,960
steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and in fellowship and in breaking of bread and in

34
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:15,199
prayers. Isn't that exciting? And I like that it says that they continued steadfastly, and what a

35
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:22,639
blessing to see the desire of these new converts growing and learning the truth of God's word and

36
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:28,559
the purpose that God has saved them for, and just a joy. We come to Acts 3, we read of a great miracle

37
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:32,720
that took place, and it was the lame man that was healed. Peter and John, of course, are going to

38
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:40,320
the temple. They see that lame man, and we find that Peter says, look at us, and he looks, and he

39
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,919
says this in verse number five, he gave unto them, expecting to receive something of them, and

40
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:51,440
Peter said, silver and gold have I none, but such as I have, give I thee in the name of Jesus Christ

41
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,399
of Nazareth, rise up and walk. And we find the Bible tells us in verse number eight that he,

42
00:03:56,399 --> 00:04:02,399
leaping up, stood and walked and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising

43
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:08,639
God. What a great day that was, and it says in verse number nine, and all the people saw him

44
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,960
walking and praising God. It's interesting because even in Acts chapter number four,

45
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:19,200
the religious leaders, the opposition to the disciples, to the apostles, they

46
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:26,160
notate that there was a miracle that took place, and they could not deny it, and these people saw

47
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,920
it, and it gave opportunity as they gathered on Solomon's porch. It gave opportunity for Peter to

48
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,239
preach. He preaches another message, and God moves, and God works, and it tells us in Acts 4,

49
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:44,399
in verse number four, how be it many of them which heard the word believed. Notice here, it says,

50
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:54,079
and the number of the men was about 5,000. We had 120 in Acts 1. They at Pentecost, 3,000.

51
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:02,559
Here in Acts 4, just the number of men, 5,000. Can you imagine? I mean, it's exciting what God is

52
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:07,839
doing and how God is moving, and we find, of course, that there's opposition that comes. They're told

53
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,959
in Acts chapter number four, after they're dealing with some persecution and what have you, they're

54
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,359
told not to speak in his name and so on and so forth, and we find that the Bible tells us that

55
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:22,720
they spoke the word of God with boldness. Look in verse number 29. This was their prayer after they

56
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,000
heard the threats of the religious leaders. It says in Acts 4 in verse 29, and now, Lord, behold

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,239
their threatenings, and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word.

58
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:39,279
And we need God's boldness to speak his word as we're filled with the power of the Holy Spirit

59
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,559
of God. The Bible tells us in verse number 31, and when they had prayed, the place was shaken,

60
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:48,559
where they were assembled together, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost. Notice what it

61
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:56,160
says, they spake the word of God with boldness. That was their prayer. You know, their prayer was

62
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:03,200
not, God, would you deal with these people that are threatening us? Would you deal with these

63
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:09,600
that are opposing your work? No, their prayer was, God, just give us boldness to do what you've

64
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,959
called us to do. And God gives them boldness, and the Bible tells us in verse number 32,

65
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:19,920
and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart, of one soul. Neither said any of them

66
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,320
that ought of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things common. As we

67
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,239
read verse 32, we read this word about multitude, and this multitude of people. You see the advancement

68
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:38,559
of the gospel. You come to the fifth chapter, and you read in verse number 14, the Bible tells us

69
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:45,839
here, and the believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes, both of men and women.

70
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,640
Multitudes. God's not even giving us a number at this point. He's saying multitudes, both of men

71
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:58,640
and women. He says in verse number 32, after they had been miraculously released from prison,

72
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,880
remember they had put them in prison to keep them from being able to speak, and God released them

73
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,640
miraculously from prison. And we find that in verse number 28, they're told that they had filled

74
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,040
Jerusalem with their doctrine. They say we ought to obey God rather than men in verse 29. And in

75
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:19,679
verse number 32, they say this, we are his witnesses of these things. This morning, we continue to be

76
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:24,959
his witnesses. It's our responsibility. He said in Acts 1 and verse number 8, and you shall receive

77
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,760
power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you, and you shall be witnesses unto me, both in

78
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,079
Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. And we find that still today,

79
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,600
even as the disciples embrace the responsibility that we are his witnesses, we too this morning

80
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,440
must embrace that responsibility that we are his witnesses. As the witnesses of the Lord Jesus

81
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:52,160
Christ, as his representatives, as the ambassadors, as we read in 2 Corinthians 5, we find in verse

82
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,959
number 42 of Acts 5, the Bible tells us this, and daily in the temple and in every house, they ceased

83
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:06,320
not to teach and preach Jesus Christ. This is exciting what's happening in the book of Acts.

84
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:14,399
We get to this portion of Scripture, and we read how that God is working and how God is moving,

85
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:20,320
and the attacks from the external are not being successful. There's some strife that's internal

86
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,799
in chapter number 6, but I want you to notice in verse number 7, the Bible says that the Word of

87
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:30,959
God increased, and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly, and a great

88
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:37,919
company of the priests were obedient to the faith. The Word of God increased, the number of the

89
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:44,559
disciples multiplied in Jerusalem, notice it says greatly. You come to Acts chapter number 7,

90
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:50,320
and you read that as Stephen is preaching, and what a great message it is that he preaches,

91
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,919
you know that Stephen understood the truth of God's Word, and he's able to handle the Word of

92
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:01,599
God, and he's preaching a powerful message. And at the end of Acts chapter number 7, we read

93
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:06,640
that as Stephen is preaching, that these people are cut to the heart, and the Bible tells us that

94
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:14,719
he was stoned to death because of his preaching the opposition. We read of all of these events,

95
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:20,080
I very quickly went through several highlights from Acts 1 to Acts 7, to kind of bring us to

96
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,559
place in Acts chapter number 8, where we'll study this morning, to have an understanding of the

97
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:30,239
context and the timing of all that's taking place. And these seven chapters, Acts 1 through 7,

98
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:36,640
roughly record the first three years of the history of the church after the ascension of

99
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:45,039
Jesus Christ. And it was full with exciting growth, opportunities to see people saved,

100
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:50,239
and lives changed. We come to Acts chapter number 8, and the Bible says that Saul was consenting

101
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:56,559
unto his death, speaking of Stephen, in Acts 7. And at that time, there was a great persecution

102
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,840
against the church, which was at Jerusalem, and they were all scattered

103
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,520
abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria except the apostles. Devout men carried

104
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:11,760
Stephen to his burial and made great lamentation over him. As for Saul, he made havoc of the church,

105
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,520
entering into every house, and hailing men and women, committed them to prison. Therefore,

106
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,920
they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word." I preached a message this

107
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,840
morning from Acts 8, one through four. I took the title from verse number four,

108
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:34,800
went everywhere preaching the word. These events that lead up to this passage of Scripture remind

109
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,920
us of how God was fulfilling the promise that he had given to the disciples. You remember that the

110
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,200
Lord Jesus Christ asked the question of the disciples, who is it that men say that I am?

111
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,840
And as that question was asked of the disciples, the disciples respond and say, well, some say

112
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,280
that you're John the Baptist, some say that you're one of the prophets, Jeremiah, Isaiah,

113
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:59,280
one of the prophets. And Jesus then says, but whom say ye that I am? And we know that Peter

114
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,320
stands up with great boldness and authority, and he declares, he says, thou art the Christ,

115
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,920
the Son of the living God. And we find that Jesus responds to him, and he talks how that God

116
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,480
revealed that truth to him. But then he gives them this truth. He says that he would build

117
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,480
his church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And we find that as that

118
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,600
promise was given, that we see in the early stages of church history in the book of Acts,

119
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,600
as God is recording for us the events that we've quickly gone over, we see how that the

120
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:40,640
Lord Jesus Christ is fulfilling that promise to build his church. From then until now,

121
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,800
Jesus continues to build his church. And I am so thankful, as we prayed this morning,

122
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,040
both Dean and I here at the platform, we prayed thanking God for the church, the body of believers,

123
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,320
the called-out assembly, those of us that have voluntarily joined ourselves together,

124
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,600
those that have been born again, church members have to be saved, and you're saved and you're

125
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,760
baptized, you join together for the purpose of carrying out the Great Commission. As a church,

126
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,280
we must never lose our focus as to why we're here. We're not a club. We're not just an organization

127
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:22,240
that just gets together for some, you know, mundane type of activity. We are here for a purpose,

128
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,680
and it is His purpose. We have the responsibility not only to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ in all

129
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,840
that we say and do, but it's our responsibility to evangelize the world. And here in Acts 8,

130
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,280
as we see the church in Jerusalem growing in those first seven chapters, and we see all of the

131
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:46,160
exciting things that are taking place, it starts with 120, and there are 3,000 and 5,000 in multitude

132
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,920
and multitudes, and the Bible tells us that the number increased greatly there at the church

133
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:59,280
at Jerusalem. The estimates of the attendance, the membership of the church at Jerusalem vary

134
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:06,560
greatly by scholars of yesteryear, but it's in the thousands of people, tens of thousands.

135
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:14,960
God was working. God was moving. And then we come to Acts 8. We read about this great persecution,

136
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,160
but we read about this scattering, and as we read about the scattering, the Bible says that

137
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,080
they went everywhere preaching the Word. This morning, I want you to consider just two thoughts.

138
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,360
Number one, the reason for the scattering. The reason for the scattering. As we look at this

139
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,840
passage of Scripture, there are two reasons that jump off the page to us. One is the reason for

140
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,800
the scattering, and the other is the reason for the persecution. And as we look at these two reasons that God

141
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,600
provides us with, we understand that we serve a sovereign God, and He's in control of all things.

142
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,040
And we find here in Acts 8 and verse number 1 that the Bible tells us the first of these reasons

143
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,880
for this scattering that we read of here in Acts 8 is that there was a great persecution.

144
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:04,400
That word persecution, it means the infliction of pain, punishment, or death upon others unjustly,

145
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:11,920
particularly for adhering to a religious creed or mode of worship. I want you to notice that

146
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,600
the Bible says that at that time, at the time of all of these great events that are taking place,

147
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,520
and all of the advancement, the church growing, God moving, God working, that the Bible says

148
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:29,440
there arose a great persecution against the church, which was at Jerusalem. You understand

149
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,680
this morning that even as we started all the way back in Acts chapter number 4, that that's really

150
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,400
when the persecution began. We find that that's when the persecution began. That's when the

151
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,360
threats were given. That's when they were imprisoned. In Acts chapter number 5, they were

152
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,240
beaten, and they were threatened. And you read all of this, but now we come to Acts 8, and we read

153
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:57,200
that it's described as being a great persecution. Through all of the attempts in Acts 4, 5, 6, and

154
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:03,520
7, you read of all of the attacks, and now it kind of reaches this pinnacle point, if you will,

155
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,640
and it's called a great persecution, and it's against the church that was at Jerusalem,

156
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,280
and because of this great persecution, it says that they were scattered abroad.

157
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,680
Not only do we read about the great persecution in verse number 1, but we read about Saul in

158
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,280
particular. We know that in Acts chapter 9, Saul is going to be transformed by the power of the

159
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:30,480
Lord Jesus Christ. He's going to be saved on the road to Damascus, but at this particular time,

160
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:37,840
Paul is Saul, and he's not yet been saved. We find that Saul is making havoc of the church.

161
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,160
You see in verse number 3, it says, "...as for Saul, he made havoc of the church,

162
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,920
entering into every house, and hailing men and women, committed them to prison." I believe that

163
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,120
in Acts chapter number 7, as Paul was there, it says that he was consenting unto his death in

164
00:15:53,120 --> 00:16:00,960
Acts 8, verse number 1. It does tell us this also, that in verse number 59 and 60, it says that,

165
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:06,160
"...and they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. And he

166
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,560
kneeled down and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had

167
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:19,360
said this, he fell asleep." But notice in verse number 58 that the witnesses laid down their

168
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:27,920
clothes at a young man's feet whose name, his name was Saul. And Saul observed the events this day.

169
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,360
He heard the preaching of Stephen. He heard how Stephen was able to take the truth of the Old

170
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,800
Testament and handle it so wisely and present the truth of the gospel. And Saul heard this,

171
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:45,200
and no doubt he was under great, just dealing with the preaching of the Word of God, and he's

172
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:51,840
dealing with the power of God working in his heart and his life. And as he's hearing this, and

173
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:57,200
just as these other men that they hear and they begin to oppose, and they're going to stone Stephen,

174
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,560
that here Paul is hearing this, Saul is his name, he's not yet converted, and he's hearing this. And

175
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:09,600
now how does he respond to this? What he's dealing with, he responds with increasing his attack

176
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:19,200
against the people of God. He's fighting. He's resisting. The Bible tells us that he

177
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:27,040
made havoc of the church. It means to treat shamefully, to ravage, to devastate, to ruin,

178
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:33,200
waste, or destroy. He was entering into every house. Can you imagine?

179
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:43,280
He's committing these to prison. And we read the reason for this scattering in Acts chapter 8,

180
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,640
and we think about the people of God and what they're enduring and how God was fulfilling His

181
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:55,280
purpose, however. Because as we see the reason that is mentioned in verse 1 and 3, we understand

182
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,760
that God is in control of all things. You know, there's nothing that happens to you in your life,

183
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:09,040
or me in my life, that God does not allow. This morning, as we look at this passage of Scripture,

184
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,640
we could ask ourselves this question, could God have prevented this persecution?

185
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,800
Sure He could. He could have kept these things from happening. He could have prevented

186
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,560
all of this from taking place. But we know that as He's dealing here and He's allowing

187
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,360
these things to happen, we find that He's fulfilling His purpose. So not only do we see

188
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:37,120
the reason for the scattering, but I want you to notice the result of the scattering.

189
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,720
As I think about the result of the scattering, it's mentioned simply in verse number 4,

190
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:49,840
therefore, they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the Word. The result of what

191
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,360
is recorded for us in verses 1 through 3, the result of this great persecution, the result of

192
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:01,200
Saul making havoc of the church, we find is that they that were scattered, these believers that were

193
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:07,680
in Jerusalem, they were scattered as a result of this persecution, as a result of this difficult

194
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,080
situation that they're dealing with, and they were scattered abroad, but they went everywhere

195
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,040
preaching the Word. I want to take you back to the book of Genesis just for a moment,

196
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:25,920
and go to Genesis chapter number 50. In Genesis chapter number 50, we know that Jacob has now

197
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,640
died, and we find that Joseph is there with his brethren. And it's interesting as we begin to

198
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,640
find what's taking place here, and as Joseph is revealing some truth to his brothers,

199
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,080
we find that God gives us a great principle here in this passage of Scripture. In fact,

200
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,880
in Genesis 50, we'll mention it, but in Genesis chapter number 45, we find that Joseph made this

201
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,440
known to his brothers when he first revealed himself. It was in that passage of Scripture

202
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,760
when he first revealed himself to his brothers, and he tells them this in Genesis

203
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,400
This is 45 and verse number five,

204
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,640
now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves

205
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,620
that you sold me hither.

206
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,160
Notice the perspective of Joseph,

207
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,160
for God did send me before you to preserve life.

208
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,560
Verse seven it says, and God sent me before you

209
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,260
to preserve you a posterity in the earth

210
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,800
and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

211
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,460
So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God.

212
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,100
Do you remember the circumstances

213
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,260
that led to Joseph coming to Egypt?

214
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,320
Could we not ask ourselves,

215
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,140
couldn't he got to Egypt a better way?

216
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,920
God's way is perfect, God makes no mistakes,

217
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,180
you believe that this morning?

218
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,180
God allowed those events to take place

219
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,500
in the life of Joseph to bring Joseph

220
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,260
to the place where he is in Genesis 45

221
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,300
when he makes himself known to his brothers

222
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,020
and he with very direct truth says to them,

223
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:06,420
it was not you that sent me hither, but God.

224
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,300
And in Genesis chapter number 50,

225
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,580
as his brothers come to him,

226
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,260
it begins as they are coming back from the burial

227
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,220
and all that took place.

228
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,820
And it says in verse number 15,

229
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,260
and when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead,

230
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,080
they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us

231
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,380
and will certainly requite us of all the evil

232
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,660
which we did unto him.

233
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,700
So what did they do?

234
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,300
They sent a messenger unto Joseph

235
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,180
and here's what they told the messenger to take this message

236
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,980
thy father did command before he died saying,

237
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,580
so shall you say unto Joseph,

238
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,700
forgive I pray thee now the trespass of thy brethren

239
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,940
and their sin, for they did unto the evil

240
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,020
and now we pray thee,

241
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,620
forgive the trespass of thy servants

242
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,460
of the God of thy father.

243
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,800
Notice the response of Joseph,

244
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,440
he wept when they spake unto him.

245
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,260
He wept.

246
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,500
Joseph had already forgiven his brothers.

247
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,380
Joseph already knew that he was in the place

248
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,540
that God had for him.

249
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,300
And God just used his brothers to get him to that place,

250
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,100
but it was God that was moving him there.

251
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,860
Verse 18, this is his brethren also went

252
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,860
and fell down before his face.

253
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,460
They said, behold, we be thy servants.

254
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,220
And Joseph said unto them, fear not,

255
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,460
for am I in the place of God?

256
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,220
He says this in verse number 20,

257
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,620
but as for you, ye thought evil against me,

258
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,420
but God meant it unto good to bring to pass

259
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:38,420
as it is this day to save much people alive.

260
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,860
I think about this principle from Genesis chapter number 50

261
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,740
and as this principle is revealed to us

262
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,420
in the life of Joseph in Genesis 50,

263
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,420
really 45 and 50,

264
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,940
we find that it's a principle that we're able to see

265
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,740
in other portions of scripture.

266
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,060
As we begin to read various accounts of people's lives,

267
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,300
you see the hand of God and how God is working.

268
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,900
And we find that in Genesis chapter number 45

269
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,740
and in Genesis chapter number 50,

270
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,980
when we read about the sovereignty of Almighty God

271
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,180
and his purposes being fulfilled,

272
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:15,580
we understand that then specifically in the life of Joseph,

273
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,140
God was moving and working for the purpose

274
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:22,100
of preservation of life through sustenance.

275
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,100
Remember, there was going to be a famine.

276
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,300
The dream was revealed.

277
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,940
There was no one that could interpret the dream to Pharaoh

278
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,940
and the butler and the baker,

279
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,860
they both had a dream the same night

280
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,500
and the butler, he hears his interpretation.

281
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,380
It's pretty positive.

282
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,980
He's gonna be restored his butlership

283
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,740
and the baker's like, well, I had a dream too.

284
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,380
Let me tell you about my dream.

285
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,260
It wasn't so good for the baker.

286
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,700
In three days, you're gonna be released too,

287
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,900
but you're gonna be put to death.

288
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,580
Right, that's what happens.

289
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,380
The butler's restored to his butlership

290
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,820
and a period of time passes two full years

291
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,260
according to the word of God

292
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,660
and the request that Joseph made to the butler

293
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,740
was remember me, but two years passed.

294
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,500
Joseph continues in prison and Pharaoh has a dream

295
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,780
and no one can interpret the dream.

296
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,220
The butler says, I remember.

297
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,740
You were angry with me and with the baker.

298
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,300
We're in war, we're in prison.

299
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,660
There's a man there in Hebrew.

300
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,619
He could interpret dreams and Joseph comes

301
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:20,380
and he says, it's God that gives the interpretation

302
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:24,380
just like Daniel and he gives the interpretation.

303
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,619
He talks about the famine, right?

304
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:26,900
There's gonna be seven years of plenty

305
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,460
and then there's gonna be seven years of famine.

306
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,820
He begins to give Pharaoh a plan.

307
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:35,300
He says, who else but you should run the show, so to speak.

308
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,700
The famine wasn't just in Egypt, it was all lands.

309
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,540
They came to Egypt to get food

310
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:48,860
and God had sent providentially Joseph ahead

311
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:54,619
to preserve life through food, through sustenance.

312
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:56,820
But I want you to understand that in a much greater way

313
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,020
in Acts chapter number eight, that this sending forth,

314
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,940
this scattering was not just the preservation of life

315
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,940
through sustenance, that this scattering

316
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,420
was the advancement of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

317
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,619
That we find that as God would allow this persecution,

318
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:16,339
that as God would allow Saul to cause havoc,

319
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,059
to make havoc of the church,

320
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:21,339
as God allowed this persecution to take place,

321
00:25:21,339 --> 00:25:23,339
that we find that it was the advancement

322
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:25,180
of the gospel of Jesus Christ,

323
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:28,779
which does not simply sustain life through physical food,

324
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:33,460
but it gives everlasting life, eternal life.

325
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,460
And what a blessing.

326
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,700
We find that our God is sovereign and our God is able.

327
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,059
And though the enemy desired, they sought to,

328
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:47,660
if I could use the terminology this morning,

329
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:52,500
they sought to stamp out biblical Christianity in Jerusalem

330
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,059
and all they did is spread the embers

331
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:58,540
of the fire of the gospel throughout the known world.

332
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,339
And what had been said of the church of Jesus Christ,

333
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:04,779
the church in Jerusalem as they're going forth

334
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:06,300
in those first three years,

335
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,740
what had been said of them in Acts five

336
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,100
in verse number 28 is this,

337
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,660
you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine.

338
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:19,300
Now that's commendable, is it not?

339
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,619
To have filled Jerusalem with their doctrine,

340
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:25,660
to have been so bold in giving the gospel of Jesus Christ

341
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,500
to go forth and to preach the word of God.

342
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,220
We read about the advancement, the growth of the church

343
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,100
and how it increased greatly.

344
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,020
And we see the growth of the church,

345
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,940
but they're only in Jerusalem.

346
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,300
And in Acts one in verse number eight,

347
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,779
Jerusalem wasn't the end point, it was the starting point.

348
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,860
Right?

349
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:49,860
And you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem,

350
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,740
the starting point where they were,

351
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:57,180
Judea, Samaria and the uttermost.

352
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,580
And so they weren't to stay in Jerusalem.

353
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,020
But the reality is that things were going really good

354
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,260
in Jerusalem, right?

355
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,140
Church is growing.

356
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,540
I mean, multitudes are being saved,

357
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,820
they're continuing steadfastly.

358
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,180
Yes, they dealt with some problems,

359
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,660
they dealt with some difficulties,

360
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,460
but God was working and God was moving.

361
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,380
But there was Judea and Samaria and the uttermost

362
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,420
that still had to be reached.

363
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,020
And so God would allow this persecution

364
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,339
in Acts chapter number eight

365
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:28,860
in order for the word of God to go forth.

366
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,260
And we find that as the enemy sought

367
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,420
to stamp out biblical Christianity,

368
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,580
that as we read in the passage of scripture

369
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,300
in Acts chapter number eight,

370
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,619
that they go scattered abroad.

371
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:41,779
Those that were scattered,

372
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:43,260
they went everywhere preaching the word.

373
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,700
Notice in verse number one,

374
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,540
when it speaks about this great persecution

375
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,380
against the church, which was at Jerusalem,

376
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,580
notice it says this at the end of verse number one,

377
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,260
and they were all scattered abroad

378
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,300
throughout the regions specifically mentioned,

379
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,779
Judea and Samaria.

380
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,500
Except the apostles, they stayed there in Jerusalem.

381
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,900
We understand even as you read about the council

382
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,660
in Jerusalem, as you come to Acts 15,

383
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,180
you understand that the church there in Jerusalem continued

384
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,380
and it was a good church, a thriving church,

385
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,660
but we find that these folks were scattered abroad.

386
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,220
And as they were scattered,

387
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,540
they went everywhere preaching the word.

388
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:25,260
I want you to turn to Acts chapter number 17, if you will.

389
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,100
I want you to read with me

390
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,059
as Paul now is going forth

391
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:35,619
and he was saved in Acts nine

392
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:37,900
and he's gone, completed one missionary journey.

393
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,780
Now on his second, he's going forth

394
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:45,380
and I mean, God is working, souls are being saved.

395
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,540
The Bible tells us in Acts 17 in verse number one,

396
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:51,900
now when they had passed through Epiphalus and Apollonia,

397
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,140
they came to Thessalonica,

398
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,700
where was a synagogue of the Jews.

399
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,859
And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them

400
00:28:57,859 --> 00:29:00,540
and three Sabbath days reasoned with them

401
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,100
out of the scriptures.

402
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,940
Says that he was opening and alleging

403
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,700
that Christ must needs have suffered

404
00:29:06,739 --> 00:29:08,380
and risen again from the dead

405
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,500
and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ.

406
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,460
And you read about the church in Thessalonica,

407
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,660
if you read the letters of first and second Thessalonians,

408
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:23,140
you read about a church that, man, they were on fire for God.

409
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,020
They'd been used mightily from that church.

410
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,619
And in this text of scripture, Acts 17,

411
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:32,340
Paul is there and he's preaching

412
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,859
and he's giving them the truth of the gospel.

413
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:36,140
It tells us in verse number four,

414
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,580
some of them believed and consorted with Paul and Silas

415
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,820
and of the devout Greeks, a great multitude

416
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,580
and of the chief women, not a few.

417
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:45,340
So there were some Jews that got saved

418
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,540
because he was there in the synagogue.

419
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,100
The Bible tells us that there were of the devout Greeks,

420
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,340
a great multitude of the chief women, not a few.

421
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,540
So there were many that got saved,

422
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,780
it says in verse number five,

423
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,100
but the Jews, which believed not, moved with envy,

424
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,900
took upon them certain lewd fellows of the base.

425
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,720
her sword, and gathered a company, and set all the city of an uproar, and assaulted the

426
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,040
house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people."

427
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,680
So you see the persecution continues.

428
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,760
And I want you to notice in verse number 6, it says, when they found them not, they drew

429
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,680
Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city.

430
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:26,640
Here's what they cry, "'These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also.'"

431
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,980
Until Acts 8, it was Jerusalem.

432
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:35,680
When you read Acts 2 through Acts 7, you read of Jerusalem and the work in the church in

433
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:42,120
Jerusalem, the growth of the church in Jerusalem, the persecution of the church at Jerusalem.

434
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,880
You have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine.

435
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,080
But when you come to Acts chapter number 17, after that scattering that we read of in Acts

436
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:55,680
8, and as they go to Samaria and to Judea, and they go, and the gospel continues to advance

437
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,520
through these missionary journeys that we read of with the Apostle Paul, you find that

438
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:05,080
these that are the opponents of the work of God, they come, and the accusation that they

439
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:11,080
bring is that these that have turned the world upside down are come hither also.

440
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:17,080
Isn't that a great result of the scattering that we read of in Acts 8, that now we begin

441
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,480
to look at the entirety of the book of Acts, and you begin to study through, and as you

442
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,360
read the epistles, and you read about the book of Ephesians, and the church at Ephesus,

443
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,520
you can go back to the book of Acts, and you can read how the gospel got to Ephesus.

444
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:35,000
You can read about the book of Philippians, and as you read the book of Philippians today,

445
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,560
man, this is exciting.

446
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,560
Where did this happen?

447
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,600
You go back to the book of Acts, and you read about the gospel coming to Philippi, and all

448
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,600
that takes place, and on, and on, and on, and you begin to see how God is working and

449
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,320
how God is moving.

450
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:55,720
And I would submit to you this morning that still today, God is at work.

451
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,160
God is able to save sinners.

452
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,320
Brianna sang about the greatest of all miracles when He saved me.

453
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,960
Listen, He's a wonderful Savior to me.

454
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,680
We sing that song, What a Great Song It Is, and He is a wonderful Savior to me.

455
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,640
But I understand this morning that there are a lot of lost people that need to know the

456
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,880
wonderful Savior, Jesus Christ.

457
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:21,360
As we think about the truth of the Word of God, and we begin to look at the responsibility

458
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,380
and looking at these believers in Acts chapter number 8, and they were scattered abroad because

459
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:31,400
of this persecution, because of the havoc that Saul was causing to them, because of

460
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:39,640
all of this difficulty, they're spread abroad, but they went everywhere preaching the Word.

461
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,800
You know that many of the places in which Paul went preaching the Word, he was met with

462
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,440
opposition.

463
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,240
In many of the cities that we read of during those missionary journeys, Paul was met with

464
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,080
fierce opposition.

465
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,560
We find that he's faced with that opposition, that he simply goes to the next town, he goes

466
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,480
to the next place, he goes to the next city, and what does he do?

467
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,200
He does the same thing that he did before.

468
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:10,040
He preaches the Word of God because of the Word of God that changes lives.

469
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:15,720
We think about the truth of God's Word this morning in our lives, and we begin to consider

470
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:22,100
the importance that we have to take the gospel to a lost and dying world.

471
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,000
As we make preparation for our missions conference, I mentioned it several weeks ago, if you go

472
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,640
over to our fellowship hall, Ron and Mady did some decorating before they went away

473
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,760
for this weekend.

474
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,720
And our theme for our conference this year is Go and Tell.

475
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,180
And I want you to just briefly look at Mark 5, just for a moment this morning.

476
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:48,080
Mark chapter number 5, this is where the theme, as I prayed and sought the Lord with regard

477
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:54,160
to a theme this year, this is the passage in which God has led me to, and I'm so thankful

478
00:33:54,160 --> 00:34:02,420
that God has given us not only the responsibility but the privilege of being His witnesses.

479
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,180
The privilege of going and telling.

480
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:09,960
Have you ever experienced something in your life physically, something temporal, something

481
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,420
that you experienced here upon this earth that you experienced that you just felt like

482
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:16,160
you had to tell somebody about?

483
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,760
Maybe you had a really good dinner somewhere.

484
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,760
I mean, it was just exceptional.

485
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,960
It was one of the best meals you've ever had.

486
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,920
You took your spouse out, you took your wife, fellas, you took her out for dinner, and you

487
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,400
went to this fantastic restaurant.

488
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,160
Man, it was just wonderful.

489
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,840
And you just, I mean, it was just a temporal thing.

490
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,120
It's nothing spiritual whatsoever, but it's just a temporal thing, and you feel like you

491
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:38,580
want to tell somebody about it.

492
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,700
I want you to understand this morning that the greatest thing that could ever happen

493
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:46,620
in somebody's life, if you're saved this morning, you've experienced that greatest thing.

494
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,140
Salvation, through the Lord Jesus Christ.

495
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:54,260
The man that we read of in Mark chapter number 5, we're familiar with the passage of Scripture.

496
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:58,580
I won't take time to develop all of it, but in this passage of Scripture, it's the maniac

497
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,580
from Gadara.

498
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,640
If you were to study the timeline of this particular miracle, you'll find that they

499
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,680
got into the ship so that they could pass over to the other side.

500
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,680
They encounter a great storm.

501
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,320
They're there in Gadara for the purpose, really singularly, of this man trusting Christ as

502
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,080
a Savior, because then they get back on the boat and go back to the other side.

503
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,080
Why?

504
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:23,820
Because the people say, go.

505
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:28,760
But this man, this man that was, he was demon-possessed.

506
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,900
You read about all that took place, and you read about how the Lord Jesus Christ healed

507
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:39,220
this man, and obviously this man is transformed by the gospel, the power of the Lord Jesus

508
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,220
Christ.

509
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,460
It tells us in verse number 15, and they come to Jesus and see him that was possessed with

510
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:50,220
the devil and had the legion sitting and clothed in his right mind, and they were afraid.

511
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,620
This is the people of the town.

512
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:56,860
We find that this man that is described earlier in the passage of Scripture with this demon-possession

513
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,120
and all that was taking place and all the characteristics of this man, now the Bible

514
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,760
tells us that he's clothed and he's in his right mind and he's sitting at the feet of

515
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,760
Jesus.

516
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,960
Isn't that awesome?

517
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,880
As I read verse number 15 of Mark 5, I really look at it as a situation in which this man

518
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,640
is worshiping and he's learning and he's there in the presence of Jesus.

519
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,240
If any man be in Christ, the Bible tells us that he's a new creature.

520
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,620
All things are passed away, behold, all things are become new.

521
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:35,220
We sing the song with the kids, there's been a great change since I've been born again.

522
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,860
The miracle of salvation.

523
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:42,060
The Bible tells us, and they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed

524
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:46,380
with the devil and also concerning the swine, and they, the people of the city, it says

525
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:50,300
this in verse 17, they began to pray him to depart out of their coast.

526
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,440
And he was coming to the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that

527
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,040
he might be with him.

528
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,880
I can understand the man's desire in verse number 18.

529
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,900
The people of the city, they hear all that takes place and they ask Jesus to leave.

530
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,880
And Jesus gets into the ship, he and his disciples, and they're going to depart, they're going

531
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,540
to leave.

532
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:16,120
And this man that had been transformed by the power of Jesus Christ, in verse number

533
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:21,140
18, it says, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with

534
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,800
him.

535
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,860
You know, the reality is that as a child of God, we ought to desire to be with our Savior.

536
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:32,340
Spend time with Him in communion and fellowship.

537
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:37,580
What a joy in His presence, His fullness of joy.

538
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:41,380
And he desires to be with Jesus, commendable, relatable.

539
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,920
But I want you to see what Jesus says to this man in verse number 19.

540
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,240
Albeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him.

541
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:57,800
So Jesus didn't allow him to get on the ship and to go to the other side.

542
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:05,400
He said, go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee

543
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,600
and have had compassion on thee.

544
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,400
You see it there, go and tell.

545
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,760
Go home to thy friends and tell them.

546
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,200
Tell them what?

547
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:22,960
Tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee and have had compassion on thee.

548
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,960
The Bible tells us in verse number 20, and he departed and began to publish in Decapolis

549
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:36,000
how great things Jesus had done for him and all men did marvel.

550
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,920
This morning, if you've been saved, it's not only a responsibility that we have to

551
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,900
carry out the Great Commission, it is a great privilege.

552
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,880
And what is it that we're doing?

553
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,240
Going and telling.

554
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:55,920
These believers in Acts chapter number 8, they were scattered abroad and they went everywhere

555
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,800
preaching the Word.

556
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:05,980
You read immediately in Acts 8 about the Ethiopian eunuch and how God used Philip in that situation.

557
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:11,980
And you read even before then how they're there and it tells us that the people in verse

558
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,580
number 5, then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them.

559
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:20,260
And so before he's taken away to go over to meet with the Ethiopian eunuch, he's there

560
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,100
and he's preaching Christ unto them in verse number 5.

561
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:30,500
And the Bible tells us in verse number 8, and there was great joy in that city.

562
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,380
This morning, they went everywhere preaching the Word.

563
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:39,500
As we leave this place, we leave this place as God's representatives.

564
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:46,220
And as we leave this place, we have, as we look at Mark 5 and use it as our theme this

565
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:52,940
year for our missions conference, this responsibility, go and tell.

566
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,940
Go and tell them.

567
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,380
I ask you this morning, if we don't tell them, who's going to?

568
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:03,500
They're not hearing the gospel in the classroom, right?

569
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:11,380
They're not hearing it from the movie industry, the music industry.

570
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:20,300
They're not hearing it from the halls of Congress, right?

571
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:29,720
None of those people, groups, entities, organizations have been given the responsibility like we

572
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,640
have as the church.

573
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:39,000
We as the church have been given the responsibility to carry out the Great Commission.

574
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,200
It's a unique privilege that we have to go and tell.

575
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,560
We have all these missionaries that we support.

576
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:56,560
We have missionaries that will be with us, one going to Honduras, one going to Bulgaria,

577
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,400
one that's a director of a missions board.

578
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,760
They'll be here with us, and they'll tell us about various fields.

579
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,960
And during our Sunday school class this morning, I put Steve on the spot.

580
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,080
He started sweating like I do, and I said, what is a missionary, and he gave a really

581
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,080
good answer.

582
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,720
He was kind of nervous.

583
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,720
You were, weren't you?

584
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,400
And he said, but, here's what he said.

585
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,360
I'm not going to quote you because I'm going to get it wrong, but basically, Steve said

586
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,360
this.

587
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,860
He said, a missionary is someone that takes, is a representative, someone that goes and

588
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,320
takes the gospel to some other place.

589
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,240
But you really don't have to go to another place because we can be missionaries right

590
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,240
here in Fairfax.

591
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:41,240
That's what he said, similar.

592
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,600
And I've often said as you look at our map, you look at this map, you look at all these

593
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:49,800
faces, you can push the little red button and you can push and see all the lights that

594
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,680
light up.

595
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,720
There's no missionary on that board that's going to Oakton or Fairfax County.

596
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,080
Why?

597
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:07,320
It's our job.

598
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,160
This is our Jerusalem.

599
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,639
This is our locale.

600
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:23,160
And so this morning, just as Jesus said to this man that was possessed of the devil,

601
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:30,360
He says, go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee

602
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,880
and hath had compassion on thee.

603
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:39,000
Listen, He's done some great things for us.

604
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,960
He's had compassion on us.

605
00:42:42,279 --> 00:42:45,720
He saved my soul, changed my life.

606
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:53,200
I don't even like to think about where I'd be without Christ.

607
00:42:53,200 --> 00:43:02,840
Every now and again, I think about it.

608
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:12,559
What if somebody didn't give the gospel to my dad?

609
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:18,279
Probably I wouldn't be here as your pastor today.

610
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:24,559
Maybe God in His grace would allow somebody else to come and bring me the gospel, but

611
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:27,400
I don't know that.

612
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:35,880
So which one of your neighbors, which one of your co-workers is going to hear the gospel

613
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:46,520
because of you, or is not going to hear the gospel because we don't tell them?

614
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:50,080
Somebody said this in the very first missions conference we had as I was the pastor here

615
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:55,000
at the church in 2012, our first missions conference, one of the missionaries made this

616
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,880
statement.

617
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:04,520
As a missionary, as a child of God, we ought to do and be willing to do what we would want

618
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:10,919
somebody else to do if they knew the truth and I was lost.

619
00:44:10,919 --> 00:44:15,440
I think it's a really good perspective because what if your neighbor knew the truth and you

620
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,440
were in darkness?

621
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,119
Man, wouldn't you want somebody to tell you?

622
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:24,360
I know that a lot of people don't want anyone to tell them because they don't know.

623
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:29,959
But man, after you get saved and you understand, you say, man, this is wonderful, this is wonderful

624
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:37,660
that He would save me and then that He would use me to tell someone else.

625
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:45,820
Just one sinner that's been saved telling another sinner about the Savior.

626
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:46,820
Jesus saves.

627
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:47,820
We sing the song.

628
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,760
We believe it this morning.

629
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,739
In Acts 8, they went everywhere preaching the Word.

630
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:59,559
Each time we leave this place, we are scattered in a certain sense.

631
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:07,000
We're not scattered the way that they were scattered, but we all live in different places.

632
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I won't take the time to name all the different towns that are represented, but we scatter

633
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,640
from here.

634
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:21,520
And as we have this single light, if you will, in Oakton as a church, as a body of believers,

635
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:28,899
but then you carry your light to your region, right, because we're scattered.

636
00:45:28,899 --> 00:45:31,839
No one else lives right close to where you live.

637
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:35,600
Not too far, there's a couple of families that live there, and so on and so forth.

638
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:44,080
And we take our lights and we go to our little place and we go and tell, go and tell how

639
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:49,480
great things Christ has done for you.

640
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,720
I often just say to somebody, can I just tell you how He changed my life?

641
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,520
Can I just tell you what He did for me?

642
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:03,360
How He saved my soul, gave me peace and joy.

643
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,260
Go and tell.

644
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:08,760
These people were scattered abroad because of great persecution.

645
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,279
Saul made havoc of the church.

646
00:46:11,279 --> 00:46:18,640
And the reason is notated, but we understand that God moved and God worked, and the result

647
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,320
was not only that Jerusalem was filled with the doctrine, but the world was turned upside

648
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,320
down.

649
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:29,959
And if you really trace it and you trace church history and you see how the gospel went in

650
00:46:29,959 --> 00:46:35,320
the book of Acts as far as it did, you begin to trace and see how the gospel got to where

651
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,320
we are.

652
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,320
It's amazing.

653
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:44,920
And it's just one believer obeying the truth that God has given us and saying, we're going

654
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,920
to tell other people what Christ did for me.

655
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,920
Let's pray.

656
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,220
Father, we love You.

657
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:53,440
We thank You for loving us.

658
00:46:53,440 --> 00:47:02,399
God I pray this morning that we would observe the behavior of those that were scattered

659
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:09,440
in Acts 8, and we would determine as Your people to go and tell.

660
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,320
Thank You for using us.

661
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:16,320
Thank You for the privilege of being Your representatives.

662
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,600
I pray that this morning in this time of invitation that You'd move and work.

663
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,000
God help us.

664
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:30,760
Maybe there's some that would say, Lord, I have not been going, I have not been telling.

665
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:37,720
Would You help me to be a bold witness?

666
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:42,000
Maybe some have been and You're just going to pray for some specific opportunities.

667
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,320
But trust this morning in the quietness of this invitation that each of us would yield

668
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,320
ourselves.

669
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:53,160
Say, Lord, use me.

670
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,920
I want to go and tell.

671
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:55,920
Would You stand with me?

672
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,119
Heads are bowed.
