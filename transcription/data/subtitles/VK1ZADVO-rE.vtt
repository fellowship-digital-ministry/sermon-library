00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
of Acts. I'm so thankful for this book. God has given us the Bible, the Word of God. He's given

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.439
us the Book of Acts. And really, as we study through and read the Book of Acts, what an

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:15.920
exciting book it is, and to see how that God is working through His servants. And I'm thankful

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.079
that God is still using His people today, aren't you? And what a blessing to be His servants. What

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:27.920
a blessing to be used to bring honor and glory to His name. It's not about us. It's not about

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.080
our name, our reputation. It's all about lifting up the Lord Jesus Christ, that He would be

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.639
exalted, that all the world would know that He is the Savior of the world. And I'm so thankful for

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:46.240
the privilege of reading this book. It tells us, really, the record of the Gospel advancing during

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:54.080
the first century. It begins in the first chapter, recording for us the ascension of Jesus Christ.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.599
And of course, as you end the Book of Acts, you find that the Apostle Paul is in Rome on house

00:00:59.599 --> 00:01:05.760
arrest. And those events that are covered in the Book of Acts are approximately 30 years of church

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.360
history. You think about the 30 years that are condensed into 28 chapters of the Book of Acts,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.720
and it is a power-packed, action-filled book with the advancement of the Gospel. The first seven

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.319
chapters of the book roughly record about three years before we get to Acts chapter number eight,

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:28.720
the text of Scripture in which we'll be looking at specifically this morning. But I want to remind

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.839
you that not only in Acts 1 did we read of the ascension of Jesus Christ, but we know that

00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:39.680
they're there in Jerusalem. The Bible tells us in verse number 14 of Acts 1, these all continued

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.559
with one accord in prayer and supplication with the women and Mary, the mother of Jesus,

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:49.120
and with the brethren. It tells us in verse number 15 that the number of names together

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.879
were about 120. And so you see that they're gathered there, they're obeying what the Lord

00:01:54.879 --> 00:02:01.279
Jesus Christ had told them in the beginning of Acts 1. They're there in Jerusalem, they're praying,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.199
they're just having fellowship one with another. And then we understand that we come to the second

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:11.759
chapter. As we come to Acts chapter number two, God gives us the record. We often refer to the

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:16.880
day of Pentecost, and you read about the day of Pentecost, and Peter, as he stands up, he's filled

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.839
with the power of the Holy Spirit of God, and he preaches with great boldness and with great power.

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:27.440
And we see that the Bible tells us that there were 3,000 that were added to the church. Look

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.520
in Acts 2 in verse number 41, it says, then they that gladly received his word were baptized,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:41.199
and the same day there were added unto them about 3,000 souls. Now in Acts 1, we read that the

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:46.720
Bible told us that there were about 120 of them, and now at the end of the day of Pentecost,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.279
in Acts chapter number two, there are 3,000 that were added. Isn't that amazing? It's miraculous

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:58.240
to see the way in which God is working. It tells us, and they, if you read verse number 42,

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.360
so not only the 120 that were there in Acts 1, but now these 3,000, they continued

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:08.960
steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and in fellowship and in breaking of bread and in

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:15.199
prayers. Isn't that exciting? And I like that it says that they continued steadfastly, and what a

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:22.639
blessing to see the desire of these new converts growing and learning the truth of God's word and

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:28.559
the purpose that God has saved them for, and just a joy. We come to Acts 3, we read of a great miracle

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:32.720
that took place, and it was the lame man that was healed. Peter and John, of course, are going to

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:40.320
the temple. They see that lame man, and we find that Peter says, look at us, and he looks, and he

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.919
says this in verse number five, he gave unto them, expecting to receive something of them, and

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:51.440
Peter said, silver and gold have I none, but such as I have, give I thee in the name of Jesus Christ

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.399
of Nazareth, rise up and walk. And we find the Bible tells us in verse number eight that he,

00:03:56.399 --> 00:04:02.399
leaping up, stood and walked and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:08.639
God. What a great day that was, and it says in verse number nine, and all the people saw him

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.960
walking and praising God. It's interesting because even in Acts chapter number four,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.200
the religious leaders, the opposition to the disciples, to the apostles, they

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:26.160
notate that there was a miracle that took place, and they could not deny it, and these people saw

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.920
it, and it gave opportunity as they gathered on Solomon's porch. It gave opportunity for Peter to

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:38.239
preach. He preaches another message, and God moves, and God works, and it tells us in Acts 4,

00:04:38.239 --> 00:04:44.399
in verse number four, how be it many of them which heard the word believed. Notice here, it says,

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:54.079
and the number of the men was about 5,000. We had 120 in Acts 1. They at Pentecost, 3,000.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:02.559
Here in Acts 4, just the number of men, 5,000. Can you imagine? I mean, it's exciting what God is

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:07.839
doing and how God is moving, and we find, of course, that there's opposition that comes. They're told

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:12.959
in Acts chapter number four, after they're dealing with some persecution and what have you, they're

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:17.359
told not to speak in his name and so on and so forth, and we find that the Bible tells us that

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:22.720
they spoke the word of God with boldness. Look in verse number 29. This was their prayer after they

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.000
heard the threats of the religious leaders. It says in Acts 4 in verse 29, and now, Lord, behold

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.239
their threatenings, and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word.

00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:39.279
And we need God's boldness to speak his word as we're filled with the power of the Holy Spirit

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:44.559
of God. The Bible tells us in verse number 31, and when they had prayed, the place was shaken,

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:48.559
where they were assembled together, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost. Notice what it

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:56.160
says, they spake the word of God with boldness. That was their prayer. You know, their prayer was

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:03.200
not, God, would you deal with these people that are threatening us? Would you deal with these

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:09.600
that are opposing your work? No, their prayer was, God, just give us boldness to do what you've

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.959
called us to do. And God gives them boldness, and the Bible tells us in verse number 32,

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:19.920
and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart, of one soul. Neither said any of them

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.320
that ought of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things common. As we

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.239
read verse 32, we read this word about multitude, and this multitude of people. You see the advancement

00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:38.559
of the gospel. You come to the fifth chapter, and you read in verse number 14, the Bible tells us

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:45.839
here, and the believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes, both of men and women.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.640
Multitudes. God's not even giving us a number at this point. He's saying multitudes, both of men

00:06:53.359 --> 00:06:58.640
and women. He says in verse number 32, after they had been miraculously released from prison,

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.880
remember they had put them in prison to keep them from being able to speak, and God released them

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.640
miraculously from prison. And we find that in verse number 28, they're told that they had filled

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.040
Jerusalem with their doctrine. They say we ought to obey God rather than men in verse 29. And in

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:19.679
verse number 32, they say this, we are his witnesses of these things. This morning, we continue to be

00:07:19.679 --> 00:07:24.959
his witnesses. It's our responsibility. He said in Acts 1 and verse number 8, and you shall receive

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:29.760
power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you, and you shall be witnesses unto me, both in

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.079
Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. And we find that still today,

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:39.600
even as the disciples embrace the responsibility that we are his witnesses, we too this morning

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.440
must embrace that responsibility that we are his witnesses. As the witnesses of the Lord Jesus

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:52.160
Christ, as his representatives, as the ambassadors, as we read in 2 Corinthians 5, we find in verse

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:58.959
number 42 of Acts 5, the Bible tells us this, and daily in the temple and in every house, they ceased

00:07:58.959 --> 00:08:06.320
not to teach and preach Jesus Christ. This is exciting what's happening in the book of Acts.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:14.399
We get to this portion of Scripture, and we read how that God is working and how God is moving,

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:20.320
and the attacks from the external are not being successful. There's some strife that's internal

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.799
in chapter number 6, but I want you to notice in verse number 7, the Bible says that the Word of

00:08:24.799 --> 00:08:30.959
God increased, and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly, and a great

00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:37.919
company of the priests were obedient to the faith. The Word of God increased, the number of the

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:44.559
disciples multiplied in Jerusalem, notice it says greatly. You come to Acts chapter number 7,

00:08:45.119 --> 00:08:50.320
and you read that as Stephen is preaching, and what a great message it is that he preaches,

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:55.919
you know that Stephen understood the truth of God's Word, and he's able to handle the Word of

00:08:55.919 --> 00:09:01.599
God, and he's preaching a powerful message. And at the end of Acts chapter number 7, we read

00:09:01.599 --> 00:09:06.640
that as Stephen is preaching, that these people are cut to the heart, and the Bible tells us that

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:14.719
he was stoned to death because of his preaching the opposition. We read of all of these events,

00:09:14.719 --> 00:09:20.080
I very quickly went through several highlights from Acts 1 to Acts 7, to kind of bring us to

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.559
place in Acts chapter number 8, where we'll study this morning, to have an understanding of the

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:30.239
context and the timing of all that's taking place. And these seven chapters, Acts 1 through 7,

00:09:30.239 --> 00:09:36.640
roughly record the first three years of the history of the church after the ascension of

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:45.039
Jesus Christ. And it was full with exciting growth, opportunities to see people saved,

00:09:45.039 --> 00:09:50.239
and lives changed. We come to Acts chapter number 8, and the Bible says that Saul was consenting

00:09:50.239 --> 00:09:56.559
unto his death, speaking of Stephen, in Acts 7. And at that time, there was a great persecution

00:09:56.559 --> 00:09:59.840
against the church, which was at Jerusalem, and they were all scattered

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:05.520
abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria except the apostles. Devout men carried

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:11.760
Stephen to his burial and made great lamentation over him. As for Saul, he made havoc of the church,

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:17.520
entering into every house, and hailing men and women, committed them to prison. Therefore,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:23.920
they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word." I preached a message this

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.840
morning from Acts 8, one through four. I took the title from verse number four,

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:34.800
went everywhere preaching the word. These events that lead up to this passage of Scripture remind

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.920
us of how God was fulfilling the promise that he had given to the disciples. You remember that the

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:45.200
Lord Jesus Christ asked the question of the disciples, who is it that men say that I am?

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.840
And as that question was asked of the disciples, the disciples respond and say, well, some say

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.280
that you're John the Baptist, some say that you're one of the prophets, Jeremiah, Isaiah,

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:59.280
one of the prophets. And Jesus then says, but whom say ye that I am? And we know that Peter

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:04.320
stands up with great boldness and authority, and he declares, he says, thou art the Christ,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.920
the Son of the living God. And we find that Jesus responds to him, and he talks how that God

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.480
revealed that truth to him. But then he gives them this truth. He says that he would build

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.480
his church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And we find that as that

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.600
promise was given, that we see in the early stages of church history in the book of Acts,

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:31.600
as God is recording for us the events that we've quickly gone over, we see how that the

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:40.640
Lord Jesus Christ is fulfilling that promise to build his church. From then until now,

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:46.800
Jesus continues to build his church. And I am so thankful, as we prayed this morning,

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:53.040
both Dean and I here at the platform, we prayed thanking God for the church, the body of believers,

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.320
the called-out assembly, those of us that have voluntarily joined ourselves together,

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.600
those that have been born again, church members have to be saved, and you're saved and you're

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:09.760
baptized, you join together for the purpose of carrying out the Great Commission. As a church,

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:15.280
we must never lose our focus as to why we're here. We're not a club. We're not just an organization

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:22.240
that just gets together for some, you know, mundane type of activity. We are here for a purpose,

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.680
and it is His purpose. We have the responsibility not only to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ in all

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:33.840
that we say and do, but it's our responsibility to evangelize the world. And here in Acts 8,

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:39.280
as we see the church in Jerusalem growing in those first seven chapters, and we see all of the

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:46.160
exciting things that are taking place, it starts with 120, and there are 3,000 and 5,000 in multitude

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.920
and multitudes, and the Bible tells us that the number increased greatly there at the church

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:59.280
at Jerusalem. The estimates of the attendance, the membership of the church at Jerusalem vary

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:06.560
greatly by scholars of yesteryear, but it's in the thousands of people, tens of thousands.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:14.960
God was working. God was moving. And then we come to Acts 8. We read about this great persecution,

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:20.160
but we read about this scattering, and as we read about the scattering, the Bible says that

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:26.080
they went everywhere preaching the Word. This morning, I want you to consider just two thoughts.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:31.360
Number one, the reason for the scattering. The reason for the scattering. As we look at this

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.840
passage of Scripture, there are two reasons that jump off the page to us. One is the reason for

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.800
the scattering, and the other is the reason for the persecution. And as we look at these two reasons that God

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:45.600
provides us with, we understand that we serve a sovereign God, and He's in control of all things.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:51.040
And we find here in Acts 8 and verse number 1 that the Bible tells us the first of these reasons

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:56.880
for this scattering that we read of here in Acts 8 is that there was a great persecution.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:04.400
That word persecution, it means the infliction of pain, punishment, or death upon others unjustly,

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:11.920
particularly for adhering to a religious creed or mode of worship. I want you to notice that

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:17.600
the Bible says that at that time, at the time of all of these great events that are taking place,

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:23.520
and all of the advancement, the church growing, God moving, God working, that the Bible says

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:29.440
there arose a great persecution against the church, which was at Jerusalem. You understand

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.680
this morning that even as we started all the way back in Acts chapter number 4, that that's really

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:38.400
when the persecution began. We find that that's when the persecution began. That's when the

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:43.360
threats were given. That's when they were imprisoned. In Acts chapter number 5, they were

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:48.240
beaten, and they were threatened. And you read all of this, but now we come to Acts 8, and we read

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:57.200
that it's described as being a great persecution. Through all of the attempts in Acts 4, 5, 6, and

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:03.520
7, you read of all of the attacks, and now it kind of reaches this pinnacle point, if you will,

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.640
and it's called a great persecution, and it's against the church that was at Jerusalem,

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:13.280
and because of this great persecution, it says that they were scattered abroad.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.680
Not only do we read about the great persecution in verse number 1, but we read about Saul in

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:25.280
particular. We know that in Acts chapter 9, Saul is going to be transformed by the power of the

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:30.480
Lord Jesus Christ. He's going to be saved on the road to Damascus, but at this particular time,

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:37.840
Paul is Saul, and he's not yet been saved. We find that Saul is making havoc of the church.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:42.160
You see in verse number 3, it says, "...as for Saul, he made havoc of the church,

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:47.920
entering into every house, and hailing men and women, committed them to prison." I believe that

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:53.120
in Acts chapter number 7, as Paul was there, it says that he was consenting unto his death in

00:15:53.120 --> 00:16:00.960
Acts 8, verse number 1. It does tell us this also, that in verse number 59 and 60, it says that,

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:06.160
"...and they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. And he

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:12.560
kneeled down and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:19.360
said this, he fell asleep." But notice in verse number 58 that the witnesses laid down their

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:27.920
clothes at a young man's feet whose name, his name was Saul. And Saul observed the events this day.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:33.360
He heard the preaching of Stephen. He heard how Stephen was able to take the truth of the Old

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:38.800
Testament and handle it so wisely and present the truth of the gospel. And Saul heard this,

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:45.200
and no doubt he was under great, just dealing with the preaching of the Word of God, and he's

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:51.840
dealing with the power of God working in his heart and his life. And as he's hearing this, and

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:57.200
just as these other men that they hear and they begin to oppose, and they're going to stone Stephen,

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:02.560
that here Paul is hearing this, Saul is his name, he's not yet converted, and he's hearing this. And

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:09.600
now how does he respond to this? What he's dealing with, he responds with increasing his attack

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:19.200
against the people of God. He's fighting. He's resisting. The Bible tells us that he

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:27.040
made havoc of the church. It means to treat shamefully, to ravage, to devastate, to ruin,

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:33.200
waste, or destroy. He was entering into every house. Can you imagine?

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:43.280
He's committing these to prison. And we read the reason for this scattering in Acts chapter 8,

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:48.640
and we think about the people of God and what they're enduring and how God was fulfilling His

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:55.280
purpose, however. Because as we see the reason that is mentioned in verse 1 and 3, we understand

00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:01.760
that God is in control of all things. You know, there's nothing that happens to you in your life,

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:09.040
or me in my life, that God does not allow. This morning, as we look at this passage of Scripture,

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:14.640
we could ask ourselves this question, could God have prevented this persecution?

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:20.800
Sure He could. He could have kept these things from happening. He could have prevented

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:26.560
all of this from taking place. But we know that as He's dealing here and He's allowing

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:31.360
these things to happen, we find that He's fulfilling His purpose. So not only do we see

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:37.120
the reason for the scattering, but I want you to notice the result of the scattering.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.720
As I think about the result of the scattering, it's mentioned simply in verse number 4,

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:49.840
therefore, they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the Word. The result of what

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:55.360
is recorded for us in verses 1 through 3, the result of this great persecution, the result of

00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:01.200
Saul making havoc of the church, we find is that they that were scattered, these believers that were

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:07.680
in Jerusalem, they were scattered as a result of this persecution, as a result of this difficult

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.080
situation that they're dealing with, and they were scattered abroad, but they went everywhere

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:19.040
preaching the Word. I want to take you back to the book of Genesis just for a moment,

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:25.920
and go to Genesis chapter number 50. In Genesis chapter number 50, we know that Jacob has now

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:32.640
died, and we find that Joseph is there with his brethren. And it's interesting as we begin to

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:38.640
find what's taking place here, and as Joseph is revealing some truth to his brothers,

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:44.080
we find that God gives us a great principle here in this passage of Scripture. In fact,

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:50.880
in Genesis 50, we'll mention it, but in Genesis chapter number 45, we find that Joseph made this

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.440
known to his brothers when he first revealed himself. It was in that passage of Scripture

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:59.760
when he first revealed himself to his brothers, and he tells them this in Genesis

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.400
This is 45 and verse number five,

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.640
now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.620
that you sold me hither.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.160
Notice the perspective of Joseph,

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:14.160
for God did send me before you to preserve life.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.560
Verse seven it says, and God sent me before you

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.260
to preserve you a posterity in the earth

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.800
and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:26.460
So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.100
Do you remember the circumstances

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.260
that led to Joseph coming to Egypt?

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.320
Could we not ask ourselves,

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.140
couldn't he got to Egypt a better way?

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:46.920
God's way is perfect, God makes no mistakes,

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.180
you believe that this morning?

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.180
God allowed those events to take place

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.500
in the life of Joseph to bring Joseph

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.260
to the place where he is in Genesis 45

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.300
when he makes himself known to his brothers

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:02.020
and he with very direct truth says to them,

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:06.420
it was not you that sent me hither, but God.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.300
And in Genesis chapter number 50,

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.580
as his brothers come to him,

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:14.260
it begins as they are coming back from the burial

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.220
and all that took place.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.820
And it says in verse number 15,

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.260
and when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead,

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.080
they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.380
and will certainly requite us of all the evil

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:26.660
which we did unto him.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.700
So what did they do?

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.300
They sent a messenger unto Joseph

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.180
and here's what they told the messenger to take this message

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.980
thy father did command before he died saying,

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.580
so shall you say unto Joseph,

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:40.700
forgive I pray thee now the trespass of thy brethren

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.940
and their sin, for they did unto the evil

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.020
and now we pray thee,

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.620
forgive the trespass of thy servants

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:49.460
of the God of thy father.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.800
Notice the response of Joseph,

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.440
he wept when they spake unto him.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.260
He wept.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.500
Joseph had already forgiven his brothers.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.380
Joseph already knew that he was in the place

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.540
that God had for him.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.300
And God just used his brothers to get him to that place,

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.100
but it was God that was moving him there.

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.860
Verse 18, this is his brethren also went

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.860
and fell down before his face.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.460
They said, behold, we be thy servants.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:20.220
And Joseph said unto them, fear not,

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.460
for am I in the place of God?

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.220
He says this in verse number 20,

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:29.620
but as for you, ye thought evil against me,

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:33.420
but God meant it unto good to bring to pass

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:38.420
as it is this day to save much people alive.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.860
I think about this principle from Genesis chapter number 50

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.740
and as this principle is revealed to us

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.420
in the life of Joseph in Genesis 50,

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:49.420
really 45 and 50,

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.940
we find that it's a principle that we're able to see

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:53.740
in other portions of scripture.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.060
As we begin to read various accounts of people's lives,

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.300
you see the hand of God and how God is working.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.900
And we find that in Genesis chapter number 45

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.740
and in Genesis chapter number 50,

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.980
when we read about the sovereignty of Almighty God

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.180
and his purposes being fulfilled,

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:15.580
we understand that then specifically in the life of Joseph,

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.140
God was moving and working for the purpose

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:22.100
of preservation of life through sustenance.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.100
Remember, there was going to be a famine.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.300
The dream was revealed.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.940
There was no one that could interpret the dream to Pharaoh

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:29.940
and the butler and the baker,

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.860
they both had a dream the same night

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.500
and the butler, he hears his interpretation.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.380
It's pretty positive.

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.980
He's gonna be restored his butlership

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.740
and the baker's like, well, I had a dream too.

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.380
Let me tell you about my dream.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.260
It wasn't so good for the baker.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.700
In three days, you're gonna be released too,

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.900
but you're gonna be put to death.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.580
Right, that's what happens.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.380
The butler's restored to his butlership

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.820
and a period of time passes two full years

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:53.260
according to the word of God

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.660
and the request that Joseph made to the butler

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.740
was remember me, but two years passed.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:02.500
Joseph continues in prison and Pharaoh has a dream

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.780
and no one can interpret the dream.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.220
The butler says, I remember.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.740
You were angry with me and with the baker.

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.300
We're in war, we're in prison.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.660
There's a man there in Hebrew.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.619
He could interpret dreams and Joseph comes

00:24:17.619 --> 00:24:20.380
and he says, it's God that gives the interpretation

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:24.380
just like Daniel and he gives the interpretation.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.619
He talks about the famine, right?

00:24:25.619 --> 00:24:26.900
There's gonna be seven years of plenty

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.460
and then there's gonna be seven years of famine.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.820
He begins to give Pharaoh a plan.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:35.300
He says, who else but you should run the show, so to speak.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.700
The famine wasn't just in Egypt, it was all lands.

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.540
They came to Egypt to get food

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:48.860
and God had sent providentially Joseph ahead

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:54.619
to preserve life through food, through sustenance.

00:24:54.619 --> 00:24:56.820
But I want you to understand that in a much greater way

00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:00.020
in Acts chapter number eight, that this sending forth,

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.940
this scattering was not just the preservation of life

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.940
through sustenance, that this scattering

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:08.420
was the advancement of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:11.619
That we find that as God would allow this persecution,

00:25:11.619 --> 00:25:16.339
that as God would allow Saul to cause havoc,

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.059
to make havoc of the church,

00:25:18.059 --> 00:25:21.339
as God allowed this persecution to take place,

00:25:21.339 --> 00:25:23.339
that we find that it was the advancement

00:25:23.339 --> 00:25:25.180
of the gospel of Jesus Christ,

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:28.779
which does not simply sustain life through physical food,

00:25:28.779 --> 00:25:33.460
but it gives everlasting life, eternal life.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.460
And what a blessing.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:40.700
We find that our God is sovereign and our God is able.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:45.059
And though the enemy desired, they sought to,

00:25:45.059 --> 00:25:47.660
if I could use the terminology this morning,

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:52.500
they sought to stamp out biblical Christianity in Jerusalem

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.059
and all they did is spread the embers

00:25:55.059 --> 00:25:58.540
of the fire of the gospel throughout the known world.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:02.339
And what had been said of the church of Jesus Christ,

00:26:02.339 --> 00:26:04.779
the church in Jerusalem as they're going forth

00:26:04.779 --> 00:26:06.300
in those first three years,

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.740
what had been said of them in Acts five

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.100
in verse number 28 is this,

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.660
you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine.

00:26:16.059 --> 00:26:19.300
Now that's commendable, is it not?

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.619
To have filled Jerusalem with their doctrine,

00:26:21.619 --> 00:26:25.660
to have been so bold in giving the gospel of Jesus Christ

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.500
to go forth and to preach the word of God.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.220
We read about the advancement, the growth of the church

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.100
and how it increased greatly.

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.020
And we see the growth of the church,

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.940
but they're only in Jerusalem.

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.300
And in Acts one in verse number eight,

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.779
Jerusalem wasn't the end point, it was the starting point.

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:45.860
Right?

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:49.860
And you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem,

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.740
the starting point where they were,

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:57.180
Judea, Samaria and the uttermost.

00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.580
And so they weren't to stay in Jerusalem.

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.020
But the reality is that things were going really good

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:05.260
in Jerusalem, right?

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.140
Church is growing.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.540
I mean, multitudes are being saved,

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:09.820
they're continuing steadfastly.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.180
Yes, they dealt with some problems,

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.660
they dealt with some difficulties,

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.460
but God was working and God was moving.

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.380
But there was Judea and Samaria and the uttermost

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.420
that still had to be reached.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.020
And so God would allow this persecution

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.339
in Acts chapter number eight

00:27:25.339 --> 00:27:28.860
in order for the word of God to go forth.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.260
And we find that as the enemy sought

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.420
to stamp out biblical Christianity,

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.580
that as we read in the passage of scripture

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.300
in Acts chapter number eight,

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.619
that they go scattered abroad.

00:27:40.619 --> 00:27:41.779
Those that were scattered,

00:27:41.779 --> 00:27:43.260
they went everywhere preaching the word.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.700
Notice in verse number one,

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.540
when it speaks about this great persecution

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.380
against the church, which was at Jerusalem,

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.580
notice it says this at the end of verse number one,

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.260
and they were all scattered abroad

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:56.300
throughout the regions specifically mentioned,

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.779
Judea and Samaria.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:02.500
Except the apostles, they stayed there in Jerusalem.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.900
We understand even as you read about the council

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.660
in Jerusalem, as you come to Acts 15,

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:10.180
you understand that the church there in Jerusalem continued

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.380
and it was a good church, a thriving church,

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:15.660
but we find that these folks were scattered abroad.

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.220
And as they were scattered,

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:21.540
they went everywhere preaching the word.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:25.260
I want you to turn to Acts chapter number 17, if you will.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.100
I want you to read with me

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.059
as Paul now is going forth

00:28:31.059 --> 00:28:35.619
and he was saved in Acts nine

00:28:35.619 --> 00:28:37.900
and he's gone, completed one missionary journey.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:41.780
Now on his second, he's going forth

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:45.380
and I mean, God is working, souls are being saved.

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.540
The Bible tells us in Acts 17 in verse number one,

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:51.900
now when they had passed through Epiphalus and Apollonia,

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.140
they came to Thessalonica,

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.700
where was a synagogue of the Jews.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.859
And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them

00:28:57.859 --> 00:29:00.540
and three Sabbath days reasoned with them

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:02.100
out of the scriptures.

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.940
Says that he was opening and alleging

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:06.700
that Christ must needs have suffered

00:29:06.739 --> 00:29:08.380
and risen again from the dead

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:12.500
and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:15.460
And you read about the church in Thessalonica,

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:19.660
if you read the letters of first and second Thessalonians,

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:23.140
you read about a church that, man, they were on fire for God.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.020
They'd been used mightily from that church.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:30.619
And in this text of scripture, Acts 17,

00:29:30.619 --> 00:29:32.340
Paul is there and he's preaching

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.859
and he's giving them the truth of the gospel.

00:29:34.859 --> 00:29:36.140
It tells us in verse number four,

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.580
some of them believed and consorted with Paul and Silas

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.820
and of the devout Greeks, a great multitude

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.580
and of the chief women, not a few.

00:29:43.859 --> 00:29:45.340
So there were some Jews that got saved

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.540
because he was there in the synagogue.

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:50.100
The Bible tells us that there were of the devout Greeks,

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.340
a great multitude of the chief women, not a few.

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:53.540
So there were many that got saved,

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:54.780
it says in verse number five,

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.100
but the Jews, which believed not, moved with envy,

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.900
took upon them certain lewd fellows of the base.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.720
her sword, and gathered a company, and set all the city of an uproar, and assaulted the

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:07.040
house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people."

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.680
So you see the persecution continues.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:13.760
And I want you to notice in verse number 6, it says, when they found them not, they drew

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.680
Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:26.640
Here's what they cry, "'These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also.'"

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.980
Until Acts 8, it was Jerusalem.

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:35.680
When you read Acts 2 through Acts 7, you read of Jerusalem and the work in the church in

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:42.120
Jerusalem, the growth of the church in Jerusalem, the persecution of the church at Jerusalem.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.880
You have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.080
But when you come to Acts chapter number 17, after that scattering that we read of in Acts

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:55.680
8, and as they go to Samaria and to Judea, and they go, and the gospel continues to advance

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:59.520
through these missionary journeys that we read of with the Apostle Paul, you find that

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:05.080
these that are the opponents of the work of God, they come, and the accusation that they

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:11.080
bring is that these that have turned the world upside down are come hither also.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:17.080
Isn't that a great result of the scattering that we read of in Acts 8, that now we begin

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:21.480
to look at the entirety of the book of Acts, and you begin to study through, and as you

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:26.360
read the epistles, and you read about the book of Ephesians, and the church at Ephesus,

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:30.520
you can go back to the book of Acts, and you can read how the gospel got to Ephesus.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:35.000
You can read about the book of Philippians, and as you read the book of Philippians today,

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.560
man, this is exciting.

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:37.560
Where did this happen?

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:41.600
You go back to the book of Acts, and you read about the gospel coming to Philippi, and all

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:45.600
that takes place, and on, and on, and on, and you begin to see how God is working and

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:49.320
how God is moving.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:55.720
And I would submit to you this morning that still today, God is at work.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.160
God is able to save sinners.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.320
Brianna sang about the greatest of all miracles when He saved me.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.960
Listen, He's a wonderful Savior to me.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:08.680
We sing that song, What a Great Song It Is, and He is a wonderful Savior to me.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:12.640
But I understand this morning that there are a lot of lost people that need to know the

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.880
wonderful Savior, Jesus Christ.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:21.360
As we think about the truth of the Word of God, and we begin to look at the responsibility

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:26.380
and looking at these believers in Acts chapter number 8, and they were scattered abroad because

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:31.400
of this persecution, because of the havoc that Saul was causing to them, because of

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:39.640
all of this difficulty, they're spread abroad, but they went everywhere preaching the Word.

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.800
You know that many of the places in which Paul went preaching the Word, he was met with

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.440
opposition.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:51.240
In many of the cities that we read of during those missionary journeys, Paul was met with

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.080
fierce opposition.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:58.560
We find that he's faced with that opposition, that he simply goes to the next town, he goes

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.480
to the next place, he goes to the next city, and what does he do?

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.200
He does the same thing that he did before.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:10.040
He preaches the Word of God because of the Word of God that changes lives.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:15.720
We think about the truth of God's Word this morning in our lives, and we begin to consider

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:22.100
the importance that we have to take the gospel to a lost and dying world.

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:26.000
As we make preparation for our missions conference, I mentioned it several weeks ago, if you go

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.640
over to our fellowship hall, Ron and Mady did some decorating before they went away

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.760
for this weekend.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:37.720
And our theme for our conference this year is Go and Tell.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:42.180
And I want you to just briefly look at Mark 5, just for a moment this morning.

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:48.080
Mark chapter number 5, this is where the theme, as I prayed and sought the Lord with regard

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:54.160
to a theme this year, this is the passage in which God has led me to, and I'm so thankful

00:33:54.160 --> 00:34:02.420
that God has given us not only the responsibility but the privilege of being His witnesses.

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.180
The privilege of going and telling.

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:09.960
Have you ever experienced something in your life physically, something temporal, something

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:13.420
that you experienced here upon this earth that you experienced that you just felt like

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:16.160
you had to tell somebody about?

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.760
Maybe you had a really good dinner somewhere.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:18.760
I mean, it was just exceptional.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.960
It was one of the best meals you've ever had.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.920
You took your spouse out, you took your wife, fellas, you took her out for dinner, and you

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.400
went to this fantastic restaurant.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.160
Man, it was just wonderful.

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.840
And you just, I mean, it was just a temporal thing.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:33.120
It's nothing spiritual whatsoever, but it's just a temporal thing, and you feel like you

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:38.580
want to tell somebody about it.

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:41.700
I want you to understand this morning that the greatest thing that could ever happen

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:46.620
in somebody's life, if you're saved this morning, you've experienced that greatest thing.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:50.140
Salvation, through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:54.260
The man that we read of in Mark chapter number 5, we're familiar with the passage of Scripture.

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:58.580
I won't take time to develop all of it, but in this passage of Scripture, it's the maniac

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:00.580
from Gadara.

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:04.640
If you were to study the timeline of this particular miracle, you'll find that they

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.680
got into the ship so that they could pass over to the other side.

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.680
They encounter a great storm.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:14.320
They're there in Gadara for the purpose, really singularly, of this man trusting Christ as

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:18.080
a Savior, because then they get back on the boat and go back to the other side.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.080
Why?

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:23.820
Because the people say, go.

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:28.760
But this man, this man that was, he was demon-possessed.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:32.900
You read about all that took place, and you read about how the Lord Jesus Christ healed

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:39.220
this man, and obviously this man is transformed by the gospel, the power of the Lord Jesus

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.220
Christ.

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:44.460
It tells us in verse number 15, and they come to Jesus and see him that was possessed with

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:50.220
the devil and had the legion sitting and clothed in his right mind, and they were afraid.

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.620
This is the people of the town.

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:56.860
We find that this man that is described earlier in the passage of Scripture with this demon-possession

00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:02.120
and all that was taking place and all the characteristics of this man, now the Bible

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:06.760
tells us that he's clothed and he's in his right mind and he's sitting at the feet of

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:07.760
Jesus.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.960
Isn't that awesome?

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:14.880
As I read verse number 15 of Mark 5, I really look at it as a situation in which this man

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:20.640
is worshiping and he's learning and he's there in the presence of Jesus.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:25.240
If any man be in Christ, the Bible tells us that he's a new creature.

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:28.620
All things are passed away, behold, all things are become new.

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:35.220
We sing the song with the kids, there's been a great change since I've been born again.

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.860
The miracle of salvation.

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:42.060
The Bible tells us, and they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:46.380
with the devil and also concerning the swine, and they, the people of the city, it says

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:50.300
this in verse 17, they began to pray him to depart out of their coast.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.440
And he was coming to the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.040
he might be with him.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:01.880
I can understand the man's desire in verse number 18.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:06.900
The people of the city, they hear all that takes place and they ask Jesus to leave.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.880
And Jesus gets into the ship, he and his disciples, and they're going to depart, they're going

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.540
to leave.

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:16.120
And this man that had been transformed by the power of Jesus Christ, in verse number

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:21.140
18, it says, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.800
him.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:28.860
You know, the reality is that as a child of God, we ought to desire to be with our Savior.

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:32.340
Spend time with Him in communion and fellowship.

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:37.580
What a joy in His presence, His fullness of joy.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:41.380
And he desires to be with Jesus, commendable, relatable.

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:47.920
But I want you to see what Jesus says to this man in verse number 19.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:53.240
Albeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him.

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:57.800
So Jesus didn't allow him to get on the ship and to go to the other side.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:05.400
He said, go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.600
and have had compassion on thee.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:11.400
You see it there, go and tell.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.760
Go home to thy friends and tell them.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.200
Tell them what?

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:22.960
Tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee and have had compassion on thee.

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:28.960
The Bible tells us in verse number 20, and he departed and began to publish in Decapolis

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:36.000
how great things Jesus had done for him and all men did marvel.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.920
This morning, if you've been saved, it's not only a responsibility that we have to

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:46.900
carry out the Great Commission, it is a great privilege.

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.880
And what is it that we're doing?

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.240
Going and telling.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:55.920
These believers in Acts chapter number 8, they were scattered abroad and they went everywhere

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.800
preaching the Word.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:05.980
You read immediately in Acts 8 about the Ethiopian eunuch and how God used Philip in that situation.

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:11.980
And you read even before then how they're there and it tells us that the people in verse

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:15.580
number 5, then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:20.260
And so before he's taken away to go over to meet with the Ethiopian eunuch, he's there

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:23.100
and he's preaching Christ unto them in verse number 5.

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:30.500
And the Bible tells us in verse number 8, and there was great joy in that city.

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:34.380
This morning, they went everywhere preaching the Word.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:39.500
As we leave this place, we leave this place as God's representatives.

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:46.220
And as we leave this place, we have, as we look at Mark 5 and use it as our theme this

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:52.940
year for our missions conference, this responsibility, go and tell.

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:53.940
Go and tell them.

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:57.380
I ask you this morning, if we don't tell them, who's going to?

00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:03.500
They're not hearing the gospel in the classroom, right?

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:11.380
They're not hearing it from the movie industry, the music industry.

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:20.300
They're not hearing it from the halls of Congress, right?

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:29.720
None of those people, groups, entities, organizations have been given the responsibility like we

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:33.640
have as the church.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:39.000
We as the church have been given the responsibility to carry out the Great Commission.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.200
It's a unique privilege that we have to go and tell.

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:49.560
We have all these missionaries that we support.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:56.560
We have missionaries that will be with us, one going to Honduras, one going to Bulgaria,

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.400
one that's a director of a missions board.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.760
They'll be here with us, and they'll tell us about various fields.

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.960
And during our Sunday school class this morning, I put Steve on the spot.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:11.080
He started sweating like I do, and I said, what is a missionary, and he gave a really

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.080
good answer.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:14.720
He was kind of nervous.

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.720
You were, weren't you?

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:21.400
And he said, but, here's what he said.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:25.360
I'm not going to quote you because I'm going to get it wrong, but basically, Steve said

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.360
this.

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:29.860
He said, a missionary is someone that takes, is a representative, someone that goes and

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:32.320
takes the gospel to some other place.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:36.240
But you really don't have to go to another place because we can be missionaries right

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.240
here in Fairfax.

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:41.240
That's what he said, similar.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.600
And I've often said as you look at our map, you look at this map, you look at all these

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:49.800
faces, you can push the little red button and you can push and see all the lights that

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.680
light up.

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:57.720
There's no missionary on that board that's going to Oakton or Fairfax County.

00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.080
Why?

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:07.320
It's our job.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:10.160
This is our Jerusalem.

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.639
This is our locale.

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:23.160
And so this morning, just as Jesus said to this man that was possessed of the devil,

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:30.360
He says, go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:33.880
and hath had compassion on thee.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:39.000
Listen, He's done some great things for us.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.960
He's had compassion on us.

00:42:42.279 --> 00:42:45.720
He saved my soul, changed my life.

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:53.200
I don't even like to think about where I'd be without Christ.

00:42:53.200 --> 00:43:02.840
Every now and again, I think about it.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:12.559
What if somebody didn't give the gospel to my dad?

00:43:12.559 --> 00:43:18.279
Probably I wouldn't be here as your pastor today.

00:43:18.279 --> 00:43:24.559
Maybe God in His grace would allow somebody else to come and bring me the gospel, but

00:43:24.559 --> 00:43:27.400
I don't know that.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:35.880
So which one of your neighbors, which one of your co-workers is going to hear the gospel

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:46.520
because of you, or is not going to hear the gospel because we don't tell them?

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:50.080
Somebody said this in the very first missions conference we had as I was the pastor here

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:55.000
at the church in 2012, our first missions conference, one of the missionaries made this

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.880
statement.

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:04.520
As a missionary, as a child of God, we ought to do and be willing to do what we would want

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:10.919
somebody else to do if they knew the truth and I was lost.

00:44:10.919 --> 00:44:15.440
I think it's a really good perspective because what if your neighbor knew the truth and you

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:16.440
were in darkness?

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:20.119
Man, wouldn't you want somebody to tell you?

00:44:20.119 --> 00:44:24.360
I know that a lot of people don't want anyone to tell them because they don't know.

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:29.959
But man, after you get saved and you understand, you say, man, this is wonderful, this is wonderful

00:44:29.959 --> 00:44:37.660
that He would save me and then that He would use me to tell someone else.

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:45.820
Just one sinner that's been saved telling another sinner about the Savior.

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:46.820
Jesus saves.

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:47.820
We sing the song.

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:49.760
We believe it this morning.

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:55.739
In Acts 8, they went everywhere preaching the Word.

00:44:55.739 --> 00:44:59.559
Each time we leave this place, we are scattered in a certain sense.

00:44:59.559 --> 00:45:07.000
We're not scattered the way that they were scattered, but we all live in different places.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.000
I won't take the time to name all the different towns that are represented, but we scatter

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.640
from here.

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:21.520
And as we have this single light, if you will, in Oakton as a church, as a body of believers,

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:28.899
but then you carry your light to your region, right, because we're scattered.

00:45:28.899 --> 00:45:31.839
No one else lives right close to where you live.

00:45:31.839 --> 00:45:35.600
Not too far, there's a couple of families that live there, and so on and so forth.

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:44.080
And we take our lights and we go to our little place and we go and tell, go and tell how

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:49.480
great things Christ has done for you.

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.720
I often just say to somebody, can I just tell you how He changed my life?

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:56.520
Can I just tell you what He did for me?

00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:03.360
How He saved my soul, gave me peace and joy.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.260
Go and tell.

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:08.760
These people were scattered abroad because of great persecution.

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:11.279
Saul made havoc of the church.

00:46:11.279 --> 00:46:18.640
And the reason is notated, but we understand that God moved and God worked, and the result

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:23.320
was not only that Jerusalem was filled with the doctrine, but the world was turned upside

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:24.320
down.

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:29.959
And if you really trace it and you trace church history and you see how the gospel went in

00:46:29.959 --> 00:46:35.320
the book of Acts as far as it did, you begin to trace and see how the gospel got to where

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:36.320
we are.

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.320
It's amazing.

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:44.920
And it's just one believer obeying the truth that God has given us and saying, we're going

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.920
to tell other people what Christ did for me.

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:48.920
Let's pray.

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.220
Father, we love You.

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:53.440
We thank You for loving us.

00:46:53.440 --> 00:47:02.399
God I pray this morning that we would observe the behavior of those that were scattered

00:47:02.399 --> 00:47:09.440
in Acts 8, and we would determine as Your people to go and tell.

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:12.320
Thank You for using us.

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:16.320
Thank You for the privilege of being Your representatives.

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.600
I pray that this morning in this time of invitation that You'd move and work.

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.000
God help us.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:30.760
Maybe there's some that would say, Lord, I have not been going, I have not been telling.

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:37.720
Would You help me to be a bold witness?

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:42.000
Maybe some have been and You're just going to pray for some specific opportunities.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:48.320
But trust this morning in the quietness of this invitation that each of us would yield

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.320
ourselves.

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:53.160
Say, Lord, use me.

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.920
I want to go and tell.

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:55.920
Would You stand with me?

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:56.119
Heads are bowed.
