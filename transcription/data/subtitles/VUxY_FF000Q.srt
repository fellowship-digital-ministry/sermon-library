1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,919
but he knoweth the way that I take.

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,920
When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold."

3
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:09,640
What a great truth.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,640
You think about Job.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,079
We mentioned a little bit in Sunday school

6
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:14,680
about Job this morning in my class,

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,319
and you think about the trial that he endured,

8
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:19,719
and God is at work.

9
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:20,719
The psalmist said this,

10
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:23,200
"'It was good for me that I was afflicted.'"

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,360
It was good for me that I was afflicted, why?

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,819
Because then I learned thy statutes.

13
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:32,259
And what a blessing when we have that perspective

14
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,139
that God doeth all things well,

15
00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:37,139
that he has a perfect plan, and what a blessing.

16
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:39,659
His goal for us as his people

17
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:43,540
is that we would be conformed to the image of his dear son.

18
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,540
Romans 8 and verse 29,

19
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,979
and what a blessed truth of God's word.

20
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:50,259
If you have your Bible with you this morning,

21
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,060
1 Timothy chapter six,

22
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,700
1 Timothy chapter number six this morning,

23
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,340
and we dealt with the beginning

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,700
of this passage of scripture last week,

25
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,180
and looked at verses one through 10,

26
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,459
and we talked about the importance last week

27
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:06,180
of developing biblical perspective,

28
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,019
and we talked about biblical perspective

29
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:09,819
with regard to conversion,

30
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,940
with regard to contending,

31
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,300
and that we're to earnestly contend for the faith,

32
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,099
and then also a biblical perspective on contentment.

33
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:19,720
As we enter into the next portion,

34
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,480
we're just gonna look at verses 11 and 12 this morning.

35
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,139
These two verses of scripture are full.

36
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:26,660
They're just packed with truth

37
00:01:26,699 --> 00:01:28,940
that is so important for us to understand,

38
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,660
and we do not wanna just quickly go through them.

39
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,819
As we look at the text of scripture in verse 11,

40
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:34,660
notice the Bible says,

41
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,660
"'But thou, O man of God, flee these things,

42
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,500
"'and follow after righteousness, godliness,

43
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,440
"'faith, love, patience, meekness.

44
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,180
"'Fight the good fight of faith.

45
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,900
"'Lay hold on eternal life,

46
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,900
"'whereunto thou art also called,

47
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,199
"'and hast professed a good profession

48
00:01:58,199 --> 00:02:01,300
"'before many witnesses.'"

49
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,860
I've titled the message this morning,

50
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,459
Flee, Follow, Fight.

51
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,980
As we look at this text of scripture,

52
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,419
what's of great interest to me right in the beginning

53
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,179
by way of introduction,

54
00:02:12,179 --> 00:02:13,860
is the way in which the apostle Paul,

55
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,779
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

56
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:17,679
addresses Timothy.

57
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,039
You find that right in the middle

58
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,339
of this portion of scripture,

59
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:22,380
that verse number 11 begins,

60
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:25,979
"'But thou, O man of God.'"

61
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,860
And I believe that just as that kinda jumps off

62
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,580
of the pages of scripture for me,

63
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,539
I believe that as Timothy was receiving this letter,

64
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:36,320
as he was reading what Paul was giving him

65
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,059
by way of instruction, by way of encouragement,

66
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,419
because of all that was being dealt with

67
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:43,720
as he's there in Ephesus,

68
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,100
and we find that Timothy comes near the end of this letter,

69
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:53,619
and it says, "'But thou, O man of God.'"

70
00:02:53,619 --> 00:02:55,699
And I wonder, as I look at that statement,

71
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:58,100
as I look at that reference this morning,

72
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,820
I wonder this morning, what is it about an individual

73
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,339
that would make them a man or woman of God?

74
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:08,059
What is it about the individual?

75
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:09,440
Why is it that Paul,

76
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,139
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

77
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:16,139
would say, "'But thou, O man of God.'"

78
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,500
I wonder this morning, would God look at you?

79
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,220
Would God look at me?

80
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,220
Would he say, would he refer to us as being a man of God,

81
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,660
or for the ladies, a woman of God?

82
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,339
Would he look at us and refer to us in that manner?

83
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:35,580
What is it that must be evidenced in our life

84
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,740
that would result in that type of a title, if you will?

85
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,660
Well, I think, first of all, you must be saved.

86
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,539
If you're not saved,

87
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:45,619
if you're not saved by the blood of Christ,

88
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:47,100
then you're not going to be referred to

89
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,100
as a man or woman of God.

90
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,380
We find this morning the truth of salvation

91
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,020
has been plainly dealt with,

92
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,100
even in the book of 1 Timothy,

93
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,139
that Paul says this at the beginning of the book.

94
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,059
He talks about the importance of understanding

95
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:05,020
the grace and mercy of God,

96
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,940
and he says this is a faithful saying

97
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,419
and worthy of all acceptation,

98
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:11,419
that Christ Jesus came into the world

99
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:15,039
to save sinners, of whom I am chief.

100
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,119
I am thankful this morning

101
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:20,600
that Jesus Christ left heaven's glory.

102
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,519
He left the throne room of heaven.

103
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,559
He left all that he had.

104
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:27,519
He that was rich, he became poor for us.

105
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,959
He humbled himself and he became obedient unto death,

106
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,480
even the death of the cross.

107
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,320
Why?

108
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,239
So that mankind could be redeemed.

109
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:39,119
And we find this morning that Paul would then say

110
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:41,760
in the second chapter of the book of 1 Timothy,

111
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,399
speaking of God, he says,

112
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,959
who will have all men to be saved

113
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:49,239
and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

114
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:51,600
And what a blessing it is for us to understand

115
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,679
and to have that biblical perspective

116
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:55,320
with regard to conversion,

117
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,279
that all men must be saved.

118
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,480
If you're a human being, you're in need of salvation.

119
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,600
If you're here this morning

120
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,839
and you've already trust that Christ is your savior,

121
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,459
then you can rejoice, and I rejoice with you

122
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:10,079
that you've been born again, that you're heaven bound.

123
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,299
If you're not yet saved,

124
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:13,660
if you've never trust that Christ is your savior,

125
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,299
if there's not been that moment in your life

126
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:18,220
where you understood that you were a sinner

127
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,899
and that there's a penalty for sin

128
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:22,540
and it's separation from God for all of eternity

129
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,579
in the lake of fire and that Jesus Christ is the only way.

130
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:29,500
He said, I am the way, the truth and the life.

131
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,940
No man cometh unto the father but by me.

132
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,100
Could I tell you this morning,

133
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,579
if you've not trust that Christ

134
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:39,820
that today is the day of salvation, no longer delay.

135
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,940
Do not put it off for a moment longer.

136
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,540
Trust Christ today.

137
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,100
He is ready to save you.

138
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,940
He loves you.

139
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,059
He died for you.

140
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:51,100
So we find that Timothy,

141
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,820
before he could be referred to as being a man of God,

142
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,500
he must be a child of God.

143
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,179
He must be saved by the grace of God.

144
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:01,579
I believe one that would be referred to as being a man

145
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:04,980
or woman of God would be one that is growing spiritually,

146
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,500
not just somebody that's saved, but somebody that's growing,

147
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,779
somebody that's walking with Christ,

148
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:15,179
that's showing, demonstrating, displaying in their life

149
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:16,420
the fruit of the spirit,

150
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,059
someone that the attributes of God

151
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:20,820
are evidenced in their life.

152
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,420
They're growing in their walk with Christ.

153
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,579
The reality is that we understand as we study the scripture

154
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:32,140
that God intends for his people to grow spiritually.

155
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,700
He does not just save us and say,

156
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,140
now we're heaven bound and just do what you want,

157
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,660
live how you want because you're going to heaven.

158
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,299
No, we find that God desires that we as his children

159
00:06:44,299 --> 00:06:46,059
would walk in obedience,

160
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:49,059
that we would walk as children of the light,

161
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:52,820
that we would walk in such a way that he would be pleased,

162
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,779
that he would be honored and glorified.

163
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:57,779
And we find that the individual

164
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:00,660
that is walking in the spirit,

165
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,739
the Bible says they shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

166
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:05,619
He that is walking in the spirit

167
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:08,660
that has the fruit of the spirit evidence

168
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,299
displayed in their lives,

169
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:15,299
the one who according to John 15 is abiding in Christ,

170
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:18,820
that individual I believe is the one

171
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,820
that God would refer to as a man or a woman of God.

172
00:07:23,859 --> 00:07:24,820
The end of the text

173
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,420
or at the end of the message this morning,

174
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,420
we'll look at some of the testimony of Timothy

175
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,179
and understand a little bit more

176
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:34,299
as we look at a few other portions of scripture

177
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:37,540
why it is that Timothy would be referred to

178
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,059
as a man of God.

179
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,660
But I want you to think about the beginning

180
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,339
of this portion of scripture in verse 11

181
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:47,380
when God uses the apostle Paul to write to Timothy

182
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,940
and says, but thou, O man of God.

183
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,700
Notice the instruction that is provided.

184
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,380
Number one, if you're taking notes,

185
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:59,380
the instruction to flee, the instruction to flee.

186
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,779
Notice very simply,

187
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,220
we find that as we start this verse of scripture,

188
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,980
but thou, O man of God,

189
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,940
notice these three words, flee these things.

190
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,820
We find in other portions of scripture

191
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,420
that God specifically tells us certain things,

192
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,540
specific things that were to flee.

193
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,980
If you go to 1 Corinthians 6, flee fornication.

194
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,660
And you can look at a number of other portions of scripture

195
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,619
where something specifically is mentioned

196
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:27,179
with regard to fleeing.

197
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:29,579
Here it says flee these things.

198
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:32,219
So we have to understand contextually

199
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,619
as we look at the content of this passage of scripture,

200
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:39,659
what is it that Paul is telling Timothy to flee?

201
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,099
Well, I believe as we just studied last week

202
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:44,900
and we look specifically in verses six through 10,

203
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,979
and we dealt with the perspective

204
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:49,979
that we're to have on contentment.

205
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:51,820
And we find that in verse number nine,

206
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,219
it says they that will be rich.

207
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:56,099
Again, I mentioned last week,

208
00:08:56,099 --> 00:08:59,659
I took great time to explain last Sunday

209
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,460
that it does not say they that are rich.

210
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,619
It says they that will be rich.

211
00:09:04,619 --> 00:09:05,979
That is their drive.

212
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,460
That is their motivation.

213
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,340
That is what they're seeking is riches.

214
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,340
And he says, they that will be rich

215
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,260
fall into temptation and a snare

216
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,260
into many foolish and hurtful lusts,

217
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,500
which drown men in destruction and perdition.

218
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,059
Verse 10, for the love of money.

219
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:24,539
It doesn't say for money.

220
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:28,340
It says the love of money is the root of all evil,

221
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,979
which while some coveted after,

222
00:09:30,979 --> 00:09:32,659
they have erred from the faith

223
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:35,539
and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

224
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:37,059
And so we look at this truth

225
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:40,059
with regard to contentment, verse six and seven,

226
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:43,140
but godliness with contentment is great gain,

227
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,099
for we brought nothing into this world

228
00:09:45,099 --> 00:09:47,500
and this certainly can carry nothing out.

229
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,820
We find that Paul then says to Timothy,

230
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,059
flee these things.

231
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:56,140
You understand that Timothy,

232
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,580
though he's not a young man, like as a teenager,

233
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,419
he still.

234
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:08,259
is younger, as Paul refers to him as a youth. He's probably about 35, 40 years old, really,

235
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:12,579
in this portion of scripture when it's being written to him. But we find that he's still

236
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:18,339
younger. But you understand that there is, if you think about the young people here this morning,

237
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:26,419
there is a perspective, a worldview that is painted for them that they are to seek after

238
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:33,619
and follow after wealth and riches, and that's their driving force. I remember when I first

239
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:39,219
shared with my grandfather, who passed away a number of years ago, that God was calling me to

240
00:10:39,219 --> 00:10:44,579
the ministry, and I believe that God wanted me to pastor. And I remember his first response to me

241
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:52,819
was this, does it pay well? That was his perspective. That was his thought. And we

242
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:58,339
find here that Paul says to Timothy to flee these things. What are these things? Well, really,

243
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:04,979
these are temporary things. These are temporal things. And we find as a man of God, or as a

244
00:11:04,979 --> 00:11:11,459
woman of God, we should be not focused on those things which are temporary, those things which

245
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:18,899
in a moment can fade away, can flee away. We find that we ought to be eternally focused.

246
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:24,979
And so the apostle Paul, as he's writing to Timothy, he says, listen, flee these things. We

247
00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:29,459
understand that he doesn't simply say to avoid them, but to flee them. There had to be some

248
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:35,939
great pressure, some great influence there with regard to those that were seeking, that will be

249
00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:43,059
rich, those that were loving money, and they were, this attitude, this worldview was being developed.

250
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:51,219
And Paul says to Timothy, flee these things. Actively make a decision that you will flee

251
00:11:51,219 --> 00:11:56,899
from these things. Notice with me that Paul says, he gives instruction to flee. Number two, the

252
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:03,779
instruction to follow, the instruction to follow. I think it's a great contrast that we find in our

253
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:08,499
text of scripture between these things that are referenced, which would be the riches that are

254
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:15,219
spoken of in verses 9 and 10, with that which we're to follow after. As Timothy being again

255
00:12:15,219 --> 00:12:21,459
referred to as this man of God, he has a higher calling, a higher plane, if you will. We sing the

256
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:27,299
song, higher ground. Lord, plant my feet on higher ground, right? And we think about the importance,

257
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:33,219
Paul mentions it in the book of 2 Corinthians, about having an eternal perspective and not

258
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:39,699
a temporal perspective, and we find that this instruction is given to follow. So, understand

259
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:44,499
with me this morning, he says, flee these things. There's some things that you're to flee, but then

260
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:52,339
follow after these things. By the way, every time we take something out of our life, we ought to

261
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:58,259
replace it with something that is appropriate and biblical, something that is God honoring.

262
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:03,859
God doesn't just say, flee these things, and then there's a void. God says, flee these things

263
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:09,459
because you're following these things. By the way, if I'm actively following what I'm supposed

264
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:15,219
to be following after, then at the same time I'm fleeing the things that I'm not supposed to be

265
00:13:15,219 --> 00:13:21,539
following. Does that make sense? I cannot follow after the things that are mentioned here, while

266
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:28,659
at the same time following the things that he says to flee. So, I'm fleeing, but I'm following.

267
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:37,219
And we find here in verse number 11, he says, follow after righteousness, godliness, faith,

268
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:46,339
love, patience, and meekness. As we look at these particular words that are given, six things

269
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:53,059
that Paul instructs Timothy with regard to what he is to follow after, I want you to find this

270
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:59,379
morning how this helps to shape and to mold a direction of an individual. We find this morning

271
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:05,379
that we're to seek after God, we're to follow after the Lord, and he says here, follow after

272
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:13,699
righteousness, that which is right. I understand today that there are some that have sought to

273
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:20,019
redefine what is right and what is wrong, what is holy and what is evil, and we find that even

274
00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:26,819
today this is nothing new. This is something that's been going on for centuries. We find that

275
00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:32,339
all the way back as Jeremiah and Isaiah are prophesying in Israel and Judah that they call

276
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:40,099
evil good and good evil, and we find today that we live in that type of situation where we have

277
00:14:40,099 --> 00:14:47,219
had those individuals seek to redefine what is right. Can I tell you this morning that God defines

278
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:54,579
what is right? We find that God defines what is good and what is right, and he says follow after

279
00:14:55,299 --> 00:15:03,219
righteousness, that which is right, that which is pleasing to God, that which is right in the eyes

280
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:09,859
of our God, of our Savior. Follow after righteousness. Notice he not only says

281
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:16,259
righteousness, but then he says godliness, the things of God, the things of God.

282
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:23,219
You understand that Timothy, again, being a born-again believer, being a child of God,

283
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:30,339
that he is to follow after righteousness, but also godliness, the things of God. You know,

284
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:36,739
the reality this morning is that we can be about our own business or we can be about our Father's

285
00:15:36,739 --> 00:15:41,779
business. You think about what Jesus said. He said he was about his Father's business,

286
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:48,499
and this morning we must understand that we need to be following after godliness, the things

287
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:55,699
that are of God, the things that pertain to God that were about our Father's business.

288
00:15:56,659 --> 00:16:02,419
As we look at our lives, as we examine our lives, and we begin to use this list of these six items

289
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:07,059
that are given to us this morning that we're to follow after, we could, at each point,

290
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:15,539
examine our own lives and say, am I following after, am I pursuing righteousness, godliness?

291
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:23,539
Notice number three, faith. The Bible tells us that the just shall live by faith.

292
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:30,819
The simplest definition that I know that I could give you of faith is taking God at His word,

293
00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:35,219
just believing God. Paul stood up in the book of Acts when they're dealing with

294
00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:42,899
a great storm in Acts 27, and all hope that they should live was gone, and it was as if they were

295
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:48,659
certain they would perish, and we find that God sends and gives Him word that they would be spared,

296
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:53,379
that there would be destruction of the ship, but no lives would be lost, and Paul stands up,

297
00:16:53,379 --> 00:17:02,659
and he makes this bold statement. He says, I believe God, that it shall be. It's going to be

298
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:09,779
just as God said it would be, and this morning we must have faith. We must believe God. In fact,

299
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:13,619
in the book of Hebrews, in the 11th chapter, a passage of scripture that we've often referred

300
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:19,459
to as being the hall of faith chapter, we see how God lists throughout that portion of scripture,

301
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:25,059
by faith this individual did this, and by faith this individual did this. What did they do? They

302
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:33,779
believed God. They simply acted in obedience. They responded in faith that God would do what God said

303
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:40,419
He would do. How do we get faith? Well, faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

304
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:45,299
We must be in the Bible. We must be in the scriptures if we're going to have our faith

305
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:51,779
increased, and if we're going to live by faith. Hebrews 11, I referenced a moment ago, but verse

306
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:59,699
number six says this, that without faith it is impossible to please Him, to please God,

307
00:17:59,699 --> 00:18:04,979
for he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that

308
00:18:04,979 --> 00:18:12,099
diligently seek Him, and we find this morning, listen, we're to live by faith. It pleases God

309
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:19,779
when we live by faith, not by sight. We live by faith, and I'm so thankful this morning. I want

310
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:24,739
you to think about what God says, the Lord Jesus Christ says to Thomas. Hold your place here in the

311
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:29,699
book of 1 Timothy, and turn to the book of John, if you will, and I want you to see what we read

312
00:18:29,699 --> 00:18:36,820
here in John chapter number 20, and I want you to think about this truth, and we oftentimes, we

313
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:42,419
are familiar with Thomas. In fact, many times we'll be referred to as being doubting Thomas. You've

314
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:49,139
heard that phraseology that's been given to him, and we find that Thomas, he makes this statement

315
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:55,219
because he was not where he should have been, and Jesus showed up, and the disciples tell him

316
00:18:55,219 --> 00:19:01,539
about Jesus being there, and he wasn't there to see it, and he says this, I will not believe.

317
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:09,059
Wow, what a statement at the end of verse number 25. After eight days again, verse number 26,

318
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:14,260
his disciples were within, and notice the Bible says, and Thomas with them. That's just always

319
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:19,779
of interest to me. The Holy Spirit includes those words, and Thomas with them. He wasn't

320
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:24,820
going to miss it again. The Bible says this, then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the

321
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:31,539
midst, and said, peace be unto you. Then saith he to Thomas, now I love this. You know why I love

322
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:38,419
this so much, is because God wants to see our faith increased. He wants us to believe. Do you

323
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:48,099
remember Gideon? God comes to Gideon and says, thou mighty man of valor. The Midianites, a great

324
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:54,099
host of people that were oppressing the children of Israel at that time, he says he's going to

325
00:19:54,099 --> 00:20:00,179
provide deliverance through Gideon. Gideon's like, you got the wrong guy. Gideon had small faith.

326
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,619
But you know what God did for Gideon?

327
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,179
He built his faith.

328
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:09,739
You can look through those portions of Scripture and you can see in Judges 6 and 7 how that

329
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:14,859
Gideon's faith is increased and God doesn't get angry with Gideon for saying, I'm going

330
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:16,579
to put this fleece out and let...

331
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:18,459
No, God doesn't get mad at Gideon.

332
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:20,379
You know what God does?

333
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:23,019
He builds his faith.

334
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:27,379
We have a God who is so gracious, who is so kind.

335
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:29,979
We have a God who knows our frame.

336
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:34,899
He wants us to be people of faith and here we find that Jesus, he goes to Thomas and

337
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:41,259
notice what he says, reach hither thy finger, behold my hands and reach hither thy hand

338
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:47,859
and thrust it into my side and be not faithless, but believing.

339
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:52,899
Thomas answered and said unto him, my Lord and my God.

340
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:54,939
By the way, Jesus didn't rebuke him.

341
00:20:54,939 --> 00:20:55,939
Why?

342
00:20:55,939 --> 00:20:56,939
Because he's God.

343
00:20:57,499 --> 00:21:00,979
If you came up here and said to me, my Lord and my God, I'd stop you in a heartless and

344
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:04,859
I am not, but Jesus is God.

345
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:12,939
So when Thomas says, my Lord and my God, Thomas is not rebuked for that because it's the truth.

346
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:20,419
But I want you to notice what Jesus says in verse 29, Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because

347
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:24,539
thou hast seen me, thou hast believed.

348
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:28,379
What are they that have not seen and yet have believed?

349
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:32,819
I want you to understand this morning that God wants us to be people of faith.

350
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:38,019
He wants us to have faith that God is real, that God's on his throne, that we believe

351
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:39,019
this book.

352
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:42,699
I preached a message on Wednesday evening, the totality of scripture and dealing with

353
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:48,979
the fact that Paul says, I believe all things that are written in the law and in the prophets

354
00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:55,499
and the importance that we understand that we take God at his word, that we believe God.

355
00:21:55,499 --> 00:21:56,859
What are we to follow after?

356
00:21:56,859 --> 00:22:01,019
Righteousness, godliness, faith, notice love.

357
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:05,939
Back in 1 Timothy 6 and verse number 11, he says, not only to follow after righteousness,

358
00:22:05,939 --> 00:22:08,659
godliness and faith, but also to follow after love.

359
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:14,619
There's a whole chapter, 1 Corinthians 13, that's committed to charity or to love.

360
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:19,259
And we understand that Jesus said this as the end of John, chapter number 13, he says,

361
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:21,299
a new commandment I give you.

362
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:28,219
What is this new commandment I give unto you that you love not in the same way that you

363
00:22:28,219 --> 00:22:31,219
love yourself, but as I have loved?

364
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:36,539
See, in the Old Testament, love your neighbor as thyself, but in the New Testament, we find

365
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:38,699
that he says, love as I have loved.

366
00:22:38,699 --> 00:22:39,699
It's amazing.

367
00:22:39,699 --> 00:22:45,099
He says, by this, by what, by your love one for another, you'll know, all men will know

368
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:47,699
that you are my disciples.

369
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,539
First John deals with it very plainly.

370
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:55,219
Don't say that you love God, but you don't love your brethren.

371
00:22:55,219 --> 00:22:59,859
How can you love God if you don't love your brethren?

372
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:02,859
We find this morning that here he says love.

373
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:07,500
Now understand with me, I believe that as we're pursuing love, that first and foremost,

374
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,539
we're speaking about love for God, love for God.

375
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:17,339
We're to love him with every part of our being, love him supremely.

376
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:22,259
Now understand this morning that when we say that we love the Lord, we love him because

377
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:24,779
he first loved us.

378
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,779
I wasn't seeking him, he was seeking me.

379
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:30,500
He's been so gracious and so merciful and so loving.

380
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:36,139
And we find that John, first John in the fourth chapter deals very plainly with this truth

381
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:40,179
that I love him because he first loved me.

382
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:41,179
What a joy.

383
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:46,979
Listen, if we love him, first John continues, then we're to keep his commandments.

384
00:23:46,979 --> 00:23:50,539
By the way, John in chapter 14 deals with that as well.

385
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:53,099
If you love me, keep my commandments.

386
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:59,179
That is the demonstration, that is the evidence of our love for God.

387
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:03,579
People can run around and say they love God, they can say whatever they want to say, but

388
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:11,859
the reality is, does the evidence bring forth the truth that we love God?

389
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:16,579
So we're pursuing, we're following after love, love first and foremost for God, but also

390
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:19,459
love for people, love for people.

391
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:24,459
I can't love people the way I'm supposed to love people and you can't love people the

392
00:24:24,459 --> 00:24:28,739
way you're supposed to love people if we're not walking in the Spirit.

393
00:24:28,739 --> 00:24:35,220
It is God who, his Holy Spirit sheds his love through us to others.

394
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,940
I can't love like I'm supposed to love without the help of the Holy Spirit.

395
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:46,979
By the way, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, so on and so forth.

396
00:24:46,979 --> 00:24:51,259
And so we find that the fruit of the Spirit is love.

397
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:52,259
What does Paul say?

398
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:57,619
Look in 1 Corinthians 13, as I mentioned a moment ago, this chapter that is dedicated

399
00:24:57,619 --> 00:25:03,419
to charity, notice the Bible says this in 1 Corinthians 13, I mean, he lists through

400
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:08,699
it, we don't have time to go through every verse and give, expound upon it, but Paul

401
00:25:08,699 --> 00:25:12,500
says in 1 Corinthians 13 and verse number 1, though I speak with the tongues of men

402
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:19,459
and of angels and have not charity, I am become a sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.

403
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:23,739
Though I have the gift of prophecy, verse 2, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge,

404
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:28,579
and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity, I

405
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:34,779
am nothing, verse number 3, and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though

406
00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:40,979
I give my body to be burned and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.

407
00:25:40,979 --> 00:25:47,100
He then goes on in the next few verses to explain, to describe detail what charity,

408
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:53,100
what love is, it suffereth long, it is kind, it envieth not, it vaunteth not itself, is

409
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:59,179
not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked,

410
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:05,940
thinketh no evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things,

411
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,220
believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.

412
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:15,639
Charity, you know what it says, never faileth.

413
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:21,059
Now it says this, but whether they be prophecies, they shall fail.

414
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,539
Whether they be tongues, they shall cease.

415
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,459
Whether they be knowledge, it shall vanish away.

416
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:31,539
But charity, notice the end of verse number 13, but the greatest of these is charity.

417
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:35,579
I believe that as you study the book of 1 Thessalonians and you begin to see a little

418
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:39,899
bit of the heart of the Apostle Paul, we won't take time to look at any verses there, but

419
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:44,579
if you study the life of the Apostle Paul and his ministry to the believers in Thessalonica,

420
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:49,539
I believe that you see something abundantly clear in the book of 1 Thessalonians.

421
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:54,979
You know what it is, I think that you see, is that Paul loved the people of Thessalonica.

422
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:55,979
He cared about them.

423
00:26:55,979 --> 00:27:00,419
It was genuine love for those people in Thessalonica.

424
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:05,339
And you know, because he loved them and because they knew that he loved them, he was able

425
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:08,859
to effectively minister to them.

426
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:13,259
He was able to help them grow in their walk with Christ.

427
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:14,259
Why?

428
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:15,259
Because he loved them.

429
00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:20,619
We find that here, Paul says, there's some things that you're to flee, but let me give

430
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:26,660
you some things you're to follow, righteousness, godliness, faith, love.

431
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:32,820
Notice back in 1 Timothy chapter 6, the fifth one that's listed, patience, patience.

432
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,660
Long-suffering is how it's worded in the fruit of the Spirit in Galatians chapter number

433
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,940
5, and you see it there.

434
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,619
But we find here that he says patience.

435
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:46,899
You think about this truth of being patient, and I've heard all sorts of things about people

436
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:51,820
that talk about patience and you should never pray for patience and all this kind of thing,

437
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,799
but the reality is that I'm thankful that our God is long-suffering, I'm thankful that

438
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:02,019
our God is patient toward us, and we too ought to be long-suffering and we ought to be patient.

439
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:06,779
Again, it's not a work in my own flesh, it's not a work in your flesh, it's the Holy Spirit

440
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:11,199
of God working through us.

441
00:28:11,199 --> 00:28:16,119
As I think about this verse here in 1 Timothy chapter 6 and verse number 11 with the idea

442
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:19,720
of patience, it's waiting for God to work.

443
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,600
Have you found in your life that God's work is not always done on your timeline, on your

444
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
timetable?

445
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,759
I mean, honestly, have you found it to be the case in your life that God's work is not

446
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:35,320
always done on your timetable or on my timetable?

447
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:40,640
But can I tell you this morning that God's work is always done on time?

448
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,200
God's doing a work, and we need to be patient as God is working.

449
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:51,320
I say often as the psalmist says in Psalm 119, it is time, Lord, for you to work.

450
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:57,799
I mean, it is time for God to work, but the reality is that God is working, God is working.

451
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:02,679
You know, there are times that God's working and we don't even see how God is working.

452
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:05,339
There are times that God's working on the other end.

453
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:08,880
You're praying for an individual, maybe you're not seeing the results that you'd like to

454
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,719
see because the timeline is not your timeline, but it's God's timeline, but we can rest

455
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:17,080
in the fact that God is at work.

456
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,739
We have to have patience.

457
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:25,960
I'm thankful as I think about Timothy and his responsibility as it was outlined at the

458
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:32,559
end of chapter number five and all of chapter number four is his responsibility as a pastor,

459
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:38,080
as an elder there in Ephesus, the job that he was given to do, that he was going to have

460
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,820
the need for patience, for long-suffering.

461
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:50,039
You say people annoy me, well, you annoy people, amen?

462
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:57,000
The reality is that we can't get so distracted with that and become impatient.

463
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,520
No, we pray that God would do a work.

464
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,680
Is God able?

465
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,680
Sure He is.

466
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,800
We sang this morning, He is able to deliver thee.

467
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,800
Is God sovereign?

468
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,800
Yes.

469
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
Is God all-powerful?

470
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
Yes.

471
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:14,880
Is there the need of the individual to surrender themselves and yield themselves?

472
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,240
Absolutely.

473
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,120
But God is at work.

474
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:24,720
You know, sometimes I feel like we pray at times, although we reject Calvinism, there

475
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,520
are times in which we almost pray like we're Calvinist.

476
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,520
What do I mean by that?

477
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,440
Lord, would you save that person?

478
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,520
God wants to save the person, but the person has to trust Christ as their Savior.

479
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:44,480
But sometimes we pray almost like we're Calvinistic in our prayer, instead of understanding the

480
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,120
need for the individual to respond to the gospel that's been presented.

481
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,920
Oftentimes I pray, if I know that there's someone that's not saved and I've been sharing

482
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,240
the gospel with them and there's a heavy burden to see them saved, I'll pray that

483
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,720
God will allow someone else to cross into their path, that maybe the individual's taking

484
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,160
a flight, and you know how awesome it would be for the person right next to them on the

485
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,640
airplane to be a Christian that speaks up and shares the gospel on that.

486
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,080
Listen, it is a time in which God would give you a unique opportunity.

487
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,280
I heard a story about an individual that he'd always get on the plane at the end, and he'd

488
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,520
get on the plane, he always wore the same shirt when he was flying, he flew quite a

489
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:30,560
bit, and he would walk down the center aisle after everyone's getting seated, and he had

490
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:36,840
written on his shirt, if you want to go to heaven, come talk to me.

491
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,280
And he'd walk down the aisle, he'd try to get to the furthest to the back of the plane

492
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,920
he could possibly get to, and he'd try to stop and make sure everyone could read his

493
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,640
shirt.

494
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:51,880
And that man testified of many, many opportunities that God gave him to be able to share the

495
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:57,680
gospel with individuals because of wearing a shirt that said that.

496
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:04,240
But I pray that God would work and that God would send a coworker, a friend, a neighbor,

497
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,560
someone to bring the gospel.

498
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:11,360
So we have to be patient, knowing that God is working.

499
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,240
Sometimes we want God to hurry up and work, and we say, this is not my timeline, this

500
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:21,840
is not the timing that I had planned, but we must have patience.

501
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,720
We must have patience.

502
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:30,040
Notice finally he says this, meekness, meekness.

503
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:37,320
Some have wrongly concluded that meekness is weakness.

504
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,320
Meekness is not weakness.

505
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,880
To be meek is not to be weak.

506
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,000
In fact, meek is really power under control.

507
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,880
In fact, as we look at this truth of meekness here and we think about the truth that our

508
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,800
Lord Jesus Christ, he was meek.

509
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,480
He was not weak, but he was meek.

510
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,840
We think about the Old Testament and Moses.

511
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,560
Moses was meek.

512
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,840
The Bible tells us that.

513
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,520
He was not weak, but he was meek as a leader.

514
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:13,960
And Timothy would have this responsibility as he would fulfill the role that God gave

515
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:19,680
him to fulfill, to follow after these things, righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience,

516
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:26,400
and meekness, to have gentleness or mildness in the manner in which he ministered.

517
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,560
See, look at 1 Peter chapter 5, if you will.

518
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:36,160
Here's the flip side of the coin, if you will, with regard to this instruction to follow

519
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,760
after meekness.

520
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:43,640
We find that in 1 Peter chapter 5, Peter is writing to the elders which are among you

521
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,200
and he's giving them an exhortation.

522
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,800
He's giving them some instruction.

523
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:53,680
And notice in verse number 1 of 1 Peter 5, as Peter is providing again under the inspiration

524
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,320
of the Holy Spirit of God this truth, he says, the elders which are among you I exhort who

525
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,880
am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the glory

526
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:10,200
that shall be revealed, feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight

527
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:17,160
thereof, but then notice this, not by constraint but willingly, not for filthy lucre but of

528
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:23,760
a ready mind, neither as being lords over God's heritage but being in samples to the

529
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,960
flock.

530
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
That's meekness.

531
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:35,120
See you've heard there's been charges that have been raised against those that are dictators

532
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:40,680
as far as being leaders, the pastor is a dictator type of a leader.

533
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:50,280
No, God says meekness, not as being lords over God's heritage.

534
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,880
Understand that the people that are saved are God's people.

535
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,200
I'm thankful I belong to God, aren't you?

536
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,880
And here, as Paul would give this instruction to Timothy, he says, listen, you need to flee

537
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,860
these things, why?

538
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:13,240
Because you have a higher calling, a higher plane, these temporal things, the seeking,

539
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:18,720
the being driven to be rich, the love for money, no, flee those things and follow after

540
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:25,280
righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience and meekness.

541
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,760
And then number three this morning, he says, not only is there instruction to flee and

542
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,640
instruction to follow, but number three, the instruction to fight the good fight.

543
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,720
Notice, it doesn't just say fight.

544
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,320
I'm thankful for that.

545
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,420
It says fight the good fight of faith.

546
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,720
Fight the good fight of faith.

547
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:53,060
We're not just fighting to fight, but we are to fight the good fight of faith.

548
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,380
We are to earnestly contend for the faith.

549
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:01,620
We are to be able to stand and give an answer for why we believe the things that we believe

550
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:07,020
and understanding that God has given us the word of God.

551
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:12,900
And here, Paul says, of course, you know that there have been many references already in

552
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,300
this book with regard to the false teachers that are at Ephesus and their activity and

553
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:25,660
all that's taking place, and so now Paul says to Timothy, fight the good fight of faith.

554
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:30,900
It's often been said, it's a battleground, not a playground.

555
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,140
It's a battleground, not a playground.

556
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:39,260
I think Tozer was the first one that coined that phrase, at least as best I can tell,

557
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:45,300
and many after that have repeated that phrase and how appropriate it is.

558
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,540
We won't take the time this morning, but if you look at Ephesians chapter 6 and look

559
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:56,020
at verses 10 through 17, you can see the detail with regard to the fight, the battle, the

560
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,180
spiritual battle that we're engaged in.

561
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,780
It's a battleground, not a playground.

562
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:07,500
Therefore, Paul is instructing Timothy to fight the good fight of faith.

563
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,220
It's interesting to me that in the next letter that we'll begin studying here in a few weeks

564
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:19,180
on Sunday mornings that Paul says to Timothy in 2 Timothy chapter number 2, he tells him,

565
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:24,540
Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus and the things that

566
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,780
thou hast heard of me among many witnesses.

567
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:30,940
The same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also.

568
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:37,700
Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

569
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:42,860
O man, that warreth and tangleth himself with the affairs of this life, that he may

570
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:47,260
please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

571
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,620
Those verses of Scripture go perfect with what we're looking at in 1 Timothy 6 verses

572
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,100
11 and 12.

573
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:58,500
The one that's warring, the good soldier that's going to endure hardness, he's not going to

574
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,820
entangle himself with the things, the affairs of this world, verses 9 and 10 in 1 Timothy

575
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:09,300
chapter 6, but he's going to seek after, he's going to follow after why that he might

576
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:14,020
please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

577
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:22,640
And oh, as we look here at this truth of the battleground that we're engaged in, this battle

578
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,540
that's raging all around us.

579
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:33,540
Many today have tried to use various terms to describe the battle.

580
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:38,220
Cultural wars, social wars, you name whatever it might be, political wars.

581
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,020
I want you to understand it's spiritual war.

582
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,020
It is spiritual war.

583
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,820
And we're engaged in spiritual warfare.

584
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:51,619
I'm thankful that Paul, as he's writing to the church in Corinth, that our weapons are

585
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:52,619
not carnal.

586
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:56,140
No, they're spiritual.

587
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:01,980
Can I tell you that we must recognize that we're fighting a spiritual battle.

588
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,020
We wrestle not against flesh and blood, according to Ephesians 6.

589
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,900
We wrestle against spiritual wickedness in high places.

590
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:14,460
And can I tell you this morning, every day of your life you better put on the whole armor

591
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:18,520
of God because there's not a day off in this battle.

592
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,980
There's not a day off in this battle.

593
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:26,500
And the day that you think that there's a day off is the day that the enemy will fire

594
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:31,140
as many fiery darts at you as he possibly can fire.

595
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:35,140
You say, oh, I wish I had the shield of faith that can quench all the fiery darts.

596
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,860
No, I went out without the armor on.

597
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,739
Put on the whole armor of God.

598
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:44,020
Be strong in the Lord and the power of His might.

599
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,020
It's a battleground.

600
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:51,140
Notice in verse number 12 of 1 Timothy 6, he says, fight the good fight of faith.

601
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:57,220
But then he gives this following truth that's so important for us to understand.

602
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,460
He says, lay hold.

603
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:04,460
on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called

604
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,040
and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.

605
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,500
This phraseology of lay hold on eternal life,

606
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,980
it's not the idea of getting saved,

607
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,600
it's the idea that because you are saved,

608
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:20,600
you are a possessor of eternal life, now live like it.

609
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,580
Lay hold on eternal life.

610
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,720
Listen, we are more than conquerors through him.

611
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,900
We are, as the song says, and Curtis Hudson

612
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,120
used to sing it so often, we are on the winning side.

613
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:38,840
And the reality is that we sing the song victory in Jesus,

614
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,040
but thanks be to God, 1 Corinthians 15,

615
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,520
which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

616
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,440
1 Corinthians 15 and verse 57.

617
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,040
This morning he says lay hold on eternal life.

618
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,960
It's not get saved, it's the fact that you are saved.

619
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,200
We are a possessor of eternal life.

620
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,000
As a possessor of eternal life,

621
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,200
we need to live our lives in that fashion.

622
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,640
I'm saved, I'm a child of God.

623
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,140
I live different than I used to live.

624
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,200
I know for many of us here this morning,

625
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,080
we can remember how we lived before we got saved.

626
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,560
I can remember how I lived before I got saved.

627
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,080
And I think if you'd be honest this morning,

628
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,320
if you got saved, if you were old enough

629
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,040
when you got saved to have lived a certain way

630
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,720
and can recall that, there should be a contrast,

631
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,760
a difference in your life as a believer,

632
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,640
as a possessor of eternal life.

633
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,560
I'm so thankful that I'm going to heaven one day,

634
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,440
but we need to live like we're possessors of eternal life.

635
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,420
It's interesting that then Paul says this,

636
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,400
lay hold on eternal life.

637
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,240
Then he says this,

638
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,760
were unto thou art also called

639
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:59,760
and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.

640
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,800
Now, I love the end of verse number 12

641
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,520
because what Paul is saying to Timothy

642
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,520
at the end of verse number 12,

643
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,120
he's really referring to the testimony of Timothy.

644
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,320
He's saying to Timothy,

645
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,520
you have professed a good profession before many witnesses.

646
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,280
You have lived a life.

647
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,540
You have passed a test, so to speak.

648
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,680
Your testimony is known.

649
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,600
But can I tell you this?

650
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,840
We can't live in the past.

651
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,320
We can't live in the past.

652
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,080
Timothy, you have, he says this,

653
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:33,080
thou hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.

654
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,560
I wish I could have had the time to deal with the entirety

655
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,560
of this passage of scripture in one week.

656
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,200
So I hope you come back next week

657
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,120
so that you can find the followup to this.

658
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,220
He says, I give thee charge in the sight of God,

659
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,680
according to verse number 13.

660
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,320
And we find that he tells him

661
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,280
that he's to keep on doing these things

662
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,160
until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.

663
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,520
See, it's great, Timothy,

664
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,040
that you have this good profession before many witnesses,

665
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,760
but don't stop.

666
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,200
Understanding that your testimony continues to be important

667
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,680
and you must continue to profess this good profession

668
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,440
before those that you come in contact with.

669
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,440
You know, there's some people, Obadiah,

670
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,480
if you remember, not the prophet Obadiah,

671
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,240
but the one that was working with Ahab

672
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,880
when Elijah was on the run.

673
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,680
Remember, God hid Elijah.

674
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,160
And he says, well, do you know what I've done?

675
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,440
Do you know how many I hid?

676
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,740
Do you know how I?

677
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,420
Listen, sometimes we can live in the past.

678
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,640
Let me tell you what I used to do.

679
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,740
Let me tell you how I used to.

680
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,080
No, we need to live in the present.

681
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,040
Notice the testimony of this man, Timothy.

682
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,560
Paul says you have, at the end of verse number 12,

683
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,520
and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.

684
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,080
Notice in 1 Corinthians chapter four,

685
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,120
I'm gonna look at just a couple of verses quickly

686
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,600
to look at the testimony of Timothy.

687
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:58,560
In 1 Corinthians chapter four, in verse number 17,

688
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,640
Paul is writing to the church in Corinth,

689
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,000
and here's what he says.

690
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,840
For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus,

691
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,960
who is my beloved son and faithful in the Lord,

692
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,920
who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways,

693
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,560
which be in Christ as I teach everywhere in every church.

694
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,860
So Paul is saying I'm sending, I have sent Timothy to you,

695
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,320
and here's the testimony of Timothy.

696
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:29,120
He is my beloved son, he is faithful in the Lord,

697
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,760
and he's going to be able to bring you in remembrance

698
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,720
of the things that I taught.

699
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,100
Wow, that's why Paul said I can send Timothy to Corinth.

700
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,520
Notice in Philippians chapter number two,

701
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,400
Paul sends Timothy to the church in Philippi,

702
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,300
and we find that as Paul would give

703
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,940
in Philippians chapter number two,

704
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:49,420
some of the reason that Timothy was being sent,

705
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,540
it helps us to understand this profession

706
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:56,940
that he had Timothy before many witnesses.

707
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,900
In Philippians chapter two, in verse 19,

708
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,180
Paul says, but I trust in the Lord Jesus

709
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,460
to send Timotheus shortly unto you,

710
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:07,780
that I also may be of good comfort when I know your state.

711
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:12,100
Notice what he says, he says, for I have no man like-minded

712
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:16,380
who will naturally care for your state.

713
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,000
For all seek their own, not the things

714
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,780
which are Jesus Christ, but ye know the proof of him.

715
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,620
Who's him?

716
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,540
Well, that's Timothy, go back to verse 19.

717
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,020
He says, you know the proof of him

718
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:28,420
that as a son with the father,

719
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:31,920
he hath served me in the gospel.

720
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,820
He said, I have no one else to send,

721
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:36,020
but I have Timothy to send.

722
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:39,660
And Paul, he desires to send Timothy,

723
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:43,420
he has this longing to be able to send Timothy, why?

724
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:48,060
Because Timothy had a testimony that was God-honoring.

725
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,860
We read in 1 Thessalonians chapter number three,

726
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,300
this truth with regard to Timothy

727
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,980
being sent to the church in Thessalonica.

728
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:00,580
Why is it that Paul would send Timothy

729
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,780
to the church in Thessalonica?

730
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:04,140
Well, the same reason he would send him to Corinth

731
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,220
and the same reason he'd send him to Philippi,

732
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,180
because he was faithful.

733
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:10,380
1 Thessalonians three, it says in verse number one,

734
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,380
wherefore, when we could no longer forbear,

735
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,740
we thought it good to be left at Athens alone

736
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:20,020
and sent Timotheus, our brother and minister of God

737
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,660
and our fellow labor in the gospel of Christ

738
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:27,660
to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith.

739
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,060
Timothy, he had lived a life

740
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:35,460
that was honoring to the Lord.

741
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,480
He's referred to in verse number 11,

742
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,680
O thou man of God.

743
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,800
But Timothy, don't live in the past.

744
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,220
You know, sometimes it's easy for us to live in the past.

745
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,200
Sometimes it will be referred to this way

746
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,760
as a group of people get together

747
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,960
and they talk about the good old days.

748
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,280
You ever hear people use that terminology?

749
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,200
And they're reminiscing

750
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,500
and they're talking about the good old days.

751
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,680
But I want you to understand that we have the present

752
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,120
and we must live in the present

753
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,500
as possessors of eternal life.

754
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,220
And we must live in the present,

755
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:16,220
fleeing those things and following after these things

756
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,460
and understanding that God says

757
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,700
to fight the good fight of faith.

758
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,180
It is an active, listen, in each of these instances,

759
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,420
there is instruction that is given.

760
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,140
There is a decision that has to be made.

761
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,420
And it's in the present that you're going to flee.

762
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,520
You're going to follow.

763
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,060
You're going to fight.

764
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:40,440
This morning, Paul, we know, fought the good fight.

765
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,160
He's able to say at the end of 2 Timothy chapter number four

766
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,000
about the fact that he had finished.

767
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,560
He says in verse number seven, I have fought a good fight.

768
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,320
I have finished my course.

769
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,400
I have kept the faith.

770
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,520
You know what I believe Paul's desire was for Timothy?

771
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,640
Was that Timothy could say the same thing.

772
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,120
That Timothy could say, I have fought a good fight.

773
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,940
You know what my desire is for my life

774
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:09,460
is that I would be able to say, I have fought a good fight.

775
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,180
But you know what my desire is for your life

776
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,620
is that you too would be able to say,

777
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:16,620
I have fought a good fight.

778
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:19,320
That we would live our lives in such a way

779
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,280
that Christ is exalted and magnified,

780
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,860
that he alone is pleased.

781
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,740
That we would take the truth of his word,

782
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,160
apply it in our lives, be doers of the word,

783
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,840
and please him.

784
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,940
So that we would not be ashamed as appearing,

785
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:39,940
no, that we would be able to say, as Paul said,

786
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,619
I have fought a good fight.

787
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:46,080
I have finished my course.

788
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,420
I have kept the faith.

789
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:49,420
Can I tell you this morning,

790
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,260
it's not going to happen by accident.

791
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,460
It's not going to happen by chance.

792
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:57,040
You must actively make some decisions.

793
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,460
You must flee these things.

794
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,360
You must follow these things,

795
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,840
and you must fight the good fight of faith.

796
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,420
One day, every single one of us are gonna stand before God.

797
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,500
Absolutely, every single one of us gonna stand before God.

798
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,000
I've seen people in the store wear a shirt or a hat

799
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,540
that says only God can judge me.

800
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:21,240
I don't know if you've ever seen someone wearing that.

801
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,059
But when I see it, it actually breaks my heart

802
00:49:23,059 --> 00:49:26,240
because the reality is that God will judge them one day.

803
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,020
God will judge me knowing the terror of the Lord,

804
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,179
1 Corinthians, or 2 Corinthians 4.

805
00:49:31,179 --> 00:49:32,900
We persuade men.

806
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,619
Listen, we're gonna stand before God.

807
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:39,660
And I wonder today, I hope you're saved,

808
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,720
but I hope you're living for Christ,

809
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,420
making that active decision.

810
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,320
There's some things I need to flee.

811
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,140
There's some things I need to follow.

812
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:47,980
Why?

813
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,960
Because I'm a possessor of eternal life.

814
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,900
I am saved by the blood of the Lamb.

815
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,559
I am heaven bound, and I need to live like a Christian.

816
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,840
Flee, follow, fight.

817
00:49:58,840 --> 00:49:59,679
Let's pray.

818
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:04,039
Father we love you. Thank you for loving us. Thank you for the opportunity to study your

819
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:08,299
word this morning. Thank you for the example, the testimony of Timothy. I pray that you'd

820
00:50:08,299 --> 00:50:13,279
help us to have a testimony like Timothy. Lord, help us to be able to say, as Paul said

821
00:50:13,279 --> 00:50:18,519
at the end of his life, the time of my departure is at hand. But he said this, I have fought

822
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:23,159
a good fight. I finished my course. I have kept the faith. And Lord, I pray that you'd

823
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:31,039
help us, as we are challenged with these commands, these instructions this morning,

824
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:36,839
to flee, follow, and fight. Lord, help us to be doers of the word. If there's one not

825
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:41,639
sure of heaven, God, I pray that the Holy Spirit of God would convict them and convince

826
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:46,519
them of their need for Christ, that they would not leave here today without knowing for sure

827
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:51,239
that heaven is their home. I pray that you do a work in these moments of invitation and

828
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:55,119
we'll thank you for it. In Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are

829
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:59,119
bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano. And as she does,

830
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:00,079
the altar is open.
