1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
Baptist nap, you should be chipper and ready to go.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,659
And we had spaghetti and meatballs today

3
00:00:05,659 --> 00:00:07,019
and all the trimmings that went with it.

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:10,500
And we enjoyed a good meal over there at the pastor's house.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,460
I'll tell you what, his wife is gonna make me fat.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,379
One of the things that happens to us as we travel

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,659
is that we eat so much on the road.

8
00:00:18,659 --> 00:00:20,860
We're not big eaters, but when we are out

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,700
in the revival meetings, everybody wants to feed us.

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,780
And so you don't wanna be unkind

11
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,819
and you don't wanna be rude,

12
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:29,059
so eat everything in sight, amen?

13
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:31,700
And so we'll go back a little heavier than we came.

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,939
So I had to go back on some kind of a diet

15
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:36,580
and get on that exercise bike again, I guess.

16
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,860
But praise the Lord, we sure have been enjoying ourselves

17
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,659
with the mans and they've been gracious to us.

18
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:43,819
And it's a blessing to have the house over here.

19
00:00:43,819 --> 00:00:45,939
And they've got that nice prophet's chamber downstairs.

20
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:48,880
We're very comfortable down there and we're enjoying it.

21
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,479
And so we're thankful for that.

22
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:51,319
It's a blessing.

23
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:53,619
It's a nice little respite for us to get away

24
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:56,139
and be able to spend time together down there

25
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,180
during the course of the day.

26
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,020
And Lyndon and I have enjoyed that a great deal.

27
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,659
I want you to turn tonight to Jeremiah's Lament,

28
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:05,099
chapter three, Jeremiah's Lament, chapter three,

29
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,419
the book of Lamentations, chapter three in verse 22.

30
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,699
Jeremiah chapter three in verse, or Lamentations rather,

31
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,319
Lamentations chapter three in verse 22.

32
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,580
Familiar or past the scripture,

33
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,220
many of you may even have this memorized.

34
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,739
I know I do, but I do love this, these two verses.

35
00:01:24,739 --> 00:01:26,819
And we're gonna look at these tonight as we begin.

36
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,339
And if you would please, would you stand with me

37
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:30,220
out of respect for reading of God's holy

38
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,720
and foul on earth and inspired word, amen.

39
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,819
Lamentations chapter three in verse 22.

40
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:36,739
I'm gonna read two verses.

41
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:38,059
We'll pray.

42
00:01:38,059 --> 00:01:41,180
We'll get into the message that God has for us tonight.

43
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,839
The Bible says this, it is of the Lord's mercies.

44
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:48,980
It's of the Lord's mercies that we're not consumed.

45
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:51,160
Why?

46
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,260
Because his compassions fail not, amen.

47
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,139
Now, I like this.

48
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:58,300
It says they are new every morning.

49
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,480
So he's constantly renewing them.

50
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,500
They are new every morning.

51
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,940
And then he says this, great is thy faithfulness.

52
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,820
What a wonderful passage of scripture this is.

53
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,699
Let me read it again.

54
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,300
It's of the Lord's mercies that we're not consumed.

55
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,779
That we're not consumed because his compassions fail not.

56
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:19,779
They are new every morning, great is thy faithfulness.

57
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:22,220
I encourage myself with that.

58
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,820
It's listen, we serve a merciful God.

59
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:28,580
For God is good and his mercies endure forever.

60
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,500
Aren't you glad for that?

61
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,940
If we didn't have a merciful God,

62
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,899
I tell you where most of us would all be tonight.

63
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:37,020
I sure am glad he's merciful to us.

64
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,220
So we're gonna look at some things tonight.

65
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,020
I trust be a help, encouragement and blessing to you.

66
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,979
Father, we thank you for the reading of thy word.

67
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:43,139
Add your blessing now to it.

68
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:44,139
Help your servant tonight.

69
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:46,300
As I try to readily divide the word of truth,

70
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,380
please fill me with thy spirit, oh God.

71
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,380
And meet with us tonight.

72
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,259
I pray you to bind the strong man

73
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:53,339
as you put a hedge of protection about us tonight.

74
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,100
There will be no satanic disturbance here in this place.

75
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,660
The devil will not find any place in here tonight.

76
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,419
But God, I pray that you would just protect us

77
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:02,539
and give your angels charge over us.

78
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:03,779
Father, we thank you for the gathering

79
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:04,619
of your people tonight.

80
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:06,020
Bless our time together.

81
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,339
We'll thank you now for it in Jesus' precious

82
00:03:08,339 --> 00:03:09,460
and holy and wonderful name.

83
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,940
And this I do say, amen and amen.

84
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,179
Thank you, may be seated.

85
00:03:14,339 --> 00:03:17,979
Turn with me if you will please to Psalm 103.

86
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:19,259
Psalm 103.

87
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:22,259
Psalm 103.

88
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:26,860
Another great passage of scripture.

89
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,899
I love the Psalms.

90
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:28,940
It's a Psalm of David.

91
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,220
And of course, most of the Psalms were put to music.

92
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,139
This was God's hymn book.

93
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:35,460
And I mentioned to men yesterday

94
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,539
that the Psalms were written by David or Asaph.

95
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:39,460
And Psalm 90, as far as we know,

96
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,220
is the only Psalm written by Moses.

97
00:03:42,059 --> 00:03:43,500
And of course, the theme there

98
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,139
in the center of that Psalm is time.

99
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:47,539
Now, beloved, let me say this tonight

100
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:48,699
before I get moving here.

101
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:50,419
You know, we ought to be found redeeming the time

102
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:51,500
for the days of evil.

103
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,300
You know, we're inveterate time wasters, we Americans.

104
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,259
We waste a lot of time.

105
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:00,179
We waste a lot of time on things that really don't matter.

106
00:04:01,179 --> 00:04:02,020
I don't know what it was,

107
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,380
but when I turned 55 many years ago now,

108
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,940
I told the Lord, I said, Lord, listen,

109
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,940
I don't wanna be involved in anything that doesn't matter.

110
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,820
I don't wanna be involved in anything that wastes my time.

111
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,299
I don't wanna be involved in anything

112
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,459
that takes me away from the principle thing in life,

113
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,820
and that's living for you.

114
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,779
And so I made that promise to God,

115
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:26,140
and I don't know why it was, it happened at 55.

116
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,420
In fact, I heard Dr. Roloff say the same thing,

117
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,459
that when he turned 55, he said,

118
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:31,339
I just got to the point

119
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:33,179
where I just didn't wanna be found wasting time.

120
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:35,980
And yet, if you would look at Dr. Roloff's life,

121
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,980
all his life, he was busy for the Lord.

122
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,660
So I don't know what it was he thought was distracting him,

123
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,260
but he didn't seem to me like a distracted man.

124
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,019
But we are a distracted generation.

125
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,540
This is one of the most distracted generations

126
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,299
that I can think of in my lifetime.

127
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:55,899
And I'm sure that if we were to look at the sum total

128
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:59,500
of the years that we have been a nation,

129
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,859
and we look at our churches and look at God's people,

130
00:05:01,859 --> 00:05:04,420
I'd say that we've always had a certain amount

131
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,859
of distraction in every generation,

132
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:08,260
but this is a really distracted generation.

133
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,739
I'll give you several examples.

134
00:05:10,739 --> 00:05:12,140
One of them is social media.

135
00:05:13,619 --> 00:05:16,859
The social media is really bad for our time.

136
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:18,220
And my pastor says all the time,

137
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,299
you need to get off Facebook

138
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:22,260
and get your face in the book, amen?

139
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,420
And I think there's truth to that, and I use Facebook.

140
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,579
I post something on there every day.

141
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:28,260
I write little articles and I put them on there

142
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,779
and just share some thoughts every day on Facebook.

143
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:35,779
You can use those social media outlets for the glory of God,

144
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:38,619
but it can be a distraction.

145
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:41,859
You know, all the rest of it, TikTok and Instagram

146
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:44,220
and all the rest of that business, even the internet,

147
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,859
people get on the internet and spend all day

148
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:47,859
just roaming around and doing Google searches

149
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:49,660
for who knows what.

150
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,220
And then of course, there's the television

151
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,299
and there's movies and there's all kinds

152
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:55,779
of other distractions.

153
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:57,859
A lot of people have hobbies that take them away

154
00:05:57,859 --> 00:05:58,940
from the things of God.

155
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,339
Now there's nothing wrong with having hobbies.

156
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:04,899
I know a lot of people that are obsessive about golf,

157
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:06,899
and I can't understand that.

158
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,739
Bunch of grown men chasing a little ball around the field.

159
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:10,779
That's never figured for me,

160
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,339
but I know that people enjoy that game

161
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,339
and there's nothing wrong with that game.

162
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,739
But sports has become the God of America

163
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:19,700
and we know that people are so absorbed

164
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,540
and so immersed in sports.

165
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,380
It's sports, sports, sports.

166
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,459
When I got up here, I was with a rental car,

167
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:29,459
I'm looking for Christian radio stations

168
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:30,619
or something to listen to.

169
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:33,619
And I was doing the automatic seek on the radio

170
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:35,380
and it seemed like about every other station

171
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,339
was a sports station.

172
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:39,859
And they had ASPN one, two, three, four, and five

173
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:40,940
and whatever else today.

174
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,420
And so people are so absorbed with and saturated

175
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,100
by the things of this world.

176
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,859
I'm talking about God's people here

177
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:49,500
that we're a distracted generation.

178
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,980
And we need to get back to things of the Lord.

179
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,820
We need to focus on God, amen,

180
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,100
because we don't have a lot of time.

181
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,579
Bible says life's but a vapor.

182
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,380
And I mean, it just goes quick.

183
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,980
And you get down to the point where I'm at now

184
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,140
and some of the others here tonight that are older than me,

185
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,980
you look back at it and you say, man, where did it go?

186
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,339
And sometimes you wish you hadn't wasted

187
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:15,500
some of the time you wasted.

188
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,700
And so let's use God's time that he's given.

189
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,980
By the way, time is God's gift to us.

190
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,940
You get out of bed in the morning,

191
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,899
put your feet on the floor, that's a gift of God, amen.

192
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:26,619
You got up, you put your feet on the floor,

193
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:28,579
you drew a breath and you stood up

194
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:29,700
and you got ready for the day

195
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,459
and you went out into the day and got going

196
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,059
and you're still alive, that's God's gift.

197
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:35,179
Life is God's gift to us.

198
00:07:35,179 --> 00:07:37,380
Why should we waste that?

199
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,579
And many of you have occupations you're involved in,

200
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:41,380
some are retired, praise the Lord.

201
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,459
Someone said to me recently, are you gonna retire?

202
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:46,500
I said, no, I'm just gonna refire.

203
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:49,299
They said, I thought you were retired.

204
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:50,739
I said, no, I'm just tired.

205
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:53,859
So I mean, it's just the way it is.

206
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:54,700
But you know what I'm saying,

207
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,059
we ought to be found redeeming the time.

208
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,940
But Psalm 103, I'm gonna begin in verse one,

209
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,140
read down through this, make some comments about it,

210
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,540
then we're gonna move around just a little bit

211
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,380
in the word of God tonight.

212
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,019
But in Psalm 103 is inspired by the Holy Spirit.

213
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:10,700
David writes this, he said,

214
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,940
bless the Lord, O my soul,

215
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,059
and all that is within me, bless His holy name.

216
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:18,700
Bless the Lord, O my soul,

217
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,220
and forget not all His benefits.

218
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,660
Amen.

219
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,100
Don't you think that our God's a beneficent God?

220
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:27,339
You know, when I was in the military,

221
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:29,339
we're all talking about benefits.

222
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:31,459
And we call it, we said, I'm gonna get my bennies.

223
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:32,659
That's what we call it, bennies.

224
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,419
I'm gonna get my bennies, amen.

225
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,260
We're gonna do our 20 years or 30 years,

226
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,859
whatever it is, gonna retire and get our benefits.

227
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:41,539
And we always are talking about benefits.

228
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,260
Let me tell you what, there's no greater benefit

229
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,179
than what comes at the hand of God.

230
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:46,260
And by the way, he's not just talking

231
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,340
about material things here.

232
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,299
Certainly we are blessed with material goodness.

233
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:52,260
There's no two ways about that.

234
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,260
I don't know about you, but I'm getting three meals a day.

235
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,539
I got a roof over my head.

236
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:57,580
I got Raymond on my back.

237
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,140
I got transportation.

238
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,619
Praise the Lord, and God's allowed me

239
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:03,299
to be able to earn a little money

240
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:04,419
over the course of my life,

241
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,500
and He's provided for my needs, amen.

242
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,940
And so God has blessed me

243
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,460
with those kind of material benefits,

244
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,299
and I thank God for that.

245
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:14,659
It all comes at the hand of the Lord, amen.

246
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:16,380
We say my house, no, it's God's house.

247
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,739
We say my car, no, it's God's car.

248
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:20,460
We say my this and my that.

249
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,780
I mean, we're so possessive,

250
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,619
and we had to remember that everything we have

251
00:09:23,619 --> 00:09:24,659
comes at the hand of God.

252
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:26,419
God gave me everything I've got.

253
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:28,460
It's the Lord's, and it's to be used

254
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,340
for His honor and glory.

255
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,099
But He's speaking about the spiritual benefits

256
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:33,219
here as well.

257
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:35,739
We certainly have been the benefactors

258
00:09:35,739 --> 00:09:37,859
of all manner of spiritual blessings,

259
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:38,900
and I praise God for that.

260
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,859
Blessed Lord, oh my soul, and forget not.

261
00:09:41,859 --> 00:09:42,820
See that, what it says?

262
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,419
Forget not, don't forget.

263
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,539
He told the children of Israel,

264
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:48,340
look, if you've got wealth,

265
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,500
remember where it came from.

266
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,460
Don't forget where it came from,

267
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,820
who gave it to you.

268
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,140
Forget not all its benefits.

269
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,780
Verse three, who forgiveth all thine iniquities.

270
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,659
I won't say that word all.

271
00:09:58,659 --> 00:09:59,739
What a wonderful word that is.

272
00:09:59,739 --> 00:10:00,580
He forgiveth all.

273
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,700
giveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy diseases,

274
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,140
who redeemeth thy life from destruction,

275
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,860
who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercy,

276
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,460
so satisfy thy mouth with good things,

277
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,420
so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles, amen?

278
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,820
The Lord executeth righteousness and judgment

279
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,420
for all that are oppressed.

280
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,260
He made known his ways unto Moses,

281
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,180
his acts unto the children of Israel.

282
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,240
Oh, I love verse eight.

283
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,820
It says, the Lord is merciful and gracious.

284
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,660
Slow to anger.

285
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,380
Notice what it says, and plenteous in mercy.

286
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,980
He will not always chide,

287
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,060
and neither will he keep his anger forever.

288
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,180
Hold back his anger.

289
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,740
He will not, he hath not dealt with us after our sins,

290
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,860
but I'll tell you what, we ought to be glad for that,

291
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,420
nor reward us according to our iniquities.

292
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,340
For as the heaven is high above the earth,

293
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:52,200
so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.

294
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,620
As far as east is from the west,

295
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,420
so far hath he removed our transgressions from us,

296
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,700
like as a father pitieth his children,

297
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,060
so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.

298
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,220
I like this, for he knoweth our frame,

299
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,420
he remembereth that we are dust.

300
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,880
What a wonderful psalm this is.

301
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,720
I'm gonna stop there.

302
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,300
I could read it a little bit further,

303
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,180
but I'm gonna stop right there.

304
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,620
Now, I want you to see this.

305
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,660
I've noticed several things about this psalm

306
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,820
up into verse 14, and this is what I've noticed.

307
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,540
In verse three, the Bible says clearly

308
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,740
that he's a forgiver.

309
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,600
It says, our God's a forgiver.

310
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,760
I thank the Lord that I'm forgiven of my sin.

311
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,600
Amen?

312
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,420
And I thank God that as a Christian,

313
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,440
when I sin against him, I know I can go to him,

314
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,320
and I can lay my sins out before him

315
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,520
and ask his forgiveness for that which I've done,

316
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,920
repent of my sin, to confess my sin, to forsake my sin.

317
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,000
Lord, forgive me for what I've done.

318
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,160
Forgive me for what I've said.

319
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,480
Forgive me for the way I've behaved.

320
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,240
And listen, my God is a forgiver.

321
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,520
He's in the business of forgiving.

322
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,720
But I tell you what, when I got saved by the grace of God

323
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,960
on April the 7th, 1974, at 11 o'clock at night,

324
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,600
one of the things that I know for sure is God forgave me.

325
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,120
But I'll tell you, it's like the burden of sin

326
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,680
came off of me, and I knew that I was

327
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,520
in the army of the forgiven, amen.

328
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,660
I knew that I'd been washed in the blood of the Lamb,

329
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,400
praise the Lord, and I knew that he had washed away

330
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,880
all of my sins.

331
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,200
What a glorious thing it is to know that we're forgiven.

332
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,600
In verse three, I also see it says he's a healer.

333
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,520
I'm reminded that God is Jehovah Rapha, the God that heals.

334
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,120
And they're not talking about just physically healing,

335
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,200
no, he does heal physically.

336
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,400
But he heals us of all our iniquities and all our sins.

337
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,920
It's spiritual healing that he is giving reference here

338
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,880
to the most.

339
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,960
But he does, he is still in the healing business,

340
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,880
and he can heal physically.

341
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,720
I praise the Lord for that.

342
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,520
I won't go into the whole thing and give detail.

343
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,120
We know a lady had seven tumors in her abdomen,

344
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,860
and they said she had a couple months to live.

345
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,160
She was 30-some years old.

346
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,280
Go home and kiss your kids and say goodbye to your husband

347
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,240
and put your things in order because you're gonna die.

348
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,240
And she said, well, I want a second opinion.

349
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,080
This was a Navy doctor told her this,

350
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,560
and of course, they'd done everything they could

351
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,760
to try to treat her,

352
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,200
and they couldn't do anything for her anymore.

353
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,000
They sent her back here to Oak Knoll Naval Hospital

354
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,440
in San Francisco, and she got a second opinion.

355
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,240
The oncology department did a workup on her.

356
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,080
They saw the PET scans, the CAT scans, the MRIs,

357
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,260
the x-rays and everything.

358
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,040
They saw all the workup, all the blood work

359
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,520
and everything else, and they started from scratch

360
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,760
and did it again.

361
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,440
And at the end of the week, they said, we don't understand.

362
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,340
You haven't got a tumor in your body.

363
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,620
Not one single tumor was there.

364
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,580
And she'd been completely healed by the grace of God.

365
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,300
And I'll tell you, she had gone to the men of the church

366
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,180
before she left Japan, and she said,

367
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,020
I want you guys to do what the Bible says

368
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,860
in the book of James.

369
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,340
Would you lay hands on me and pray over me

370
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,780
and anoint me with oil?

371
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,260
That's biblical.

372
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,940
Now, the oil doesn't heal, it doesn't cure.

373
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,140
The oil represents the Holy Spirit and the word of God,

374
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,660
and she was just putting her life,

375
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,100
just trusting her life to the Lord

376
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,900
and saying, God, whatever you're willing to do,

377
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,300
whatever your will is, I want your will in my life.

378
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,740
If it's your will to heal me, amen.

379
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,940
If it's not, well, praise the Lord.

380
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,620
The ultimate healing is going home and be with Jesus.

381
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,460
Amen.

382
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,260
And God healed her, and I'm gonna tell you,

383
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,300
he still can heal.

384
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,500
In verse four, we see this.

385
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,060
The Bible says he's a redeemer.

386
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,340
He has redeemed my soul.

387
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,620
He's a redeemer.

388
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,780
Because of the blood of Jesus on the cross in Calvary,

389
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,320
he is a perfect redeemer that satisfies God's demand

390
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,260
against me when I put my faith and trust in him

391
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,580
and receive him as my personal Lord and Savior, amen.

392
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,060
He's my redeemer.

393
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,380
In verse four, it says he's a crowner.

394
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,180
He's the crowner, amen.

395
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,980
In verse five, it says he's the satisfier.

396
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,900
Well, I'll tell you what I know about you,

397
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,500
but he satisfieth my soul.

398
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,340
Amen.

399
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,940
He ought to satisfy your soul, amen.

400
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,660
If you're saved, he's your satisfier.

401
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,680
At number five, or verse five, he's the renewer.

402
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,780
God maketh all things new.

403
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,020
Well, I praise the Lord for that.

404
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,420
Now, listen, when we have revival, that's a time of renewal.

405
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,500
It's a renewing experience.

406
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,300
When I got to, I experienced a personal revival in 1991,

407
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,020
and it was almost like getting saved.

408
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,860
I mean, now you can't get saved again, again, again,

409
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,740
again, again, amen.

410
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,940
Once saved, always saved.

411
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,880
And by the way, you can't lose your salvation.

412
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,620
I praise the Lord for that.

413
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,220
But it was a good thing when I experienced revival,

414
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,980
and it renewed me.

415
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,900
In verse six, we see he's the righteous.

416
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,420
Well, I sure am glad he's the righteous, amen.

417
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,900
In verse eight, we see he's the merciful.

418
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,660
We're gonna talk about that in a minute.

419
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,120
And then we see in verse eight also, he's the gracious.

420
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,960
Well, I don't know about you,

421
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,380
but my God's been gracious to me.

422
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,860
He's been gracious.

423
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,380
And then last of all, in verse 13,

424
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,460
I'm sure there's more here.

425
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,260
This is just some of the wonderful attributes of God.

426
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,300
In verse 13, the Bible says he's a pitier.

427
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,820
He looked down on this poor boy, and he took pity on me.

428
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,940
Amen.

429
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,300
I tell you, the Holy Spirit of God

430
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,500
had me under conviction for six long months

431
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,180
before I got saved.

432
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,020
But I tell you, I've been running from God all my life

433
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,980
and didn't get saved at 27.

434
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,020
And I tell you what, God was merciful to me,

435
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,460
and he would not let me go

436
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,060
without me hearing the gospel over and over and over again

437
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,900
throughout my life.

438
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,520
And I just rejected God out of hand

439
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,900
because I wanted to live my own life

440
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,740
the way I wanted to live it.

441
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,900
I was just rebellious.

442
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,320
I just made my decision I was gonna live for sin.

443
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,760
And I lived all out for the devil.

444
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,340
Now, I will not tell you the things I did

445
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,820
because I don't wanna give glory to him,

446
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,220
I wanna give glory to God, amen?

447
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,100
I'm not gonna glorify what the devil did in my life,

448
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,500
I wanna glorify God for what he did in my life.

449
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,540
And one night I bowed my head in repentance,

450
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,460
and I turned away from my sin,

451
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,340
and I turned to Jesus Christ,

452
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,900
and I put my faith in him,

453
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,260
and I got washed in the blood of the Lamb, amen?

454
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,740
And I became a new creature in Christ.

455
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,620
I've been the same since.

456
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,220
And now I've been saved almost half a century.

457
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,760
Isn't that a wonderful thing, to be saved that long?

458
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,420
Now, some of you have been saved longer than me.

459
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,100
I've talked to someone not too long ago,

460
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,300
they've been saved like, I think, 70-some years.

461
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,300
If you're here tonight, and you're in your 90s,

462
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,420
my brother, and you got saved when you're 10,

463
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,520
man, you've been saved 80 years,

464
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,420
if that was your testimony.

465
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,220
So, you know, really, when it comes down to it,

466
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,300
being saved a half century is a wonderful thing.

467
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,500
And you know what, I've never gotten over it.

468
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,300
You never get over it.

469
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,900
Because you become a new creature in Christ,

470
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,700
and all things have been made new.

471
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,700
You have new desires, you have new wants,

472
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,660
and the main thing you wanna do is you wanna serve,

473
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,980
and you want to honor, and you wanna glorify your Savior.

474
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,900
Amen.

475
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,660
Now, let me say this.

476
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,620
As I look down through this, I gotta tell you,

477
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,420
there's one word that stands out to me.

478
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,260
You know what it is?

479
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,220
It's the word mercy.

480
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,700
And of all these attributes of God

481
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,780
that I mention here tonight,

482
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,100
it calls him the merciful in verse eight,

483
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,700
the word mercy stands out.

484
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,940
So of all the attributes of God

485
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,660
that stand out to me, it's mercy.

486
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,180
And by the way, he delighteth in mercy,

487
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,260
takes pleasure in mercy,

488
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,940
he's pleased to do it,

489
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,260
he's moved to bend down and extend mercy to us,

490
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,340
we poor sinners.

491
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,780
It's his desire to demonstrate mercy toward us,

492
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,300
and I noticed this, and I wrote it down

493
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,020
because I sometimes forget these things

494
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,660
now at this point in my life,

495
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,940
but I noticed there are 346 verses

496
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,740
in the word of God containing the words mercy,

497
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,060
mercies are merciful.

498
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,980
So 346 times in my Bible, in the King James Bible,

499
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,020
346 times God mentions the word mercy

500
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,780
in one form or another.

501
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,180
That's how often he speaks of it.

502
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,900
Grace is receiving what we do not deserve,

503
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,460
and mercy is not receiving what we do deserve.

504
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,500
Amen, I praise the Lord for that.

505
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,580
Now here's the thing that I wrote,

506
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,420
I had to write this down

507
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,220
because I didn't want to lose this one.

508
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,700
There is not one verse of scripture

509
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,020
that declares that God takes delight in wrath.

510
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,420
Did you hear what I just said?

511
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,500
There's not one verse of scripture

512
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,140
anywhere in the Bible that says

513
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,700
that God takes delight in wrath.

514
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,860
Now it doesn't mean that God is not a God of wrath

515
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,660
because he does demonstrate wrath,

516
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,340
and he certainly demonstrates judgment,

517
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,980
but God delights in mercy.

518
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,140
He doesn't delight in wrath.

519
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,100
That's the kind of God I serve.

520
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,360
Yes, that's my King, that's my God,

521
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,020
that's my Redeemer, that's my Savior,

522
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,460
that's my Lord, amen?

523
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,059
He is a God, ultimately, he is a God of mercy.

524
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:02,980
Turn in your Bible, if you will, please, with me quickly.

525
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,860
I gotta keep moving here

526
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,380
because I want to jump over in the New Testament.

527
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,580
Go over to Micah, chapter seven.

528
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,780
Let me show you this.

529
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,500
Micah, chapter seven.

530
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,340
Micah, chapter seven, verse 18.

531
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,420
This is a wonderful verse.

532
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,179
It says this.

533
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:23,739
Who is a God like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity,

534
00:19:23,739 --> 00:19:25,340
that passeth by the transgression

535
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,940
of the remnant of his heritage?

536
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,460
He retaineth not his anger forever because, look at this,

537
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,239
because he delighteth in mercy.

538
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,920
Do you see that?

539
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,040
It says he delighteth in mercy.

540
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,160
Going on to the next verse, I read this in verse 19.

541
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,440
He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us,

542
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,880
he will subdue our iniquities,

543
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,679
and that will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.

544
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,880
But when I read what he says here,

545
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,440
it says he delighteth in mercy.

546
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,280
I just want to have a hallelujah fit.

547
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,600
I mean, just think about that.

548
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,940
Think of the weight of that statement,

549
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,320
the magnitude of that statement where God says,

550
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,960
hey, listen, I, God,

551
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,840
God, delight and mercy.

552
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,280
That's what he says.

553
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,480
I think it was a missionary who wrote this down, he said, mark those words, he delighteth

554
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,720
in mercy, and you will not find a single verse anywhere in the book that says he delighteth

555
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,240
in wrath and judgment and punishment, not a verse anywhere in the whole book from cover

556
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,480
to cover, from Genesis to Revelation, you won't find a single verse that teaches or

557
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,600
says that God delights in judgment or punishment or wrath.

558
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,000
But you can find many places which either stay plainly or clearly indicate, just as

559
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,680
it does here in Micah 7, 18, that he delighteth in mercy.

560
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:41,600
It is his joy to show mercy to fallen man.

561
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Can you imagine that?

562
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,040
And I don't know about you, but I'll tell you something, when I think about it, it just

563
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,360
absolutely and positively stultifies my brain.

564
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,920
I just have to sit and wonder.

565
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,440
I just have to consider this, muse upon this, meditate on it, think about it.

566
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,440
Why would God want to show mercy to me?

567
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,600
I know me, and I know who I was, and I know what I did.

568
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,480
And I wonder sometimes, why, oh God, would you want to show mercy to me, an old wicked

569
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,680
sinner?

570
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,680
We were in a fellowship one night, and there was a group of us that get together after

571
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,040
church, we used to call it an afterglow back in the 70s, and we were sitting around in

572
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,360
someone's living room with a fire going in the fireplace, and we were just having coffee

573
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,280
and stuff and talking.

574
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,600
And they went around the room, and everybody gave their testimony.

575
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:34,280
On those days, I gave them a whole testimony, scared everybody to death, amen.

576
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:39,200
And one of the men in the room, Al Kiefer was his name, he was a dear brother.

577
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,040
I got to speak at his funeral, and I miss him.

578
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,880
Brother Al Kiefer said this, he said, well, you know what, he said, I was raised in a

579
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,920
Christian home, I went to Christian school, he said, I went to Bible college.

580
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,440
He said, I never tasted many of the sin that some of you people have tasted.

581
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,880
He said, I've never drank, never smoked, he said, I never used foul language, he said,

582
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,400
I never ran around with women of ill repute, I never did any of these things, I never had

583
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
an immoral life.

584
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,840
He said, well, I'll tell you something, if I had to die without Jesus Christ, I'd go

585
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,560
in the same hell you'd have gone to if you'd not been saved.

586
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,920
We need to think about that.

587
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:15,120
There's too many people that live a so-called moral life that are dying in their sins and

588
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,280
going to hell, see?

589
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,440
So God's been merciful to all of us.

590
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,040
He's been merciful to every last one of us, amen?

591
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,560
Missionary James Dearmore said this, he said, but though he caused grief, yet will he have

592
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,200
compassion according to the multitude of his mercies, for he doth not afflict willingly,

593
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,440
nor grieve the children of men.

594
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,680
God does not grieve nor afflict men willingly, but he does so only upon great provocation.

595
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,720
You realize how, hey, listen, do you realize how long-suffering God is?

596
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,080
You realize how patient God really is with us?

597
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,360
And when he does chastise, you realize how gentle he is, at least in the initial stages

598
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,960
of that, amen?

599
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,960
He's gentle.

600
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,640
He's good to us in so many ways.

601
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,720
Listen to this, trusting in mercy implies a cessation from all excuses and excuse-making.

602
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,920
The moment you trust in mercy, you give up all apologies and excuses at once and entirely,

603
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,960
for these imply a reliance upon God's justice.

604
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,480
An excuse or apology is nothing more nor less than an appeal to justice, a plea designed

605
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
to justify our conduct.

606
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,080
Trusting in mercy forever implies that we have ceased from all excuses forever.

607
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,520
The very thing that mercy does is to set aside the execution of the penalty of the law.

608
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,920
Now Charles Finney said that.

609
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,080
Now that's an interesting statement.

610
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,000
Mercy involves this, it's the setting aside of the execution of the penalty of the law.

611
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,320
And when you stop and think about salvation, that's exactly what it is.

612
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,440
The penalty of the law is set aside when we're saved by the grace of God, all because of

613
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,200
the blood of Jesus.

614
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,920
What can wash away my sins?

615
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,060
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

616
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,600
What can make me whole again?

617
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

618
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,040
So precious is the flow that washes, cleanses white as snow.

619
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,040
No other fount I know, nothing but the blood of Jesus.

620
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Amen?

621
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,600
Praise the Lord for the precious blood of the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin

622
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
of the world.

623
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,320
I want you to go to Luke chapter 15, we're going to go over there and I'm going to go

624
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,520
down through a portion of this text with you tonight and we'll finish up there.

625
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,800
Luke chapter 15 verse 11.

626
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:19,000
Now the two examples given, the two parables given before this parable are just a little

627
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
bit different than this one and I'm going to go down through this just over the next

628
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
few minutes and just share some thoughts with you about this particular scenario that the

629
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,560
Lord Jesus gives us here in Luke chapter 15 beginning in verse 11.

630
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,840
Now it reads this way, and he said a certain man had two sons.

631
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,680
Now you know we're talking about the prodigal son here.

632
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,480
And you know the story of the prodigal son.

633
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,960
But he said a certain man had two sons.

634
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,920
So these boys had sons yet.

635
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,160
Okay, they were this man's sons.

636
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:00,640
By the way, this man represents in type, shadow, and figure God the Father.

637
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,960
Represents my God, amen?

638
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,320
And it said a certain man had two sons.

639
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,080
The younger of them said to the father, father give me the portion of my goods that fall

640
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,800
to me and he divided unto them his living.

641
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,120
Now he made a demand, he said now listen daddy, I'll tell you what, I want my inheritance

642
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,600
and I want it now.

643
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,760
And he was very impudent and arrogant about this and his demand, I believe that.

644
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,040
This was a young man that was self-centered, he was living for himself, he didn't care

645
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,920
about anything or anybody else but him.

646
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,740
And he said I want my inheritance and I want it now.

647
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:39,240
And the father didn't resist that and he didn't say no, listen son, you cannot have your inheritance

648
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,240
until I'm dead.

649
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,880
And when I'm dead and gone then you can go and make your claim on your inheritance as

650
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,880
can your brother.

651
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,760
But in the meantime, you're not due or owed anything.

652
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,200
So you're not going to get it.

653
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,740
So now we've got this young man who's imposing his will upon his father's will.

654
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,320
Think about that.

655
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,560
Have you ever done that?

656
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:08,280
Have you ever dictated to God the terms of your life?

657
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,680
Sometimes in prayer we tell God what we think He ought to do.

658
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,840
Now God I tell you what I think you ought to do, you may not pray that way exactly but

659
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,000
sometimes we do that.

660
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,480
We don't pray thy will be done, we pray my will be done.

661
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,080
And so we make demands on God.

662
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,400
I've actually heard people pray that way.

663
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,920
And we have no right to make demands on Him and we have no right to tell Him what to do.

664
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,200
We have no right to impose our will on God's will.

665
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,560
And yet sometimes people do that.

666
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,800
And so now here we see this boy imposing his will upon the will of his father.

667
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,520
It's not his father's will to give him this money, not at this point in his life.

668
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,480
For number one, he realized this boy couldn't handle that money and number two, he knew

669
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,480
that he would take it and use it for all the wrong reasons because he knew the character

670
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,200
of his son.

671
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,320
Think about that.

672
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:02,040
Does God not know the character of every one of us here in this room tonight?

673
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,520
God knows my character, He knows your character.

674
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,000
He knows what we can handle, when we can handle it.

675
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,600
And I can just see the picture, the scenario here.

676
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
He said, all right.

677
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
He said, that's what this boy wants.

678
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,080
I'm going to go ahead and let him have it.

679
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,800
Sometimes God will give us what we want, what we demand and teach us through the process

680
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,920
of how badly it turns out, how stupid we really are.

681
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:30,960
Excuse the word stupid, but it's a good Greek word, stupido, amen?

682
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,640
I mean, it's really stupid.

683
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,440
And really he's imposing his will on his father's will.

684
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,240
It's not his father's will to give him this money and just let him go out and do whatever

685
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,200
he wants with it.

686
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,120
God doesn't just want me to go out and do whatever I want.

687
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,120
I belong to him.

688
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
I'm his child.

689
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
I'm his son.

690
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,240
I'll tell you what, God has sometimes just let me get myself my own messes because he

691
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,040
knew that was the only way he was going to learn.

692
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,040
Stupido.

693
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:07,000
Boy, I want to tell you, I got myself into some really big messes in my life.

694
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,600
If tonight I were to stand up here and give you testimony of some of the really dumb things

695
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,620
I've done in my Christian life, you'd probably laugh at it, but to me it wasn't very funny

696
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,600
at the time because God took me to task.

697
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,600
He said, all right, he said, if that's what you want and you're going to make that demand,

698
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,080
I'll go ahead and I'll meet that demand and then you come back and tell me how that worked

699
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,080
out.

700
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,120
Is everybody on board with me here?

701
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,119
Amen.

702
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:35,160
Come on now, somebody give me a testimony here.

703
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
Amen.

704
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,600
I'm telling you, it's the exact way it is.

705
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,559
And so he said, now, okay, he said, I'll tell you what, son, I'll go ahead and give you

706
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:43,720
what you want.

707
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,080
So it says, he said, a certain man had two sons, the younger of them said, father, father,

708
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,520
give me the portion of goods that fall to me.

709
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,600
And he divided unto them his living.

710
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:58,720
So it wasn't this boy's money, it was the father's money, and he divided unto him his

711
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,720
living.

712
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,840
This boy didn't earn a penny of it, not a cent.

713
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:08,720
And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far

714
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,559
country and there wasted his substance with riotous living.

715
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,559
Now notice what he did.

716
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,960
He took his father's inheritance, his father's wealth, he gathered it all together, packed

717
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,760
his bags, and took a journey into a far country.

718
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,860
In other words, he was getting as far away from his father as he possibly could.

719
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,760
He didn't want to be under his father's authority anymore, and I don't know how old this boy

720
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:41,160
was when this whole scenario unfolds, but he took his father's inheritance, that inheritance

721
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:46,920
which his father gave to him, and he went into a far country and got as far away from

722
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,520
his daddy as he possibly could.

723
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,400
But I tell you this, I don't think he went off into a godly place.

724
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,080
That far country he chose was a heathen place, I guarantee it, because we'll see in a minute

725
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,080
what went on there.

726
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,960
He went into a pagan country, took his father's wealth.

727
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,780
went into a pagan country, and by the way, let me say this, he knew better.

728
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,060
He knew better.

729
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,780
He knew that what he was doing was wrong.

730
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,220
He knew that from the very get-go.

731
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:16,500
I know he knew that, so he took this money, his wealth, and he wasted it.

732
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,660
He wasted it.

733
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:21,820
He wasted his substance with riotous living.

734
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,820
Now you ought to do a word study on the word riotous.

735
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,140
It is not good.

736
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:31,420
I mean, it was wine, women, and song, and it was honky-tonk all the time, and he probably

737
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:36,900
got himself into some really bad business with the wrong kind of people, and he got

738
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,580
himself into a situation that he probably wished, after he got into it, probably wished

739
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,660
he'd get out of it, but he was probably enjoying it because the flesh likes sin.

740
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,180
I want to tell you something tonight, friend.

741
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,980
You're running from God, and you're giving everything you possibly can to your flesh.

742
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,980
You can't sit here and tell me that your flesh don't like sin.

743
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,980
Your flesh likes sin.

744
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,380
By the way, many times the flesh is the biggest enemy you have.

745
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:06,500
We blame everything on the devil, and sometimes he has nothing to do with it.

746
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,140
You know, we say, well, the devil made me do it.

747
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,700
There used to be a comedian by the name of Chip Wilson.

748
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,700
He used to do a skit.

749
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,300
He'd always say, well, the devil made me do it.

750
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,300
Well, you know what?

751
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,380
The truth of the matter is, a lot of times the devil didn't make you do anything, and

752
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:22,260
by the way, the devil can't make you do anything you don't want to do.

753
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,980
Did you hear me?

754
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,480
You have to cooperate with Satan.

755
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:32,780
So the devil gives you satanic suggestion, listen, if you don't say no to him, he'll

756
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:37,620
keep working until you give in, because your flesh loves sin.

757
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,940
That's why you can never give in to the flesh.

758
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:45,260
The Bible says the flesh profiteth nothing, and it doesn't.

759
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:52,220
So verse 14, look at this, and when he spent all, so I mean, he went on a binge, man.

760
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:56,980
I mean, he spent all this money, every single bit of whatever he had, he spent it, and when

761
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,940
he spent all, there arose a mighty famine in the land, and it began to be in want.

762
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,460
Well, I guess so.

763
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,300
I guess so.

764
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,340
By the way, someone said to me, well, you know, he went out full, and he came back empty.

765
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:12,300
No, he went out empty.

766
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,300
And he came back empty.

767
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:19,420
Yeah, he had money, he had material things, but he went out empty.

768
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,420
And he came back empty.

769
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,300
Emptier than when he went out.

770
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,660
It began to be in want, verse 15.

771
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:30,300
And he went and he joined himself to a citizen of that country.

772
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,420
And he sent him into his fields to feed swine.

773
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:40,420
Now, you stop and contemplate that for a minute, and think about that for a minute, and say,

774
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,980
no, wait a minute.

775
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:45,580
You mean to tell me this Jewish boy was feeding pigs?

776
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,900
Yeah, he was feeding pigs.

777
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:55,220
So this man in this far country, because he had nothing, he was empty, he had nothing

778
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:58,460
to eat even, he said, okay, I'll give you a job, you can go out here in the field and

779
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,660
feed my pigs.

780
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:04,060
And he lowered himself that much that he was willing to go and feed pigs and get into the

781
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,060
pigsty.

782
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,380
I'm going to tell you what, your sin will take you farther than you want to go.

783
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,620
The Bible says the way of the transgressor is hard.

784
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:17,860
And so here this poor boy is, and he's done wrong, and he's wasted his substance on riotous

785
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:21,460
living, he's run from God, he's run from home, he's run from everything he knows is

786
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,260
right and good, and now he ends up in a pigsty.

787
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:28,660
That's really a picture of sin, friends.

788
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:32,340
Sin is nothing more than a figurative pigsty.

789
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,140
That may be a real pigsty.

790
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,900
And I can hear him saying this now.

791
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,940
I can hear him saying, how did I end up here?

792
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,180
How did I end up here?

793
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:47,500
Well, God didn't put him there.

794
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,220
He was there by his own choice and his own volition.

795
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,580
He was there because he decided to run from God.

796
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,580
Now he's in a pigsty.

797
00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:00,740
You know, I'll tell you, life can be a pigsty.

798
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,980
There have been a lot of places I've been in my lifetime where I can say, man, I'll

799
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,740
tell you what, this ain't even fit for pigs.

800
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:10,540
There's a lot of places in this world not fit for pigs.

801
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,980
And there he is in a pigsty.

802
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:18,020
Well, he's sitting in the middle of that pigsty, I begin to think about this, and what

803
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,020
am I going to do?

804
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:23,020
Well, how am I going to get out of this?

805
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:29,260
I mean, this is a terrible situation, and this is a real mess is what it is.

806
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:33,180
And verse 16, and he would fain have filled his belly with a husk that the swine did eat,

807
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,180
and no man gave unto him.

808
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:40,180
Nobody even gave him the pig food.

809
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,180
But look at verse 17.

810
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,100
Everybody with me?

811
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:49,940
And when he came to himself, that's a good place to come to.

812
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,540
And when he came to himself, someone said to me, in fact, it was Dr. David Earnhardt,

813
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,540
I'll never forget this.

814
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,700
He said, you read that verse there, preacher said, doesn't that tell you that really sin

815
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,820
is a form of insanity?

816
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,100
I don't know about that.

817
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,460
I never thought about that.

818
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,060
I didn't look at it as a form of insanity.

819
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:11,140
I have always thought of sin as a matter of rebellious self-will and just disobeying God

820
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,900
and disobeying His Word.

821
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:18,240
But when you come down to it, you think this guy was completely beside himself with sin.

822
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,980
And he came to himself, and that was a good thing to come to.

823
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,980
Now watch.

824
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:27,940
And he came to himself and he said, how many hired servants of my father's have bread enough

825
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,300
and spare, and I perish with hunger?

826
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:35,300
Oh, we go back to that old Greek word again, stupido.

827
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,620
Now, it's maybe Hispanic.

828
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,620
Am I right?

829
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,620
Is it Spanish?

830
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,620
Whatever it is, he's just dumb.

831
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,620
Amen?

832
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,620
He just stopped and thought about that and said, man, I'm just dumb, man.

833
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,620
He said, look where I've ended up.

834
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,660
Now verse 18, here's the blessing.

835
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:56,140
I will rise and go to my father.

836
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,820
I rejoice when I read this.

837
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,740
Now, I know you can apply this past the scripture all the way.

838
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,620
Some people say, well, it's a picture of an unsaved individual, and others say, no, it's

839
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:07,820
a picture of a young man out of fellowship with God and backslidden.

840
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,820
It's a child of God.

841
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,140
He says he has sonship and he's got a father.

842
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,660
I tend to see a real revival message in this, I really do.

843
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,740
And he said, listen, he said, I will rise and go to my father.

844
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:22,780
He always knew he could go home.

845
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,420
He always knew that he could go home.

846
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,260
He always knew that that which he'd run from, he could go back home.

847
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,380
He could go back to his father.

848
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,380
Why?

849
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,540
Because he knew the character and nature of his father, that his father is a God of mercy.

850
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,540
Amen.

851
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:39,140
Now, you got that right, class.

852
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,580
God is a God of mercy and he's a God of forgiveness.

853
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,820
And he said, well, he said, I've spent all my money, I've wasted all my substance from

854
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,820
my life.

855
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:52,500
He said, I'm living here out in a pig pen and nobody will feed me, but I can go home.

856
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,220
You know, as that light went on.

857
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:58,940
See now, his running is over.

858
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,140
It come to an end.

859
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,860
He was done running.

860
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,060
Now he's going to run, but he's going to run in the right direction.

861
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:11,180
He's running from sin and running to God.

862
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,920
Running from sin and running to God.

863
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,060
That is by the way, the essence of revival.

864
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,200
There's no difference.

865
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,700
There's no difference to me personally.

866
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:22,140
There's no difference when, when you and I got saved by the grace of God, we ran from

867
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,340
sin and self and we ran to God for his mercy and we got saved.

868
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,340
Am I right?

869
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,340
All right.

870
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,340
Now listen, it's the same thing in revival.

871
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:32,780
We run from sin and we run from self and our rebellion and our disobedience and our coldness

872
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:38,700
and our lethargy and apathy, spiritual lethargy and apathy, and we run to God and we get revival.

873
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,860
We do what the Bible says we need in order to experience renewal.

874
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,940
And what a wonderful thing it is.

875
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:50,900
And God's always willing and ready to extend mercy.

876
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:55,660
I sure am glad I serve a God with a tender heart.

877
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,660
God of mercies.

878
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:00,180
There's too much of this preaching today about this God in heaven that wants to beat everybody

879
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,300
up all the time and he's just going to take a baseball bat and whoop up on you and if

880
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,060
you don't do exactly right, he's just going to drop you dead in your tracks and all this

881
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,060
business.

882
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,100
I've heard people say, well, if you don't get this right, God is going to kill you.

883
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:13,140
Well, listen, God can take our lives from us if we disobey him.

884
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,200
There's a sin on the death.

885
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,540
We know that's true.

886
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:19,580
But because God is a merciful God, he's not the kind of God that many times we see some

887
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,300
fundamentalists say he is.

888
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,780
Now, I'm a fundamentalist, but I'm just telling you, some fundamentalists are fighting fundamentalists

889
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:31,340
and they have a picture of God that's not the picture of my God, because my God's a

890
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,340
God of mercy.

891
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:37,619
Yes, he's a God of judgment, he's a God of wrath, but he does not delight in wrath.

892
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:40,100
He delighteth in mercy.

893
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,179
That's the kind of God I serve.

894
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:43,179
That's my King.

895
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:44,179
That's my Jesus.

896
00:38:44,179 --> 00:38:45,179
Amen?

897
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:47,340
And I know that he loves me and I know he cares about me.

898
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,059
And it's just like with my daughter when she was growing up.

899
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:54,580
Now she's like, I can hardly believe my kid's 56 years old almost.

900
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,619
And when I look at her when she's growing up, we loved our child.

901
00:38:57,619 --> 00:38:58,619
She was our only child.

902
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:02,020
We loved her and she was precious to us.

903
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,100
But we didn't let her get away with sin.

904
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,700
We didn't let her get away with wrongdoing.

905
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,500
We were very patriotic in our home.

906
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:16,140
We applied the stripes and she saw the stars, amen?

907
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,179
She knew she was disobedient, she had it coming.

908
00:39:19,179 --> 00:39:24,500
But along with the punishment or correction came mercy.

909
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:31,220
And by the way, biblical correction in a child's life is not child abuse, it's child correction.

910
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:35,380
There's a right way of doing it and a wrong way to do it.

911
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:41,460
And so my God takes delight in when I do wrong, when he has to deal with me, he takes delight

912
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,340
in doing it in such a way whereby he gives me an opportunity to respond before he has

913
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:49,619
to step things up because he's merciful.

914
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:50,619
He's merciful, amen?

915
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:53,900
And I think about that and I think, well, praise the Lord how good God really is to

916
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,980
us because he is indeed a wonderful God of mercy.

917
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,980
So you knew you could go home.

918
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,619
So verse 18, I've got to keep moving.

919
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:01,020
I'm almost...

920
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:06,960
done, I will rise and go to my Father, and I will say unto him, Father, I have sinned

921
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:15,700
against heaven and before thee, before thee. Now that's repentance. That's the beginning

922
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:20,760
of repentance right there. That's an admission of sin. That's the acknowledgement of sin.

923
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,080
The first step in revival and the first step in getting right with God is to acknowledge

924
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:29,920
my sin. David said, I acknowledge my sin, it's ever before me in Psalm 51. So that's

925
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,600
the acknowledgement of sin. That's where repentance starts. Verse 19, I'm no more worthy to be

926
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:40,980
called thy son. Make me as one of the hired servants. That's humility. That's humility.

927
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,580
Verse 20, and he rose and came to his father, but when he was a great way off, his father

928
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:49,420
saw him and in compassion ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. Now that's interesting

929
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,940
because here this boy, and by the way, he may have been a little hesitant on his way

930
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,940
home, but here this boy is coming down the path and his father is waiting for him at

931
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,960
the gate. He probably every single day looked down that pathway coming to the house and

932
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:08,680
he was praying and said, oh God, speak to my boy and cause my boy to see how wrong he

933
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:13,720
is and how wicked he has been and how sinful he is and God bring him home that I can restore

934
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:20,160
him once again to his rightful place. And here comes that boy up the lane. The boy didn't

935
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,760
run to his daddy, his daddy ran to him and threw his arms around his neck and kissed

936
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:30,900
him and showed him love and mercy. That's my God right there. That's my Jesus right

937
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:37,300
there. That's my king. That's who I serve. That's the kind of God I serve. Amen? So get

938
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,620
that picture in your mind what a precious picture it is. Now watch as we go on. We're

939
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:45,380
almost done. And it said here in verse 21, and the son said to him, father, I've sinned

940
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:51,140
against heaven and on thy side and am no more worthy to be called thy son. Now that's prayer

941
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:55,520
there too. That's reference to prayer. And by the way, brokenness comes in here. But

942
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,520
the father said to his servants, bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a

943
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:03,760
ring on his feet and bring on his hand and shoes on his feet. That's restoration. So

944
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,560
here we see repentance, humility, prayer, brokenness and restoration. All one section

945
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:15,300
here. Verse 23, and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry.

946
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,640
For this my son was dead. Just like he was dead, it was like he was dead and gone. Now

947
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,900
look at this, and is alive again. Do you know what? That is exactly what revival means.

948
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:30,660
The word revival means to live again. That's what it means. He's alive again. And what

949
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:34,780
a wonderful statement that scripture is. He was lost and he's found and they began to

950
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,780
be merry. Now you look at the rest of it and you can look at the second son. He was also

951
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:41,220
prodigal but from a different direction. He was just a pompous, self-righteous individual

952
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:47,960
what he was. But here's the thing I want you to see. We can always go home. God is

953
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,800
always willing and ready to extend mercy to us and yet we don't deserve it but he's a

954
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,440
God of mercy. And when you and I run from God and we run hard, in fact I ought to preach

955
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,240
on Jonah this week. I've had Jonah in my heart here for I don't know how long. I ought to

956
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,520
preach on Jonah this week if God lets me do it. The thing is that we run sometimes from

957
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,040
God and we try to run hard and fast as far away from him as we can get but he's always

958
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:14,900
still there. He hasn't gone anywhere. God's always where he's always been, where he always

959
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:25,080
will be. Who's doing the running? Well we're doing the running. When I was pastoring, pastor,

960
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,560
I don't know how many people I've had sit across my desk and they'd come to me for counsel

961
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,420
and they'd say, man this has happened and that's happened, this is going on and that's

962
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,180
going on. And 99% of the time I could sit there and say, well you know what your problem

963
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:42,000
is? You're running from God. Stop running. Quit your running. You know and they'd look

964
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,280
at you like, well how do you know I'm running? Yeah, you're running. That's what you're doing

965
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,600
because you know what I can tell because I'm your pastor and I've been watching you live

966
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,200
your life and I've been watching what you've been doing and I've seen the things you've

967
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,440
done and I know what you're doing. One thing you're doing is you're skipping out of church

968
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,000
and you're not faithful to the house of God like you used to be and you're putting other

969
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,440
things, you have other priorities in life instead of the Lord and I can see that your

970
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:07,220
family's in trouble and I see your kids, your kids are falling apart and how can you

971
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:13,740
sit here and tell me you're not running from God? People are running from the Lord. We

972
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:19,620
live, hey listen friends, we live in a nation running from God. And we've seen influence

973
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:26,060
of that here in God's house too. But we always know this, we always know we can go home.

974
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:31,500
We can always come back. God said come back. You know in Malachi chapter 3 God says this,

975
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,160
He said if you will I will. The you will I will principle, God said if you will I

976
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,820
will. He said if you'll come back I'm ready to restore you. You first. You're the ones

977
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:48,680
going to have to come home to me. But it's a simple message but you get it so profound.

978
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:54,360
God is a merciful God. He delighteth in mercy. Now some of you are not, I don't know tonight

979
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,000
what's going on in your life, I have no idea. This is a revival meeting, so we're talking

980
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,780
about revival here. It's not an evangelistic meeting, it's a revival meeting. Revival is

981
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:06,220
for God's people. Evangelism is for the people that need to be regenerated. We're not talking

982
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:09,500
about regeneration this week, we're talking about revival. Now we will bring the gospel

983
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:13,340
out certainly. We want people to be saved that are not saved that are here. But my ministry

984
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:19,620
is mostly revival where it's revival ministry and God's people need to be revived. So you

985
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,340
may be here tonight and there may be things going on in your heart. You know that there's

986
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:25,420
something not right there. You know there's some sin in your life. There's something you're

987
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:30,800
covering up perhaps. I don't know. God knows. You know. Unless you've so deceived yourself

988
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,060
you don't see it. And that's possible. But maybe there's someone here tonight who's got

989
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:40,620
secret sin in your life. You're just running and hiding from God and you're just wasting

990
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:44,300
your life. You're not experiencing the joy of the Lord. You're not experiencing the fruit

991
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:49,260
of the Spirit. You're not enjoying the things that God has for His children. Man, quit your

992
00:45:49,260 --> 00:46:01,140
running. Stop running. Come to yourself. And come back to God. God says come back.

993
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:07,740
Come back. I never forget, as long as I live, I stood in the pulpit one night in the church

994
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:13,260
years back. There was a story that I heard years ago that Ron Comfort related. I'll never

995
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:17,500
forget it, but I applied it a little differently. And I could see God just standing over the

996
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:23,500
battlements of heaven, the parapets of heaven, and saying, come back. Come back. Come back.

997
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:33,140
Come back. He wants His church back. He wants His people back. He wants every child of God

998
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:39,660
that's running, He wants them back. If you're a prodigal, come back. Come back. Come back.

999
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:45,260
You need to examine your own heart tonight. Oh yes, we can look at the prodigal and say,

1000
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,860
yeah, there's a lot of people running from God that need to be saved. And you can get

1001
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,660
that certainly out of this passage of Scripture as well. There's no question about that. I

1002
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:54,980
tend to agree with J. Vernon McGee, and I'm not always in agreement with what he taught

1003
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:59,060
years ago, but I will tell you this. See, I think he's right about this text right here.

1004
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:05,780
You're dealing with a boy that had sonship. And he said, you come back, and I'll tell

1005
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,980
you what, I'll restore you. I'll put the ring on your finger, and I'll put the robe upon

1006
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:12,020
you, and we'll have a fatted calf, and we'll have a good hallelujah time, amen, because

1007
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:20,500
this son of mine that was running from me is back. He's been revived. Amen. What a wonderful

1008
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:25,700
thing it is to experience a Holy Ghost revival. When the Spirit of God falls fresh upon us,

1009
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:30,700
when I'll tell you what, you can't explain it on the earthly plane. When the Spirit of God

1010
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:37,020
falls fresh upon us, man, it's a hallelujah time. It's a joy. It just reverberates through a church.

1011
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:45,820
Many times it starts with one person. I've seen a church send its teenagers off to youth camp,

1012
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:50,980
and some of those kids get a good old-fashioned dose of Holy Ghost revival, and they come back

1013
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:55,140
to church. It spreads through the church like wildfire, because the parents get under conviction.

1014
00:47:55,140 --> 00:48:00,260
Now their kids are living for the Lord. And if parents aren't, and the parents get under

1015
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:05,060
conviction, get right with God. You can build a whole revival meeting on what happens sometimes

1016
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:15,500
in teen camps. They have to really wonder what's wrong with the adults, you know. Amen. Amen. I've

1017
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,220
delivered God's message. Let's all stand tonight. Would you stand with me, please?

1018
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:25,260
Get our heads about nice and close tonight as our sister comes to play the instrument. We're

1019
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:29,860
going to just have a simple time of invitation of God's spoken in your heart tonight. Now,

1020
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,900
listen, let me say this. If you're not saved, you ought to come tonight. If you don't know

1021
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,420
that you're saved, you don't know you're saved, it's a no-so thing. You ought to come tonight,

1022
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:41,460
and let us take the Word of God and show you from the Bible how to know Jesus as your personal

1023
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:47,300
Savior. For Christian night, this message was for us, really. It's a revival message, and God says,

1024
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:55,020
come back. He said, I'm a merciful God. You can always come home. You can always come back. When

1025
00:48:55,020 --> 00:49:00,540
we come to ourselves, we can always come back. As the instrument begins to play and God speaks

1026
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:05,179
to your heart tonight, the altar's open, you just step out and come. Just bow on your knee here and

1027
00:49:05,179 --> 00:49:09,580
say, oh, God, my heart's been spoken to tonight, and I want to make some things right with you.

1028
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,580
Just step out as the instrument begins to play. How about you, my friend?
