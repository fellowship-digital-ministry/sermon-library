1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,319
and then looking at verses eight through 13 this morning.

2
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:07,119
And last week, I preached a message from John 16, 33,

3
00:00:07,119 --> 00:00:08,520
be of good cheer.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,279
And what a great thought that is

5
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:11,600
from that portion of scripture

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,239
as Jesus is going through and providing the disciples

7
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:18,500
with so much information with regard to what they would face

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,200
and days ahead and years ahead with regard to ministry.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,200
But he says, be of good cheer, why?

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,479
I have overcome the world, hallelujah.

11
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:32,479
We serve a God who is victorious and he's on his throne.

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,520
He has a plan, he's never gonna be defeated.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,720
He is our God and how we ought to rejoice.

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,880
Prior to that, I started a message

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,119
from 2 Timothy chapter number two,

16
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:47,240
and I dealt with the subject of teaching others

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,919
also from verses one and two.

18
00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:52,439
But I said to you as we started that message

19
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:55,880
that throughout the second chapter of 2 Timothy,

20
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,360
really what is addressed and what the focus of the passages

21
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,680
is on God's people, the believer, the individual believer

22
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,879
being a soldier in the Lord's army.

23
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:08,040
And you said, how did I get enlisted?

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,959
Well, if you got saved, you got enlisted in the army

25
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,680
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,239
If you're not yet saved, you need to be saved.

27
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:18,239
And when you're saved, you'll be enlisted in the army

28
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,480
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

29
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,019
As I personally analyze 2 Timothy chapter number two,

30
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:29,260
I discover five characteristics that God gives us

31
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,739
in this portion of scripture that really when understood

32
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:37,699
make the soldier a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

33
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:42,220
There are characteristics attributes that are given to us

34
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,300
in these portions of scripture in this chapter

35
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,860
that reveal to us what it is to be a good soldier.

36
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,599
I hope this morning that our desire

37
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,699
is to be a good soldier of Jesus Christ,

38
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:58,180
not just to be content with being in the Lord's army,

39
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,139
not just being content that I'm a soldier,

40
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:06,139
but desiring that I would be a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

41
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,899
I don't wanna be content with just status quo.

42
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,500
I don't wanna be in the midst of mediocrity.

43
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,779
No, I wanna be a good soldier of the Lord Jesus Christ.

44
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:21,820
I believe that these five attributes are given to us

45
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,860
or these five characteristics are provided to us,

46
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,779
but then they are illustrated in the text of scripture.

47
00:02:27,779 --> 00:02:30,619
What does it mean to be a good soldier?

48
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:32,539
Well, what we'll focus on this morning

49
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:34,699
is that they're to endure hardness.

50
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:35,660
Well, what does that mean?

51
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,460
How is that illustrated?

52
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,500
And we see that the text of scripture provides that for us.

53
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,740
So I'm not gonna give you all five characteristics today

54
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,259
cause we'd be here for a long time.

55
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:46,539
So over the next five weeks,

56
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:48,619
we're gonna look at one characteristic a week

57
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:53,059
and we're gonna plan to understand this chapter

58
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:54,500
and how it applies to us.

59
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,339
Of course, the apostle Paul is speaking to Timothy,

60
00:02:57,339 --> 00:02:59,020
his son in the faith,

61
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,380
and Timothy is ministering in Ephesus.

62
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,740
And there's all sorts of things

63
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,460
that are going on in Ephesus.

64
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,660
We mentioned as we studied

65
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,860
through the book of 1 Timothy,

66
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,139
and even as we've entered into the book of 2 Timothy

67
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:10,460
here on Sunday mornings,

68
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,139
throughout this calendar year,

69
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:14,259
we've mentioned about the false teaching

70
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:18,139
and various aspects of just a difficulty

71
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:19,820
that Timothy would face

72
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,580
as he's ministering there in Ephesus.

73
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,419
And we find that Paul says to Timothy in verse number three,

74
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:29,940
thou therefore endure hardness

75
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,699
as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

76
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:37,339
If you are taking notes, it's a good soldier part one.

77
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:39,899
And so next week will be a good soldier part two

78
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:41,940
and so on and so forth.

79
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,940
And so you'll know what the titles are

80
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,979
for the next several weeks

81
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:48,059
as we study through 2 Timothy chapter number two.

82
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,740
As we consider a good soldier,

83
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,139
as it's given to us here in this text of scripture,

84
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,779
I've mentioned already,

85
00:03:54,779 --> 00:03:57,020
you see it in the text in verse number three,

86
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,979
thou therefore endure hardness

87
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:03,539
as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

88
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:04,979
Notice number one,

89
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:07,820
there is an expectation

90
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,580
that a good soldier will endure hardness.

91
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,020
There's an expectation here in this text of scripture,

92
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,500
we find that we have expectations in life,

93
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,820
in fact, several weeks ago,

94
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,820
as I was teaching in the marriage Sunday school class,

95
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,100
we dealt with the subject of expectations

96
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,500
and we talked about the importance of managing expectations

97
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,140
and how we deal with that in life.

98
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,779
And the reality is that we know

99
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:33,540
what it is to expect something,

100
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,859
we know what it is when that expectation is not reasonable,

101
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,579
is not something that comes to fruition,

102
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,420
we know the disappointment and so on and so forth.

103
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,739
But as we look here at 2 Timothy chapter two

104
00:04:44,739 --> 00:04:46,579
in verse number three,

105
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,500
I find that there is an expectation

106
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,019
that a good soldier will endure hardness.

107
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:55,940
Obviously, as we're making the connection here

108
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,420
in 2 Timothy chapter two,

109
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,859
as God is using the analogy

110
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:04,220
of a believer being a good soldier in the Lord's army,

111
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,700
being a good soldier of the Lord Jesus Christ,

112
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,980
our minds immediately can understand what it is

113
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,179
to be a soldier in any armed forces,

114
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,140
in any military branch.

115
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,820
I understand in the United States of America,

116
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,820
the army, they like to be referred to as soldiers,

117
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,420
other branches, especially the Marine Corps,

118
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,059
they don't wanna be called a soldier,

119
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:27,579
they're a Marine and there's all of these things,

120
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:31,220
but we understand, I've never been in the military,

121
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,140
however, in certain ways,

122
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,899
I feel like I spent my whole life in the military,

123
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:38,299
because when I was born, my dad was in the Marine Corps,

124
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:40,700
when I went to college, he was still in the Marine Corps,

125
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,579
and of course, Marines have the mindset,

126
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:45,500
once a Marine, always a Marine,

127
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,140
and then my brother went in,

128
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,779
I've been around it for a long time,

129
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:53,540
but I've never personally been in the military,

130
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,100
but I've examined things, I've seen things firsthand,

131
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,660
I understand the training that they go through,

132
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:04,179
I understand the process in which the boot camps

133
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:08,299
and Steve is gonna graduate from boot camp on Friday

134
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:10,619
and Evan graduated back in April

135
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:11,739
and he's going through school

136
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:14,140
and they go through all of these process, why?

137
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,899
Because at some point, there's a time

138
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:20,700
in which someone in the armed forces,

139
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,019
regardless of what branch they're in,

140
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:25,179
they're gonna face some difficulty,

141
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:27,579
they're gonna face some hardness,

142
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:31,540
we of course understand that in the era in which we're living

143
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,540
the constant potential of war and so on and so forth,

144
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:40,100
and you think about the training that has gone through,

145
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,299
the training that they endure, why?

146
00:06:43,299 --> 00:06:45,420
It's so that when they come to the place

147
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,940
of facing the hardness, the difficulty, the trouble,

148
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,980
that they will be able to endure,

149
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,339
that they will be able to stand,

150
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:54,059
that they will be able to continue,

151
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:56,140
that they won't just wave the white flag and say,

152
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,779
yeah, I didn't sign up for all this.

153
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:00,500
Do you understand what I'm saying?

154
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,859
I'm thankful for our armed forces, amen?

155
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:06,980
I am thankful for those that serve

156
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,179
in the branches of the military,

157
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,619
I am thankful this morning for those that have served

158
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:16,859
that have gone before us, that have fought for the freedoms

159
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:19,779
that we enjoy today in the United States of America,

160
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:22,820
I'm thankful for those that continue to serve

161
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,779
to defend and protect the freedoms

162
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,339
that we enjoy as American citizens.

163
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:31,220
I don't pretend that anything about America,

164
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,579
nothing about the armed forces is not perfect,

165
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:36,500
I understand there are flaws and so on and so forth,

166
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,500
but I am thankful for those that voluntarily sign up

167
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,420
to serve our nation, amen?

168
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,940
I benefit from it, you benefit from it,

169
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,820
and I am so thankful.

170
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,500
We understand some things about military service,

171
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,739
generally speaking, but as we look at the scriptures

172
00:07:56,739 --> 00:08:00,779
and we see that God uses this analogy that the believer,

173
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:04,579
the individual believer is a soldier

174
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:06,260
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

175
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,940
and the desire is not to be content

176
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,179
with simply being a soldier, but being a good soldier.

177
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,339
And the characteristic that we first come to

178
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:19,500
is that the good soldier, he endures hardness.

179
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,619
What does it mean to endure?

180
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:24,260
Well, from the 1828 Noel Webster's Dictionary,

181
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,260
it means to continue in the same state without perishing.

182
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,739
I like that idea.

183
00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:33,419
I like that definition.

184
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,859
It means to remain, it means to stand,

185
00:08:35,859 --> 00:08:38,940
it means to continue, it means to persevere.

186
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,979
The trials will come, the troubles will come,

187
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,460
the difficulties will come,

188
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,820
the hardness, as it says here in the text of scripture,

189
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,099
will come, but how do we endure

190
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:52,580
given the hardness that will come?

191
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,179
We desire to stand, to continue, to persevere,

192
00:08:56,179 --> 00:09:01,020
to remain in the same place without perishing.

193
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,859
Why or how are we to do this?

194
00:09:04,859 --> 00:09:06,900
There's an expectation.

195
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,380
I don't believe that anyone that's gone through

196
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,940
the military branches of our nation,

197
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,500
that at the time of difficulty, of hardness,

198
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,500
that the general leading the army would turn around

199
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,460
and expect that all of his soldiers

200
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,539
would be fleeing in the other direction.

201
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,979
What a sad situation that would be.

202
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:28,299
They're retreating when they should be making progress,

203
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:29,380
when they should be standing,

204
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,979
when they should be enduring.

205
00:09:31,979 --> 00:09:33,500
So we understand the word endure.

206
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,380
The word hardness means a hardship,

207
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,900
a trouble, an affliction.

208
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,900
Now understand as we look here at the text of scripture

209
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,780
that is before us and we begin to focus on this expectation

210
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,219
that God has of a good soldier,

211
00:09:48,219 --> 00:09:51,219
that this first characteristic that is given to us

212
00:09:51,219 --> 00:09:55,059
is that they would endure hardness.

213
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:58,380
The expectation is that in the midst of the hardness,

214
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,979
in the midst of the trouble.

215
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:03,059
in the midst of the affliction and the hardship

216
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:05,859
that we would endure, that we would not retreat,

217
00:10:05,859 --> 00:10:08,699
that we would not give up, that we would not turn away,

218
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:11,619
that we would not wave that white flag of surrender,

219
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:13,619
no, that we would continue.

220
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:16,419
Our theme for this year is continue.

221
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:19,179
We find that as we look at this expectation,

222
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:21,179
I believe that the expectation,

223
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:24,299
not only is of Paul writing to Timothy,

224
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:26,139
but I believe in a greater sense,

225
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:30,339
it's God's expectation for every one of his children

226
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:32,939
that have been enlisted into the Lord's army

227
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:34,519
that we would be good soldiers,

228
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:37,159
that we would endure hardness.

229
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:40,739
You say, but I don't like hardness.

230
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:41,819
I understand.

231
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:46,139
But you not liking it doesn't mean it's not gonna come.

232
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:49,459
Amen?

233
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:53,379
The trouble, the affliction, the hardship,

234
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:56,099
the hardness will come.

235
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:58,839
We find that for Timothy, it would be there.

236
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,639
The false teachers were there.

237
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,519
Those that would accuse him,

238
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,079
those that would take him to task,

239
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,079
and he's not the kind of pastor that he should be.

240
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:11,199
He said this, he didn't say that.

241
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:14,119
He went here, he didn't go there, whatever it might be.

242
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:18,159
No, he's gonna have to endure some hardness

243
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,199
as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

244
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:22,679
You know, the attacks from without

245
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:24,779
aren't really the ones that are hard to deal with.

246
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:25,919
It's the attacks from within

247
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,919
that are the greatest ones to deal with.

248
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:31,479
Paul says, as he's writing to the believers

249
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:33,359
in the region of Galatia, he says,

250
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,839
"'Have I become your enemy?'

251
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:35,679
"'Why?'

252
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,959
"'Because I tell you the truth.'"

253
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:39,359
Paul says, "'I'm simply seeking,

254
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:41,879
"'I will gladly spend and be sent for you.'"

255
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:43,399
He says to the church in Corinth,

256
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,219
"'I'm simply giving you the truth,

257
00:11:45,219 --> 00:11:48,319
"'and yet you treat me as an enemy.'"

258
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:50,159
Oh, it's a challenge, it's a difficulty.

259
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:54,619
But Timothy was going to have to endure hardness.

260
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:56,759
It's interesting for the text of Scripture

261
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:59,319
does not tell us the specifics

262
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:02,919
with regard to what the troubles or the hardships would be.

263
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:07,079
The definition or the hardnesses are not defined

264
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,819
and they're not explained as to the details.

265
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:12,499
It simply says endure hardness.

266
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,439
This morning in the marriage Sunday school class,

267
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:18,799
I taught on the subject of trials.

268
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:21,639
And no doubt there's some similarities,

269
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:24,279
but there's some differences between the hardness here

270
00:12:24,939 --> 00:12:28,619
in 2 Timothy 2 and the trial of James 1 and 1 Peter 1

271
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:30,139
that we dealt with in Sunday school.

272
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:33,579
But the truth remains in both scenarios

273
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:36,479
that we do not know when that hardness

274
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:40,239
or that trial will come, and it will be varied.

275
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:43,139
We don't know when the attack will come.

276
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,619
We don't know when the trouble will rise.

277
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:50,619
But the expectation is that the soldier endures hardness.

278
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:53,899
A good soldier endures hardness.

279
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:56,999
If you're taking notes, there's an example

280
00:12:56,999 --> 00:12:58,799
of those who have endured hardness.

281
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,119
I'm thankful that the expectation is provided to us

282
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:05,399
that a good soldier thou therefore endure hardness

283
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,119
as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

284
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:09,979
The expectation is given,

285
00:13:09,979 --> 00:13:13,059
but there's an example that is provided.

286
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:16,159
Notice the greatest example that we could ever look to

287
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,999
of course is the Lord Jesus Christ.

288
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:20,679
And we find if you skip down to verse number eight,

289
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:23,519
notice what the apostle Paul says to Timothy

290
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,919
with regard to this again.

291
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:27,259
As I mentioned, the characteristic is given

292
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:29,499
and then I believe it is illustrated

293
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:31,019
in the text of scripture as well.

294
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,059
And we begin reading of this enduring hardness

295
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:36,099
being illustrated in verse number eight.

296
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:36,939
And it says this,

297
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:41,539
remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David

298
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:46,539
was raised from the dead according to my gospel.

299
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,539
Now I want you to understand that when we read

300
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:51,119
verse number eight in 2 Timothy chapter number two,

301
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:53,979
we can rejoice at the remembering of the fact

302
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:56,099
that we serve a risen savior,

303
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:58,979
but we also must acknowledge that we understand

304
00:13:58,979 --> 00:14:02,779
that he rose from the dead because he was crucified.

305
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:06,579
He rose from the dead because of the trials that he faced

306
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,259
and the beatings that he endured

307
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:10,779
and all that he went through

308
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:12,599
before he went to that cruel cross.

309
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:16,259
All of that comes to my mind when I begin to read

310
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:19,939
what Paul says in remembering about the resurrection

311
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,479
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

312
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:24,079
I said this, I believe it was on resurrection Sunday

313
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,639
this year that someone asked me,

314
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,719
what's more important the death of Christ

315
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:30,159
or the resurrection of Christ?

316
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:33,859
And my answer was, yes, they both are equally important.

317
00:14:33,859 --> 00:14:36,919
You cannot have a resurrection if you do not have a death

318
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,079
and you cannot have a death if you do not have,

319
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,439
or the death is of no consequence

320
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:43,839
if you do not have a resurrection.

321
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,459
And so we find that here as God says to Timothy,

322
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:50,639
remember something, remember what?

323
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,879
That Jesus Christ of the seed of David

324
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:57,239
was raised from the dead according to my gospel.

325
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:59,199
Understand with me that before he ever went

326
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,959
to that cruel cross, he endured great, great hardness.

327
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,359
Understand that he endured that with a perspective

328
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:07,559
that is so important for us.

329
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:10,519
Look over quickly, if you will, at Hebrews chapter 12.

330
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:13,799
And so often we focus on the first couple of verses

331
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:16,159
of Hebrews chapter 12 and rightly so,

332
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,299
looking unto Jesus, verse number two,

333
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:20,619
the author and finisher of our faith

334
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:25,019
and how we rejoice in understanding who he is

335
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:27,759
and what he has done for us.

336
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,419
But I want you to look at the entirety of verse number two.

337
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:33,779
In Hebrews chapter 12 and verse number two,

338
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:36,919
the Bible says, looking unto Jesus,

339
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:40,739
the author and finisher of our faith,

340
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:44,419
who for the joy that was set before him,

341
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,399
what does it say in your Bible?

342
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,679
Endured the cross.

343
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,359
Endured the cross.

344
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:54,639
Notice, despising the shame and is set down

345
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,519
at the right hand of the throne of God.

346
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,719
Aren't you thankful that he's risen?

347
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,159
He has ascended, he's in his place.

348
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:03,359
Listen, one day he's coming back for us.

349
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:04,959
We understand that.

350
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,799
The trumpet of the Lord shall sound

351
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,479
and time shall be no more, as the songwriter said.

352
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:11,799
And what a joy that Jesus himself said,

353
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:16,799
I will come again and receive you unto myself

354
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,619
that where I am, there ye may be also.

355
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:22,859
But at this moment, he's at the right hand of the father.

356
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:24,379
He's in his proper place.

357
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:26,459
He's resurrected, he's ascended,

358
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:28,759
and how we can rejoice in the finished work.

359
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:32,459
But notice the Bible says that he endured the cross.

360
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:33,419
Why?

361
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:36,019
For the joy that was set before him.

362
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:40,699
He understood that he had to go through that hardness

363
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,959
in order to pay for your sin and for my sin

364
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:45,719
and for the sin of the world.

365
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:48,219
In verse number three, it says, for consider him

366
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,919
that endured, we see the word again,

367
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:54,999
such contradiction of sinners against himself,

368
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:59,559
lest ye be wearied and faint in your own minds.

369
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:03,199
See, the contrast here is that we consider

370
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,919
that the endurance of the Lord Jesus Christ

371
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,719
and what he endured during that whole process,

372
00:17:09,739 --> 00:17:14,739
and he says, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.

373
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:17,459
Listen, we ought not to grow weary.

374
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:19,859
We ought not to grow weary in well-doing

375
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,259
as Galatians 6 tells us.

376
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:25,139
We ought to understand that we're to be focused

377
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:27,219
and to be strengthened in our inner man

378
00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:29,499
that we would not faint.

379
00:17:29,499 --> 00:17:32,339
We read of that in 2 Corinthians chapter number four.

380
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:34,459
We have this ministry, but we faint not.

381
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:35,299
Why?

382
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:38,219
Because we've been strengthened in the inner man.

383
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:40,579
We can endure, we can continue,

384
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:43,879
we can stand in the midst of the hardness.

385
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:44,719
Why?

386
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:46,299
Because of what Christ has done for us.

387
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,059
He's an example for us.

388
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:50,659
We mentioned in first there over

389
00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:52,059
in 2 Timothy chapter two

390
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:54,519
that the greatest example is the Lord Jesus Christ.

391
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:57,019
We see it illustrated here in Hebrews 12 again,

392
00:17:57,019 --> 00:17:59,619
but look at 1 Peter chapter two.

393
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:03,179
In 1 Peter chapter two, and Peter, of course,

394
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,939
was an eyewitness of the sufferings of Christ,

395
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:08,899
and he was in that inner circle

396
00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:11,939
that we spoke of a few weeks ago

397
00:18:11,939 --> 00:18:14,159
with regard to teaching others also

398
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,779
and how Peter, James, and John were in that inner circle.

399
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:20,099
And here, Peter is writing under the inspiration

400
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,599
of the Holy Spirit of God,

401
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:24,979
and he says in 1 Peter chapter two in verse number 21,

402
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:28,679
for even hereunto were ye called,

403
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,979
notice, because Christ also suffered for us,

404
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:36,940
leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps,

405
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,099
who did no sin.

406
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:42,179
Neither was guile found in his mouth,

407
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:46,059
who, when he was reviled, reviled not again.

408
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,619
When he suffered, he threatened not,

409
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:53,099
but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.

410
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,820
Who, his own self, bear our sins

411
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,659
in his own body on the tree,

412
00:18:57,659 --> 00:18:59,979
that we, being dead to sin,

413
00:18:59,979 --> 00:19:01,899
should live unto righteousness,

414
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:04,940
by whose stripes ye were healed.

415
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,579
For ye were a sheep going astray,

416
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,619
but are now returned to the shepherd

417
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:12,179
and bishop of your souls.

418
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,659
I'm thankful for the example of the Lord Jesus Christ,

419
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:17,139
who, when he was reviled, reviled not again.

420
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:19,459
Who, when he suffered, he threatened not.

421
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:22,419
Listen, though he could call 12 legions of angels,

422
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:24,339
he endured the hardness.

423
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:25,659
He went to the cross.

424
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:29,739
He paid for the sin of the world.

425
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:32,419
What an example.

426
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:34,299
But I find in our text of Scripture,

427
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,099
not simply the example that is provided

428
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:40,059
of the Lord Jesus Christ, the greatest example,

429
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:42,940
and we understand that it is important

430
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,619
for us to consider the example,

431
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:47,859
to consider him that endured such contradiction,

432
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:49,339
but we go back to 2 Timothy

433
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:51,699
and we find there's another example that's provided,

434
00:19:51,699 --> 00:19:55,219
and that's the example of the Apostle Paul himself.

435
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:57,260
In verse nine and 10,

436
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,260
we see that the Apostle Paul begins to talk about.

437
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,560
his own experience and his own suffering

438
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,060
and how he suffered trouble,

439
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,600
how he dealt with the hardnesses

440
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,360
that would come his way,

441
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,940
but yet he endured, yet he continued,

442
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,320
he remained steadfast,

443
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,120
he persevered through that trouble

444
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,280
and that affliction, that hardness.

445
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,620
Notice in verse number nine,

446
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,200
he says, wherein I suffer trouble.

447
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,580
As an evildoer, he said,

448
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,580
the kind of trouble that I'm suffering

449
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,620
is like someone that is an evildoer,

450
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,400
somebody that is rightly deserving

451
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,780
because of their behavior,

452
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,660
these particular situations,

453
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,820
being in prison, facing a martyr's death,

454
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,420
all that's contained therein,

455
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,300
and we find that he says that he's even unto bonds.

456
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,940
So he's suffering trouble as an evildoer,

457
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,140
though he did nothing wrong,

458
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,820
what was he really guilty of?

459
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,620
Preaching the gospel.

460
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,500
That's what he was guilty of.

461
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,160
And guess what?

462
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,860
The religious leaders of the day didn't like it.

463
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,160
They didn't like Paul,

464
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,660
they didn't like his message,

465
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,460
they didn't like what he was doing,

466
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,300
and so they arrested him

467
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,620
and we find that here he's in prison

468
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,040
and soon he would face that martyr's death,

469
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,900
but he says this at the end of verse number nine,

470
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,220
I love it, but the word of God is not bound.

471
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,500
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

472
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,980
And we find that in verse number 10,

473
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,100
notice where he says, therefore,

474
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,780
I, what does it say?

475
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:32,780
Endure all things for the elect's sake,

476
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,460
that they may also obtain the salvation

477
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,980
which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

478
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,060
I want you to think about what Paul is saying here

479
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,140
in verse number 10.

480
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,820
He's saying, though I suffer,

481
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,780
though I'm dealing with this trouble,

482
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,700
though I've been falsely accused,

483
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,940
I'm suffering trouble as an evildoer,

484
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,580
but truly there was nothing that he was guilty of

485
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,740
other than obeying the Lord Jesus Christ

486
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,700
and preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

487
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,820
He says, though that is the case,

488
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:05,460
that is my place, that is my current situation,

489
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,100
I'm enduring these things,

490
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,820
notice, for the elect's sake,

491
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,220
that they may also obtain the salvation

492
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,060
which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

493
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,300
He says, listen, though I'm suffering as an evildoer,

494
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,620
though I'm in bonds,

495
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,580
though I'm dealing with these hardships,

496
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,340
I'm not gonna have a pity party,

497
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,180
I'm not gonna say woe is me,

498
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,980
I'm not gonna throw in the towel and give up, why?

499
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,180
Because there are people that need for me to endure

500
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,900
so that they can hear the truth.

501
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,740
Hallelujah for a perspective like that.

502
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,500
We find that Paul, he had this perspective

503
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,780
that was so much beyond himself.

504
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,420
We live in a selfish generation.

505
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,180
It's all about me.

506
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,300
In fact, we read it as we come to the third chapter,

507
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,420
we'll get there in about five or six weeks,

508
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,700
where it says, for men shall be lovers of their own selves

509
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,140
in verse number two.

510
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,500
Oh man, if we don't see that everywhere around us today,

511
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,980
we live in this, oh, did you hear what they said to me?

512
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,020
Did you hear what they did to me?

513
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,420
Did you hear how they, I'm just gonna give up,

514
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,900
I'm just gonna throw in the towel,

515
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,660
I'm not gonna go back to that church,

516
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,620
I'm not gonna, hold on a minute, it's not about you,

517
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,980
it's not about me, it's about him.

518
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,580
John the Baptist said, I must decrease,

519
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,340
but he must increase.

520
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,460
I gotta decrease, but he must increase.

521
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,980
And we find that we live,

522
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,740
Paul's not so concerned about himself,

523
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,540
Paul's not concerned about how, listen,

524
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,300
he suffers as an evildoer, but he's done no evil.

525
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,820
But he says, I got a greater perspective.

526
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,860
Timothy, I'm telling you that a good soldier,

527
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,780
one of the characteristics is that they endure hardness.

528
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,500
But I'm not telling you, Timothy,

529
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,820
or of course God is the one that's giving the word,

530
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,140
because all scripture is given by inspiration of God,

531
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,940
God is not telling Timothy,

532
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,380
nor is God simply telling us today

533
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:09,820
to do something that he himself has not done.

534
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,140
God endured hardness,

535
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:14,660
the Lord Jesus Christ endured great affliction,

536
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,860
contradiction as he went to the cross.

537
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,900
But Paul says, listen, Timothy,

538
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,180
I'm not just telling you to endure hardness,

539
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,580
I'm actively enduring hardness.

540
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,940
What a joy to see the example.

541
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,820
Can I tell you this morning that it doesn't just stop

542
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,980
with the example of the Lord Jesus Christ,

543
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,540
nor with the example of Paul,

544
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,500
there are countless others.

545
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,339
If you read the book of Hebrews in the 11th chapter,

546
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:44,140
we often refer to it as the hall of faith chapter,

547
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,820
and how we read the chapter

548
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,740
and we deal with all of the great triumphs

549
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,380
that are accomplished by faith

550
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,059
and how this one by faith did this,

551
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:54,779
and this one by faith did that,

552
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:58,820
and we read of those that were able to do great things

553
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,220
and accomplish great things.

554
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,100
I want to remind you that the end

555
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,660
of the passage of scripture says this

556
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,980
in verse number 32 of Hebrews 11,

557
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,339
and what shall I more say?

558
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:12,500
For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, of Barak,

559
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,140
of Samson, of Jephthah, of David,

560
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,940
also in Samuel, and of the prophets,

561
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,980
who through faith subdued kingdoms,

562
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,980
wrought righteousness, obtained promises,

563
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,700
stopped the mouths of lions,

564
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,059
quenched the violence of fire,

565
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:24,420
escaped the edge of the sword.

566
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,420
Out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight,

567
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,900
turned to flight the armies of the aliens.

568
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,700
Women received their dead, raised to life again,

569
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,540
and others, notice, before we get to the others

570
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,600
that are mentioned halfway through verse 35,

571
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,860
those are great triumphs that we read

572
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,700
in verses 32 through 34,

573
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,700
and even the first phrase of verse 35,

574
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,300
we say, man, look at what was accomplished through faith,

575
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,900
look at these great triumphs through faith.

576
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,500
The writer of Hebrews cannot get into all of the specifics,

577
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,020
the time would not permit him,

578
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,300
and he simply, with a very broad brush,

579
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,580
just names all these people,

580
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,700
but then he says this in verse 35,

581
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,000
and others, others were tortured,

582
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,460
not accepting deliverance,

583
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,380
that they might obtain a better resurrection,

584
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,460
and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings,

585
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,940
yea, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment.

586
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,779
They were stoned, they were sawn asunder,

587
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:24,619
were tempted, were slain with the sword.

588
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:27,100
They wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins,

589
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,660
being destitute, afflicted,

590
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,559
tormented of whom the world was not worthy.

591
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,460
They wandered in deserts and in mountains

592
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,240
and dens and caves of the earth.

593
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,980
These all, having obtained a good report

594
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,540
through faith, received not the promise,

595
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,740
God having provided some better thing for us,

596
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,920
that they without us should not be made perfect.

597
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,700
We don't know specifically every reference

598
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,820
that is made, who the individual would be in mind

599
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,820
that they were referring to,

600
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,680
which prophet, and so on and so forth,

601
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,339
but there are some that we do know

602
00:26:58,339 --> 00:27:00,980
with a great level of confidence.

603
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,100
And I would say of this,

604
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,619
that those that are mentioned at the beginning,

605
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:06,180
partway through verse 35,

606
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,380
and all the way down through verse number 37,

607
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:13,339
when you read the hardness that they endured,

608
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:16,100
they continued, though they faced the hardness.

609
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,580
The idea that is given to us of these cruel mockings

610
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,760
and these scourgings of bonds and imprisonment,

611
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,500
those are all things that we can easily understand,

612
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,380
but in verse 37, they were stoned.

613
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,220
Again, easy for us to understand.

614
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,100
They were sawn asunder.

615
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:34,220
Literally, what history would tell us is cut in half.

616
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,779
Not horizontally, but vertically.

617
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:43,100
The pain that one would endure, but they endured it.

618
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,380
They did not give up.

619
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,740
They did not go back.

620
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,420
They did not sign and say,

621
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,900
no, I will no longer speak in his name.

622
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,580
John Bunyan, it's my understanding, as you read history,

623
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,660
that he had the opportunity on more than one occasion

624
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,020
to be released from prison

625
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:00,000
if he would simply agree to one thing,

626
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,400
and that was to stop preaching the gospel

627
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,980
of the Lord Jesus Christ

628
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,619
and stop contradicting the state church.

629
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:10,140
And what did he do?

630
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,240
He said, you can keep your piece of paper.

631
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:19,020
I'll endure the hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

632
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,580
The idea that is given to us here

633
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,680
of those that were, of course, slain with the sword.

634
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,940
Again, easy to understand.

635
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,580
They wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins.

636
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:31,380
The idea is taking the leather skins of an animal

637
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,619
and having it wet and wrapping it around an individual

638
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:36,299
and putting them out in the desert

639
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:37,780
so that as they would walk about

640
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:40,619
and it would dry, it would literally shrink

641
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,859
and suffocate them to death.

642
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,580
Wow.

643
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,460
But they endured.

644
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:53,140
Paul said this in 2 Timothy chapter three,

645
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,220
in verse number 11, he said,

646
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,299
persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch,

647
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:06,220
at Iconium, at Lystra, what persecutions I endured,

648
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,700
and notice it says this, but out of them all,

649
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,700
the Lord delivered me.

650
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,660
The Lord delivered me.

651
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,900
In chapter four, he would say this, beginning in verse 14,

652
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,979
Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil.

653
00:29:19,979 --> 00:29:22,619
The Lord reward him according to his works.

654
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:24,239
Of whom be thou where also,

655
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:26,660
for he hath greatly withstood our words.

656
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,500
Paul calls this one out by name.

657
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,179
Says he did me evil, but he'll do you evil as well.

658
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:35,260
Be careful, beware.

659
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,100
He says this at my first answer,

660
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,460
Paul says in 2 Timothy 4, 16,

661
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,340
no man stood with me, but all men forsook me.

662
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,700
I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.

663
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,340
Notwithstanding, the Lord stood with me

664
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,260
and strengthened me, that by me,

665
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,059
the preaching might be fully known

666
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:55,340
and that all the Gentiles might hear.

667
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,859
And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion

668
00:29:57,859 --> 00:30:00,580
and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil word.

669
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:08,900
work, and will preserve me unto His heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory forever and ever.

670
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,900
Amen."

671
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,540
Wow, what a great testimony.

672
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:18,220
There's an expectation, but there's also an example.

673
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,820
Though the type of hardness will vary from believer to believer, we acknowledge these

674
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:27,940
two truths that are given to us in 2 Timothy chapter 2, that there is this expectation

675
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,180
that a good soldier would endure hardness.

676
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:34,500
There is this example that is provided to us of those that have endured.

677
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,380
But I want to finish this morning and spend the rest of our time on this thought as we

678
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:45,020
finish the message number three this morning, how God has equipped us to endure.

679
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,780
I mentioned to somebody this week as I was having a meeting with them on Friday afternoon,

680
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:52,940
I said, listen, when I come to the passage of Scripture they'll be preaching on Sunday,

681
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,380
I kind of give them a preview.

682
00:30:54,380 --> 00:31:00,780
I said, listen, it's not sufficient for me in my way of thinking, in my way of processing

683
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,820
to just simply end a message by saying, endure hardness.

684
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:08,780
I mean, that's what you're to do as a good soldier, just endure hardness.

685
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:14,940
Because in my mind I say, how, how, how can we endure hardness?

686
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,820
Can I say this this morning?

687
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:22,040
It has been really easy in America to be a Christian.

688
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:29,200
If you compare American Christianity to many other places of the world today, if you compare

689
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:38,920
American Christianity to first century Christianity, it's been easy to be a Christian in America.

690
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,560
Would you agree with that?

691
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,040
It's been easy.

692
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,280
I don't know that it always will be.

693
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,480
I don't know that it will not be.

694
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,400
I just don't know that it always will be.

695
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,400
What do the Scriptures tell us in 2 Timothy 3?

696
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:59,440
We read it last week, yea, all those that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

697
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,720
I don't know the level of which we will face hardship and difficulty in these trials.

698
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:12,080
But can I tell you that there are brothers and sisters around the globe today that have

699
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,160
the same Bible that we have, it might be in a different language, but they have the same

700
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,920
Bible that we have, and they can read the same passage that we're reading this morning,

701
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,760
and they can read where the Bible says that as a good soldier of Jesus Christ, I am to

702
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:32,360
endure hardness, and they are literally facing great hardness.

703
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:38,200
And how is it that in the midst of that great difficulty, of that great hardship, how can

704
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,200
they endure?

705
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,840
How can they continue?

706
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:47,000
How is it that in some places around the world today, the church of the Lord Jesus Christ

707
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:54,840
is flourishing in some of the places where the persecution is the hardest?

708
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
Why is that?

709
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,840
Well, I believe it's the same thing that happened in the book of Acts.

710
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:06,560
Persecution on the part of the religious leaders was designed to stamp out Christianity in

711
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:11,840
Jerusalem, but all they did is spread the fire around the world, because they that were

712
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:17,400
scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the Word, according to Acts 8 and verse number

713
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,400
4.

714
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,680
And so we find that they endured hardness in Jerusalem, but God's plan was that they

715
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:28,080
wouldn't just stay in Jerusalem anyway, that they would go to Judea and Samaria and the

716
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,080
uttermost, and they go forth preaching the Word.

717
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:40,020
We find that in places today, like I've read of testimonies in North Korea, I've read of

718
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:46,460
testimonies in China, I've read of testimonies in Iran, I've read of testimonies in Nigeria,

719
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,460
I've read of...

720
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:52,540
Listen, the northern part of Nigeria, they are, they suffer great persecution in the

721
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,540
northern part of Nigeria.

722
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:59,380
We find that there are places all across the northern part of the continent of Africa where

723
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,700
Christians are suffering greatly.

724
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:07,180
How is it that we can read of our missionaries that are in some of the most difficult places

725
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:15,900
that they send back reports of literally scores of people trusting Christ as their Savior?

726
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:20,460
The American church, it's been easy for us.

727
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:25,060
And in some ways, I believe it's the exact tactic of the enemy that we see in Revelation

728
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:30,420
chapter 3 of the church of the Laodiceans, that we're filled with goods, we have need

729
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:35,500
of nothing, and we're just kind of big, fat, and happy, and I hate to use the expression

730
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,700
that way, but I hope you can understand.

731
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:44,500
We're full of goods and we have need of nothing.

732
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:51,140
And it's caused the church of the Lord Jesus Christ to become very indifferent, to become

733
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:58,180
very apathetic, and I believe that the persecution will one day come.

734
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,920
The hardness is going to come.

735
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,140
It might not be in your lifetime, it might not be in my lifetime, it might not be in

736
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:08,580
your kid's lifetime, but I believe that if the Lord Jesus Christ doesn't return, that

737
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:14,620
we're going to face some hardships here in our beloved nation.

738
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:19,100
I've had people say, oh, American Christians are never going to suffer persecution on that

739
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,100
level.

740
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,260
Where do you read that in the Bible, first of all?

741
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,900
And second of all, what makes American Christians any better than Christians anywhere else in

742
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,940
the globe?

743
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:32,340
If they're suffering in other parts of the world, why would we think that we wouldn't

744
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,340
suffer?

745
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,540
That's a bad mindset.

746
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,980
That is not a biblical view.

747
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,580
So has God equipped us?

748
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:46,300
How has God equipped us so that we can endure hardness?

749
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,420
Let me give you six things.

750
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,060
You say, man, we're already way into the message, you're going to give us six things.

751
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,060
I'm going to give them to you quickly.

752
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:58,420
I'm going to have you jot down some verses, and I hope that it will be a blessing to you

753
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:04,420
as you consider how God has equipped His soldiers to endure hardness.

754
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:09,660
I hope that we can use the analogy this morning when we look at this equipping, that if you

755
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:15,380
have any level of knowledge of our armed forces in the United States of America, if you have

756
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:20,300
any knowledge of maybe you personally have gone, you've served in the military, you've

757
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:27,660
been through boot camp, you have a loved one that has, and you understand how the purpose

758
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:33,100
of those drill instructors, the purpose of the instructors is to teach them to, let me

759
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:38,760
use the word, equip them for what they will face.

760
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,300
So God has equipped us.

761
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,120
He didn't simply tell us you're going to face hardship.

762
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,620
He didn't even simply tell us you need to endure the hardness.

763
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:55,000
He said, here's how I've equipped you so that you can endure when the hardness comes.

764
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,440
And I love that about our God.

765
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,680
He didn't just say endure hardness.

766
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,000
It's going to come and just endure.

767
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,520
Just hold on.

768
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,520
No.

769
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,520
He gives us the equipping.

770
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,240
Notice the first thought this morning.

771
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,520
It has to deal with the Holy Spirit.

772
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,880
Oh, how thankful I am for God's wisdom in giving us the Holy Spirit.

773
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:20,420
The Holy Spirit indwells me, the Holy Spirit comforts me, and the Holy Spirit enables me.

774
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,640
He indwells me.

775
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,640
What?

776
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,400
Do you know that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which you

777
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,400
have of God?

778
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,120
Listen, at the moment of salvation, when you trust that Christ is your Savior this morning,

779
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:36,160
whatever that date was, yesterday was my spiritual birthday, 27 years old in the Lord.

780
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,160
Hallelujah.

781
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,560
I am so thankful for that day that I trust that Christ is my Savior.

782
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,200
But I want you to know that on that day, the Holy Spirit of God took up residence.

783
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,320
I was indwelled with the Spirit of God.

784
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,360
If you're saved this morning, you've been saved.

785
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,160
No matter when it was that you got saved, you were indwelled with the Spirit of God.

786
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,360
Not only does the Holy Spirit indwell me, according to 1 Corinthians 6, but the Holy

787
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,080
Spirit comforts me.

788
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:06,600
According to John 14 and verse 16, the Bible tells us that He is the comforter.

789
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,200
He comforts me.

790
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,520
I want you to understand that He not only indwells me and comforts me, but He enables

791
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,960
me.

792
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,400
But you shall receive power.

793
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,840
Consider that the Holy Ghost has come upon you, and you shall be witnesses unto me both

794
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,600
in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, the uttermost part of the earth.

795
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:28,120
And we find that in Acts 1.8, that truth is given to us that He enables us.

796
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,320
The Bible talks about spiritual gifts that the Holy Spirit of God gives to every man

797
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,360
severally as He will.

798
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,200
He enables us to be able to endure.

799
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,400
We must walk in the Spirit so that we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh, according to

800
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,119
Galatians chapter number 6.

801
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:49,320
And so we find that one of the means by which God has equipped His people to be good soldiers

802
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:54,160
in His army is that He's given to us the Holy Spirit of God.

803
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,160
Praise the Lord.

804
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,799
You know that this is a unique thing for the children of God in the New Testament.

805
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:01,679
You understand the Old Testament, they did not have the indwelling of the Holy Spirit

806
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:03,799
of God like we have today.

807
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:08,280
The Holy Spirit of God would come upon and would depart from, would come upon and would

808
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,400
depart from.

809
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,320
But Jesus Christ, He said to them in John, we looked at it last week, it's expedient

810
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,600
for me that I go away.

811
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,600
Why?

812
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,440
Because if I don't go away then I can't send the comforter but He's going to go away so

813
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,239
He can send to us the comforter.

814
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:26,799
He said I'm not going to leave you comfortless, hallelujah, for the truth of the Holy Spirit

815
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:29,840
of God.

816
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:35,400
Number two, how has God equipped us?

817
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,880
He's given us the Word of God.

818
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,160
The Word of God strengthens me.

819
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,600
The Word of God comforts me.

820
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:48,160
It's amazing how the Holy Spirit uses the Word.

821
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,600
The Bible tells us the Holy Spirit is not only the comforter but He's the teacher.

822
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,000
He would guide us into all truth.

823
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,059
He would teach us all things.

824
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:00,559
We find that the Holy Spirit of God uses the Word of God.

825
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:03,399
The word of God strengthens me and it comforts me.

826
00:40:03,399 --> 00:40:04,919
First Peter chapter number two says,

827
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:07,839
as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word

828
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,799
that ye may grow thereby.

829
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:14,359
Now listen, we need to have some spiritual strength

830
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:15,759
if we're going to endure.

831
00:40:15,759 --> 00:40:18,359
We need to be strengthened by the spirit of God

832
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:21,719
in our inner man and he uses his word to do that.

833
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:25,119
We need more of God's word, not less of God's word.

834
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,319
We need to get into the Bible so that the Bible

835
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:28,359
gets into me.

836
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:31,759
Someone said this years ago and I love the thought,

837
00:40:31,759 --> 00:40:34,439
it says this, that thumbprints in the Bible

838
00:40:34,439 --> 00:40:37,199
are more important than footprints on the moon.

839
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:39,199
Hallelujah.

840
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:41,799
Listen, God's given us a Bible.

841
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:44,039
It ought not be that on Sunday mornings

842
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:46,039
we have to take the Bible and dust it off

843
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:47,279
so that we can bring it to church.

844
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:49,799
No, that every day we're in the Bible

845
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:52,959
because it strengthens me, it comforts me.

846
00:40:52,959 --> 00:40:55,279
First Thessalonians four and verse number 18,

847
00:40:55,279 --> 00:40:58,039
wherefore comfort one another with these things.

848
00:40:58,719 --> 00:40:59,559
With what things?

849
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:00,799
With the word, the truth.

850
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:04,519
Paul says, listen, I'm not speaking on my own belief.

851
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:07,159
I'm speaking as the word of God.

852
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:09,639
I'm giving to you, this is not my opinion.

853
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:11,279
This is not just what I think.

854
00:41:11,279 --> 00:41:13,559
This is not just we're gonna have a pep rally

855
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:14,720
and try to encourage you.

856
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,479
No, for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord.

857
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:21,680
God's word comforts me.

858
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,399
God's word strengthens me.

859
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:25,360
Can I tell you this morning that God has equipped

860
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,399
his people to endure hardness

861
00:41:27,399 --> 00:41:29,199
through giving us the Holy Spirit,

862
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:30,879
through giving to us the word of God.

863
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:34,439
By the way, I hope you view your Bible

864
00:41:34,439 --> 00:41:36,360
as a precious gift from God.

865
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,360
I hope that in my lifetime

866
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,199
they never try to take our Bibles away.

867
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:44,000
But I tell you that throughout history

868
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,559
they've tried to steal people's Bibles.

869
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:46,720
They try to confiscate them.

870
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,599
You're found with a Bible, they're gonna imprison you,

871
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:49,680
they're gonna kill you.

872
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,639
I mean, it's happened throughout the centuries.

873
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:53,159
We've seen it over and over.

874
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:54,799
I hope they never come for our Bible,

875
00:41:54,799 --> 00:41:57,319
but I wonder this morning if they came for our Bible,

876
00:41:57,319 --> 00:41:59,680
how much of the Bible do we have in our heart?

877
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:02,439
How much will we still know

878
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:05,319
if they come and take it away from us?

879
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:08,159
Oh, we need to recognize this as being a precious promise.

880
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,800
Somebody said this, we don't really appreciate things

881
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,479
until we don't have them anymore.

882
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,000
Listen, I hope that we appreciate the Bible right now

883
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,880
while we still have it.

884
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,399
I hope that it doesn't come to a point where you say,

885
00:42:20,399 --> 00:42:22,039
man, I wish I would have read it.

886
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,520
I wish I would have been able to.

887
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,919
No, no, no, that we're in it now.

888
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,639
God's providentially preserved it for us, hallelujah.

889
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:31,839
Listen, he's given to us the armor of God,

890
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:32,959
the armor of God.

891
00:42:32,959 --> 00:42:34,239
In Ephesians chapter six,

892
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:36,279
we won't take time to develop all of it,

893
00:42:36,279 --> 00:42:37,839
but in Ephesians chapter number six,

894
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,119
the Bible says in verse number 10,

895
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,800
finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord

896
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,679
and the power of his might.

897
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:44,679
Put on the whole armor of God

898
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:46,279
that ye may be able to what?

899
00:42:46,279 --> 00:42:50,039
Stand against the wiles of the devil.

900
00:42:50,919 --> 00:42:52,759
If you read throughout the passage

901
00:42:52,759 --> 00:42:54,520
all the way down to verse number 17,

902
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,160
you find that he says again,

903
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,399
about in verse number 13,

904
00:42:57,399 --> 00:42:58,599
putting on the whole armor of God

905
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:01,199
that you may be able to withstand in the evil day

906
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:03,440
and having done all to stand,

907
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,239
stand therefore.

908
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:08,080
We see the word used four times

909
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,839
within just a couple of verses of scripture.

910
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:10,679
Why?

911
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:14,039
Because we're to endure hardness.

912
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:16,319
The armor of God that is explained to us

913
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,039
in Ephesians chapter number six,

914
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:20,679
these people would have readily understood

915
00:43:20,919 --> 00:43:23,039
the way that it would be understood

916
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:24,759
by the Roman armor,

917
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:27,800
the Roman soldiers and the armor that they had.

918
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,279
And listen, when they were going to battle,

919
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:32,279
they were not going to retreat.

920
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,000
Amen?

921
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,319
And so God says, put on the whole armor of God.

922
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:40,239
Listen, we wrestle not against flesh and blood.

923
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:42,039
We're engaged in spiritual warfare.

924
00:43:43,399 --> 00:43:47,919
Tozer said, the Christian life is a battleground,

925
00:43:47,919 --> 00:43:49,239
not a playground.

926
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:51,880
How accurate that is.

927
00:43:53,279 --> 00:43:57,399
We find that God's given to us the Holy Spirit.

928
00:43:57,399 --> 00:43:59,279
He's given to us his word.

929
00:43:59,279 --> 00:44:01,839
He's given to us the armor.

930
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,279
All these things are equipping us to be able to stand.

931
00:44:04,279 --> 00:44:05,440
Can I say to you, number four,

932
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,479
that he's given us prayer?

933
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:08,319
Prayer.

934
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,599
Not only can we pray personally,

935
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,039
but I think about it from a perspective

936
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:15,239
of intercessory prayer.

937
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:18,959
Look at 2 Corinthians chapter one very quickly.

938
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,600
You might want to jot down in your notes

939
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,799
verses three through 11.

940
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:22,639
If you're taking notes,

941
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:25,279
I won't have time to read all of those verses.

942
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,760
But I want you to see as we kind of just jump

943
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,880
into the text that Paul talks about

944
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,239
the sufferings of Christ that abound in us

945
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,000
in verse number five.

946
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,519
But he talks about the consolation

947
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:40,040
also aboundeth by Christ,

948
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,959
the comfort that God gives.

949
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,000
He says in verse number,

950
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,720
notice with me in verse number six,

951
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,639
whether we be afflicted,

952
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:51,679
it is for your consolation and salvation,

953
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:53,679
which is effectual in the enduring

954
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:55,839
of the same sufferings which we also suffer,

955
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,040
or whether we be comforted,

956
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,880
it is for your consolation and salvation.

957
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,480
He says this in verse number eight,

958
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,679
for we would not, brethren,

959
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:05,919
have you ignorant of our trouble

960
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,399
which came to us in Asia,

961
00:45:07,399 --> 00:45:09,880
that we were pressed out of measure

962
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,799
above strength,

963
00:45:10,799 --> 00:45:13,399
insomuch that we despaired even of life.

964
00:45:13,399 --> 00:45:15,480
Verse nine in 2 Corinthians chapter one,

965
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,320
but we had the sentence of death in ourselves

966
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,079
that we should not trust in ourselves,

967
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,559
but in God which raiseth the dead.

968
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,480
But I want you to notice verse number 11,

969
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,880
ye also helping together, how?

970
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,839
By prayer for us.

971
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:34,079
God has given us the unique privilege of prayer

972
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,079
that enables us to endure hardness.

973
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,000
It's part of the equipping.

974
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,600
He says, listen, you can come to me at any time

975
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,720
for any reason, and you can pray.

976
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,559
But not only can you come personally,

977
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:48,519
but we have this truth of intercessory prayer.

978
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:50,720
These believers, they were praying.

979
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,000
Paul says that you helped together with,

980
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,200
you helped us, how?

981
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,639
By praying for us.

982
00:45:56,639 --> 00:45:59,480
Wow, how can I endure?

983
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,279
Paul comes back and shares testimony

984
00:46:01,279 --> 00:46:03,079
about various things that he dealt with,

985
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:04,000
and he says, listen,

986
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,919
it's the prayers of God's people that sustain me.

987
00:46:06,919 --> 00:46:09,119
Have you ever heard somebody say that?

988
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:10,399
I have.

989
00:46:10,399 --> 00:46:13,119
The prayers of God's people sustain me,

990
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:16,079
and it enabled me to endure the hardship

991
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,079
that I was facing, the difficulty, the opposition.

992
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:19,919
Why?

993
00:46:19,919 --> 00:46:21,359
Because there were some people that were praying.

994
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,919
The missionary of old, I believe it was Jonathan Goforth,

995
00:46:23,919 --> 00:46:26,079
he said, hold the ropes.

996
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,559
What do you mean by that?

997
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:29,919
I'm gonna go, but you need to pray.

998
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:35,839
We sing a song about that very thought.

999
00:46:36,959 --> 00:46:39,760
We find that missionaries have shared testimony,

1000
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,200
I've read them before,

1001
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,760
where they speak of coming back

1002
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,119
after suffering so greatly on the mission field

1003
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,919
and slipping into a church on a Wednesday evening

1004
00:46:47,919 --> 00:46:49,119
that supported them,

1005
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,639
and going into that church and finding

1006
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:56,079
that the truth of why they suffered so greatly

1007
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,679
is that there were none that were praying for them,

1008
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:01,600
and how disappointed they were.

1009
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,079
Every missionary I've ever spoken to,

1010
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,559
they need financial help,

1011
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:07,880
but they say this,

1012
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:11,679
the greatest thing you can do for us is pray for us.

1013
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:14,000
Yes, we need funds.

1014
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,279
We can't do the work without the funds,

1015
00:47:16,279 --> 00:47:17,919
but we can have all the funds in the world,

1016
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:20,959
and if we don't have the prayers of the saints,

1017
00:47:20,959 --> 00:47:22,799
it ain't gonna happen.

1018
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:24,200
Number five, quickly,

1019
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:30,559
God's given us the ability to have an eternal perspective,

1020
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:33,359
to see beyond this temporary.

1021
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:37,160
God has revealed to us things about the future.

1022
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,559
He's revealed to us the truth of heaven.

1023
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,880
He's revealed to us that those things

1024
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,959
that we're suffering at this moment

1025
00:47:44,959 --> 00:47:47,160
are not going to be forever.

1026
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,519
In 1 Peter 1, he talks about a season.

1027
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:53,399
In 1 Peter 5, he talks about a while.

1028
00:47:53,399 --> 00:47:56,160
He says that you're in these manifold temptations

1029
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,160
for a while after you've suffered for, excuse me,

1030
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,559
a season in chapter one.

1031
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,959
After you've suffered a while in chapter number five,

1032
00:48:02,959 --> 00:48:06,720
the reality is that neither one of those phrases

1033
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,799
are forever.

1034
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:09,399
We don't know how long a season is.

1035
00:48:09,399 --> 00:48:12,519
We don't know how long this a while is,

1036
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:14,079
but we know it's not forever,

1037
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,679
and we know that God has given us the truth of eternity.

1038
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:19,480
Paul says this in 2 Corinthians.

1039
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,679
You're there in chapter one.

1040
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:24,679
Turn over a couple of pages to chapter number four.

1041
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:27,160
In chapter four, he talks about, in verse number eight,

1042
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,519
being troubled on every side, yet not distressed.

1043
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:32,239
We're perplexed, but not in despair.

1044
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:34,520
Persecuted, verse number nine, but not forsaken.

1045
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,559
Cast down, but not destroyed.

1046
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,679
Notice in verse number 16, the Bible says,

1047
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:40,400
for which cause we faint not.

1048
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,640
How is it that we faint not?

1049
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,599
But though our outward man perish yet,

1050
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,400
the inward man is renewed day by day.

1051
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,400
For our light affliction, which is but for a moment,

1052
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,440
worketh for us a far more exceeding

1053
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,039
and eternal weight of glory,

1054
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,760
while we look not at the things which are seen,

1055
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,080
but at the things which are not seen,

1056
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,279
for the things which are seen are temporal,

1057
00:49:00,279 --> 00:49:02,960
but the things which are not seen are eternal.

1058
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,119
Hallelujah, for an eternal perspective.

1059
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:08,200
God's allowed us to know that there's something

1060
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,359
beyond today, the glory of heaven.

1061
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:13,760
Paul said, in 2 Timothy chapter four,

1062
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,960
look, the time of my departure is at hand.

1063
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,159
He understood that he would soon face that martyr's death,

1064
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:21,080
but he says this in verse number eight,

1065
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,599
there's laid up for me a crown of righteousness.

1066
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,559
I know I'm gonna die, but it's not the end.

1067
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:29,159
Hallelujah, I can endure hardness.

1068
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:32,000
God's equipped me with this eternal perspective.

1069
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,359
Number six, I would say this,

1070
00:49:34,359 --> 00:49:35,960
the fellowship of the brethren.

1071
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:39,279
You know, brothers and sisters in Christ,

1072
00:49:39,279 --> 00:49:40,279
we need each other.

1073
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:43,479
You say, I don't need anybody.

1074
00:49:43,479 --> 00:49:46,000
First of all, you've deceived yourself.

1075
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,279
And number two, somebody else might need you.

1076
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,400
Somebody else might need you.

1077
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,239
You say, you know, I don't really need to go to church today.

1078
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:54,559
You may not need to go to church today,

1079
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,719
but somebody might need you to go to church today.

1080
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:00,840
Stop getting that self-centered perspective.

1081
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:09,480
and thinking about others. Paul says this in 2 Corinthians chapter 7. He says that in

1082
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:14,840
verse number 5, from when we were coming to Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were

1083
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:21,760
troubled on every side. Without were fightings, within were fears. Nevertheless, God, aren't

1084
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:29,560
you thankful for God, for what He does? Here he uses the brethren, he uses the saints,

1085
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:35,800
especially Titus. He says that comforted those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming

1086
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:43,320
of Titus. Listen, God has equipped us to be able to endure. If we face hardness and we

1087
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:49,040
faint, if we face hardness and we quit, if we run and we turn and we give up, it's not

1088
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:55,360
God's fault. He has equipped us. But the reality is that we must take that equipping and we

1089
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:01,600
must apply it. We must understand how He has equipped us because God expects that

1090
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:08,040
a good soldier would endure hardness. The example's been given and He has equipped us.

1091
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:13,080
This morning, this message, I said this in Sunday school and I told them I would repeat

1092
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:17,240
it during the morning service. This morning, this message may be a kind of message that

1093
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:22,460
you say, you know, I'm really not dealing with any hardships right now. Maybe you would

1094
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:27,620
say as you look at this or listen to this message today, I really don't need that today.

1095
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:32,700
Can I say to you this morning, can you just tuck it away and remember it? Because when

1096
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:37,980
hardness comes in your life, God expects for you to endure. And you're going to need the

1097
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:43,340
truth that God gives us in 2 Timothy chapter number 2 with regard to enduring hardness

1098
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:48,540
and all of the means by which He has equipped us to do so. You say, I have no hardness today.

1099
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:52,780
Rejoice in that. Be thankful for that. But know that it's not going to stay that way

1100
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:59,120
forever because difficulty will come. You say, it's been easy in America. I know. I've

1101
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:06,460
enjoyed it. I don't like hardness. I'm just being honest. I don't like it. But I don't

1102
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:12,540
have my head in the sand. I don't know when the hardness is going to come. But I know

1103
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:19,340
that God expects that His people would endure. And God has equipped us. Okay, I know that

1104
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:24,700
I'm supposed to endure, but how? You could add to the list I provided with six ideas

1105
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:32,580
or thoughts for how you can endure hardness when it comes in your life, when it comes

1106
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:38,060
in our lives. Because we serve a great God who's on His throne, who doeth all things

1107
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:42,520
well and He has equipped us. Let's pray together. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving

1108
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:48,280
us. We thank you, God, for your Word. Father, maybe there's some here this morning that

1109
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:54,920
are dealing with some hardness, some trouble, some difficulty. Lord, I pray that you'd encourage

1110
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:59,300
them this morning and that you would enable them to endure, that they would take these

1111
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:04,000
truths and apply them in their lives. Maybe, God, for some of us, we're not really dealing

1112
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,040
with any trouble or hardness at the moment. Would you help us to know that it will not

1113
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:19,680
remain that way forever? God, that we would file these truths away, to be mindful of

1114
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:24,920
them so that when the day comes we would be prepared and equipped, that we would be able

1115
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:30,200
to endure hardness. I pray that in the time of invitation that you'd help us, Lord, to

1116
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:37,640
be responsive. Lord, I pray that as your Holy Spirit has spoken to your people, you would

1117
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:41,240
help us to respond, that we'd be doers of the Word and not hearers only, that we would

1118
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:48,400
apply these truths, these thoughts in our lives. That our desire would be that you would

1119
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:54,320
look at us and you would say that we're a good soldier, that we've endured hardness.

1120
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:58,840
We commit the time to you, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads

1121
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:03,200
are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano, and as she does,

1122
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:07,800
the altar is open. If you're not sure of heaven, I said in the beginning, if you've

1123
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,760
never been saved, you're not a soldier, but you need to be saved today and thus become

1124
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,440
a soldier. Maybe this morning you're dealing with some trouble, some hardness, you need

1125
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,760
to come and ask God to help you. Maybe this morning you say, I'm not facing it right now,

1126
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:25,440
but I know it'll come. I'm thankful for the equipping that God has given. As Kimberly

1127
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,880
plays, the altar is open.
