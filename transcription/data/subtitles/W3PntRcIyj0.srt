1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
8, we'll be looking at verses 7 through 15 this evening, and let me just read a couple

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,400
of the verses to you.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,159
We'll get into the passage of Scripture that is before us this evening.

4
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:13,760
2 Kings 8, we'll be looking at verses 7 through 15.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,560
The Bible says this in verse 7,

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:22,319
And Elisha came to Damascus, and Ben-Hadad the king of Syria was sick, and it was told

7
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:26,079
him, saying, The man of God is come hither.

8
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:31,239
As we continue to trace the steps of Elisha, we now find him in Damascus.

9
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,680
The city of Damascus is the capital of Syria.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,400
It was located about 130 miles northeast of Jerusalem.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,360
Of course, we understand that there was much interaction and work that took place during

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,799
the ministry of Elisha in the region of Samaria, which of course is north of Jerusalem as well.

13
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,000
But we find that he's now in Damascus.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,400
During the time of studying the life of Elisha, in fact, even as we studied the life and ministry

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,819
of Elijah, we had the opportunity to see many interactions between the Syrians and the children

16
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:03,819
of Israel.

17
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:09,839
Of course, the name Ben-Hadad has become somewhat familiar to us as we've studied these passages

18
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:15,639
of Scripture, and we've read about the way in which the Syrians had laid siege against

19
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:20,400
the nation of Israel, against the city of Samaria, and we read that in great detail

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,120
in chapter 6 and chapter 7, the effects, the impact of that siege that was laid against

21
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,080
the people of Israel, the city of Samaria.

22
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,980
And so we have, of course, had several interactions with Ben-Hadad, the Syrians, and their interactions

23
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,400
with the children of Israel.

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,360
Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, he had knowledge of Elisha.

25
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,519
In fact, we understand through the passages that we've studied—we'll reference some

26
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,720
of it back in chapter number 6 this evening in a little while—but we understand that

27
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,239
it was during that time in his life, in the life of Ben-Hadad, that there was some real

28
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,519
interaction between him and Elisha.

29
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,080
Of course, you'll recall that it was in that passage of Scripture that Elisha was telling

30
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,759
all of his secrets of all of his plans that he was making with regard to the military

31
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,960
campaign.

32
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,559
And so we find here that as we look at the passage of Scripture that is before us, that

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,160
this one, Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, he is now made aware, he is informed of the fact

34
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,399
that the man of God, Elisha, has come to Damascus.

35
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:29,360
As we look at the passage of Scripture, I want you to notice first of all with me—well,

36
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,360
let me do this.

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,360
Let me read verse number 11.

38
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
The Bible says this,

39
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,000
"...and he settled his countenance steadfastly until he was ashamed," notice this,

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,520
"...and the man of God wept."

41
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,320
The title for this evening's message is simply—adopt it from verse number 11 of

42
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,080
our text—the man of God wept.

43
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,279
That being Elisha, of course, as we get through the passage this evening, we'll understand

44
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:56,320
why it was that he wept, the man of God wept.

45
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,880
If you're taking notes, number one, the condition of Ben-Hadad.

46
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,479
In verses 7 and 8, the Bible gives us, reveals to us, the condition of the king of Syria.

47
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:11,240
We notice immediately in verse number 7, the Bible says that Elisha came to Damascus

48
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,440
and Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, was sick.

49
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,440
And it was told him, saying,

50
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,479
"...the man of God is come hither."

51
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:21,720
So we understand immediately, as we begin the passage of Scripture that is before us

52
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,039
this evening, we understand immediately that there is a physical ailment that Ben-Hadad

53
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,039
is dealing with.

54
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,039
He is sick.

55
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,279
He refers to it as a disease at the end of verse number 8,

56
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:35,039
"...shall I recover of this disease?"

57
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,960
We do not know all of the specifics and details as to what it is that Ben-Hadad is dealing

58
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,520
with, but we are aware of the fact that this condition is serious.

59
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,600
This sickness that he's dealing with is a serious condition.

60
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,880
It's one in which he's uncertain that he would recover from, one that might take him to the

61
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
grave.

62
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,360
We understand, as we'd study through the Scriptures and we'd see the references of Ben-Hadad

63
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,000
in other portions of Scripture, no doubt he was an elderly man at this point.

64
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,360
He'd been engaged in a number of battles and what have you.

65
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,919
And so we find that he has this sickness.

66
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:15,279
It's interesting that as we consider the condition of Ben-Hadad, that yes, we notice his physical

67
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:20,600
condition and the ailment that he's dealing with, but I also suggest to you this evening

68
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,880
that Ben-Hadad was not just sick, but he was seeking.

69
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,839
It's interesting to understand how at times, and really throughout Scripture, you see various

70
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:36,000
references of this, but we could even identify these things in our own lives, in the lives

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,859
of our loved ones, people that we've had interaction with through our lives.

72
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:42,959
But we understand that he is seeking.

73
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,559
He's seeking for answers.

74
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:50,839
He's in a position, if I could call it, of desperation because of this physical ailment

75
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,399
that he's dealing with.

76
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,440
And we find that it leads him to seek the man of God.

77
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,600
It's interesting as we would consider verse number 8, it says this, remember, he has just

78
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,160
been informed that the man of God has come hither.

79
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,160
In verse number 8, notice what the king says to his general, if you will, Haziel.

80
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:16,679
It says, and the king said unto Haziel, take a present in thine hand and go, meet the man

81
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:26,559
of God, and inquire of the Lord by him, saying, shall I recover of this disease?

82
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:33,279
We find that the condition of Ben-Hadad physically leads him to a place of seeking.

83
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,799
We find that he's made aware of the fact that the man of God has come, and so he calls immediately

84
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:39,040
for his general.

85
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,480
He calls for Haziel to come, and he says to take a present and to go and meet the man

86
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
of God.

87
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:51,519
It's interesting to me to really note the change in Ben-Hadad in this particular passage

88
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:57,200
of Scripture from when we last saw his interaction with Elisha.

89
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,359
You remember back in chapter number 6, I referred to it a moment ago, but in chapter number

90
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:10,679
6, in verses 8 down really through verse number 23, 24, you begin to see some things that

91
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:16,119
are happening here with the way in which the Syrians warred against the children of

92
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:17,359
Israel.

93
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:23,720
And the Bible tells us that as Ben-Hadad was making the plans, and he was setting up his

94
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:30,920
strategic moves for battle against the children of Israel, that it was Elisha that was informing

95
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,959
the king of Israel as to what the next move was, where they were going to be located,

96
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:41,040
and this thing caused much distress in the heart and soul of Ben-Hadad.

97
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,480
He was absolutely sure that there was a traitor in their midst.

98
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:52,440
Somebody was taking and revealing his military strategy to the king of Israel, to his enemy.

99
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,200
And in fact, Ben-Hadad says this at the end of verse number 11, "'Will you not show me

100
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,239
which of us is for the king of Israel?'

101
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,440
Of course, one of his servants comes and says, actually, none of us are for the king of Israel,

102
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,359
but here's what's happening, "'Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king

103
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:19,040
of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.'"

104
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:24,279
We studied this several weeks ago, and you'll remember that Ben-Hadad was not very pleased

105
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:27,200
with this development, and so what does he do?

106
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:33,040
He sends a great host of people to find out where Elisha is as he knew the location.

107
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,440
He sends them.

108
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,279
The Bible tells us that they go to Dothan.

109
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,720
Remember it was the servant of Elisha that went out early in the morning and saw the

110
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,079
great host of people, and Elisha said, don't worry, there's more for us than there are

111
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,380
for them.

112
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:52,040
And it was then that Elisha prayed that God would open the eyes of his servant and give

113
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:59,799
him that vision, and we find that Ben-Hadad, at that point, he did not have good feelings

114
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:01,119
toward Elisha.

115
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:08,200
He wanted to have Elisha captured from Dothan and brought back to him to be able to have

116
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,640
some interaction with him.

117
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,160
I'm sure it would not have been awfully polite and convenient.

118
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:21,399
But we find that now, at this particular stage, when this one Ben-Hadad is sick and nigh unto

119
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,000
death, he begins to have a change.

120
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,640
He's seeking.

121
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,399
And we notice the way in which he refers to Elisha.

122
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:35,119
In verse number 8 of our text of Scripture in 2 Kings 8, the Bible says that he says

123
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:44,080
to Haziel, take a present in thine hand and go, meet the man of God.

124
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:55,479
He then says this, inquire of the Lord by him, saying, shall I recover of this disease?

125
00:08:55,479 --> 00:09:01,119
As we look at the way in which Ben-Hadad would refer to Elisha and the inquiries that would

126
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:08,159
be made of him, we understand, at least at some level, the impact that Elisha had made

127
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,280
in the life of this individual.

128
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:15,039
See, Ben-Hadad understood that Elisha was a man of God.

129
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:21,479
Ben-Hadad understood that Elisha served the Lord God of the universe.

130
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:26,440
You'll remember that during the life and ministry of Elisha, there were other interactions that

131
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:34,000
had taken place, and of course, there was Naaman that had gone, and that whole situation

132
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,200
with being a leper and all of the remarkable events that took place in 2 Kings 5.

133
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,719
There's no doubt Ben-Hadad, as he was the one that wrote the letter to the king of Israel

134
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:49,080
with regard to those things, and so now, at the end of his life, when he's dealing with

135
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,599
this sickness and we consider the condition of this one Ben-Hadad, I not only see him

136
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:58,200
as being sick, but I see him as seeking.

137
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,599
It's interesting to me.

138
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,099
look at this passage of Scripture,

139
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:03,639
I begin to consider the way in which people

140
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,359
seek even still today.

141
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:09,479
There are times that events come into the lives of individuals

142
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:13,159
that cause them to seek the Lord, that

143
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:16,279
cause them to look for some type of an answer.

144
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:19,079
The reality is that we have, I have

145
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:20,959
had the experience in my life, and I'm

146
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,239
sure that you've had the experiences in your life

147
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:25,559
where you've had opportunities to speak to people,

148
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:28,979
whether it's a co-worker, a family member, a neighbor,

149
00:10:28,979 --> 00:10:31,659
whomever it may be, and you have opportunities

150
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:34,579
and you think it's not working, it's not effective,

151
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:36,179
they're not listening.

152
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:39,419
But it may just be that God might allow something

153
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:41,739
in the life of that individual that

154
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:46,179
will cause them to recognize that you're a child of God

155
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:50,179
and that they can seek some direction and counsel from you.

156
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:53,019
There are people that, when I worked in the corporate world,

157
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,399
there were people that would come

158
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,779
and they would have difficulties,

159
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:57,439
and they'd show up at my desk, people

160
00:10:57,439 --> 00:11:01,239
that otherwise I'd never really had much interaction with,

161
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:03,959
and they'd come and they'd say, would you pray for me?

162
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,719
There's a situation they're dealing with.

163
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:07,239
There's something that's going on.

164
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:10,959
And they knew that this person was a Christian,

165
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,359
that they believed in the power of God,

166
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:15,399
that they believe that God answers prayer.

167
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:18,759
And the reality is that we find in Ben-Hadad

168
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:22,359
here in this passage of Scripture, yes, he's sick,

169
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:24,559
but it's led to seeking.

170
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:28,359
He finds out that, hey, Elisha's in Damascus.

171
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:31,559
And immediately, he says, Haziel, get a gift,

172
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:36,439
go meet the man of God, and inquire of him.

173
00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:41,199
Find out, am I going to recover of this disease?

174
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:45,919
We not only notice the condition of Ben-Hadad,

175
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,239
but we notice the conversation with Haziel.

176
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:52,459
Haziel obeys the direction of King Ben-Hadad.

177
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:56,179
It says in verse 9, so Haziel went to meet him.

178
00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:58,259
And so we find that he immediately

179
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,499
responds to the direction given to him

180
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:03,659
from his superior, from the king.

181
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:05,699
And it says that he took a present with him,

182
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:08,139
even of every good thing of Damascus.

183
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:12,579
Notice this, 40 camels' burden.

184
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:15,779
That's a large present.

185
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,139
I mean, that's significant.

186
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:21,179
And sometimes we can just kind of breeze over

187
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:22,779
some things in Scripture, you know,

188
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:25,219
you never really stop and consider.

189
00:12:25,219 --> 00:12:28,299
But this is a serious present

190
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:30,419
that is being brought to Elisha.

191
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:32,899
Remember, the king said,

192
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:35,099
take a present in thine hand.

193
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:36,819
Well, he didn't take it in his hand.

194
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:39,219
He put it on 40 camels.

195
00:12:39,219 --> 00:12:41,379
That's pretty significant.

196
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:43,379
And we find that the Bible says

197
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:45,739
that it was 40 camels' burden,

198
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:49,379
and came and stood before him and said,

199
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:50,939
notice what he says,

200
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:54,179
thy son, Ben-Hadad.

201
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:55,859
Isn't that interesting?

202
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,819
The way in which he refers to Ben-Hadad.

203
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:03,339
He doesn't say, the royal king of Syria, Ben-Hadad.

204
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:07,179
No, thy son, Ben-Hadad.

205
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:10,899
It says here, yes, that he is king of Syria.

206
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:14,739
But he notes first, thy son, Ben-Hadad, king of Syria,

207
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:17,059
hath sent me to thee saying,

208
00:13:17,099 --> 00:13:22,339
shall I recover of this disease?

209
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:24,579
It was a simple request.

210
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:26,539
There's a conversation that takes place.

211
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,819
We find here in v. 10 specifically

212
00:13:29,819 --> 00:13:32,099
the conversation at this point

213
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:34,259
between Elisha and Haziel

214
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:38,099
is a conversation regarding Ben-Hadad specifically.

215
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:40,219
And we find that in v. 9 and 10

216
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,659
that this conversation is in regard

217
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:44,259
to the king of Syria.

218
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:46,419
And it's a simple question.

219
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:48,859
Shall I recover of this disease?

220
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:52,219
Notice what it is that Elisha says in v. 10.

221
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:55,139
Elisha said unto him, go.

222
00:13:55,139 --> 00:14:01,539
Say unto him, thou mayest certainly recover.

223
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:05,179
Howbeit, the Lord hath showed me

224
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,579
that he shall surely die.

225
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:08,979
And you might scratch your head and say,

226
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:10,779
what in the world?

227
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:12,939
What is going on?

228
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,499
Elisha says, thou mayest certainly recover.

229
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:19,019
Howbeit, the Lord hath showed me

230
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:21,259
that he shall surely die.

231
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:24,219
The reality is what Elisha is saying here

232
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:26,539
in this response to Haziel

233
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:29,459
is that it would not be the disease

234
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:32,299
that would kill the king.

235
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:35,019
See, we find as we go through the text of Scripture

236
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:38,459
that it would be Haziel that would kill Ben-Hadad.

237
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:40,899
It would not be the disease.

238
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:44,219
In fact, Ben-Hadad could have recovered

239
00:14:44,219 --> 00:14:45,939
from this disease,

240
00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:48,379
but Haziel would not permit it to be so

241
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:51,419
because he would take matters into his own hands

242
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:52,859
and he would kill Ben-Hadad.

243
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:55,539
We'll read of it in just a few verses.

244
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:57,619
And so we find that Elisha says to him

245
00:14:57,619 --> 00:15:01,819
with regard to the conversation with Ben-Hadad,

246
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:05,779
he says, thou mayest certainly recover.

247
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,339
Howbeit, the Lord hath showed me

248
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,459
that he shall surely die.

249
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:12,179
Notice what Elisha does in v. 11.

250
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:16,539
It's interesting to read the verse of Scripture

251
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:18,899
and consider if you could put yourself

252
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,979
in the presence of these individuals

253
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:23,299
as they're having this conversation.

254
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:26,299
It says that he settled his countenance

255
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:30,659
steadfastly until he was ashamed.

256
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:33,459
The man of God wept.

257
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:36,579
It would appear as we look at v. 11

258
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:41,499
that Elisha stared at Haziel

259
00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:43,619
until he was ashamed.

260
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:46,099
Just a period of silence.

261
00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:48,139
We don't know how long.

262
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:51,659
But he just stared at Haziel.

263
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:55,379
He settled his countenance steadfastly

264
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:59,819
upon him until he was ashamed.

265
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:03,619
We find that the man of God, Elisha,

266
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:05,459
he begins to weep.

267
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,259
We begin to study through the passage

268
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:09,419
and we'll understand the cause

269
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:11,219
for which Elisha would weep

270
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:13,139
as it's revealed to us in v. 12.

271
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,859
Because it's here in v. 12

272
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:17,219
that Haziel says to Elisha,

273
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:20,979
why weepeth my Lord?

274
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:23,459
Some would think as you're reading through this

275
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,379
as you would consider the interaction,

276
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:28,059
as you consider the conversation

277
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:29,859
up to this particular point,

278
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:31,899
some may believe or think,

279
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:33,699
obviously as you read the whole text,

280
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:35,139
you wouldn't understand this,

281
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:36,419
but if you stopped here,

282
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:38,379
you might think that Elisha was weeping

283
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:41,699
because of the death of Ben-Hadad.

284
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,179
Or the knowledge of the fact

285
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:46,099
that Ben-Hadad would surely die.

286
00:16:46,099 --> 00:16:48,299
But the reality is that the conversation

287
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,939
that he has with Haziel

288
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:54,099
that was dealing with specifically Ben-Hadad

289
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:56,019
now changes direction

290
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:59,219
and he begins to speak about Israel as a nation.

291
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,899
We find that in v. 12,

292
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:04,499
Elisha answers him and he answered.

293
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:05,939
Notice what he says,

294
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:10,139
because I know the evil that thou wilt do

295
00:17:10,139 --> 00:17:13,459
unto the children of Israel.

296
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:16,099
We find that Elisha now turns

297
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:19,419
the direction of the conversation.

298
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:21,219
As he's speaking to Haziel,

299
00:17:21,219 --> 00:17:23,139
he begins to share with him

300
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:25,219
the reason for which he's weeping.

301
00:17:25,219 --> 00:17:28,539
He says it's because of the knowledge that I have.

302
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:29,979
And the knowledge that I have

303
00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:32,299
is the evil that you, Haziel,

304
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:34,899
are going to do unto the children of Israel.

305
00:17:34,899 --> 00:17:36,419
He describes it, he says,

306
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:41,979
their strongholds wilt thou set on fire.

307
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:45,659
And their young men wilt thou slay with the sword.

308
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:48,339
And wilt dash their children

309
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:53,059
and rip up their women with child.

310
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:57,979
Elisha had been given this knowledge from the Lord.

311
00:17:57,979 --> 00:18:02,019
And Elisha knew the wickedness that Haziel would do

312
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:06,259
and for that reason, Elisha's weeping.

313
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:09,499
He had shared the information about Ben-Hadad.

314
00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:13,779
The reason initially for the interaction

315
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:15,939
between Elisha and Haziel

316
00:18:15,939 --> 00:18:18,779
was the condition of Ben-Hadad.

317
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:21,539
It was the whole reason that they're even meeting together.

318
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:24,619
We find that the conversation quickly changes

319
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:29,539
from Ben-Hadad to Haziel and the nation of Israel

320
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:33,500
in future events that would come to pass.

321
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,500
Haziel immediately responds to Elisha in v. 13.

322
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,739
He says, but what is thy servant? A dog?

323
00:18:41,739 --> 00:18:44,219
That he should do this great thing?

324
00:18:44,219 --> 00:18:46,500
And notice what Elisha answered.

325
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,779
The Lord hath showed me

326
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:54,219
that thou shalt be king over Syria.

327
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:58,059
So we find that here in v. 13,

328
00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:03,299
the conversation that first began with Ben-Hadad specifically

329
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,979
and his condition turns to Israel as a whole

330
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,500
and the events that would happen in the near future.

331
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,940
And then we find it begins to deal specifically with Haziel

332
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,940
and his place of leadership there as being king of Syria.

333
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,380
You'll remember back in 1 Kings 19,

334
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,819
if you hold your place here in 2 Kings 8

335
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:25,619
and just quickly go back to 1 Kings 19,

336
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:29,500
and you'll remember that it was in this passage of scripture

337
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,739
that Elijah, excuse me,

338
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,899
had experienced in chapter number 18,

339
00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:38,579
great victory over the worshipers of Baal

340
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:42,579
and all that had transpired in the fire that came from heaven.

341
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:44,139
But it was in chapter number 19

342
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:47,779
that he heard about the threat of Jezebel.

343
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:51,179
And he, of course, was overwhelmed.

344
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:54,179
And we find that God comes to Elijah

345
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,380
and He tells him that He has work for him to do.

346
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,619
In other words, God says to Elijah,

347
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:02,779
Elijah, I'm not done with you yet, Elijah.

348
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:07,859
And some of that which is said to him in verse number 15 of 1 Kings 19, the Lord said unto

349
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:11,379
him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus.

350
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:16,179
And when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria.

351
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:21,579
And Jehu, the son of Nimshi, shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel.

352
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:29,299
And Elisha, the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah, shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.

353
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:33,699
Just in the next few verses, you begin to see the appointment of Elisha and of course

354
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,379
the calling and all that took place.

355
00:20:35,379 --> 00:20:37,179
We studied that many months ago.

356
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:44,259
But you'll see here that Hazael, Elijah had been given that prophecy back in 1 Kings 19.

357
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:51,019
And now it's time for this one, Hazael, he's now going to be the king of Syria.

358
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:56,619
And God says through the prophet Elisha, he says, the Lord hath showed me that thou shalt

359
00:20:56,619 --> 00:20:58,619
be king over Syria.

360
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:05,259
So he, Hazael, back in 2 Kings 8, look at verse number 14, the Bible says that he departed

361
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:07,619
from Elisha.

362
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:14,499
Notice he came to his master who said to him, what said Elisha to thee?

363
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:22,719
Can you, in your mind's eye, can you see the spirit, if you will, of Ben-Hadad awaiting

364
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:24,219
an answer?

365
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:28,659
I mean, you consider, as we mentioned at the beginning of our message this evening, the

366
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:32,779
condition of this man, and you consider what he was dealing with in this disease, and he

367
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:37,619
sent Hazael, he knew that Elisha was there, he had been informed that the man of God had

368
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:43,459
come hither, and we find that there was some level of anxiety, if you will, anxiousness

369
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:48,779
on waiting the return of Hazael, what's the answer that I'm going to receive?

370
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:54,419
And we find that immediately in verse number 14, upon Hazael returning from his conversation

371
00:21:54,419 --> 00:22:01,699
with Elisha, the man of God, the servant of the Lord, that Ben-Hadad immediately, what

372
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:03,719
said Elisha to thee?

373
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:08,259
He wants to know, what is the word from the man of God?

374
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:12,819
He answered, he told me that thou shouldest surely recover.

375
00:22:12,819 --> 00:22:15,379
Now, is that the whole message?

376
00:22:15,379 --> 00:22:16,379
No.

377
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:20,739
It's not the whole message.

378
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:26,860
In fact, Elisha said, thou mayest certainly recover, how be it the Lord hath showed me

379
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,819
that he shall surely die.

380
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:34,339
It would not be the disease, however, that would take the life of Ben-Hadad, it would

381
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:40,819
be Hazael, the thought of becoming the king of Syria and all that would go along with

382
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:41,819
that.

383
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:46,179
And we find that here, after he gives them this false report in verse number 15, it says

384
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:50,139
it came to pass, notice these words, on the morrow.

385
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:54,339
I mean, Hazael didn't waste any time.

386
00:22:54,339 --> 00:23:01,059
The Bible says that he took a thick cloth and dipped it in water and spread it on his

387
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:08,179
face so that he died, and Hazael reigned in his stead.

388
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:13,580
It's interesting as we look at the passage of Scripture and we see the condition of Ben-Hadad

389
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:18,580
and we obviously have made point already this evening, not only of his sickness, but of

390
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:25,819
his seeking, it reminds me tonight of how important it is to be that faithful witness,

391
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:33,139
to be the faithful, the salt and the light that the Lord's called us to be.

392
00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:37,779
Because we just never know when something's going to take place in somebody's life that's

393
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:41,339
going to cause them to seek for some amount of truth.

394
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:50,899
See, we can interact with people in such a way that we can be assured that when they

395
00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:56,019
have a time of trouble in their lives, we will not be the person they call.

396
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,220
What do I mean by that?

397
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:02,179
We can be ugly and nasty and we can be rude and forward and unkind and we can have the

398
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:08,539
wrong disposition and we can tell people some things that we probably shouldn't tell

399
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:15,779
them that will turn them off and they will probably never contact us.

400
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:22,739
But if we have a proper spirit, if we try to show them the love of Christ, there are

401
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:26,299
times in which I've said to people when we've gone out door knocking, we've not been able

402
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:31,739
to do it in a while because of all that's going on, how I long to be able to interact

403
00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:36,739
with people and not have to be so concerned about if I'm sharing some kind of germ with

404
00:24:36,739 --> 00:24:39,799
them or them with me and all of that sort of thing.

405
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:42,739
But the reality is that we're in that position now.

406
00:24:42,739 --> 00:24:47,380
But I've often said that we've had people that have rejected us, I've had more people

407
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,959
to reject than have received.

408
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:56,139
But here's my goal in every situation is to leave an open door of opportunity.

409
00:24:56,139 --> 00:25:02,139
My prayer is that we can leave a gospel tract on somebody's door, in somebody's hand, we

410
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:07,299
can leave a word of witness and when they deal with that time of heartache, when they

411
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:11,899
deal with that disappointment and that discouragement, when they deal with the death of a loved one,

412
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:20,699
whatever the tragedy might be, that they would recall there was somebody that showed me kindness

413
00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:23,820
and love and genuine concern.

414
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:30,699
How many times have we said to people, listen, the reality is that I'm not trying to gain

415
00:25:30,699 --> 00:25:33,220
anything by sharing the gospel.

416
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,220
I'm trying to obey the Lord first and foremost and number two, I'm trying to keep you from

417
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,899
going to the lake of fire.

418
00:25:39,899 --> 00:25:41,500
Amen.

419
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:48,540
And the reality is that we seek to be able to have another opportunity.

420
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:53,619
Not only may we personally have another opportunity, but what about the Christian that comes behind

421
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:54,619
us?

422
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:59,220
Listen, I've been in situations and scenarios where the Christian that went in front of

423
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:05,059
me did a poor job and caused me great grief on trying to reach somebody with the gospel

424
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:06,660
of Jesus Christ.

425
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,699
Why?

426
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:11,019
Because the person that had interaction with them before that was a Christian left a bad

427
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:13,619
taste in their mouth.

428
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:17,739
The way that they treated them, the words that they said, so on and so forth.

429
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:25,339
I'm thankful that though Elisha at just a few chapters before, several years perhaps

430
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:31,019
earlier could be viewed by Ben-Hadad as Elisha's the enemy.

431
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:32,260
He's telling the secrets.

432
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,940
He's given the intel to the king of Israel.

433
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,940
Go get him.

434
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:42,339
And they send this great host to Dothan to take Elisha and to bring him back.

435
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:50,179
But at the time of his dark hour, he hears that Elisha has come hither, and what does

436
00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:51,579
he say?

437
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:53,779
Go to the man of God.

438
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,320
Inquire of him.

439
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:02,579
Take a gift with you, but inquire of the Lord by him saying, shall I recover of this disease?

440
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:08,739
I hope that we would understand that great truth from verses 7 and 8 and really the approach

441
00:27:08,739 --> 00:27:09,739
of Elisha.

442
00:27:09,739 --> 00:27:14,260
Then as we consider the latter part of the text of Scripture and we think about this

443
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:20,619
situation which caused the man of God, Elisha, to weep, I want you to understand that this

444
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:26,419
prophecy that is given that these things will come to pass just as the man of God said.

445
00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:31,100
He mentioned in verse number 12, because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children

446
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:35,760
of Israel, their strongholds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay

447
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:42,199
with the sword, and wilt dash their children and rip up their women with child.

448
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:45,600
It caused the man of God to weep.

449
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,559
Turn over, if you will, to chapter number 10.

450
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,559
Look at what the Bible tells us.

451
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,600
Remember, at the end of our passage of Scripture there in verse number 15, Hazael began to

452
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
reign.

453
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,119
It says that he reigned in his stead.

454
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:04,600
In chapter 10 of 2 Kings in verse number 32, the Bible says, in those days the Lord began

455
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:11,399
to cut Israel short, and Hazael smote them in all the coast of Israel, from Jordan eastward,

456
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:17,639
all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, the Reubenites, the Manassites, from Aror, which is by the

457
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:20,600
river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.

458
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:25,559
If you're studying with us the book of Joshua and you're on track with the lessons that

459
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:32,599
we're doing, you'll see that this is the inheritance for the two and a half tribes on the east

460
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:38,640
side of Jordan, the tribe of Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh.

461
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,880
And that's what's being referenced here specifically as to how Hazael smote them in the coast of

462
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
Israel.

463
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,559
Turn again over to chapter number 13, if you will.

464
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:56,279
A little lengthier portion of Scripture to understand exactly all that was taking place.

465
00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:00,479
Notice in verse number 1 of chapter 13, in the three and twentieth year of Joash the

466
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:08,159
son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in

467
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,380
Samaria and reign 17 years.

468
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,839
He did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord and followed the sins of Jeroboam

469
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:20,159
the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin, he departed not therefrom.

470
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,760
The anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and he delivered them into the hand

471
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:30,400
of Hazael king of Syria, and in the hand of Ben-Hadad the son of Hazael all their days.

472
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,359
And Jehoahaz besought the Lord and the Lord hearkened unto him, for he saw the oppression

473
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:41,359
of Israel, notice, because the king of Syria oppressed them, that's Hazael.

474
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:44,760
It says in verse number 5, and the Lord gave Israel a savior so that they went out from

475
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:49,440
under the hand of the Syrians and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents as before time.

476
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,559
Nevertheless, they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam who made Israel sin

477
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:58,640
but walked therein and there remained the grove also in Samaria, that's the parenthetical

478
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,919
there in verses 5 and 6.

479
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,199
Notice in v. 7,

480
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,319
"...neither did he leave of the people

481
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:14,079
to Jehoahaz, but fifty horsemen,

482
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:17,259
and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen,

483
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:20,459
for the king of Syria had destroyed them

484
00:30:20,459 --> 00:30:25,339
and had made them like the dust by threshing."

485
00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:26,459
Look at v. 22,

486
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:29,639
"...Yet Haziel, king of Syria, oppressed Israel

487
00:30:29,639 --> 00:30:34,699
all the days of Jehoahaz."

488
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,719
Yes, indeed, it was the wickedness

489
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:38,879
of the children of Israel,

490
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,719
the sin of the children of Israel

491
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:42,679
that would bring these things to pass,

492
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:46,239
but we find that Elisha, the man of God,

493
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:47,439
he knew.

494
00:30:47,439 --> 00:30:49,099
He had been given the information

495
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:52,719
from the Lord God of the universe.

496
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:54,319
We find that the Bible tells us

497
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,879
that the man of God wept.

498
00:30:56,879 --> 00:30:59,239
What caused him to weep?

499
00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:02,839
That which he knew was going to happen.

500
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:05,339
Now, we understand that these things

501
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:07,959
would transpire in just a short period of time

502
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:09,279
in the history of Israel.

503
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,099
We can read them now on this side of the history

504
00:31:12,099 --> 00:31:13,639
to see how they came to pass.

505
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:16,479
To see how Haziel, as the king of Syria,

506
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:18,899
brought these things upon the children of Israel

507
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:22,339
and the destruction in which he wrought.

508
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,519
Can I tell you that today,

509
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,719
if we could make application for us

510
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,359
with regard to these things,

511
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:30,059
and we understand that this is

512
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,219
the historical context in which

513
00:31:32,219 --> 00:31:33,439
it's being dealt with,

514
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:35,599
but can I tell you that there are some future events

515
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:38,919
that you and I know about?

516
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:42,539
God's given us His Word with regard to eschatology.

517
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:43,579
Amen?

518
00:31:43,579 --> 00:31:44,619
What's eschatology?

519
00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:47,279
The study of future things.

520
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,639
We know that as we read the New Testament,

521
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:51,679
in fact, reading the Old Testament,

522
00:31:51,699 --> 00:31:56,259
some of the prophecies that are contained therein

523
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:58,919
with regard to the prophetic events

524
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:00,259
and the prophetic calendar,

525
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:02,419
and you read those coupled with the New Testament,

526
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:03,739
you read the book of Revelation,

527
00:32:03,739 --> 00:32:07,259
listen, we know some things that are going to happen.

528
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,419
You've read about the tribulation, haven't you?

529
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:11,619
We know what's going to happen.

530
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:13,559
We know the destruction.

531
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,939
The devastation.

532
00:32:15,939 --> 00:32:17,459
I'm thankful as a child of God

533
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:20,439
that I won't be here to experience it.

534
00:32:20,459 --> 00:32:22,139
Amen?

535
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:23,419
But there are some people that you know

536
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:25,899
and there are some people that I know

537
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:27,099
that are not saved.

538
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:27,939
They're not part of the church.

539
00:32:27,939 --> 00:32:31,099
They're not going to be raptured out of here.

540
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:33,099
Worse than that, however,

541
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:34,859
is what we read in the book of Revelation

542
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:36,699
in the 20th chapter

543
00:32:36,699 --> 00:32:40,579
with regard to the great white throne judgment.

544
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:43,099
You say, pastor, why are we making this application?

545
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:45,419
Because the man of God wept

546
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:47,139
because he knew of some physical things

547
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:47,979
that were going to happen,

548
00:32:47,979 --> 00:32:50,179
some destruction that was going to come

549
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:52,679
in the hand of Haziel.

550
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,399
Can I tell you that when you read

551
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,679
Revelation 20,

552
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:00,519
it ought to cause you as a child of God to weep.

553
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:02,519
To understand that the Bible tells us

554
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:03,879
that the dead, small and great,

555
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:05,639
they stand before God.

556
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:07,919
The books are opened.

557
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,279
They're judged out of what book?

558
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,079
The book of life.

559
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:11,519
And whosoever is not found written therein

560
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,799
was cast in the lake of fire.

561
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:17,319
This is the second death.

562
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:21,579
If you read Revelation 20, verses 11-15,

563
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:23,739
it will break your heart.

564
00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:26,059
It ought to cause us to weep.

565
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:27,459
Because every single person

566
00:33:27,459 --> 00:33:29,379
that does not trust the Lord Jesus Christ

567
00:33:29,379 --> 00:33:30,739
as their personal Savior

568
00:33:30,739 --> 00:33:34,579
will stand at that great white throne judgment.

569
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,939
And based upon the authority of the Word of God,

570
00:33:36,939 --> 00:33:40,739
they will be cast in the lake of fire.

571
00:33:40,739 --> 00:33:42,859
Just as these events that are recorded here

572
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:45,339
would cause the man of God to weep.

573
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,919
I wonder tonight,

574
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,279
what would it be that would cause us to weep?

575
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,919
What would it be to cause us to

576
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,519
understand the reality

577
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,999
of what God has revealed to us

578
00:33:58,999 --> 00:34:02,719
is going to come to pass?

579
00:34:02,719 --> 00:34:05,239
It's not a possibility.

580
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:07,919
It's a certainty.

581
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:08,919
We understand that.

582
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:11,439
We believe that.

583
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:14,919
These things that had been revealed to Elisha,

584
00:34:14,939 --> 00:34:17,299
they were not but a possibility.

585
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:18,579
He knew that it was certain

586
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:20,939
because God had revealed it to him.

587
00:34:20,939 --> 00:34:22,739
And it caused him to weep.

588
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:25,299
And I just wonder this evening,

589
00:34:25,299 --> 00:34:27,219
when we look at the big picture of things

590
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:29,139
and we begin to understand

591
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:32,419
all of what God has given us,

592
00:34:32,419 --> 00:34:35,739
and the knowledge that He has given us,

593
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,179
what He's revealed to us

594
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:39,779
with regard to not only the end times,

595
00:34:39,779 --> 00:34:43,659
but the great white throne judgment,

596
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:45,319
I wonder how does it impact me?

597
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:47,439
I wonder how does it impact

598
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:49,959
each one of God's people?

599
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:54,879
Does it cause us to have

600
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,479
a broken heart?

601
00:34:56,479 --> 00:34:59,079
Does it cause us to weep?

602
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:00,639
To think about people that we know,

603
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:02,479
that we interact with.

604
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:05,759
I understand that we can't make everybody trust Christ.

605
00:35:05,759 --> 00:35:07,679
And I wish sometimes we could.

606
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:08,839
Don't you?

607
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:11,119
We can't. It's not possible.

608
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:16,379
It's a decision they have to make.

609
00:35:16,379 --> 00:35:19,739
But I can be a faithful witness.

610
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:21,699
I can have a broken heart.

611
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:24,459
I can go forth bearing precious seed

612
00:35:24,459 --> 00:35:27,419
with tears, right?

613
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:30,539
And I see the man of God, Elisha,

614
00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:31,859
in this passage of Scripture,

615
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:34,059
weeping over some events

616
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:37,859
that are going to take place.

617
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:43,479
His second death, by the way,

618
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:46,479
is of serious nature.

619
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:49,319
This evening, the man of God wept.

620
00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:51,279
Father, we love You.

621
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:54,359
We thank You for loving us.

622
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:57,099
We thank You for the testimony of Elisha

623
00:35:57,099 --> 00:35:59,059
and the way in which he was able to have interaction

624
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:00,939
with Ben-Hadad.

625
00:36:00,939 --> 00:36:02,859
And though at times, no doubt,

626
00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:04,559
Ben-Hadad probably would have liked

627
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:09,419
to have seen Elisha dead,

628
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:15,479
we find that in his last moments,

629
00:36:15,479 --> 00:36:18,919
Ben-Hadad sent to inquire

630
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:20,739
the man of God.

631
00:36:20,739 --> 00:36:24,019
We thank You for the testimony, influence, and impact

632
00:36:24,019 --> 00:36:26,559
that Elisha had.

633
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,759
And Lord, as we think about this conversation

634
00:36:28,759 --> 00:36:29,839
that took place

635
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,799
and the specifics of the conversation,

636
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:38,399
and we think about the man of God, Elisha, weeping,

637
00:36:38,399 --> 00:36:41,859
we understand what caused him to weep.

638
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:44,799
We see as recorded history

639
00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:49,979
how those events in fact did come to pass.

640
00:36:49,979 --> 00:36:53,579
God, I wonder tonight

641
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:57,899
when the last time is that we have wept

642
00:36:57,899 --> 00:37:00,599
because of those things which You've given us,

643
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:03,479
the knowledge that we have.

644
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:06,039
When Elisha was asked by Haziel,

645
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:08,439
why are you weeping?

646
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:10,859
He said, because I know.

647
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:13,159
There's some things that we know

648
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:14,739
as Your people

649
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:17,979
that cause us to rejoice greatly.

650
00:37:17,979 --> 00:37:19,679
There's some things that we know as Your people

651
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:22,279
that should cause us to weep.

652
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:23,759
God, I pray that You'd help us

653
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:27,699
with a heart of compassion

654
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:31,219
to obey Your commandment

655
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:35,099
to preach the gospel to every creature.

656
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:36,699
Help us, Lord.

657
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:37,699
We'll thank You for it.

658
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:39,299
In Christ's name we pray,

659
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:40,299
Amen.
