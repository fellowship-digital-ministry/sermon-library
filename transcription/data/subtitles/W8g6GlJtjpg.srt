1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
and our series here on Wednesday nights

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,760
for a number of weeks now has been this thought,

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,320
doing what we ought to do.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,239
And I know that I've said it often,

5
00:00:09,239 --> 00:00:10,560
but it's worth repeating

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,560
at the beginning of each of our lessons,

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,920
just because we know what we ought to do

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,879
doesn't mean we do what we ought to do.

9
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:20,719
And have you ever had your child

10
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:22,799
or maybe a young person that you were watching

11
00:00:22,799 --> 00:00:24,959
and you were in charge of,

12
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,040
and you said, why did you do,

13
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,399
didn't you know that you're not supposed to do that?

14
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:29,559
Well, yeah, I knew I wasn't supposed to do it,

15
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:30,680
so why'd you do it?

16
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,279
Well, because I wanted to.

17
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,720
And how many of you were in school when you were kids,

18
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,560
you weren't allowed to chew gum in class?

19
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,400
Anyone have that rule?

20
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,040
Not allowed to chew gum in class, all right.

21
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,720
How many of you chewed gum in class anyway?

22
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,639
Some of you better raise your hand, amen,

23
00:00:44,639 --> 00:00:46,119
because I know you chewed gum in class

24
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,520
even though you weren't supposed to,

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,439
and you swallowed it even though your mom said

26
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:51,599
that it was gonna take you seven years to digest it

27
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:53,319
and all that nonsense, right?

28
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,959
And the reality is that just because you knew

29
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:59,240
you weren't supposed to doing what we ought to do,

30
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:01,759
we don't always do it just because we know it,

31
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,199
and we think about that with life in general.

32
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,160
But then when we come to the truth of God's word,

33
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,800
I'm so thankful that God in his omniscience

34
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,760
and his grace, his mercy, he gave us his word

35
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,800
and he told us, here's how you can be saved,

36
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,319
here's how you can know me,

37
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:21,720
here's how you can live to please me.

38
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,319
Isn't that awesome that God would let us know that?

39
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,760
I was thinking about this today

40
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,000
and thinking about the truth of prayer

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,839
and what a privileged prayer is

42
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,360
and how God hears us when we pray

43
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,800
and he answers us and it's such a blessing.

44
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,199
I begin to think about this as I was thinking

45
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:40,160
about the book of Acts this morning

46
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,239
and reading through several chapters there

47
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,639
and just thinking about how the prayers of God's people

48
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:50,120
revealed what they knew to be true about God.

49
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,080
And I begin to think about this when we pray,

50
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,260
God, would you be gracious to this person?

51
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,839
Why is it that we pray that way?

52
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:57,519
Well, because we know that God's given us his word

53
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,559
and he's revealed to us that he's a gracious God.

54
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:01,760
Does that make sense?

55
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,680
And we begin to think about how we pray

56
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,400
and we pray according to his will,

57
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,119
according to what the scriptures teach us

58
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,759
and how we're to pray and when we pray according to his will

59
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,240
we know that he hears us and he's going to answer

60
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,119
and we can rejoice in that but we find that God

61
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:20,520
has not just given us his word so that we could know him,

62
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,080
although that's wonderful.

63
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,580
He did not just give us his word

64
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,039
so that we could know the way of salvation,

65
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,639
although that's wonderful,

66
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,899
but he also gave us his word

67
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:30,740
so that we would know how to please him,

68
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,639
that we could live in such a way

69
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,839
that our lives would be pleasing in his sight.

70
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:38,679
We've looked at a number of these ought to statements

71
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:40,960
throughout the New Testament and last week

72
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,800
we started a kind of a mini series within the series

73
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,639
from 1 John chapter two.

74
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,479
I read several verses last week

75
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,600
but let me just jump right into verse number six,

76
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,979
the key verse, if you will, for this thought here

77
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:57,639
that is just going to kind of control our study here

78
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,940
for the next couple of weeks.

79
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,979
In verse number six, the Bible says he that saith

80
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:05,979
he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk

81
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,179
even as he walked.

82
00:03:09,179 --> 00:03:11,460
Now I mentioned last week that we ought to walk

83
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,960
as Christ walked, that's the title of the lesson,

84
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,179
last week part one, this week part two

85
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:18,419
and I said this, that when we come to this verse

86
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:21,940
of scripture, it really requires the Bible student

87
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,779
to then do some research, to do some study

88
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:27,820
because if the truth is that we ought to walk

89
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,740
as he walked, then I need to study the scriptures

90
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,580
to find out, well, how did Christ walk?

91
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,539
How did he live his life?

92
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:38,619
We mentioned this, that oftentimes in the Bible

93
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:42,020
we see that phrase of our walk,

94
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,179
it's referring to how we live our lives,

95
00:03:44,179 --> 00:03:47,139
it's not the actual gait of our step

96
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:51,820
and the posture of our walk, it's how we live our lives,

97
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,860
it's our behavior and so we find that here this evening,

98
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,619
we're gonna look at a couple of more things,

99
00:03:57,619 --> 00:04:01,339
last week we talked about the fact that Jesus walked wisely

100
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:04,179
and how we need wisdom, we need God's wisdom

101
00:04:04,179 --> 00:04:07,580
as we live and walk in this world

102
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,880
and then we said that he walked humbly

103
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,419
and what great truth with regard to the humility

104
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:17,059
of the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

105
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:20,820
that he humbled himself and so often,

106
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,859
we are reminded of the importance for us

107
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:27,420
as the people of God to also walk humbly,

108
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,660
to be clothed as Peter said in humility.

109
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,940
This evening, again, part number two,

110
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,480
so really number three within the miniseries,

111
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,100
number one this evening, Jesus walked purposefully,

112
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,339
he walked purposefully and let me consider this this evening

113
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:44,859
as we look back at the scriptures,

114
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:46,899
turn back if you will to Matthew chapter four

115
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:48,579
and I want you to look at a number of things,

116
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,100
just as we did last week, I'm gonna make a statement

117
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,380
with regard to how Jesus walked

118
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,179
and then go to the scriptures and seek to illustrate,

119
00:04:57,179 --> 00:04:59,179
to show you why is it that we're saying

120
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:00,500
that he walked wisely,

121
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
why is it that we're saying that he walked humbly?

122
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,100
Tonight, why would I make this declaration

123
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,500
that he walked purposefully?

124
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,380
Well, we find that as you study the life of Christ

125
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,019
and we have these four gospel records

126
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:16,000
that God has given to us,

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,299
that we have the privilege of being able to see

128
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:21,980
how Christ lived his life.

129
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,700
We find in Matthew chapter number four,

130
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,980
the Bible says in verse number 23,

131
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,859
and Jesus went about all Galilee,

132
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:33,459
notice what it says, teaching in their synagogues

133
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:36,739
and preaching the gospel of the kingdom

134
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:39,959
and healing all manner of sickness

135
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,859
and all manner of disease among the people

136
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:45,299
and his fame went throughout all Syria

137
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:47,140
and they brought unto him all sick people

138
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,940
that were taken with divers diseases and torments

139
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,100
and those which were possessed with devils

140
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,660
and those which were lunatic

141
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,540
and those that had palsy and he healed them

142
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,980
and there followed him great multitudes of people

143
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,380
from Galilee and from Decapolis and from Jerusalem

144
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,820
and from Judea and from beyond Jordan.

145
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,779
And so we find that Jesus, he went about all Galilee,

146
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:11,079
it says in verse 23 and it tells us

147
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,880
that as we consider this thought tonight

148
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,500
that he walked purposefully,

149
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,119
that as he went about Galilee,

150
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:19,279
notice he was teaching in their synagogues.

151
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,600
It tells us that he was preaching

152
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,100
the gospel of the kingdom

153
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,279
and it tells us that he was healing all manner of sickness.

154
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,440
We find that because of his teaching

155
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,600
and his preaching and his healing,

156
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,820
that there's a great multitude of people

157
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,440
that begin to follow him

158
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,239
and we find that in verse 25,

159
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:39,160
it tells us that there followed him

160
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,980
a great multitudes of people

161
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,739
and it says not only from Galilee

162
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:44,420
but from Decapolis, from Jerusalem,

163
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,899
from Judea and from beyond Jordan.

164
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:49,859
Think about the word being spread

165
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:53,619
about how Jesus was teaching and preaching and healing

166
00:06:53,619 --> 00:06:56,660
and the Bible says in verse number one of chapter five

167
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,660
and seeing the multitudes,

168
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,339
he went up into a mountain

169
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:02,579
and when he was set, his disciples came unto him

170
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:05,660
and he opened his mouth and taught them saying

171
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,420
and we see the Sermon on the Mount,

172
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,459
we begin to read the Beatitudes we often refer to

173
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:15,660
and again, we see that Jesus walked purposefully.

174
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,160
He didn't just walk about just without any purpose.

175
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,500
You ever see somebody that seems like

176
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,959
they're going around life without any purpose?

177
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,100
They just kind of have no real direction,

178
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,920
there's no purpose in their life.

179
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,299
I find that Jesus walked purposefully.

180
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:31,459
Notice in Matthew chapter nine,

181
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,540
the Bible tells us this,

182
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,839
just a few pages over in your Bibles there,

183
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,559
Matthew chapter nine in verse number 35

184
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,200
and Jesus went about all the cities and villages

185
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,559
teaching in their synagogues

186
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:45,920
and preaching the gospel of the kingdom

187
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,019
and healing every sickness

188
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:48,720
and every disease among the people

189
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,600
and so again, we find very similar

190
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,799
to what we read in Matthew chapter number four

191
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:56,019
that as Jesus went about all the cities and the villages,

192
00:07:56,019 --> 00:08:00,239
notice he's going and he's teaching again,

193
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:02,239
he's preaching and he's healing.

194
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:04,839
He's going with purpose.

195
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:08,480
He's going on purpose and with purpose.

196
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,959
I'm thankful this evening

197
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,160
that our God always moves with purpose.

198
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,820
I'm thankful this evening that God always has a purpose.

199
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,019
We can go through life,

200
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:19,399
have you ever been in a situation say,

201
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,200
I don't know why I'm dealing with this,

202
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,760
I don't know what the purpose of this is

203
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,839
and maybe we'll never know this side of heaven

204
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,279
but we can rejoice in knowing that if we don't know

205
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:34,200
that we can rest in knowing that our God has a purpose

206
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,640
and it may be years before we ever find out

207
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,679
what that purpose was.

208
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,320
I was sharing with somebody a testimony

209
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,880
just a couple of weeks ago

210
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,760
about how my dad got orders when I was living in Nevada

211
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,719
courtesy of the Marine Corps to move down to California

212
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,440
and it was the last place he wanted to go.

213
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,320
He'd been in the Marine Corps for 20 years.

214
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,320
He was going to basically go to his last duty station

215
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,520
before he retired, everyone knew that

216
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,280
and he said, I'll go anywhere in the world

217
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,440
but I don't wanna go to California

218
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,000
and so guess where he got to go?

219
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,960
California and we got to go there

220
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,599
and you know, it was really challenging.

221
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:10,559
It was challenging for me.

222
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,799
I was going to my senior high school.

223
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,479
There were a lot of challenges with regard to that

224
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:17,760
with sports and athletics, academics,

225
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,679
all of that sort of thing

226
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,320
but the reality was that we moved

227
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,960
and I didn't understand all of the reasons why we did

228
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,280
but we did and I got saved

229
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,640
within about three months of moving to California

230
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,400
and then after I got saved, God called me to the ministry

231
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,039
and then after I got called to the ministry,

232
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,640
God put me together with Paul Merchant as my pastor

233
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,400
who's still a mentor to me today

234
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,159
who God then used 13 years later that connection

235
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,799
to bring me to this church to be the pastor.

236
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:49,119
It's absolutely amazing how God works

237
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:52,080
and so we see that even still today,

238
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,400
we can rejoice in knowing that our God has purpose

239
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,080
but we even see it as we look at the scriptures

240
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,520
and look at the life of Christ,

241
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,200
he moved, he walked.

242
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,080
purposefully, Mark chapter number one.

243
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,640
Look there if you will, Mark chapter number one,

244
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,160
and we'll get to one more passage of scripture,

245
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,280
Mark chapter one, and the reality is that we could look

246
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,160
at tons of portions of scripture this evening

247
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,100
to deal with this subject of the Lord Jesus Christ

248
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,880
moving and walking with purpose.

249
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,000
In Mark chapter number one in verse number 16,

250
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,240
it says, now as he walked by the Sea of Galilee,

251
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,960
he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net

252
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,480
into the sea, and they were four, they were fishers.

253
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,720
And Jesus said unto them, come ye after me,

254
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,280
and I will make you to become fishers of men.

255
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,320
I think about this call that he issues here

256
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,320
to Peter and Andrew to be disciples,

257
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,100
and how Jesus purposefully walked by the Sea of Galilee.

258
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,800
Now we know that he knows everything, amen.

259
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,080
He knows everything, he's the all-knowing, all-wise God,

260
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,160
and there's nothing that surprises him,

261
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,000
there's nothing that he's ever, man, I didn't know that,

262
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,240
I didn't think of that, no, he knew the thoughts

263
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,100
of the religious leaders as they gathered,

264
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,760
he knew the thoughts of the disciples,

265
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,880
he said to them on more than one occasion,

266
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,980
why reason ye among yourselves?

267
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,900
So he knew, and he walked with purpose to that place,

268
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,100
and as Peter and Andrew were casting a net

269
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,920
because they were fishers, that was their trade,

270
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,920
that was their occupation, he says, come ye after me.

271
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,840
We read it in Matthew, he says, follow me.

272
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,480
And we find that he says, I will make you

273
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,760
to become fishers of men.

274
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,960
He moved with purpose.

275
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,240
I want you to think about John chapter number four,

276
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,240
a text of scripture that is always so impactful to us

277
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,960
as we look at the Gospel of John and see how Jesus

278
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,960
was working to help his people understand the truth

279
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,800
of all people needing to hear the Gospel,

280
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,320
and we come to the fourth chapter of the book of John,

281
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,000
the Bible says in verse number one,

282
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,280
when therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees

283
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,000
had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples

284
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,820
than John, though Jesus himself baptized not,

285
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,160
but his disciples, he left Judea

286
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,160
and departed again into Galilee.

287
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,720
Now, if you're going to go from Judea to Galilee

288
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,440
as a Jewish person, there was a set route

289
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,280
that you would take.

290
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,040
There was a way that you would go

291
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,540
and you would never go through Samaria.

292
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,160
It just was the way it was.

293
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
And why?

294
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:40,080
Well, the woman at the well says this to him,

295
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,680
why is it that you ask me of water?

296
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,540
The Jews have no company with the Samaritans.

297
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,300
There's this divide, this prejudice,

298
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,520
and we look at that and we understand that it says

299
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,320
in verse nine, for the Jews have no dealing

300
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,300
with the Samaritans.

301
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,140
They would literally go out of their way.

302
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,880
They would take a longer journey in order to avoid Samaria.

303
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
How many of you ever take a trip

304
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,360
and you take the shortcut, right?

305
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,600
And sometimes you try to outsmart your GPS.

306
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,360
You ever try to do that and you find out

307
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,840
that the GPS actually was smarter than you were

308
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,960
and was taking you on the route that it was on purpose.

309
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,000
I remember talking to a little kid years ago

310
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,300
and I asked how a trip was and they said it was really good.

311
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,540
We took the long cut and I thought that was quite comical

312
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,620
to hear the child use that terminology.

313
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,100
What do you mean by taking the long cut?

314
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,940
Well, my dad missed the turn and we took the long way.

315
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,080
And I mean, it just right out there, you know,

316
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,820
and it was quite comical, but really the Jews,

317
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,660
that's what they would do.

318
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,360
They would go out of their way to avoid Samaria.

319
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,100
But notice in verse number four, the Bible says,

320
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:48,100
and he must, needs go through Samaria.

321
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,580
Why?

322
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,540
Well, because he walked purposefully.

323
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,140
He walked purposefully.

324
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,380
We find that he comes and you're familiar with the account.

325
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,900
Then cometh he to a city of Samaria,

326
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,620
which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground

327
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,000
that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

328
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,860
Verse six, now Jacob's well was there.

329
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,180
Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey,

330
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,180
sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour.

331
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,780
Then cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water

332
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,000
and Jesus saith unto her, give me to drink.

333
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,420
Now we don't have time this evening

334
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,340
to look at the entirety of the fourth chapter

335
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,620
of the book of John, but I believe tonight I could say,

336
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,160
and most of us are familiar with it,

337
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,600
that you would agree with me,

338
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,660
that her life was never the same after this interaction.

339
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:37,660
And what a joy to think about how Jesus walked purposefully.

340
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,779
That though so many, if they're going to go

341
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:44,580
from Judea to Galilee, they would go a certain route.

342
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,980
They would avoid at all costs going through Samaria.

343
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,100
No, Jesus said that he must needs go through Samaria.

344
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,860
He walked with purpose.

345
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,860
I think about the woman at the well and her being saved,

346
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,100
but also the people of the city that heard and came,

347
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,860
and not only from her testimony,

348
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,620
but from hearing as Jesus stayed there for two days

349
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,820
and teaching and preaching

350
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,720
and how many came to know the Lord.

351
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,620
Man, isn't that awesome?

352
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,779
He walked purposefully.

353
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,620
And so if we understand this evening,

354
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,840
the truth of 1 John 2 in verse number six,

355
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,700
where the Bible says, again, just as a reminder,

356
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,940
he that saith he abideth in him

357
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:33,140
ought himself also so to walk even as he walked.

358
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,320
And so if we can look at the scriptures,

359
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,140
and again, there's a number of other portions

360
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,700
of scripture that we could go to,

361
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,140
and we could prove tonight that Jesus walked purposefully,

362
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,580
then it should be said of us as the people of God

363
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,500
that we too should walk purposefully.

364
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,220
We should have purpose.

365
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,380
I wonder this evening,

366
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,980
sometimes people ask this question,

367
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,020
what is the purpose of life?

368
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,100
What is, why are we here?

369
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,340
You know, it's kind of interesting

370
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,059
when you hear people ask that question,

371
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,820
and depending on their worldview,

372
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,059
you get a varied kind of answer.

373
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:06,860
And people have all sorts of ideas and thoughts

374
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,160
with regard to why they're here and what their purpose is.

375
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,279
But I would submit to you

376
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,740
that as a child of God this evening,

377
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,900
that we should not have any stuttering or stammering,

378
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,300
it should not be any difficulty for us

379
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,540
to be able to answer with confidence and clarity

380
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,080
what our purpose is.

381
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,680
Because our purpose can be summarized very easily

382
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,300
as we read the truth of 1 Corinthians 10,

383
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,260
and verse number 31, where the Bible says,

384
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,779
whether therefore you eat, or drink,

385
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:38,200
or whatsoever you do,

386
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,200
do all to the glory of God.

387
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,120
Is that what your Bible says?

388
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,360
That's what my Bible says.

389
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,740
And so if we could take that verse of scripture tonight

390
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,520
and use that verse as answering the question,

391
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,740
what is my purpose?

392
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,680
What's the purpose of my life?

393
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,400
What is it that I'm doing?

394
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,559
And no doubt there are times, I mean,

395
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:02,200
businessmen, those in corporate America,

396
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,120
they've struggled because they've kind of,

397
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,940
if you kind of use that terminology

398
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,380
of being in the rat races,

399
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,200
they would use that analogy of just

400
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,600
how high up the ladder can I climb?

401
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,040
How much can I make?

402
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,920
What titles can I attain?

403
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,700
And reality sets in.

404
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,380
There's always somewhere else to go.

405
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,040
There's always someone else competing.

406
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,980
And what is our purpose?

407
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,760
I had a professor in Bible college

408
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,279
that I remember with great clarity,

409
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:32,880
him coming into class one day

410
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,820
with just a different countenance.

411
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,920
You ever notice somebody that has a different countenance

412
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,680
and you try to figure out,

413
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,000
okay, what's going on?

414
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,880
Remember, Nehemiah had a countenance.

415
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,040
His countenance was sad.

416
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,800
It was sorrow of heart is what the king said.

417
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,600
And we find that you can tell,

418
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,160
you can read people, you sometimes,

419
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,440
especially if you know them,

420
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,279
you can just see them and say,

421
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,100
hey, what's wrong?

422
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,240
Like, I can just tell there's something not right.

423
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,760
And I remember the professor walking in

424
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,559
and this just sobriety that was over him

425
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:06,680
and we began to inquire and we found out

426
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,400
that there were just some things

427
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,980
that he had been talking about

428
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:11,220
with regard to purpose.

429
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,180
And he was just overwhelmed with the fact

430
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,860
that God saved him and God called him to the ministry.

431
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,820
And he was just so full of emotion over that.

432
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,660
And here's why.

433
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,820
He began to tell us the account of his life

434
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,420
and how he grew up in a home where they weren't saved.

435
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,220
They didn't go to church,

436
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,419
except for a couple of times a year,

437
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:38,179
kind of the special holidays and that sort of thing,

438
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:42,320
and went to college and trained for a particular field.

439
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,859
He was in the engineering field

440
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:45,660
and that's what he was gonna do.

441
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,220
And he said that he was a design engineer

442
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,859
working on things and machinery and so on and so forth.

443
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:52,480
And he got this job and man,

444
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,020
he thought he was at the top of the world

445
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,619
and all these things out of college

446
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:58,460
and successful several years at the same company.

447
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,260
And they had this big ceremony

448
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,059
where they had worked on designing this new machine

449
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,780
and they were taking out all of the old stuff

450
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,820
and putting in the new

451
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,020
and they had this big ribbon cutting ceremony

452
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,020
and all these things.

453
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,140
And as all of this is happening,

454
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,980
just a few weeks prior, he got saved.

455
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,179
Somebody invited him to church

456
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:21,500
and he went to church and he got saved.

457
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,100
And all he had been living for was that type of an event.

458
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,460
But something changed in his heart and his life.

459
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,580
And he knew that that wasn't what life was all about.

460
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,960
And God was working in his heart,

461
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,940
calling to the ministry and so on and so forth.

462
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:37,859
And he said, I stood at that ribbon cutting ceremony

463
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:42,380
and here's the thought that just was so impressed on my heart

464
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,980
is that one day, another group of people are gonna come in

465
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,380
and they're gonna take out the machines that I helped design

466
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,859
and they're gonna implement new machines

467
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,900
and they're gonna have a ribbon cutting ceremony

468
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,739
and it's gonna happen over and over and over again.

469
00:19:59,739 --> 00:20:05,179
And God used that in his life to help him understand and solidify the call.

470
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:07,819
Now, we understand not everyone's called to the ministry.

471
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:10,779
But for him, he'd been struggling with that.

472
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:14,059
I mean, right after he got saved, God was dealing with him calling to the ministry,

473
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:15,899
and he was really struggling with that.

474
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:18,539
And he said, look, what is life all about?

475
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:20,139
Is this what I want to do?

476
00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:23,099
And the reality is that God was calling him.

477
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:25,899
Again, God's not calling everyone to the ministry.

478
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:32,219
But what we must understand is that wherever we are, if we're an engineer, if we're a doctor,

479
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:40,539
if we're in economics, finance, medicine, whatever field we're in, that God has for us,

480
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:44,139
that whatsoever we do, we do it for his glory.

481
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:52,219
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it heartily as unto the Lord and not unto men.

482
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:57,739
And so we find that at some point in life, as we recognize, what is my purpose?

483
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:01,979
And how do I walk purposefully as Jesus did?

484
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:07,179
How do I fulfill the purpose of whether therefore you eat, drink, or whatsoever you do,

485
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:08,699
do all to the glory of God?

486
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:10,139
I think about that verse of Scripture.

487
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:14,939
In fact, several weeks ago, in our marriage class, I used that verse of Scripture

488
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:17,659
as one of the points in our lesson.

489
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:21,259
And I said this, it's always an interesting verse of Scripture, because for me,

490
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:25,019
the thought of eating or drinking is just a, you almost don't think about it.

491
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:28,139
I mean, it's just a natural, you have to, right?

492
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:31,019
I mean, your body reminds you if you don't.

493
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:36,059
And it's just kind of almost a mundane kind of a thing.

494
00:21:37,739 --> 00:21:44,139
But God says, whether you eat or drink or whatsoever you do, do all to the glory of God.

495
00:21:44,139 --> 00:21:45,819
And so how do I do it to the glory of God?

496
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:49,419
How do I walk with that purpose, understanding the purpose?

497
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:53,499
Mark 16, 15, a verse that we are very familiar with,

498
00:21:53,499 --> 00:22:00,699
a verse that some of the liberal Bible folks today try to take out of the Bible,

499
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:06,619
textual critics, and they try to discount the closing portion of Mark 16.

500
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:12,859
Many of them will explain away the Great Commission from the other books as well.

501
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:19,339
But we find Mark 16, 15, that Jesus makes it very plain to the disciples,

502
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,379
and he said unto them,

503
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:25,339
go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.

504
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:29,419
And the reality is that we have a unique privilege and opportunity.

505
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:32,139
We've been allowed of God to preach the gospel.

506
00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:36,539
Now, does it mean that everything I'm going to do every single day of my life,

507
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:38,779
all I'm going to do is go and preach the gospel?

508
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:42,859
No, but the reality is that God has us in places,

509
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:49,499
and he allows us to come into contact with people that we are the light to those people.

510
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:54,219
We have the opportunity to share the gospel with those individuals.

511
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:58,139
I mentioned on Sunday evening, we sang that song, bringing in the sheaves,

512
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:00,299
and what a wonderful song that is.

513
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:04,059
It starts out by sowing in the morning, sowing in the evening, right?

514
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:07,899
And the song starts that way because you're not going to bring in the sheaves

515
00:23:07,899 --> 00:23:09,179
if you're not first sowing.

516
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,419
It makes sense, right?

517
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:14,779
And the songwriter understood something about agriculture

518
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:17,899
is using that analogy in the song, and so we understand.

519
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:21,579
And I was convicted as I was reading that song earlier in the day,

520
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:22,779
and I mentioned it on Sunday.

521
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:25,579
I was reading, I was sitting here on the pulpit as I prayed in the morning,

522
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:28,219
and as I was reading through the words of the song, I was convicted,

523
00:23:28,219 --> 00:23:29,979
and I asked myself this question,

524
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:33,419
when is the last time I even tried to share the gospel with someone?

525
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:39,099
If that's what our purpose is, we have to ask ourselves the question,

526
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:40,459
so sometimes we ask the question,

527
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:43,579
when's the last time you led somebody to Christ?

528
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:48,539
One of the difficulties with that question is I don't have a control over that

529
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:53,099
because the Bible says that some plant some water, but God gives the increase.

530
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,499
So I have to leave that part in God's hands.

531
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:59,659
I can't control whether or not I could lead somebody to Christ,

532
00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:02,859
but the reality is that I better be sharing the gospel.

533
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:06,139
Now, I can't force anyone to listen to the gospel,

534
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:09,899
but am I even trying to share the gospel?

535
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:12,299
Am I trying to sow the seed?

536
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:14,619
The folks that I come in contact with,

537
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:18,380
the people that I rub shoulders with throughout the week,

538
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:22,220
are those people, do they know that I'm a Christian?

539
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,099
Have I ever tried to share the gospel with them?

540
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:26,059
That's our purpose.

541
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:31,099
Think about this, John chapter number 15.

542
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:34,139
The Bible says this, I'll give you a moment to turn there,

543
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,940
and John 15 is a familiar passage.

544
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,899
It's kind of interesting.

545
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:41,019
It goes right along with this truth in 1 John

546
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:44,059
because in 1 John chapter 2 and verse number 6,

547
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:48,539
the verse that we're using as our lesson key verse,

548
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:51,500
it says, he that saith, he abideth in him.

549
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,539
Now, in John chapter number 15, what's the thought here?

550
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:56,539
Abide in me, right?

551
00:24:56,539 --> 00:24:58,459
We see it in verse number four,

552
00:24:58,459 --> 00:24:59,660
abide in me, and I in you,

553
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,099
as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself,

554
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,139
except it abide in the vine,

555
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:04,059
no more can you except you abide in me.

556
00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:06,539
And so, he that abideth in me, verse number five,

557
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:10,220
if a man abide not in me, verse number six,

558
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,619
if ye abide in me, verse number seven,

559
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:16,220
and so we see that 1 John chapter 2 speaks about this,

560
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,459
the one that says he abides in him.

561
00:25:18,459 --> 00:25:21,660
Remember, the evidence has to support the claim,

562
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:25,339
and that's why it says that he himself also sort of walk

563
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:27,899
even as he walked or as Christ walked.

564
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:30,059
So, we come to John 15,

565
00:25:30,699 --> 00:25:33,660
and we begin to see this truth that God gives us

566
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,259
with regard to being the vine and we are the branches.

567
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:39,339
It's interesting, he says, I am the true vine.

568
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:41,339
I am the true vine.

569
00:25:41,979 --> 00:25:47,819
And my attention recently was just captivated

570
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:49,660
on that thought, the true vine.

571
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,419
Listen, there's a lot of false things out there today,

572
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:56,220
but I'm thankful that my savior, that my Jesus,

573
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,019
he is the true vine.

574
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:01,660
The Bible says in verse number one,

575
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,500
and my father is the husbandman,

576
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,220
every branch in me that beareth not fruit,

577
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,179
he taketh away, and every branch that beareth fruit,

578
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:11,979
he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.

579
00:26:11,979 --> 00:26:14,139
Now, understand, who's the one that gives the fruit?

580
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:18,940
It's God that gives the fruit, but he's using us, right?

581
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,739
Some plant, some water, God gives the increase.

582
00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:24,539
And he says that he purgeth it, verse number two,

583
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:26,859
that it may bring forth more fruit.

584
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:29,339
Verse number three, now ye are clean through the word,

585
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:30,859
which I have spoken unto you.

586
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:31,979
Abide in me, and I in you,

587
00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:34,059
as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself,

588
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,500
except it abide in the vine.

589
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,660
No more can ye except ye abide in me.

590
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,539
Now we understand that principle and that truth.

591
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:42,220
And so the importance of abiding,

592
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,419
if I'm gonna produce fruit,

593
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:45,099
if I'm gonna be a fruit bearer,

594
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:46,619
I must abide in the vine.

595
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:48,699
Verse five, I am the vine, ye are the branches.

596
00:26:48,699 --> 00:26:50,859
He that abideth in me, and I in him,

597
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,259
the same bringeth forth much fruit.

598
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:55,259
For without me he can do nothing.

599
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:57,019
And so if you notice, if you go through

600
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:59,500
the few verses of scripture here,

601
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,899
in verse number one, excuse me, verse number two,

602
00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:05,660
it says that if he beareth not fruit,

603
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,380
and then it says in every branch that beareth fruit.

604
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:11,099
And so you see, it's just bearing fruit.

605
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:12,699
But then at the end of verse number two,

606
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:15,179
it says that he purgeth it, that it might bring forth,

607
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:15,819
what does it say?

608
00:27:16,699 --> 00:27:17,419
More fruit.

609
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:21,339
And then by the time you get down to verse number five,

610
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:23,019
it says that he that abideth in me,

611
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:26,859
and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit.

612
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,139
So in verse number two, we go from fruit to more fruit,

613
00:27:30,139 --> 00:27:31,979
to verse number five, much fruit.

614
00:27:32,699 --> 00:27:35,099
And we find this, remember, what did Jesus say?

615
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:37,339
We looked at Mark one,

616
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:39,819
when he purposefully walked along the sea

617
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:42,059
so that he could call Peter and Andrew.

618
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:44,059
He said, come, and he said,

619
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:47,739
I will make you to be fishers of men.

620
00:27:47,739 --> 00:27:49,500
Now, what does it mean to be a fisher of men?

621
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:52,619
We use the term sometimes soul winning,

622
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:53,979
and we talk about going out.

623
00:27:53,979 --> 00:27:57,819
The proverb says, he that winneth souls is wise.

624
00:27:57,819 --> 00:28:00,220
And we go out, we share the gospel,

625
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,819
we preach the truth of the gospel

626
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:04,139
so that people can know that they have a choice.

627
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:06,619
I said this on Sunday morning in Sunday school.

628
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:08,539
John chapter number one,

629
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:11,500
he came to his own and his own received him not.

630
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:14,220
Verse 12, but as many as received him,

631
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,819
to them gave he power to become the sons of God,

632
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,099
even to them that believe on his name.

633
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,699
And so it's very interesting

634
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:19,979
because they received him not,

635
00:28:19,979 --> 00:28:21,739
and then those that received him,

636
00:28:22,699 --> 00:28:24,699
every single person on the face of the earth,

637
00:28:24,699 --> 00:28:26,699
every person that you know, that you work with,

638
00:28:26,699 --> 00:28:29,339
that you have any kind of activity with,

639
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:30,139
they have a choice.

640
00:28:31,899 --> 00:28:35,739
But what really burdens my heart

641
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:37,179
is how many of them don't even know

642
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:38,380
that they have a choice.

643
00:28:39,979 --> 00:28:40,859
They don't even know

644
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:42,219
because they've not heard the gospel.

645
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:44,299
They don't know that they have a choice

646
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:46,299
to reject or receive.

647
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:48,140
They obviously, what does the truth say

648
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,820
in John three in verse 36?

649
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,979
Look, if you don't, you're condemned already, right?

650
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,419
The preacher years ago preached a message,

651
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:58,779
what do you have to do to go to hell?

652
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,299
And the answer was nothing

653
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:01,899
because we're condemned already.

654
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:04,459
And so there's countless millions of people

655
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:07,899
on our planet today that have no idea.

656
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:10,059
They don't know the choice that they have.

657
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:12,619
And I feel like as believers

658
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:15,500
and I challenge my own life, my own self,

659
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,659
am I walking with purpose,

660
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:20,940
understanding the main purpose, right?

661
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,380
What is the main purpose?

662
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,539
Now, remember he said in first Corinthians 10 31,

663
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:27,580
whether therefore you eat or drink,

664
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,979
whatsoever you do, do all to the glory of God.

665
00:29:29,979 --> 00:29:31,899
We're speaking here in John 15

666
00:29:31,899 --> 00:29:33,899
about this bringing forth fruit.

667
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:35,659
Jesus walked purposefully.

668
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:38,380
He called people and said, follow me.

669
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,419
I will make you to be fishers of men.

670
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:43,739
It's God doing the work in us

671
00:29:43,739 --> 00:29:46,859
as we abide in him, as we yield ourselves to him,

672
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:49,020
as we also walk purposefully.

673
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,580
Continue now in John 15 verse number six,

674
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,580
if a man abide not in me,

675
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:57,099
he has cast forth as a branch and is withered

676
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:59,500
and men gather them and cast them into the fire.

677
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,759
and they are burned.

678
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:04,139
If you abide in me and my words abide in you,

679
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:06,480
you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you.

680
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,979
Now notice verse number eight.

681
00:30:07,979 --> 00:30:09,220
It's where I've been trying to get to

682
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,699
with this whole thought going through these verses.

683
00:30:11,699 --> 00:30:14,819
Herein is my father glorified.

684
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:18,500
Now 1 Corinthians 10 31, do all the glory of God.

685
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,219
So here in John 15 and verse number eight,

686
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,700
herein is my father glorified.

687
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,020
Here's how he's glorified, that ye bear much fruit.

688
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:29,819
So shall you be my disciples.

689
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:31,379
How do I bear much fruit?

690
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:32,819
Well, he said, follow me and I'll make you

691
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:34,220
to be fishers of men.

692
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,900
He said, abide in me.

693
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,200
And so there's this yielding, there's this understanding.

694
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,700
What is my purpose?

695
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,680
Why is it that God has left me here?

696
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,979
And yes, I have to work a job.

697
00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:46,680
Yes, I have to do these things

698
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,380
and I have these responsibilities and these duties,

699
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:54,340
but I can't lose sight in the midst of all of those things

700
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,540
that I have a greater purpose.

701
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,659
And that purpose is to make Christ known,

702
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,580
to make Christ known.

703
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:05,099
Notice in Colossians one, in verse number 18,

704
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:07,540
Colossians one, in verse number 18,

705
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,059
it's a familiar verse of scripture,

706
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,919
one in which we ought to commit to memory.

707
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:17,739
And we see that really beginning in verse 15,

708
00:31:17,739 --> 00:31:20,779
a great truth with regard to a great description

709
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:22,699
with regard to our Lord.

710
00:31:22,699 --> 00:31:24,819
I actually begin reading it there in verse 15

711
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:25,819
in Colossians one.

712
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:27,699
Notice the Bible says this,

713
00:31:27,699 --> 00:31:29,819
who is the image of the invisible God,

714
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:31,819
the firstborn of every creature,

715
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:35,819
for by him were all things created that are in heaven,

716
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:37,919
that are in earth, visible and invisible,

717
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,419
whether they be thrones or dominions

718
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,339
or principalities or powers,

719
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:44,580
all things were created by him and for him.

720
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,980
And he is before all things,

721
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,099
and by him all things consist.

722
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:52,860
And he is the head of the body, the church.

723
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,580
And this is a great verse of scripture

724
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,540
talking about the polity of the church.

725
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,779
And we're saying, listen, there's no other person

726
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:01,379
that's to be the head of the church.

727
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:04,120
Why do we have an issue with the state government church,

728
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,099
a state-run church?

729
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:07,619
Because there's no other head of the church.

730
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:09,759
It's Jesus that is the head of the church.

731
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:12,339
Notice who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead.

732
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:14,820
Then notice this, that in all things,

733
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,639
he might have the preeminence,

734
00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:21,699
that he might have the preeminence,

735
00:32:21,699 --> 00:32:24,259
literally having first place.

736
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:26,500
First John ends by saying,

737
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,399
my little children, keep yourselves from idols.

738
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,460
We find that an idol is anything

739
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,699
that gets in the place of God.

740
00:32:36,699 --> 00:32:40,100
Idols can vary from culture to culture,

741
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,380
from family to family, a different thing.

742
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:47,380
Somebody can idolize something that another person does not.

743
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,619
And we see here that the scriptures say that in all things,

744
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:55,059
he, Christ, might have the preeminence.

745
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:58,539
By the way, when you start reading in verse number 15,

746
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:00,500
obviously, previous even to that,

747
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,360
he talks about the fact that we've been redeemed

748
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,339
through his blood, that's how we have forgiveness.

749
00:33:04,339 --> 00:33:05,419
He's our savior.

750
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:10,419
But then you see this great description of who our God is,

751
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:12,759
and then it says that he might have the preeminence.

752
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:16,020
Well, absolutely, that just makes sense,

753
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:20,259
knowing who he is, that in my life, in your life,

754
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,339
he should have the preeminence.

755
00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:25,500
And so this evening, when we look at this thought

756
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,139
of walking, we ought to walk as Christ walked.

757
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:32,160
We find that he walked wisely, he walked humbly,

758
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,179
as we looked at last week, but tonight,

759
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:37,699
we consider this truth that he walked purposefully.

760
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:41,419
If you study the gospels and you study through

761
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,899
the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ,

762
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:48,460
he was always moving with purpose, always.

763
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,100
John 9, he saw a man that was born blind.

764
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,460
It was an opportunity.

765
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,779
You come to John chapter 11, and you find there

766
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:59,220
that he's made aware of the fact that he whom thou lovest

767
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,539
is sick, and what did he do?

768
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,380
He stayed there, he delayed, he didn't go.

769
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,940
Why?

770
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,059
Well, because he knew what he was gonna do.

771
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:10,619
And he tells his disciples, he said,

772
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,419
all right, it's time to go.

773
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:14,220
And they said that Lazarus was asleep.

774
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,779
Well, if he's sleeping, then that's good.

775
00:34:15,779 --> 00:34:17,380
I mean, he's sick, let him sleep.

776
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,420
And he said, Lazarus is dead.

777
00:34:20,779 --> 00:34:24,179
And then he says this, I am glad for your sakes

778
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:29,059
that I was not there, to the intent that you might believe.

779
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:31,619
We could go on and on this evening with just

780
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,820
example after example, in the life and ministry

781
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,859
of the Lord Jesus Christ, where he walked purposefully.

782
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,260
As I consider that truth this evening,

783
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,220
coupled with this ought to command

784
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,899
from 1 John chapter two, in verse number six,

785
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:52,299
I examine my own life, and I say,

786
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:54,940
am I walking with purpose?

787
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,500
Today, did I walk with purpose?

788
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,660
When I went about the various things that I went about,

789
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,579
did I have purpose in what I was doing?

790
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:07,579
Was there ever something that I did

791
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:10,339
that was to bring glory to God,

792
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:15,339
that there was the purpose of my day, of my activity?

793
00:35:17,459 --> 00:35:20,660
Because Jesus always walked purposefully.

794
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,859
And tonight, if we're gonna walk as Christ walked,

795
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:27,019
then we too, we must walk purposefully.

796
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,779
Why am I doing the things that I'm doing?

797
00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:34,579
Why am I, we could ask ourselves, we gotta answer,

798
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:36,380
am I doing it for the glory of God?

799
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,859
How can I do it for the glory of God?

800
00:35:41,859 --> 00:35:44,500
Is there a way that I can approach this task,

801
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,660
this responsibility, and fulfill the responsibility

802
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,140
at the same time of bringing glory to God?

803
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,940
Because we need to, as Christ did, walk purposefully.

804
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,420
Father, we love you, we thank you for loving us,

805
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,299
we thank you for your word tonight,

806
00:36:00,299 --> 00:36:03,820
we thank you for the example of the Lord Jesus Christ,

807
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,260
and Lord, I pray that you'd help us tonight.

808
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,500
Lord, help us not to lose sight

809
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,700
of why you have left us here.

810
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,019
Lord, help us to move and walk with purpose

811
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:17,179
just as our Savior did.

812
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:20,179
We thank you for the privilege of prayer,

813
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:22,660
we thank you that you hear and answer prayer.

814
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,459
We ask God that you would bless our time,

815
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:25,859
I pray that you'd be honored and glorified,

816
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:28,739
for it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
