WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
and our series here on Wednesday nights

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.760
for a number of weeks now has been this thought,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.320
doing what we ought to do.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.239
And I know that I've said it often,

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:10.560
but it's worth repeating

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.560
at the beginning of each of our lessons,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.920
just because we know what we ought to do

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.879
doesn't mean we do what we ought to do.

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:20.719
And have you ever had your child

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:22.799
or maybe a young person that you were watching

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:24.959
and you were in charge of,

00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:26.040
and you said, why did you do,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.399
didn't you know that you're not supposed to do that?

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:29.559
Well, yeah, I knew I wasn't supposed to do it,

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:30.680
so why'd you do it?

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.279
Well, because I wanted to.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.720
And how many of you were in school when you were kids,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.560
you weren't allowed to chew gum in class?

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.400
Anyone have that rule?

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.040
Not allowed to chew gum in class, all right.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.720
How many of you chewed gum in class anyway?

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.639
Some of you better raise your hand, amen,

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:46.119
because I know you chewed gum in class

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:47.520
even though you weren't supposed to,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.439
and you swallowed it even though your mom said

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:51.599
that it was gonna take you seven years to digest it

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:53.319
and all that nonsense, right?

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:55.959
And the reality is that just because you knew

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:59.240
you weren't supposed to doing what we ought to do,

00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:01.759
we don't always do it just because we know it,

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:05.199
and we think about that with life in general.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.160
But then when we come to the truth of God's word,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.800
I'm so thankful that God in his omniscience

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.760
and his grace, his mercy, he gave us his word

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.800
and he told us, here's how you can be saved,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.319
here's how you can know me,

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:21.720
here's how you can live to please me.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.319
Isn't that awesome that God would let us know that?

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:25.760
I was thinking about this today

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.000
and thinking about the truth of prayer

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.839
and what a privileged prayer is

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:32.360
and how God hears us when we pray

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.800
and he answers us and it's such a blessing.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.199
I begin to think about this as I was thinking

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:40.160
about the book of Acts this morning

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.239
and reading through several chapters there

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:45.639
and just thinking about how the prayers of God's people

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:50.120
revealed what they knew to be true about God.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.080
And I begin to think about this when we pray,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.260
God, would you be gracious to this person?

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.839
Why is it that we pray that way?

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:57.519
Well, because we know that God's given us his word

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.559
and he's revealed to us that he's a gracious God.

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:01.760
Does that make sense?

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.680
And we begin to think about how we pray

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.400
and we pray according to his will,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.119
according to what the scriptures teach us

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.759
and how we're to pray and when we pray according to his will

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:14.240
we know that he hears us and he's going to answer

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.119
and we can rejoice in that but we find that God

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.520
has not just given us his word so that we could know him,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.080
although that's wonderful.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.580
He did not just give us his word

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.039
so that we could know the way of salvation,

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:26.639
although that's wonderful,

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:27.899
but he also gave us his word

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:30.740
so that we would know how to please him,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.639
that we could live in such a way

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.839
that our lives would be pleasing in his sight.

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.679
We've looked at a number of these ought to statements

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:40.960
throughout the New Testament and last week

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.800
we started a kind of a mini series within the series

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.639
from 1 John chapter two.

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:47.479
I read several verses last week

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:49.600
but let me just jump right into verse number six,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.979
the key verse, if you will, for this thought here

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:57.639
that is just going to kind of control our study here

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:58.940
for the next couple of weeks.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.979
In verse number six, the Bible says he that saith

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:05.979
he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.179
even as he walked.

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:11.460
Now I mentioned last week that we ought to walk

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.960
as Christ walked, that's the title of the lesson,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.179
last week part one, this week part two

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:18.419
and I said this, that when we come to this verse

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.940
of scripture, it really requires the Bible student

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.779
to then do some research, to do some study

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:27.820
because if the truth is that we ought to walk

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.740
as he walked, then I need to study the scriptures

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.580
to find out, well, how did Christ walk?

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.539
How did he live his life?

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:38.619
We mentioned this, that oftentimes in the Bible

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:42.020
we see that phrase of our walk,

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.179
it's referring to how we live our lives,

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:47.139
it's not the actual gait of our step

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:51.820
and the posture of our walk, it's how we live our lives,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.860
it's our behavior and so we find that here this evening,

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.619
we're gonna look at a couple of more things,

00:03:57.619 --> 00:04:01.339
last week we talked about the fact that Jesus walked wisely

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:04.179
and how we need wisdom, we need God's wisdom

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:07.580
as we live and walk in this world

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.880
and then we said that he walked humbly

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.419
and what great truth with regard to the humility

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:17.059
of the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:20.820
that he humbled himself and so often,

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.859
we are reminded of the importance for us

00:04:23.859 --> 00:04:27.420
as the people of God to also walk humbly,

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.660
to be clothed as Peter said in humility.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.940
This evening, again, part number two,

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.480
so really number three within the miniseries,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.100
number one this evening, Jesus walked purposefully,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.339
he walked purposefully and let me consider this this evening

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:44.859
as we look back at the scriptures,

00:04:44.859 --> 00:04:46.899
turn back if you will to Matthew chapter four

00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:48.579
and I want you to look at a number of things,

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:51.100
just as we did last week, I'm gonna make a statement

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.380
with regard to how Jesus walked

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.179
and then go to the scriptures and seek to illustrate,

00:04:57.179 --> 00:04:59.179
to show you why is it that we're saying

00:04:59.179 --> 00:05:00.500
that he walked wisely,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.500
why is it that we're saying that he walked humbly?

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.100
Tonight, why would I make this declaration

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.500
that he walked purposefully?

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.380
Well, we find that as you study the life of Christ

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.019
and we have these four gospel records

00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:16.000
that God has given to us,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.299
that we have the privilege of being able to see

00:05:19.299 --> 00:05:21.980
how Christ lived his life.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.700
We find in Matthew chapter number four,

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.980
the Bible says in verse number 23,

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.859
and Jesus went about all Galilee,

00:05:29.859 --> 00:05:33.459
notice what it says, teaching in their synagogues

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:36.739
and preaching the gospel of the kingdom

00:05:36.739 --> 00:05:39.959
and healing all manner of sickness

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:42.859
and all manner of disease among the people

00:05:42.859 --> 00:05:45.299
and his fame went throughout all Syria

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:47.140
and they brought unto him all sick people

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.940
that were taken with divers diseases and torments

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.100
and those which were possessed with devils

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.660
and those which were lunatic

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.540
and those that had palsy and he healed them

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.980
and there followed him great multitudes of people

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.380
from Galilee and from Decapolis and from Jerusalem

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.820
and from Judea and from beyond Jordan.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.779
And so we find that Jesus, he went about all Galilee,

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:11.079
it says in verse 23 and it tells us

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:12.880
that as we consider this thought tonight

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.500
that he walked purposefully,

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.119
that as he went about Galilee,

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:19.279
notice he was teaching in their synagogues.

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:21.600
It tells us that he was preaching

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.100
the gospel of the kingdom

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.279
and it tells us that he was healing all manner of sickness.

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:29.440
We find that because of his teaching

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.600
and his preaching and his healing,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.820
that there's a great multitude of people

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.440
that begin to follow him

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.239
and we find that in verse 25,

00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:39.160
it tells us that there followed him

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.980
a great multitudes of people

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.739
and it says not only from Galilee

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:44.420
but from Decapolis, from Jerusalem,

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.899
from Judea and from beyond Jordan.

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:49.859
Think about the word being spread

00:06:49.859 --> 00:06:53.619
about how Jesus was teaching and preaching and healing

00:06:53.619 --> 00:06:56.660
and the Bible says in verse number one of chapter five

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.660
and seeing the multitudes,

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.339
he went up into a mountain

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:02.579
and when he was set, his disciples came unto him

00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:05.660
and he opened his mouth and taught them saying

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.420
and we see the Sermon on the Mount,

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.459
we begin to read the Beatitudes we often refer to

00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:15.660
and again, we see that Jesus walked purposefully.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.160
He didn't just walk about just without any purpose.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.500
You ever see somebody that seems like

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.959
they're going around life without any purpose?

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:25.100
They just kind of have no real direction,

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.920
there's no purpose in their life.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.299
I find that Jesus walked purposefully.

00:07:29.299 --> 00:07:31.459
Notice in Matthew chapter nine,

00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:33.540
the Bible tells us this,

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.839
just a few pages over in your Bibles there,

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:39.559
Matthew chapter nine in verse number 35

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:42.200
and Jesus went about all the cities and villages

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.559
teaching in their synagogues

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:45.920
and preaching the gospel of the kingdom

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.019
and healing every sickness

00:07:47.019 --> 00:07:48.720
and every disease among the people

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.600
and so again, we find very similar

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.799
to what we read in Matthew chapter number four

00:07:52.799 --> 00:07:56.019
that as Jesus went about all the cities and the villages,

00:07:56.019 --> 00:08:00.239
notice he's going and he's teaching again,

00:08:00.239 --> 00:08:02.239
he's preaching and he's healing.

00:08:02.239 --> 00:08:04.839
He's going with purpose.

00:08:04.839 --> 00:08:08.480
He's going on purpose and with purpose.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.959
I'm thankful this evening

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:13.160
that our God always moves with purpose.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.820
I'm thankful this evening that God always has a purpose.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.019
We can go through life,

00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:19.399
have you ever been in a situation say,

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:21.200
I don't know why I'm dealing with this,

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.760
I don't know what the purpose of this is

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.839
and maybe we'll never know this side of heaven

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:30.279
but we can rejoice in knowing that if we don't know

00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:34.200
that we can rest in knowing that our God has a purpose

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.640
and it may be years before we ever find out

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.679
what that purpose was.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.320
I was sharing with somebody a testimony

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.880
just a couple of weeks ago

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.760
about how my dad got orders when I was living in Nevada

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.719
courtesy of the Marine Corps to move down to California

00:08:49.719 --> 00:08:51.440
and it was the last place he wanted to go.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.320
He'd been in the Marine Corps for 20 years.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.320
He was going to basically go to his last duty station

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.520
before he retired, everyone knew that

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.280
and he said, I'll go anywhere in the world

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.440
but I don't wanna go to California

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.000
and so guess where he got to go?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.960
California and we got to go there

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.599
and you know, it was really challenging.

00:09:09.599 --> 00:09:10.559
It was challenging for me.

00:09:10.559 --> 00:09:12.799
I was going to my senior high school.

00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:15.479
There were a lot of challenges with regard to that

00:09:15.479 --> 00:09:17.760
with sports and athletics, academics,

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.679
all of that sort of thing

00:09:18.679 --> 00:09:20.320
but the reality was that we moved

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.960
and I didn't understand all of the reasons why we did

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.280
but we did and I got saved

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.640
within about three months of moving to California

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.400
and then after I got saved, God called me to the ministry

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.039
and then after I got called to the ministry,

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.640
God put me together with Paul Merchant as my pastor

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.400
who's still a mentor to me today

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:43.159
who God then used 13 years later that connection

00:09:43.159 --> 00:09:45.799
to bring me to this church to be the pastor.

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:49.119
It's absolutely amazing how God works

00:09:49.119 --> 00:09:52.080
and so we see that even still today,

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.400
we can rejoice in knowing that our God has purpose

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.080
but we even see it as we look at the scriptures

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.520
and look at the life of Christ,

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.200
he moved, he walked.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.080
purposefully, Mark chapter number one.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.640
Look there if you will, Mark chapter number one,

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.160
and we'll get to one more passage of scripture,

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.280
Mark chapter one, and the reality is that we could look

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:16.160
at tons of portions of scripture this evening

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.100
to deal with this subject of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.880
moving and walking with purpose.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.000
In Mark chapter number one in verse number 16,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.240
it says, now as he walked by the Sea of Galilee,

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.960
he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.480
into the sea, and they were four, they were fishers.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.720
And Jesus said unto them, come ye after me,

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.280
and I will make you to become fishers of men.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.320
I think about this call that he issues here

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.320
to Peter and Andrew to be disciples,

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.100
and how Jesus purposefully walked by the Sea of Galilee.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.800
Now we know that he knows everything, amen.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.080
He knows everything, he's the all-knowing, all-wise God,

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.160
and there's nothing that surprises him,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.000
there's nothing that he's ever, man, I didn't know that,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.240
I didn't think of that, no, he knew the thoughts

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.100
of the religious leaders as they gathered,

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.760
he knew the thoughts of the disciples,

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.880
he said to them on more than one occasion,

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.980
why reason ye among yourselves?

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.900
So he knew, and he walked with purpose to that place,

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.100
and as Peter and Andrew were casting a net

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.920
because they were fishers, that was their trade,

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.920
that was their occupation, he says, come ye after me.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.840
We read it in Matthew, he says, follow me.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.480
And we find that he says, I will make you

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.760
to become fishers of men.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.960
He moved with purpose.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.240
I want you to think about John chapter number four,

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:48.240
a text of scripture that is always so impactful to us

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.960
as we look at the Gospel of John and see how Jesus

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.960
was working to help his people understand the truth

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.800
of all people needing to hear the Gospel,

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.320
and we come to the fourth chapter of the book of John,

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.000
the Bible says in verse number one,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.280
when therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.000
had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.820
than John, though Jesus himself baptized not,

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.160
but his disciples, he left Judea

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.160
and departed again into Galilee.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.720
Now, if you're going to go from Judea to Galilee

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.440
as a Jewish person, there was a set route

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.280
that you would take.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.040
There was a way that you would go

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.540
and you would never go through Samaria.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.160
It just was the way it was.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.160
And why?

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.080
Well, the woman at the well says this to him,

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.680
why is it that you ask me of water?

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.540
The Jews have no company with the Samaritans.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.300
There's this divide, this prejudice,

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.520
and we look at that and we understand that it says

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.320
in verse nine, for the Jews have no dealing

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.300
with the Samaritans.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.140
They would literally go out of their way.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:03.880
They would take a longer journey in order to avoid Samaria.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.880
How many of you ever take a trip

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.360
and you take the shortcut, right?

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.600
And sometimes you try to outsmart your GPS.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.360
You ever try to do that and you find out

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.840
that the GPS actually was smarter than you were

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.960
and was taking you on the route that it was on purpose.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.000
I remember talking to a little kid years ago

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.300
and I asked how a trip was and they said it was really good.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.540
We took the long cut and I thought that was quite comical

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.620
to hear the child use that terminology.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.100
What do you mean by taking the long cut?

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.940
Well, my dad missed the turn and we took the long way.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.080
And I mean, it just right out there, you know,

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.820
and it was quite comical, but really the Jews,

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:37.660
that's what they would do.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:41.360
They would go out of their way to avoid Samaria.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.100
But notice in verse number four, the Bible says,

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:48.100
and he must, needs go through Samaria.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.580
Why?

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.540
Well, because he walked purposefully.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.140
He walked purposefully.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.380
We find that he comes and you're familiar with the account.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.900
Then cometh he to a city of Samaria,

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.620
which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.000
that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.860
Verse six, now Jacob's well was there.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.180
Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey,

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.180
sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.780
Then cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.000
and Jesus saith unto her, give me to drink.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.420
Now we don't have time this evening

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.340
to look at the entirety of the fourth chapter

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.620
of the book of John, but I believe tonight I could say,

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.160
and most of us are familiar with it,

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.600
that you would agree with me,

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.660
that her life was never the same after this interaction.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:37.660
And what a joy to think about how Jesus walked purposefully.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.779
That though so many, if they're going to go

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:44.580
from Judea to Galilee, they would go a certain route.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.980
They would avoid at all costs going through Samaria.

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:52.100
No, Jesus said that he must needs go through Samaria.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.860
He walked with purpose.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.860
I think about the woman at the well and her being saved,

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:04.100
but also the people of the city that heard and came,

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.860
and not only from her testimony,

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:09.620
but from hearing as Jesus stayed there for two days

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:10.820
and teaching and preaching

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.720
and how many came to know the Lord.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.620
Man, isn't that awesome?

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.779
He walked purposefully.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:19.620
And so if we understand this evening,

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.840
the truth of 1 John 2 in verse number six,

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.700
where the Bible says, again, just as a reminder,

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.940
he that saith he abideth in him

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.140
ought himself also so to walk even as he walked.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.320
And so if we can look at the scriptures,

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.140
and again, there's a number of other portions

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.700
of scripture that we could go to,

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:43.140
and we could prove tonight that Jesus walked purposefully,

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.580
then it should be said of us as the people of God

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.500
that we too should walk purposefully.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.220
We should have purpose.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.380
I wonder this evening,

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.980
sometimes people ask this question,

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.020
what is the purpose of life?

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.100
What is, why are we here?

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.340
You know, it's kind of interesting

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.059
when you hear people ask that question,

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:01.820
and depending on their worldview,

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.059
you get a varied kind of answer.

00:16:04.059 --> 00:16:06.860
And people have all sorts of ideas and thoughts

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:10.160
with regard to why they're here and what their purpose is.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.279
But I would submit to you

00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:13.740
that as a child of God this evening,

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:17.900
that we should not have any stuttering or stammering,

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.300
it should not be any difficulty for us

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.540
to be able to answer with confidence and clarity

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.080
what our purpose is.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.680
Because our purpose can be summarized very easily

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.300
as we read the truth of 1 Corinthians 10,

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.260
and verse number 31, where the Bible says,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.779
whether therefore you eat, or drink,

00:16:35.779 --> 00:16:38.200
or whatsoever you do,

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:43.200
do all to the glory of God.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.120
Is that what your Bible says?

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.360
That's what my Bible says.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.740
And so if we could take that verse of scripture tonight

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.520
and use that verse as answering the question,

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.740
what is my purpose?

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.680
What's the purpose of my life?

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.400
What is it that I'm doing?

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.559
And no doubt there are times, I mean,

00:16:59.559 --> 00:17:02.200
businessmen, those in corporate America,

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.120
they've struggled because they've kind of,

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.940
if you kind of use that terminology

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.380
of being in the rat races,

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.200
they would use that analogy of just

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.600
how high up the ladder can I climb?

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.040
How much can I make?

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.920
What titles can I attain?

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.700
And reality sets in.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.380
There's always somewhere else to go.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.040
There's always someone else competing.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.980
And what is our purpose?

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.760
I had a professor in Bible college

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.279
that I remember with great clarity,

00:17:31.279 --> 00:17:32.880
him coming into class one day

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.820
with just a different countenance.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.920
You ever notice somebody that has a different countenance

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.680
and you try to figure out,

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.000
okay, what's going on?

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.880
Remember, Nehemiah had a countenance.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.040
His countenance was sad.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.800
It was sorrow of heart is what the king said.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.600
And we find that you can tell,

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.160
you can read people, you sometimes,

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.440
especially if you know them,

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.279
you can just see them and say,

00:17:54.279 --> 00:17:55.100
hey, what's wrong?

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.240
Like, I can just tell there's something not right.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.760
And I remember the professor walking in

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.559
and this just sobriety that was over him

00:18:03.559 --> 00:18:06.680
and we began to inquire and we found out

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.400
that there were just some things

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.980
that he had been talking about

00:18:10.059 --> 00:18:11.220
with regard to purpose.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.180
And he was just overwhelmed with the fact

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.860
that God saved him and God called him to the ministry.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:23.820
And he was just so full of emotion over that.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:24.660
And here's why.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.820
He began to tell us the account of his life

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:31.420
and how he grew up in a home where they weren't saved.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.220
They didn't go to church,

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.419
except for a couple of times a year,

00:18:35.419 --> 00:18:38.179
kind of the special holidays and that sort of thing,

00:18:38.179 --> 00:18:42.320
and went to college and trained for a particular field.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.859
He was in the engineering field

00:18:43.859 --> 00:18:45.660
and that's what he was gonna do.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.220
And he said that he was a design engineer

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.859
working on things and machinery and so on and so forth.

00:18:50.859 --> 00:18:52.480
And he got this job and man,

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.020
he thought he was at the top of the world

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.619
and all these things out of college

00:18:55.619 --> 00:18:58.460
and successful several years at the same company.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.260
And they had this big ceremony

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:04.059
where they had worked on designing this new machine

00:19:04.059 --> 00:19:06.780
and they were taking out all of the old stuff

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:07.820
and putting in the new

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.020
and they had this big ribbon cutting ceremony

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.020
and all these things.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.140
And as all of this is happening,

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.980
just a few weeks prior, he got saved.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.179
Somebody invited him to church

00:19:19.179 --> 00:19:21.500
and he went to church and he got saved.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:26.100
And all he had been living for was that type of an event.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.460
But something changed in his heart and his life.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.580
And he knew that that wasn't what life was all about.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.960
And God was working in his heart,

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.940
calling to the ministry and so on and so forth.

00:19:35.059 --> 00:19:37.859
And he said, I stood at that ribbon cutting ceremony

00:19:37.859 --> 00:19:42.380
and here's the thought that just was so impressed on my heart

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:46.980
is that one day, another group of people are gonna come in

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.380
and they're gonna take out the machines that I helped design

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.859
and they're gonna implement new machines

00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:54.900
and they're gonna have a ribbon cutting ceremony

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:59.739
and it's gonna happen over and over and over again.

00:19:59.739 --> 00:20:05.179
And God used that in his life to help him understand and solidify the call.

00:20:05.179 --> 00:20:07.819
Now, we understand not everyone's called to the ministry.

00:20:09.019 --> 00:20:10.779
But for him, he'd been struggling with that.

00:20:10.779 --> 00:20:14.059
I mean, right after he got saved, God was dealing with him calling to the ministry,

00:20:14.059 --> 00:20:15.899
and he was really struggling with that.

00:20:15.899 --> 00:20:18.539
And he said, look, what is life all about?

00:20:18.539 --> 00:20:20.139
Is this what I want to do?

00:20:20.139 --> 00:20:23.099
And the reality is that God was calling him.

00:20:23.099 --> 00:20:25.899
Again, God's not calling everyone to the ministry.

00:20:25.899 --> 00:20:32.219
But what we must understand is that wherever we are, if we're an engineer, if we're a doctor,

00:20:32.219 --> 00:20:40.539
if we're in economics, finance, medicine, whatever field we're in, that God has for us,

00:20:41.179 --> 00:20:44.139
that whatsoever we do, we do it for his glory.

00:20:45.179 --> 00:20:52.219
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it heartily as unto the Lord and not unto men.

00:20:52.219 --> 00:20:57.739
And so we find that at some point in life, as we recognize, what is my purpose?

00:20:57.739 --> 00:21:01.979
And how do I walk purposefully as Jesus did?

00:21:01.979 --> 00:21:07.179
How do I fulfill the purpose of whether therefore you eat, drink, or whatsoever you do,

00:21:07.179 --> 00:21:08.699
do all to the glory of God?

00:21:08.699 --> 00:21:10.139
I think about that verse of Scripture.

00:21:10.139 --> 00:21:14.939
In fact, several weeks ago, in our marriage class, I used that verse of Scripture

00:21:15.499 --> 00:21:17.659
as one of the points in our lesson.

00:21:17.659 --> 00:21:21.259
And I said this, it's always an interesting verse of Scripture, because for me,

00:21:21.259 --> 00:21:25.019
the thought of eating or drinking is just a, you almost don't think about it.

00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:28.139
I mean, it's just a natural, you have to, right?

00:21:28.139 --> 00:21:31.019
I mean, your body reminds you if you don't.

00:21:31.019 --> 00:21:36.059
And it's just kind of almost a mundane kind of a thing.

00:21:37.739 --> 00:21:44.139
But God says, whether you eat or drink or whatsoever you do, do all to the glory of God.

00:21:44.139 --> 00:21:45.819
And so how do I do it to the glory of God?

00:21:45.819 --> 00:21:49.419
How do I walk with that purpose, understanding the purpose?

00:21:49.899 --> 00:21:53.499
Mark 16, 15, a verse that we are very familiar with,

00:21:53.499 --> 00:22:00.699
a verse that some of the liberal Bible folks today try to take out of the Bible,

00:22:01.339 --> 00:22:06.619
textual critics, and they try to discount the closing portion of Mark 16.

00:22:07.419 --> 00:22:12.859
Many of them will explain away the Great Commission from the other books as well.

00:22:12.859 --> 00:22:19.339
But we find Mark 16, 15, that Jesus makes it very plain to the disciples,

00:22:19.339 --> 00:22:20.379
and he said unto them,

00:22:20.379 --> 00:22:25.339
go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.

00:22:25.339 --> 00:22:29.419
And the reality is that we have a unique privilege and opportunity.

00:22:29.419 --> 00:22:32.139
We've been allowed of God to preach the gospel.

00:22:32.139 --> 00:22:36.539
Now, does it mean that everything I'm going to do every single day of my life,

00:22:36.539 --> 00:22:38.779
all I'm going to do is go and preach the gospel?

00:22:38.859 --> 00:22:42.859
No, but the reality is that God has us in places,

00:22:42.859 --> 00:22:49.499
and he allows us to come into contact with people that we are the light to those people.

00:22:49.499 --> 00:22:54.219
We have the opportunity to share the gospel with those individuals.

00:22:54.219 --> 00:22:58.139
I mentioned on Sunday evening, we sang that song, bringing in the sheaves,

00:22:58.139 --> 00:23:00.299
and what a wonderful song that is.

00:23:00.299 --> 00:23:04.059
It starts out by sowing in the morning, sowing in the evening, right?

00:23:04.059 --> 00:23:07.899
And the song starts that way because you're not going to bring in the sheaves

00:23:07.899 --> 00:23:09.179
if you're not first sowing.

00:23:09.179 --> 00:23:11.419
It makes sense, right?

00:23:11.419 --> 00:23:14.779
And the songwriter understood something about agriculture

00:23:14.779 --> 00:23:17.899
is using that analogy in the song, and so we understand.

00:23:17.899 --> 00:23:21.579
And I was convicted as I was reading that song earlier in the day,

00:23:21.579 --> 00:23:22.779
and I mentioned it on Sunday.

00:23:22.779 --> 00:23:25.579
I was reading, I was sitting here on the pulpit as I prayed in the morning,

00:23:25.579 --> 00:23:28.219
and as I was reading through the words of the song, I was convicted,

00:23:28.219 --> 00:23:29.979
and I asked myself this question,

00:23:29.979 --> 00:23:33.419
when is the last time I even tried to share the gospel with someone?

00:23:34.379 --> 00:23:39.099
If that's what our purpose is, we have to ask ourselves the question,

00:23:39.099 --> 00:23:40.459
so sometimes we ask the question,

00:23:40.459 --> 00:23:43.579
when's the last time you led somebody to Christ?

00:23:43.579 --> 00:23:48.539
One of the difficulties with that question is I don't have a control over that

00:23:48.539 --> 00:23:53.099
because the Bible says that some plant some water, but God gives the increase.

00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:55.499
So I have to leave that part in God's hands.

00:23:55.499 --> 00:23:59.659
I can't control whether or not I could lead somebody to Christ,

00:23:59.659 --> 00:24:02.859
but the reality is that I better be sharing the gospel.

00:24:03.099 --> 00:24:06.139
Now, I can't force anyone to listen to the gospel,

00:24:06.859 --> 00:24:09.899
but am I even trying to share the gospel?

00:24:09.899 --> 00:24:12.299
Am I trying to sow the seed?

00:24:12.299 --> 00:24:14.619
The folks that I come in contact with,

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:18.380
the people that I rub shoulders with throughout the week,

00:24:19.819 --> 00:24:22.220
are those people, do they know that I'm a Christian?

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.099
Have I ever tried to share the gospel with them?

00:24:25.099 --> 00:24:26.059
That's our purpose.

00:24:26.059 --> 00:24:31.099
Think about this, John chapter number 15.

00:24:31.179 --> 00:24:34.139
The Bible says this, I'll give you a moment to turn there,

00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:36.940
and John 15 is a familiar passage.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:37.899
It's kind of interesting.

00:24:37.899 --> 00:24:41.019
It goes right along with this truth in 1 John

00:24:41.019 --> 00:24:44.059
because in 1 John chapter 2 and verse number 6,

00:24:44.059 --> 00:24:48.539
the verse that we're using as our lesson key verse,

00:24:48.539 --> 00:24:51.500
it says, he that saith, he abideth in him.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.539
Now, in John chapter number 15, what's the thought here?

00:24:54.539 --> 00:24:56.539
Abide in me, right?

00:24:56.539 --> 00:24:58.459
We see it in verse number four,

00:24:58.459 --> 00:24:59.660
abide in me, and I in you,

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.099
as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself,

00:25:01.099 --> 00:25:02.139
except it abide in the vine,

00:25:02.139 --> 00:25:04.059
no more can you except you abide in me.

00:25:04.059 --> 00:25:06.539
And so, he that abideth in me, verse number five,

00:25:07.099 --> 00:25:10.220
if a man abide not in me, verse number six,

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.619
if ye abide in me, verse number seven,

00:25:12.619 --> 00:25:16.220
and so we see that 1 John chapter 2 speaks about this,

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:18.459
the one that says he abides in him.

00:25:18.459 --> 00:25:21.660
Remember, the evidence has to support the claim,

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:25.339
and that's why it says that he himself also sort of walk

00:25:25.339 --> 00:25:27.899
even as he walked or as Christ walked.

00:25:27.899 --> 00:25:30.059
So, we come to John 15,

00:25:30.699 --> 00:25:33.660
and we begin to see this truth that God gives us

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:37.259
with regard to being the vine and we are the branches.

00:25:37.259 --> 00:25:39.339
It's interesting, he says, I am the true vine.

00:25:40.059 --> 00:25:41.339
I am the true vine.

00:25:41.979 --> 00:25:47.819
And my attention recently was just captivated

00:25:47.819 --> 00:25:49.660
on that thought, the true vine.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:53.419
Listen, there's a lot of false things out there today,

00:25:53.419 --> 00:25:56.220
but I'm thankful that my savior, that my Jesus,

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.019
he is the true vine.

00:25:59.019 --> 00:26:01.660
The Bible says in verse number one,

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.500
and my father is the husbandman,

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.220
every branch in me that beareth not fruit,

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:09.179
he taketh away, and every branch that beareth fruit,

00:26:09.179 --> 00:26:11.979
he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.

00:26:11.979 --> 00:26:14.139
Now, understand, who's the one that gives the fruit?

00:26:15.019 --> 00:26:18.940
It's God that gives the fruit, but he's using us, right?

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.739
Some plant, some water, God gives the increase.

00:26:21.739 --> 00:26:24.539
And he says that he purgeth it, verse number two,

00:26:24.539 --> 00:26:26.859
that it may bring forth more fruit.

00:26:26.859 --> 00:26:29.339
Verse number three, now ye are clean through the word,

00:26:29.339 --> 00:26:30.859
which I have spoken unto you.

00:26:30.859 --> 00:26:31.979
Abide in me, and I in you,

00:26:31.979 --> 00:26:34.059
as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself,

00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:35.500
except it abide in the vine.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.660
No more can ye except ye abide in me.

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.539
Now we understand that principle and that truth.

00:26:40.539 --> 00:26:42.220
And so the importance of abiding,

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.419
if I'm gonna produce fruit,

00:26:43.419 --> 00:26:45.099
if I'm gonna be a fruit bearer,

00:26:45.099 --> 00:26:46.619
I must abide in the vine.

00:26:46.619 --> 00:26:48.699
Verse five, I am the vine, ye are the branches.

00:26:48.699 --> 00:26:50.859
He that abideth in me, and I in him,

00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:53.259
the same bringeth forth much fruit.

00:26:53.259 --> 00:26:55.259
For without me he can do nothing.

00:26:55.259 --> 00:26:57.019
And so if you notice, if you go through

00:26:57.019 --> 00:26:59.500
the few verses of scripture here,

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.899
in verse number one, excuse me, verse number two,

00:27:01.899 --> 00:27:05.660
it says that if he beareth not fruit,

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.380
and then it says in every branch that beareth fruit.

00:27:09.019 --> 00:27:11.099
And so you see, it's just bearing fruit.

00:27:11.099 --> 00:27:12.699
But then at the end of verse number two,

00:27:12.699 --> 00:27:15.179
it says that he purgeth it, that it might bring forth,

00:27:15.179 --> 00:27:15.819
what does it say?

00:27:16.699 --> 00:27:17.419
More fruit.

00:27:18.779 --> 00:27:21.339
And then by the time you get down to verse number five,

00:27:21.339 --> 00:27:23.019
it says that he that abideth in me,

00:27:23.019 --> 00:27:26.859
and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.139
So in verse number two, we go from fruit to more fruit,

00:27:30.139 --> 00:27:31.979
to verse number five, much fruit.

00:27:32.699 --> 00:27:35.099
And we find this, remember, what did Jesus say?

00:27:35.099 --> 00:27:37.339
We looked at Mark one,

00:27:37.339 --> 00:27:39.819
when he purposefully walked along the sea

00:27:39.819 --> 00:27:42.059
so that he could call Peter and Andrew.

00:27:42.059 --> 00:27:44.059
He said, come, and he said,

00:27:44.059 --> 00:27:47.739
I will make you to be fishers of men.

00:27:47.739 --> 00:27:49.500
Now, what does it mean to be a fisher of men?

00:27:50.539 --> 00:27:52.619
We use the term sometimes soul winning,

00:27:52.619 --> 00:27:53.979
and we talk about going out.

00:27:53.979 --> 00:27:57.819
The proverb says, he that winneth souls is wise.

00:27:57.819 --> 00:28:00.220
And we go out, we share the gospel,

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.819
we preach the truth of the gospel

00:28:01.819 --> 00:28:04.139
so that people can know that they have a choice.

00:28:04.139 --> 00:28:06.619
I said this on Sunday morning in Sunday school.

00:28:07.339 --> 00:28:08.539
John chapter number one,

00:28:09.259 --> 00:28:11.500
he came to his own and his own received him not.

00:28:12.539 --> 00:28:14.220
Verse 12, but as many as received him,

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:15.819
to them gave he power to become the sons of God,

00:28:15.819 --> 00:28:17.099
even to them that believe on his name.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:18.699
And so it's very interesting

00:28:18.699 --> 00:28:19.979
because they received him not,

00:28:19.979 --> 00:28:21.739
and then those that received him,

00:28:22.699 --> 00:28:24.699
every single person on the face of the earth,

00:28:24.699 --> 00:28:26.699
every person that you know, that you work with,

00:28:26.699 --> 00:28:29.339
that you have any kind of activity with,

00:28:29.339 --> 00:28:30.139
they have a choice.

00:28:31.899 --> 00:28:35.739
But what really burdens my heart

00:28:35.739 --> 00:28:37.179
is how many of them don't even know

00:28:37.179 --> 00:28:38.380
that they have a choice.

00:28:39.979 --> 00:28:40.859
They don't even know

00:28:40.859 --> 00:28:42.219
because they've not heard the gospel.

00:28:42.219 --> 00:28:44.299
They don't know that they have a choice

00:28:44.299 --> 00:28:46.299
to reject or receive.

00:28:46.299 --> 00:28:48.140
They obviously, what does the truth say

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.820
in John three in verse 36?

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:53.979
Look, if you don't, you're condemned already, right?

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.419
The preacher years ago preached a message,

00:28:57.419 --> 00:28:58.779
what do you have to do to go to hell?

00:28:58.779 --> 00:29:00.299
And the answer was nothing

00:29:00.299 --> 00:29:01.899
because we're condemned already.

00:29:02.539 --> 00:29:04.459
And so there's countless millions of people

00:29:04.459 --> 00:29:07.899
on our planet today that have no idea.

00:29:07.899 --> 00:29:10.059
They don't know the choice that they have.

00:29:10.059 --> 00:29:12.619
And I feel like as believers

00:29:12.619 --> 00:29:15.500
and I challenge my own life, my own self,

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.659
am I walking with purpose,

00:29:17.659 --> 00:29:20.940
understanding the main purpose, right?

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.380
What is the main purpose?

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:26.539
Now, remember he said in first Corinthians 10 31,

00:29:26.539 --> 00:29:27.580
whether therefore you eat or drink,

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.979
whatsoever you do, do all to the glory of God.

00:29:29.979 --> 00:29:31.899
We're speaking here in John 15

00:29:31.899 --> 00:29:33.899
about this bringing forth fruit.

00:29:33.899 --> 00:29:35.659
Jesus walked purposefully.

00:29:35.659 --> 00:29:38.380
He called people and said, follow me.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:41.419
I will make you to be fishers of men.

00:29:41.419 --> 00:29:43.739
It's God doing the work in us

00:29:43.739 --> 00:29:46.859
as we abide in him, as we yield ourselves to him,

00:29:46.859 --> 00:29:49.020
as we also walk purposefully.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.580
Continue now in John 15 verse number six,

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.580
if a man abide not in me,

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:57.099
he has cast forth as a branch and is withered

00:29:57.099 --> 00:29:59.500
and men gather them and cast them into the fire.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:00.759
and they are burned.

00:30:00.759 --> 00:30:04.139
If you abide in me and my words abide in you,

00:30:04.139 --> 00:30:06.480
you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.979
Now notice verse number eight.

00:30:07.979 --> 00:30:09.220
It's where I've been trying to get to

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.699
with this whole thought going through these verses.

00:30:11.699 --> 00:30:14.819
Herein is my father glorified.

00:30:14.819 --> 00:30:18.500
Now 1 Corinthians 10 31, do all the glory of God.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:21.219
So here in John 15 and verse number eight,

00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:22.700
herein is my father glorified.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:27.020
Here's how he's glorified, that ye bear much fruit.

00:30:27.899 --> 00:30:29.819
So shall you be my disciples.

00:30:29.819 --> 00:30:31.379
How do I bear much fruit?

00:30:31.379 --> 00:30:32.819
Well, he said, follow me and I'll make you

00:30:32.819 --> 00:30:34.220
to be fishers of men.

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:35.900
He said, abide in me.

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.200
And so there's this yielding, there's this understanding.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.700
What is my purpose?

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:42.680
Why is it that God has left me here?

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.979
And yes, I have to work a job.

00:30:44.979 --> 00:30:46.680
Yes, I have to do these things

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.380
and I have these responsibilities and these duties,

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:54.340
but I can't lose sight in the midst of all of those things

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.540
that I have a greater purpose.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.659
And that purpose is to make Christ known,

00:31:00.599 --> 00:31:01.580
to make Christ known.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:05.099
Notice in Colossians one, in verse number 18,

00:31:05.099 --> 00:31:07.540
Colossians one, in verse number 18,

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:10.059
it's a familiar verse of scripture,

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:14.919
one in which we ought to commit to memory.

00:31:14.919 --> 00:31:17.739
And we see that really beginning in verse 15,

00:31:17.739 --> 00:31:20.779
a great truth with regard to a great description

00:31:20.779 --> 00:31:22.699
with regard to our Lord.

00:31:22.699 --> 00:31:24.819
I actually begin reading it there in verse 15

00:31:24.819 --> 00:31:25.819
in Colossians one.

00:31:25.819 --> 00:31:27.699
Notice the Bible says this,

00:31:27.699 --> 00:31:29.819
who is the image of the invisible God,

00:31:29.819 --> 00:31:31.819
the firstborn of every creature,

00:31:31.819 --> 00:31:35.819
for by him were all things created that are in heaven,

00:31:35.819 --> 00:31:37.919
that are in earth, visible and invisible,

00:31:37.919 --> 00:31:39.419
whether they be thrones or dominions

00:31:39.419 --> 00:31:41.339
or principalities or powers,

00:31:41.339 --> 00:31:44.580
all things were created by him and for him.

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:45.980
And he is before all things,

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:49.099
and by him all things consist.

00:31:49.099 --> 00:31:52.860
And he is the head of the body, the church.

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.580
And this is a great verse of scripture

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.540
talking about the polity of the church.

00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.779
And we're saying, listen, there's no other person

00:31:59.779 --> 00:32:01.379
that's to be the head of the church.

00:32:01.379 --> 00:32:04.120
Why do we have an issue with the state government church,

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.099
a state-run church?

00:32:05.099 --> 00:32:07.619
Because there's no other head of the church.

00:32:07.619 --> 00:32:09.759
It's Jesus that is the head of the church.

00:32:09.759 --> 00:32:12.339
Notice who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead.

00:32:12.339 --> 00:32:14.820
Then notice this, that in all things,

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:18.639
he might have the preeminence,

00:32:19.539 --> 00:32:21.699
that he might have the preeminence,

00:32:21.699 --> 00:32:24.259
literally having first place.

00:32:24.259 --> 00:32:26.500
First John ends by saying,

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:31.399
my little children, keep yourselves from idols.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.460
We find that an idol is anything

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.699
that gets in the place of God.

00:32:36.699 --> 00:32:40.100
Idols can vary from culture to culture,

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.380
from family to family, a different thing.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:47.380
Somebody can idolize something that another person does not.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:50.619
And we see here that the scriptures say that in all things,

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:55.059
he, Christ, might have the preeminence.

00:32:55.059 --> 00:32:58.539
By the way, when you start reading in verse number 15,

00:32:58.539 --> 00:33:00.500
obviously, previous even to that,

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.360
he talks about the fact that we've been redeemed

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:04.339
through his blood, that's how we have forgiveness.

00:33:04.339 --> 00:33:05.419
He's our savior.

00:33:05.419 --> 00:33:10.419
But then you see this great description of who our God is,

00:33:10.419 --> 00:33:12.759
and then it says that he might have the preeminence.

00:33:12.759 --> 00:33:16.020
Well, absolutely, that just makes sense,

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:20.259
knowing who he is, that in my life, in your life,

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:22.339
he should have the preeminence.

00:33:23.259 --> 00:33:25.500
And so this evening, when we look at this thought

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:29.139
of walking, we ought to walk as Christ walked.

00:33:29.139 --> 00:33:32.160
We find that he walked wisely, he walked humbly,

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.179
as we looked at last week, but tonight,

00:33:34.179 --> 00:33:37.699
we consider this truth that he walked purposefully.

00:33:37.699 --> 00:33:41.419
If you study the gospels and you study through

00:33:41.419 --> 00:33:43.899
the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:33:43.899 --> 00:33:48.460
he was always moving with purpose, always.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:51.100
John 9, he saw a man that was born blind.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.460
It was an opportunity.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:55.779
You come to John chapter 11, and you find there

00:33:55.779 --> 00:33:59.220
that he's made aware of the fact that he whom thou lovest

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.539
is sick, and what did he do?

00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:04.380
He stayed there, he delayed, he didn't go.

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:05.940
Why?

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:08.059
Well, because he knew what he was gonna do.

00:34:09.339 --> 00:34:10.619
And he tells his disciples, he said,

00:34:10.619 --> 00:34:12.419
all right, it's time to go.

00:34:12.419 --> 00:34:14.220
And they said that Lazarus was asleep.

00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:15.779
Well, if he's sleeping, then that's good.

00:34:15.779 --> 00:34:17.380
I mean, he's sick, let him sleep.

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:19.420
And he said, Lazarus is dead.

00:34:20.779 --> 00:34:24.179
And then he says this, I am glad for your sakes

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:29.059
that I was not there, to the intent that you might believe.

00:34:29.059 --> 00:34:31.619
We could go on and on this evening with just

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:36.820
example after example, in the life and ministry

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:39.859
of the Lord Jesus Christ, where he walked purposefully.

00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:44.260
As I consider that truth this evening,

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:47.220
coupled with this ought to command

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:49.899
from 1 John chapter two, in verse number six,

00:34:49.899 --> 00:34:52.299
I examine my own life, and I say,

00:34:52.299 --> 00:34:54.940
am I walking with purpose?

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:57.500
Today, did I walk with purpose?

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.660
When I went about the various things that I went about,

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:04.579
did I have purpose in what I was doing?

00:35:04.579 --> 00:35:07.579
Was there ever something that I did

00:35:07.579 --> 00:35:10.339
that was to bring glory to God,

00:35:10.339 --> 00:35:15.339
that there was the purpose of my day, of my activity?

00:35:17.459 --> 00:35:20.660
Because Jesus always walked purposefully.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.859
And tonight, if we're gonna walk as Christ walked,

00:35:23.859 --> 00:35:27.019
then we too, we must walk purposefully.

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:30.779
Why am I doing the things that I'm doing?

00:35:30.779 --> 00:35:34.579
Why am I, we could ask ourselves, we gotta answer,

00:35:34.579 --> 00:35:36.380
am I doing it for the glory of God?

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:41.859
How can I do it for the glory of God?

00:35:41.859 --> 00:35:44.500
Is there a way that I can approach this task,

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:48.660
this responsibility, and fulfill the responsibility

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.140
at the same time of bringing glory to God?

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:55.940
Because we need to, as Christ did, walk purposefully.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:58.420
Father, we love you, we thank you for loving us,

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.299
we thank you for your word tonight,

00:36:00.299 --> 00:36:03.820
we thank you for the example of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:07.260
and Lord, I pray that you'd help us tonight.

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:09.500
Lord, help us not to lose sight

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.700
of why you have left us here.

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:15.019
Lord, help us to move and walk with purpose

00:36:15.019 --> 00:36:17.179
just as our Savior did.

00:36:18.579 --> 00:36:20.179
We thank you for the privilege of prayer,

00:36:20.179 --> 00:36:22.660
we thank you that you hear and answer prayer.

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:24.459
We ask God that you would bless our time,

00:36:24.459 --> 00:36:25.859
I pray that you'd be honored and glorified,

00:36:25.859 --> 00:36:28.739
for it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
