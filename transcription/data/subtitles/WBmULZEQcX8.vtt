WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.079
And this is, I had mentioned when I preached

00:00:03.079 --> 00:00:05.239
through Genesis chapter number 36,

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:07.119
that it was one of the most difficult chapters

00:00:07.119 --> 00:00:08.680
in the book of Genesis to preach through.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.159
And that was from a perspective of developing a sermon

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:14.039
with regard to all of the descendants.

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.159
We made it through that portion of scripture,

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:18.040
looked at some very good principles

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.600
that God teaches us in his word.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.840
Every portion of God, it says all scripture

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.120
is given by inspiration of God and is profitable.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.620
And so we know that God has given us exactly what we need.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.620
As we look at Genesis chapter number 38,

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.700
I think from a content perspective,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.099
it's probably the most complicated passage

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:37.939
in the book of Genesis to be able to preach through.

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:39.779
I will skip through a couple of the verses

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:41.220
through the passage,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.020
but we'll look at this chapter this evening.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.819
The content of Genesis chapter number 38

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:50.099
provides us with a record of Judah's wicked behavior.

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:52.900
I've titled the message, the wickedness of Judah.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.180
However, you'll find as we go through the message

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.979
this evening, that not only is the behavior

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.939
of Judah recorded, but we find that his two sons,

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:05.379
their wicked behavior is recorded as well.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.660
We find this evening that as we look at the Bible,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.580
that God addresses the subject matter of sin.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.699
And the subject matter of sin is addressed

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:17.180
and we learn valuable lessons, I believe,

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.139
with regard to that subject matter

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:21.980
here in Genesis chapter number 38.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.139
And the reality is that God created man

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:29.459
in a perfect environment, in a perfect creation

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:33.980
and man disobeyed, sin entered into the world.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.540
And we find that sin is a common factor

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.500
for all people, all human beings.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.419
I understand the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:46.980
100% God, 100% man, and he is the God man.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.260
He is sinless and perfect,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.180
but every other person to be born upon the face

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.379
of this earth is born a sinner.

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:58.059
And as we look at this passage of scripture,

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:59.860
I wanna draw your attention in verse number one,

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.139
the Bible says this, and it came to pass at that time

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:05.660
that Judah went down from his brethren

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.820
and turned into a certain Adulamite whose name was Hira.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.500
And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.699
whose name was Shua, and he took her and went in unto her

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:18.339
and she conceived and bear a son and he called his name Ur.

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:19.979
She conceived again and bear a son

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.539
and she called his name Onan.

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:24.860
And she yet again conceived and bear a son

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.619
and called his name Shelah.

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:29.979
And he was at Chezeb when she bear him.

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:33.139
And Judah took a wife for Ur, his firstborn,

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:35.740
whose name was Tamar.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.899
It tells us in verse number seven,

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:39.419
in Ur, Judah's firstborn was wicked

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:42.979
in the sight of the Lord and the Lord slew him.

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:45.259
As we look at this portion of scripture this evening,

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:47.979
I wanna give you five lessons that I believe we find

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.820
from Genesis chapter number 38

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.539
with regard to the subject matter of sin.

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.820
Five valuable lessons, and I hope that as we work

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.059
through the passage of scripture this evening,

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:00.539
that we will be challenged in our own personal walk

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:02.979
with the Lord, and Genesis chapter number 38

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:05.119
gives us these five valuable lessons.

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:06.300
Lesson number one this evening

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.860
from this portion of scripture is simply this.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.460
Every human being has a sin nature.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.100
Every human being has a sin nature.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.580
There are some that have the idea,

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.500
well, you talk about sin, I'm not really,

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.500
I'm exempt from that.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.380
No, you're not, none of us are,

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.419
and we all have a sin nature.

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:27.139
We understand, the Bible tells us

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:28.660
that we're at enmity with God.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.139
If you read Romans chapter five in verse number 10,

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.220
you understand that we're at enmity with God.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.580
You also understand this truth,

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.259
the book of Ephesians chapter two,

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:39.979
verses two and three deals with the subject matter

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:43.619
of our condition before salvation,

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:45.539
and we all had our conversation,

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:48.699
we're all in that same position,

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.860
but it talks about the fact that our flesh

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.020
has these desires, these fleshly desires,

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.300
and I would say this this evening

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.339
when we understand that every human being

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:02.979
has a sin nature, that our flesh has wicked desires.

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:05.820
I've said, as I preached in the book of 1 John last year,

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.259
that it'd be a wonderful thing from our perspective,

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:12.179
but we understand that God does all things well.

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:14.039
He knows better than we do,

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:15.240
but from our perspective,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.040
oftentimes we would think it'd be wonderful

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.600
at the moment of salvation,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.519
if our flesh was just eradicated

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.420
and we didn't have to deal with it anymore,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.559
and the reality is that's just not how it works,

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:29.799
and after salvation, we find that we are a new creature,

00:04:29.799 --> 00:04:30.920
old things are passed away,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.779
behold, all things become new,

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:34.279
but we still have that old man,

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:37.519
and there's a principle that we find within the scriptures

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:40.279
of putting off and putting on.

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:43.799
The Bible tells us this, that if we walk in the spirit,

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:47.079
we shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:50.239
Understand this evening that your flesh and my flesh

00:04:50.239 --> 00:04:54.679
has worldly, wicked, lustful desires.

00:04:54.679 --> 00:04:56.679
It's more for us to understand that tonight

00:04:56.679 --> 00:04:58.239
as we look at this portion of scripture.

00:04:58.239 --> 00:05:02.600
Listen, God has recorded for billions, really,

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.679
of people throughout human history

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:07.640
to be able to read the content of Genesis chapter 38

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.320
and to read of the wicked behavior of Judah.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.920
I mentioned this last week.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.179
I'm thankful and I believe that you would be thankful

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:16.959
as well that God has not chosen to record

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:20.720
your sinful behavior for everyone else to be able to read.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.559
Amen?

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:23.920
And we find here in Genesis chapter 38,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.019
yes, we learn some lessons, but we see, first of all,

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:29.239
that every human being has a sin nature.

00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:30.899
In James chapter number four,

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:33.679
and we'll be right back into the Genesis 38,

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:36.160
so hold your place there, but in James chapter number four,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.339
I want you to understand that the Bible says this,

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:40.799
and we begin to think about the sin nature.

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:44.079
Sometimes in our minds, we begin to try to categorize sin

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:45.880
and we try to look at things as,

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.579
well, it's not really that bad,

00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:51.339
and we try to justify and excuse our behavior, our sin.

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:53.920
Sometimes we don't like to call it sin.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.760
Why?

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.320
Because we wanna feel better about ourselves,

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.299
and so we don't really call it what it is.

00:05:58.299 --> 00:06:02.420
We don't look at it as being wicked and ungodly and vile.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.799
We look at it as, well, you know,

00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:05.160
kind of everybody does that,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.359
and it's just a, you've heard the expression, no doubt.

00:06:07.359 --> 00:06:08.839
It's just a little white lie.

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:10.820
You've heard somebody use that expression.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.380
God says that he hates lying.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.519
By the way, in the list that God provides

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:18.239
in the book of Proverbs,

00:06:18.239 --> 00:06:22.399
the lying tongue finds itself twice in that list.

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:24.440
Pride, God hates pride.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.600
The Bible says, God resisteth the proud,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.279
but giveth grace unto the humble,

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:30.880
and we find here this evening

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.239
that sometimes we think about sin.

00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:34.640
We're so, and we'll get to it

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.000
as we get through the message this evening,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.720
we begin to look at sin and we begin to compare,

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.880
say, well, I'm really not that bad.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.880
I really don't do, you know, I've never murdered anybody,

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.279
and we have these things in our mind,

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:50.040
but the reality is that we understand

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.600
that there are sins, as I would say, sins of commission,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.359
but there are also sins of omission.

00:06:55.359 --> 00:06:57.399
The Bible says in James 4 in verse number 17,

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:58.799
notice what the Bible says.

00:06:58.799 --> 00:07:02.040
Therefore, to him that knoweth to do good

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.040
and doeth it not, to him it is sin.

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:09.359
To him that knoweth, therefore,

00:07:09.359 --> 00:07:11.880
to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not,

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.720
to him it is sin.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.640
We think about sin and we could,

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.079
this evening we could understand

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:18.619
there are sins of omission,

00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:21.440
things that we know that we should do that we don't do,

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.600
sins of omission, sins of commission,

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.459
things that we shouldn't do that we do.

00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:27.399
We could understand,

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:29.399
even as we look at the passage of Scripture

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:31.559
in Genesis chapter number 38,

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:36.040
that there are private and also public sin.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.399
I believe that as you look at this portion of Scripture,

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:40.839
and it's so quickly how the Bible

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:44.399
in these first seven verses deals with Judah

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:45.480
leaving the place.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.940
Remember, as we studied at the end of chapter number 37,

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.519
it was the boys that came back to Jacob and said,

00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:55.600
hey, we have found this coat of many colors.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.480
They don't refer to it that way.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.920
They just simply say, this have we found,

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.119
no, not whether it be thy son's coat or no.

00:08:03.119 --> 00:08:05.640
We find that that's where we leave off with Judah.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.720
He was the one that spoke up as they had determined

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.959
that they were gonna kill Joseph.

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:11.200
He speaks up and says,

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.519
what profit is if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?

00:08:17.359 --> 00:08:20.700
And the Bible very quickly transitions and focuses

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.480
in just one chapter in Genesis chapter 38

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.880
on the life of Judah.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.660
And it covers where he goes to this place

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:32.659
and he meets this person and the involvement,

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.299
the marriage, if you will.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:38.859
And you find that the Bible speaks about his three sons

00:08:38.859 --> 00:08:41.020
and their wicked behavior very quickly

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.979
goes through the journey of Judah going

00:08:44.979 --> 00:08:48.099
and the relationship that results in the children.

00:08:48.099 --> 00:08:50.419
The Bible says that Er, Judah's firstborn

00:08:50.419 --> 00:08:52.460
was wicked on the side of the Lord and the Lord slew him.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.539
We don't know exactly how much time has passed

00:08:55.539 --> 00:08:58.859
here in these first few verses of Genesis chapter 38,

00:08:58.859 --> 00:09:01.640
but we do see that in this portion of scripture

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.900
that God is putting this highlight

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.500
in letting us see and learn some lessons.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.679
And the first lesson is that we understand

00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:12.539
that there is every human being has a sin nature.

00:09:12.539 --> 00:09:14.260
We speak about some private sin.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.460
As you look at the sin of Er and Onan,

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.700
I believe and I would argue this evening

00:09:20.739 --> 00:09:24.219
that no doubt there was some influence

00:09:24.219 --> 00:09:27.500
from Judah in the lives of his children.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.580
I understand this evening that we cannot control

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.500
the behavior of our children.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.380
I understand this evening that we can raise them

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.619
and we can teach them to do what's right.

00:09:38.619 --> 00:09:40.580
But we understand this evening

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.000
that they have choices to make themselves.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.940
However, when you look here at the portion of scripture

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.820
and you see some of the public sin of Judah,

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.200
there's no doubt in my mind

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.979
that there was some private sin taking place,

00:09:55.979 --> 00:09:59.659
some things that the boys were no doubt exposed to.

00:09:59.659 --> 00:10:03.899
find that it results in their own wicked behavior.

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:06.179
We see these public and private sins

00:10:06.179 --> 00:10:07.899
of commission and omission.

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:09.659
If we're to take a journey through this portion

00:10:09.659 --> 00:10:11.619
of scripture, I would start in verse number two

00:10:11.619 --> 00:10:13.699
as we would look at the sin nature.

00:10:13.699 --> 00:10:17.219
And notice the first sin of Judah is given to us

00:10:17.219 --> 00:10:18.659
in verse number two where the Bible says

00:10:18.659 --> 00:10:21.539
that Judah saw that a daughter of a certain Canaanite

00:10:21.539 --> 00:10:26.419
whose name was Shua, and he took her and went in unto her.

00:10:26.419 --> 00:10:30.379
So the first sin of Judah was that he married a Canaanite.

00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:33.899
Now I can actually not argue really definitively

00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:35.659
that he even married her.

00:10:35.659 --> 00:10:37.739
The Bible does not say that he married her.

00:10:37.739 --> 00:10:38.579
It's an assumption.

00:10:38.579 --> 00:10:40.899
There are Bible scholars and theologians

00:10:40.899 --> 00:10:43.139
that have come on both sides of the equation

00:10:43.139 --> 00:10:45.259
on whether or not he actually married her.

00:10:45.259 --> 00:10:47.379
The Bible simply says that he took her

00:10:47.379 --> 00:10:49.339
and went in unto her.

00:10:49.339 --> 00:10:53.219
And so we would understand that the Bible would teach us

00:10:53.219 --> 00:10:54.539
as we've looked already.

00:10:54.539 --> 00:10:57.539
Remember, Jacob had been given the instruction

00:10:57.539 --> 00:10:59.979
with regard to not marrying a Canaanite,

00:10:59.979 --> 00:11:01.219
so on and so forth.

00:11:01.219 --> 00:11:05.339
And so we find that this is the first revelation to us

00:11:05.339 --> 00:11:07.259
in this portion of scripture with regard

00:11:07.259 --> 00:11:10.219
to the sinful behavior, that decision.

00:11:10.219 --> 00:11:13.579
Notice, if you will, in verse number seven,

00:11:13.579 --> 00:11:16.099
you see the sin of Ur.

00:11:16.099 --> 00:11:19.739
The Bible does not state for us exactly what his sin is,

00:11:19.739 --> 00:11:21.259
but notice what the Bible says.

00:11:21.259 --> 00:11:24.259
In Ur, Judah's firstborn was wicked

00:11:24.259 --> 00:11:27.559
in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord slew him.

00:11:28.679 --> 00:11:31.919
His specific sin is not recorded for us

00:11:31.919 --> 00:11:33.159
in this portion of scripture.

00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:34.979
There are assumptions that can be made,

00:11:34.979 --> 00:11:38.639
but we do not see the specific nature of what it is.

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:40.179
We find that in verse number 10,

00:11:40.179 --> 00:11:42.439
notice what the Bible says about Onan.

00:11:42.439 --> 00:11:45.979
This is the firstborn and the secondborn of Judah

00:11:45.979 --> 00:11:47.419
here in this portion of scripture.

00:11:47.419 --> 00:11:48.619
The Bible says in verse number 10,

00:11:48.739 --> 00:11:51.499
the thing which he did, speaking of Onan,

00:11:51.499 --> 00:11:56.499
displeased the Lord, wherefore he slew him also.

00:11:57.899 --> 00:12:02.899
So we find that Ur and Onan, the first two sons of Judah,

00:12:03.339 --> 00:12:06.339
their wicked behavior is revealed to us,

00:12:06.339 --> 00:12:10.539
and we find that it brought great consequence to it.

00:12:10.539 --> 00:12:12.659
The explanation of the sin of Onan

00:12:12.659 --> 00:12:14.779
is given to us in verses eight and nine,

00:12:14.779 --> 00:12:17.939
and we find that God provides for us the record there

00:12:17.979 --> 00:12:20.059
of what's going on in Onan's life.

00:12:20.059 --> 00:12:21.699
Continue looking at Judah.

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:25.499
In verse number 11, we see that the Bible says this,

00:12:25.499 --> 00:12:28.259
then said Judah to Tamar, his daughter-in-law.

00:12:28.259 --> 00:12:30.019
Now remember, in verse number six,

00:12:30.019 --> 00:12:32.899
the Bible says that he took a wife for Ur, his firstborn,

00:12:32.899 --> 00:12:37.499
whose name was Tamar, and after God slew Ur,

00:12:37.499 --> 00:12:42.499
God, excuse me, Judah gave Onan to Tamar to be her husband,

00:12:42.619 --> 00:12:44.419
and then he was killed as well,

00:12:44.419 --> 00:12:46.299
and so in verse number 11, the Bible says

00:12:46.299 --> 00:12:49.179
that Judah spoke to Tamar, his daughter-in-law.

00:12:49.179 --> 00:12:53.779
Here's what he says, remain a widow at thy father's house

00:12:53.779 --> 00:12:55.539
till Shelah, my son, be grown.

00:12:55.539 --> 00:12:58.879
That's the third son that's mentioned in verse number five.

00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:01.899
For he said, lest peradventure he die also

00:13:01.899 --> 00:13:05.679
as his brethren did, and Tamar went and dwelt

00:13:05.679 --> 00:13:07.699
in her father's house.

00:13:07.699 --> 00:13:11.739
So he, Judah, provides Tamar with an explanation.

00:13:11.739 --> 00:13:15.339
He says, go back to your father's house and remain a widow,

00:13:15.339 --> 00:13:17.899
and when this, my third son, is grown,

00:13:17.899 --> 00:13:21.459
I will give him to thee to be a husband to thee,

00:13:21.459 --> 00:13:24.179
and she went and dwelt in her father's house.

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:27.459
Notice in verse number 14, the Bible says this,

00:13:27.459 --> 00:13:30.099
and she put her widow's garments from off her,

00:13:30.099 --> 00:13:32.819
off from her, and covered her with a veil

00:13:32.819 --> 00:13:34.939
and wrapped herself and sat in an open place,

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:36.919
which is by the way of Timnath,

00:13:36.919 --> 00:13:39.619
for she saw that Shelah was grown,

00:13:39.619 --> 00:13:43.119
and she was not given unto him to wife.

00:13:43.119 --> 00:13:45.879
Again, in verse number 26 of our text of Scripture,

00:13:45.879 --> 00:13:47.959
the Bible says that Judah acknowledged them

00:13:47.959 --> 00:13:50.119
and said, she hath been more righteous than I.

00:13:50.119 --> 00:13:50.959
Why?

00:13:50.959 --> 00:13:52.879
Because then I gave her not to Shelah, my son,

00:13:52.879 --> 00:13:54.959
and he knew her again no more.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.879
And so we find that in verses 11, 14, and 26,

00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:59.879
the verses that we just read,

00:13:59.879 --> 00:14:03.459
Judah was guilty of breaking his word.

00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:08.079
Ever, see, we don't look at that as being as bad

00:14:08.079 --> 00:14:11.319
as the other sin of Judah in this portion of Scripture.

00:14:11.319 --> 00:14:12.419
You know, we make a commitment,

00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:14.219
we ought to honor our word.

00:14:14.219 --> 00:14:17.539
You know, there's a day in our nation that men were,

00:14:17.539 --> 00:14:21.539
when I use the term men, mankind, humans, men and women,

00:14:21.539 --> 00:14:24.599
they, their word meant something.

00:14:26.219 --> 00:14:29.399
You could have an agreement with somebody,

00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:32.419
and there was a time in our nation's history

00:14:32.419 --> 00:14:35.379
where you could just have a handshake,

00:14:35.379 --> 00:14:37.359
and it meant something.

00:14:37.359 --> 00:14:41.479
People were people of integrity.

00:14:42.419 --> 00:14:44.899
People that honored their word.

00:14:44.899 --> 00:14:47.979
Now you enter into a contract and you got 47 pages

00:14:47.979 --> 00:14:50.139
you have to sign with all kinds of exemptions

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:51.659
and this, that, and blah, blah, blah,

00:14:51.659 --> 00:14:53.979
and so on and so forth, and it's just a mess.

00:14:53.979 --> 00:14:54.899
Why?

00:14:54.899 --> 00:14:56.519
Because we live in a crazy world.

00:14:56.519 --> 00:14:58.659
Litigation has gone out of control.

00:14:58.659 --> 00:15:01.779
And the fact of the matter is that people lack integrity.

00:15:02.899 --> 00:15:04.579
Lack integrity.

00:15:04.579 --> 00:15:06.499
You say, well, that's not as bad as the other sin

00:15:06.499 --> 00:15:08.819
that takes place in the text of Scripture.

00:15:08.819 --> 00:15:10.779
And you can argue the severity of sin.

00:15:10.779 --> 00:15:14.139
I would say to you that sin is sin, and God sees it,

00:15:14.139 --> 00:15:16.959
and here's what happens sometimes in our lives.

00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:20.559
We may lack integrity and we just kind of excuse it

00:15:20.559 --> 00:15:24.459
or ignore it because it's not as bad as something else.

00:15:26.619 --> 00:15:27.919
And that's a danger.

00:15:29.259 --> 00:15:30.099
Why?

00:15:30.099 --> 00:15:32.459
Because sin is wicked.

00:15:33.359 --> 00:15:36.019
And sin must be dealt with.

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:40.939
And we find here that the Bible tells us about Judah

00:15:40.939 --> 00:15:43.339
breaking his word, lacking integrity.

00:15:43.339 --> 00:15:45.179
We read also in the portion of Scripture

00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:46.779
when we speak about this first principle

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:48.959
that every human being has a sin nature,

00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:52.339
we see the inappropriate relationship of Judah.

00:15:52.339 --> 00:15:56.579
It begins with the introduction really

00:15:56.579 --> 00:15:59.019
to what takes place is given to us in verse 12.

00:15:59.019 --> 00:16:00.859
It says, and in process of time,

00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:04.099
the daughter of Shua, Judah's wife, died,

00:16:04.219 --> 00:16:07.019
and Judah was comforted and went up onto his sheep shears

00:16:07.019 --> 00:16:10.579
to Timnath, he and his friend Hira the Adullamite.

00:16:10.579 --> 00:16:12.339
And so we find that they go up to this place

00:16:12.339 --> 00:16:13.739
for the purpose of being comforted

00:16:13.739 --> 00:16:17.379
after the death of Shua,

00:16:17.379 --> 00:16:20.539
and we find that the Bible tells us in verse number 13

00:16:20.539 --> 00:16:23.859
about Tamar, and she was there in that place,

00:16:23.859 --> 00:16:27.279
and she knew that her father-in-law was coming there.

00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:31.299
We read verse 14 already about her behavior,

00:16:31.299 --> 00:16:33.059
but notice what the Bible says in verse 15

00:16:33.059 --> 00:16:35.519
with regard to this inappropriate relationship.

00:16:35.519 --> 00:16:38.019
The Bible says that when Judah saw her,

00:16:38.019 --> 00:16:40.699
he thought her to be in Harlot.

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:41.539
Why?

00:16:41.539 --> 00:16:43.859
Because she had covered her face.

00:16:43.859 --> 00:16:45.499
And notice what the Bible says in verse 16,

00:16:45.499 --> 00:16:47.179
and he turned unto her by the way and said,

00:16:47.179 --> 00:16:50.179
"'Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee,'

00:16:50.179 --> 00:16:52.539
for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law.

00:16:52.539 --> 00:16:54.179
And she said, what wilt thou give me

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:56.019
that thou mayest come in unto me?'

00:16:56.019 --> 00:16:58.099
And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock.

00:16:58.099 --> 00:17:00.299
And she said, will thou give me a pledge

00:17:00.299 --> 00:17:01.619
till thou send it?

00:17:01.619 --> 00:17:03.299
And he said, what pledge shall I give thee?

00:17:03.299 --> 00:17:05.179
And she said, thy signet, thy bracelets,

00:17:05.179 --> 00:17:07.259
and thy staff that is in thine hand.

00:17:07.259 --> 00:17:09.779
So the Bible says, he gave it her and came in unto her,

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:12.819
and she conceived by him."

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:13.659
That's wicked.

00:17:16.259 --> 00:17:18.939
It's almost beyond our ability to believe

00:17:18.939 --> 00:17:20.699
except for the Bible records it.

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:23.819
And as we look at this portion of Scripture

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:25.139
and we see what's taking place,

00:17:25.139 --> 00:17:28.219
and we see the way in which it begins

00:17:28.219 --> 00:17:32.259
with the relationship there with the Canaanite,

00:17:32.259 --> 00:17:33.699
as it's mentioned in verse number two.

00:17:33.699 --> 00:17:37.019
And we find that as you look at this portion of Scripture

00:17:37.019 --> 00:17:40.099
and you find that eventually, obviously, they got married.

00:17:40.099 --> 00:17:43.259
In verse number 12, it refers to her as being his wife.

00:17:43.259 --> 00:17:45.179
And we find that she dies

00:17:45.179 --> 00:17:46.699
and now he's going to be comforted.

00:17:46.699 --> 00:17:50.059
But look at how he's seeking to be comforted.

00:17:50.059 --> 00:17:53.379
And the Bible tells us that he sees this opportunity

00:17:53.379 --> 00:17:55.859
and he really, he gives up.

00:17:55.859 --> 00:17:58.019
Look what he gives up, his signet.

00:17:58.819 --> 00:18:00.179
That was what identified him.

00:18:00.179 --> 00:18:02.379
It was how you would stamp a document.

00:18:02.379 --> 00:18:04.219
It was like your signature.

00:18:04.219 --> 00:18:06.619
And he gave up his signet, his bracelets, and his staff

00:18:06.619 --> 00:18:08.899
for this moment of pleasure, if you will.

00:18:08.899 --> 00:18:11.419
And we find that this inappropriate relationship

00:18:11.419 --> 00:18:14.619
that's given here, the record that's provided to us,

00:18:14.619 --> 00:18:16.659
we see this wicked behavior and say,

00:18:16.659 --> 00:18:19.339
I would never do something like that.

00:18:19.339 --> 00:18:20.179
Be careful.

00:18:21.139 --> 00:18:21.959
Be careful.

00:18:24.059 --> 00:18:25.019
You know what happens?

00:18:25.019 --> 00:18:26.299
There's a progression.

00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:29.699
Every human being has a sin nature.

00:18:29.699 --> 00:18:31.019
And I have written in my notes,

00:18:31.019 --> 00:18:33.539
be careful of the slippery slope of sin.

00:18:35.579 --> 00:18:36.419
You know what happens?

00:18:36.419 --> 00:18:38.419
We start making decisions

00:18:38.419 --> 00:18:39.779
that are outside of the will of God

00:18:39.779 --> 00:18:41.500
that are contrary to the word of God

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.339
and to the law that God has given us,

00:18:43.339 --> 00:18:45.339
the instruction that God has provided us with.

00:18:45.339 --> 00:18:47.139
And we start making those decisions.

00:18:47.139 --> 00:18:48.699
And then all of a sudden what happens

00:18:48.699 --> 00:18:51.619
is we start having a calloused heart.

00:18:51.619 --> 00:18:54.699
We start having what the Bible talks about grieving

00:18:54.699 --> 00:18:57.619
and quenching the Holy Spirit of God.

00:18:57.619 --> 00:19:01.500
We come to the place where we have misidentified

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.500
and misunderstood God's long suffering

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.139
for being God's approval.

00:19:05.139 --> 00:19:06.979
And we think that God must be okay with it

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:08.419
because God hasn't judged me.

00:19:08.419 --> 00:19:10.299
And I did this and I did that.

00:19:10.299 --> 00:19:12.819
And I don't see, I don't hear.

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:14.339
There's no judgment in my life.

00:19:14.339 --> 00:19:15.899
And we begin to think it's okay.

00:19:17.579 --> 00:19:18.940
We get that calloused heart.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.259
We get to the place where we've grieved

00:19:21.259 --> 00:19:23.379
and we've quenched the Holy Spirit of God.

00:19:25.699 --> 00:19:28.539
This evening, I begin to think about the work

00:19:28.539 --> 00:19:30.739
of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:19:30.739 --> 00:19:32.659
And maybe at some point in our Christian lives,

00:19:32.659 --> 00:19:35.259
hopefully even at this very moment in our Christian lives,

00:19:35.259 --> 00:19:37.299
I trust that this message this evening

00:19:37.299 --> 00:19:39.779
would be a preventative message.

00:19:39.779 --> 00:19:41.819
But we understand this evening

00:19:41.819 --> 00:19:43.579
that there's a time in our lives

00:19:43.579 --> 00:19:46.139
where as we would even particularly think

00:19:46.139 --> 00:19:47.899
about doing something that would be wrong,

00:19:47.899 --> 00:19:50.579
that the Holy Spirit of God would convict us.

00:19:51.579 --> 00:19:55.059
But what happens is, is we have that seared conscience

00:19:55.059 --> 00:19:56.779
that we speak of because we've grieved

00:19:56.779 --> 00:19:58.819
and we've quenched the Holy Spirit of God.

00:19:58.819 --> 00:19:59.659
All of a sudden.

00:19:59.659 --> 00:20:06.019
sin, we don't sense that conviction in our lives. We get in a place where we think that

00:20:06.019 --> 00:20:11.339
things are okay. We listen to voices of other people that say, oh, everybody else is doing

00:20:11.339 --> 00:20:21.459
it. What's the big deal? The big deal is that sin is what sent Jesus to the cross. Sin is

00:20:21.459 --> 00:20:26.539
sin. And we see in this passage of Scripture that every human being has a sin nature, and

00:20:26.539 --> 00:20:31.939
we see these things outlined between Judah, Ur, and Onan for us in the text of Scripture.

00:20:31.939 --> 00:20:37.019
Principle number two, we see number one, that every human being has a sin nature. I would

00:20:37.019 --> 00:20:44.279
say number two, you cannot control the consequences of your sin. You know how many people have

00:20:44.279 --> 00:20:50.339
believed the lie of the devil that think they can control their sin, that they can control

00:20:50.339 --> 00:20:54.819
the consequences of their sin. They can dabble in this and they can play over there. Listen,

00:20:54.819 --> 00:21:02.619
you can't play with fire and not get burnt. We find this evening that we seem to think

00:21:02.619 --> 00:21:07.499
in our minds that we can control the consequences, though we've seen tragic things happen in

00:21:07.499 --> 00:21:11.979
the lives of other people. We've seen just families fall apart because of decisions that

00:21:11.979 --> 00:21:16.059
were made, and we see all sorts of things that have transpired. We have records in God's

00:21:16.059 --> 00:21:20.379
Word of these things that have transpired. We see it in our own society, and we say,

00:21:20.379 --> 00:21:28.699
that's not going to happen to me. I'm exempt from that. Oh, the Bible says in Galatians

00:21:28.699 --> 00:21:37.299
6-7, be not deceived. God has not mocked whatsoever man soweth, that shall he also reap. We find

00:21:37.299 --> 00:21:42.939
that as we consider the consequences of our sin, we find here in the text of Scripture,

00:21:42.939 --> 00:21:51.299
the Bible tells us at the end of verse number 15 that she, Tamar, conceived by Him. I don't

00:21:51.299 --> 00:21:59.939
think for one second of time that that's what Judah thought would happen. We find that the

00:21:59.939 --> 00:22:05.419
Bible tells us, if you look down at verse number 24, and it came to pass about three

00:22:05.419 --> 00:22:12.139
months after. I understand that three months goes quickly, but I would believe that as

00:22:12.139 --> 00:22:18.779
you look at this portion of Scripture, and obviously in verses 20-23, Judah went to send

00:22:18.779 --> 00:22:26.419
that kid, the kid of the goats, to her. He had given that pledge, but we find that he,

00:22:26.419 --> 00:22:31.019
the kid from the flock, he's going to send to her, and his friend, the Adolamite, he

00:22:31.019 --> 00:22:38.539
can't find her, and time kind of passes, and it almost could be like you think that maybe

00:22:38.539 --> 00:22:45.939
nothing's going to happen, there are no consequences. But then three months later, he receives word.

00:22:45.939 --> 00:22:51.179
Can I say this? We think about the consequences of sin, you can't control them, but let me

00:22:51.179 --> 00:23:02.459
say this, the harvest isn't immediate. The harvest isn't immediate. You plant a seed,

00:23:02.459 --> 00:23:08.739
there's a period of time before you partake of the fruit. There's a process of cultivating

00:23:08.739 --> 00:23:13.339
and watering and nurturing, and eventually that fruit comes. You know, there are some

00:23:13.339 --> 00:23:18.979
fruit trees that will take years before they produce. You can't just go plant an apple

00:23:18.979 --> 00:23:23.219
tree and think you're going to have apples tomorrow, it doesn't happen that way. And

00:23:23.219 --> 00:23:29.739
so we find this evening that the harvest is not immediate, and that's sometimes what happens

00:23:29.739 --> 00:23:36.219
is people, listen, this evening so often we're thinking in our minds that messages

00:23:36.219 --> 00:23:40.779
such as this are for young people, and they need to take heed and be careful, and it's

00:23:40.779 --> 00:23:44.939
true, they do. They need to take heed, but I would tell you this evening that Judah's

00:23:44.939 --> 00:23:53.059
not a young person. Judah's got three boys. Two of them have already been killed. And

00:23:53.059 --> 00:23:57.779
the other one, his youngest of the three, is old enough to be the husband of Tamar,

00:23:57.779 --> 00:24:06.099
and hasn't been given to her. So Judah's not a teenager in this portion of Scripture.

00:24:06.099 --> 00:24:11.339
Listen this evening, we need to be careful that we do not think more highly of ourselves

00:24:11.339 --> 00:24:17.299
than we ought to, to think, ah, it's not going to affect me, I'm above that, I can, no, no,

00:24:17.299 --> 00:24:24.939
no, no. Sin is, sin brings with it consequences, and you can't control your consequences. Sin

00:24:24.939 --> 00:24:30.859
brings death. Here in the passage of Scripture, the Bible tells us that sin brings shame.

00:24:30.859 --> 00:24:35.699
The Bible says in Judah, it said, let her, in verse 23, take it to her, lest we be shamed.

00:24:35.699 --> 00:24:45.979
I want you to notice in James chapter 1, in verses 13 through 15, the Bible tells us this

00:24:45.979 --> 00:24:53.819
with regard to sin. In James 1 and verse 13, let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted

00:24:53.819 --> 00:24:59.619
of God, for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man. But every man

00:24:59.619 --> 00:25:04.139
is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed, then when lust hath conceived

00:25:04.139 --> 00:25:15.219
it bringeth forth sin, and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death. This evening,

00:25:15.219 --> 00:25:18.899
countless people through the ages have thought that they can control the consequences of

00:25:18.899 --> 00:25:27.059
their decisions of their sin. Do not be deceived. Understand that you cannot control the consequences

00:25:27.059 --> 00:25:33.219
of your sin. It's not going to happen to me. Be careful. Take heed, lest you fall. That's

00:25:33.219 --> 00:25:38.139
what the Bible teaches us. Number three, the third principle from this portion of Scripture,

00:25:38.139 --> 00:25:47.219
I would say this, you cannot hide your sin from God. You cannot hide your sin from God.

00:25:47.259 --> 00:25:51.619
Just as many have thought that they can control the consequences of their sin, they think

00:25:51.619 --> 00:25:56.379
that they have it under control. The reality this evening is that countless people have

00:25:56.379 --> 00:26:01.779
thought that they could hide their sin from God. And we find it in the text of Scripture.

00:26:01.779 --> 00:26:08.339
You read about Ur, Judah's firstborn. Again, the actual event or the actual sin that he

00:26:08.339 --> 00:26:13.899
commits is not recorded for us, but we believe, as you look at this portion, obviously God

00:26:13.899 --> 00:26:17.899
is the one that revealed it. Why? Because it says that he was wicked, notice the word

00:26:17.899 --> 00:26:24.899
in verse number seven, in the sight of the Lord. Judah may not even have known why Ur

00:26:24.899 --> 00:26:34.699
was killed. But God knew what Ur was doing. Onan, if you read the portion of Scripture,

00:26:34.699 --> 00:26:39.619
I think that he thought he could get away with his actions. We find that in verse number

00:26:39.619 --> 00:26:47.219
ten, it says that the thing which he did displeased the Lord. The thing that he did,

00:26:47.219 --> 00:26:52.219
it displeased the Lord. Do you think that Judah thought that he could cover, could hide

00:26:52.219 --> 00:26:57.979
his sin here in this portion of Scripture? When he goes and he's dealing with this, he

00:26:57.979 --> 00:27:02.979
engages in that moment of pleasure, if you will. But the Bible tells us in verse number

00:27:02.979 --> 00:27:07.579
twenty that Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend, the Adulamite, to receive his

00:27:07.579 --> 00:27:11.339
pledge from the woman's hand, but he found her not. He thought, this is going to work

00:27:11.339 --> 00:27:16.779
out just fine. Yes, I gave her my signet, I gave her my bracelets, and I gave her my

00:27:16.779 --> 00:27:20.659
staff, but I'm just going to get that kid sent up there, and she's going to give all

00:27:20.659 --> 00:27:28.499
that stuff back, and no one is ever going to know. God knew. God knew. The Bible says

00:27:28.499 --> 00:27:32.579
that he found her not in verse twenty. Verse twenty-one, then he asked the men of that

00:27:32.579 --> 00:27:36.379
place, saying, where's the harlot that was openly by the wayside? And they said, there

00:27:36.419 --> 00:27:42.779
was no harlot in this place. He returned to Judah and said, I cannot find her, and also

00:27:42.779 --> 00:27:48.619
the men of the place said that there was no harlot in this place. Judah's probably concerned

00:27:48.619 --> 00:27:56.219
at this point. There are many that we can look to in the Scriptures that thought they

00:27:56.219 --> 00:28:02.579
could hide their sin from God. Can I remind you of Rachel when she took of the images?

00:28:02.579 --> 00:28:08.819
Can I remind you of the troubler of Israel, Achan, when he took of the accursed thing?

00:28:08.819 --> 00:28:13.979
Can I remind you of David? He went through great lengths thinking he could cover, could

00:28:13.979 --> 00:28:19.659
hide his sin. Can I remind you in the New Testament of Ananias and Sapphira? Oh, we

00:28:19.659 --> 00:28:27.979
sold our property and we gave everything to church. But they held back a portion, and

00:28:27.979 --> 00:28:32.179
they thought that, man, that just the two of them would know, nobody else would know.

00:28:32.179 --> 00:28:39.979
They come in to bring that offering, and here comes in the husband, and Peter says,

00:28:39.979 --> 00:28:48.019
why hath Satan caused you to lie to God? Can you imagine the feeling at that moment? They

00:28:48.019 --> 00:28:50.739
thought they were hiding it. They thought they could cover it. Listen this evening,

00:28:50.739 --> 00:28:56.539
you cannot hide your sin from God. Proverbs 5 and verse 21 tells us this with regard to

00:28:56.539 --> 00:29:02.979
our God. It tells us in Proverbs 5 and verse 21, for the ways of man are before the eyes

00:29:02.979 --> 00:29:09.459
of the Lord, and he pondereth, notice what it says, all his goings. For just a moment,

00:29:09.459 --> 00:29:14.899
I'd speak to the young people. Today we have, and we've mentioned before, there's these

00:29:14.899 --> 00:29:20.059
cell phones. Listen, these things are helpful with a lot of things. They really are. We've

00:29:20.059 --> 00:29:23.099
come to the place, somebody told me this morning, oh, I left my cell phone at home. I said,

00:29:23.099 --> 00:29:26.500
do you remember the time that we didn't have cell phones that we could leave them behind?

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:32.539
I remember that time, right? I didn't always have a cell phone. These are very powerful,

00:29:32.539 --> 00:29:37.779
and they're very helpful. I have apps on here that are extremely helpful. It helps you to

00:29:37.779 --> 00:29:42.219
be connected and so on and so forth, but I can tell you this evening that sin is just

00:29:42.219 --> 00:29:48.739
a touch away. I mean, wickedness. You understand there are apps that young people are using

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:54.219
today that are a facade. It's not really what the app is, and a parent can say, oh, I'm

00:29:54.219 --> 00:29:58.459
checking my kid's phone, and the reality is that they're not seeing anything because you

00:29:58.459 --> 00:29:59.500
got to go into these.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.200
It's, listen, God knows.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.420
God knows.

00:30:04.619 --> 00:30:07.119
There are things that we think we can do in secret

00:30:07.119 --> 00:30:09.840
and we think that no one is ever going to know.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.000
Listen, don't be deceived.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.439
You cannot hide your sin from God.

00:30:15.439 --> 00:30:17.920
Proverbs 5.21 tells us that in chapter 15

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.200
in verse number three of the book of Proverbs.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.440
It says, the eyes of the Lord are in every place

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.840
beholding the evil and the good.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.899
Beholding the evil and the good.

00:30:29.899 --> 00:30:33.900
Psalm 45 in verse number seven tells us this.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:38.340
It says, thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:40.919
Listen, if God sees all things, he knows all things.

00:30:40.919 --> 00:30:42.619
His eyes are beholding all things.

00:30:42.619 --> 00:30:44.659
And the Bible says that he loveth righteousness

00:30:44.659 --> 00:30:47.459
and he hateth wickedness.

00:30:47.459 --> 00:30:51.740
The righteous God loveth righteousness, Psalm 11.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.659
We find this evening that the third principle

00:30:54.659 --> 00:30:56.659
that we learn in this portion of scripture

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.340
is that it is absolutely impossible.

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:02.439
You cannot hide your sin from God.

00:31:02.439 --> 00:31:03.720
Let me say this, number four,

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.400
as we continue to move through the portion of scripture,

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.800
I would say this, sin is deceptive.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.919
Sin is deceptive.

00:31:10.919 --> 00:31:12.120
In Hebrews three in verse 13,

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.839
the Bible speaks about the deceitfulness of sin.

00:31:15.839 --> 00:31:17.440
We find in this portion of scripture,

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.199
when we think about sin being deceptive

00:31:19.199 --> 00:31:22.080
and we find here as to what's going on,

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.040
I would say that as we consider this thought,

00:31:25.059 --> 00:31:27.500
as I was studying through this portion of scripture

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.540
and considering the truth that sin is deceptive,

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.220
a couple of thoughts come to mind.

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:32.260
Number one is this,

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.419
we are more likely to judge others than ourselves.

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:41.660
Remember the moat and the beam Jesus spoke of?

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:48.180
We are more likely to judge others than to judge ourselves.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:51.459
But the Bible tells us that we're to judge ourselves.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.440
I know there are a lot of people that run around,

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:56.860
they say the Bible says judge not lest you be judged.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:59.680
The Bible actually tells us that we're to judge all things,

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.819
but the judgment's supposed to start with us.

00:32:02.819 --> 00:32:04.180
In fact, Peter talks about judgment

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:05.720
starting at the house of God.

00:32:06.819 --> 00:32:07.919
In first Corinthians 11,

00:32:07.919 --> 00:32:10.300
the passage that we use as we observe the Lord's supper

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:12.580
so often, we speak about the fact that the Bible says,

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.380
let a man examine himself.

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:15.699
It says that if we would judge ourselves,

00:32:15.699 --> 00:32:17.300
we should not be judged.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:20.139
And the reality is that doesn't mean

00:32:20.139 --> 00:32:22.899
that if I judge myself, that Tim's not gonna judge me.

00:32:22.919 --> 00:32:25.039
It means that I'm not concerned about Tim judging me.

00:32:25.039 --> 00:32:25.880
Why?

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.440
I've already judged myself.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.899
And by the way, if I come to a place where I'm saying,

00:32:29.899 --> 00:32:31.279
let a man examine himself,

00:32:31.279 --> 00:32:33.000
I've also stood before the Lord and said,

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.919
Lord, search me as the psalmist said,

00:32:34.919 --> 00:32:37.440
and show me if there'd be any wicked way.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.960
And all of a sudden, if I've been searched by God Almighty,

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.880
and I've had honestly and humbly sought the face of God

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.039
and examined myself,

00:32:45.039 --> 00:32:48.300
we will not be concerned about others judging us.

00:32:49.279 --> 00:32:53.679
But I find this evening with the deceptive nature of sin,

00:32:53.679 --> 00:32:58.639
that what happens is those often that are involved in sin

00:32:58.639 --> 00:33:00.720
are so quick to point out

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.179
and to judge the sin of other people.

00:33:03.179 --> 00:33:04.020
Why?

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.600
Because they're trying to keep the attention

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.000
off of themselves.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
And they're trying to point out the sin of these people

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.860
and those people and so on and so forth,

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.839
while they themselves are living sinful lives,

00:33:14.839 --> 00:33:17.000
but they're trying to deflect that attention.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:17.839
Why?

00:33:18.179 --> 00:33:19.619
Because they're deceived.

00:33:19.619 --> 00:33:20.860
I would say this, number two,

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:23.539
not only are we more likely to judge others than ourselves,

00:33:23.539 --> 00:33:24.380
but I would say this,

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.740
we're more likely to call for harsh judgment

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:29.899
on others for their sin,

00:33:29.899 --> 00:33:34.899
while ignoring or excusing our own sin.

00:33:35.059 --> 00:33:36.100
Let me say that again.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:39.179
We are more likely to call for harsh judgment

00:33:39.179 --> 00:33:41.380
on others for their sin,

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:45.559
while at the same time we ignore or excuse our sin.

00:33:45.559 --> 00:33:47.500
Notice in our text in Genesis 38,

00:33:48.199 --> 00:33:49.699
the Bible tells us in verse 24.

00:33:50.639 --> 00:33:52.279
In Genesis 38, verse 24, it says,

00:33:52.279 --> 00:33:54.919
and it came to pass about three months after

00:33:54.919 --> 00:33:56.080
that it was told Judah saying,

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.520
Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:02.740
and also behold, she is with child by whoredom.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.199
Judah, notice his response in verse 24,

00:34:05.199 --> 00:34:09.559
bring her forth and let her be burnt.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.919
That's harsh judgment.

00:34:15.279 --> 00:34:16.239
He was guilty.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.399
But he's calling for harsh judgment because of her sin,

00:34:22.279 --> 00:34:24.920
while at the same time ignoring his own sin.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.459
And it's very interesting what Tamar does.

00:34:29.459 --> 00:34:33.739
The Bible says that when she was brought forth in verse 25,

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:35.799
she sent to her father-in-law saying,

00:34:35.799 --> 00:34:40.799
by the man whose these are, am I with child?

00:34:42.279 --> 00:34:46.040
And she said, discern, I pray thee, whose are these?

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:49.760
The signet and bracelets and staff.

00:34:50.779 --> 00:34:51.700
Can you imagine?

00:34:53.559 --> 00:34:58.380
What happened when Judah and the brethren of Joseph

00:34:58.380 --> 00:34:59.579
went to Jacob?

00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:00.779
They said, this have we found,

00:35:00.779 --> 00:35:03.679
know now whether it be thy son's code or no.

00:35:04.619 --> 00:35:09.299
And here Tamar stands expecting

00:35:09.299 --> 00:35:12.899
because of the inappropriate relationship that took place

00:35:12.899 --> 00:35:15.019
is recorded in verses 15 through 18.

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:19.440
We find that Judah calls for her to be judged harshly,

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.640
to be burnt.

00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:28.079
And she says, by the man whose these are, am I with child?

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.000
Wow.

00:35:30.959 --> 00:35:33.239
Verse 26, that Judah acknowledged them and said,

00:35:33.239 --> 00:35:35.799
she had been more righteous than I.

00:35:35.799 --> 00:35:37.299
We read the verse a moment ago,

00:35:37.299 --> 00:35:39.239
because that I gave her not to Sheolah my son

00:35:39.239 --> 00:35:40.799
and he knew her again no more.

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:44.339
This evening, sin is deceptive.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:49.279
And we find, can I remind you of 2 Samuel 12 in verse five?

00:35:49.279 --> 00:35:50.720
Can I remind you of what David said?

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:54.959
Remember David in his sin with Bathsheba,

00:35:54.959 --> 00:35:59.959
we find that Nathan comes and stands before David

00:35:59.959 --> 00:36:01.540
and he tells him this story.

00:36:02.959 --> 00:36:05.519
David, after hearing the story the Bible tells us

00:36:05.519 --> 00:36:07.640
is recorded in 2 Samuel 12 in verse five,

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:11.440
and David's anger was greatly kindled against the man.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.140
He didn't know who he was angry with,

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:17.519
but he heard the story that Nathan said and he was angry.

00:36:17.519 --> 00:36:19.320
And the Bible says that he says to Nathan,

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.279
as the Lord liveth, the man that hath done this thing,

00:36:22.279 --> 00:36:25.700
notice what he says, shall surely die.

00:36:28.079 --> 00:36:31.200
David was in a position where he was calling

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.179
for harsh judgment, while at the same time,

00:36:33.179 --> 00:36:36.119
listen, he tried to cover his sin, did he not?

00:36:37.239 --> 00:36:40.239
The Bible says that Nathan in verse number six

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:44.980
stood before David and said, thou art the man.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.220
Can you imagine?

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:48.700
Listen, this evening when we think about

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:53.380
this subject matter of sin, if we're not careful,

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:57.779
we'll be engaged in some type of sinful behavior

00:36:57.779 --> 00:37:02.140
in our own lives, but we ignore it or excuse it

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:06.019
while we're judging others and looking at the sin of others

00:37:06.019 --> 00:37:08.739
and calling for harsh judgment upon those

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:14.320
that are living lives of sin, while we are seeking to hide,

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:19.320
ignore, justify, excuse, whatever term you wanna use.

00:37:20.359 --> 00:37:22.320
First John chapter one says this,

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.100
I mentioned it in Sunday school this morning,

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.600
in verse number eight and again in verse number 10,

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.820
that if we say that we have no sin,

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:35.440
number one in verse number eight, we deceive ourselves.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:40.019
In verse number 10, we make God a liar.

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.540
In verse number eight and verse number 10,

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:47.980
the Bible talks about that his truth or his word

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.859
is not in us, it's referenced both ways

00:37:49.859 --> 00:37:52.019
in verse eight and verse number 10.

00:37:52.019 --> 00:37:54.459
This evening, there's not one amongst us

00:37:54.459 --> 00:37:55.579
that's without sin.

00:37:58.579 --> 00:38:00.339
The question is, what do we do

00:38:00.799 --> 00:38:05.839
as God points out sin in our lives?

00:38:05.839 --> 00:38:07.679
You say, pastor, I'm not doing anything like that.

00:38:07.679 --> 00:38:11.359
I hope you're not, but can I tell you

00:38:11.359 --> 00:38:14.519
that we're dishonest with people, we lie to people,

00:38:14.519 --> 00:38:18.320
we have pride, we don't do the things

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.920
that we know that we're supposed to do.

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:23.679
Sin, sin, we gotta deal with it.

00:38:23.679 --> 00:38:25.779
We can't just excuse it and ignore it.

00:38:25.779 --> 00:38:30.119
We can't, listen, God cannot just overlook our sin.

00:38:30.899 --> 00:38:33.020
I'm thankful to be saved by the grace of God,

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:35.179
but I understand this evening that though I'm saved

00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:37.979
and I'm heaven bound, that sin in the life of a believer

00:38:37.979 --> 00:38:39.979
hinders our fellowship with God.

00:38:39.979 --> 00:38:43.219
It hinders our effectiveness for God.

00:38:43.219 --> 00:38:46.219
God doesn't use dirty vessels.

00:38:46.219 --> 00:38:47.299
Do we understand that this evening?

00:38:47.299 --> 00:38:51.979
He doesn't use dirty vessels, he uses clean vessels.

00:38:51.979 --> 00:38:55.500
And we have to constantly go back to that brazen altar,

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.580
if you will, or excuse me, to the laver, if you will.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:38:59.799
We gotta keep going back to the laver

00:38:59.799 --> 00:39:02.099
to be cleaned for service.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.320
And we find this evening that as we look

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.159
at this portion of scripture,

00:39:07.159 --> 00:39:10.000
that we see the deceptive nature of sin

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.960
and we can get so focused on what everybody else is doing

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.440
and just kind of, I'm not really that bad.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:24.280
Somebody said, not to me, it was recorded by another pastor,

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.840
but I wanna make sure I make that clear,

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.799
because what they said is, pastor,

00:39:27.799 --> 00:39:31.140
sin is different in the lives of believers.

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.580
The pastor said, yes, it's worse.

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:35.419
Why?

00:39:35.419 --> 00:39:38.700
Because we know, we have the Holy Spirit of God within us.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:40.700
Do you understand that lost people

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:42.859
can't help themselves but to sin?

00:39:44.059 --> 00:39:47.320
They're bound by sin, is what the Bible says.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.580
But we no longer are in bondage to sin.

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:53.880
We have been delivered, not only from the penalty of sin,

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.780
but from the very power of sin.

00:39:56.599 --> 00:39:57.799
And I'm so thankful for that.

00:39:57.799 --> 00:39:59.799
One day, we sang about it in the last.

00:39:59.799 --> 00:40:03.479
song that we sang this evening, there's a fountain. One day we're going to be delivered

00:40:03.479 --> 00:40:05.919
from the presence of sin. We're going to be with our Savior and there's going to be no

00:40:05.919 --> 00:40:13.119
more sin. Hallelujah. But until that day we've got to deal with sin in our lives. Every human

00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:18.359
being has a sin nature, number one. Number two, we find that you cannot control the consequences

00:40:18.359 --> 00:40:22.719
of your sin. Number three, you cannot hide your sin from God. Number four, sin is deceptive.

00:40:22.719 --> 00:40:31.499
Number five, our God is gracious. Our God is gracious. Listen, I'm so thankful for the

00:40:31.499 --> 00:40:37.619
truth of this fifth point, this fifth truth from this portion of Scripture this evening,

00:40:37.619 --> 00:40:44.299
that our God is gracious. Let me read to you Romans chapter number five, down through the

00:40:44.299 --> 00:40:50.379
end of that chapter and into the sixth chapter. In Romans 5 in verse number 20, down through

00:40:50.459 --> 00:40:56.419
verse number two of chapter six, Romans 520 through 6-2, the Bible says this,

00:40:56.419 --> 00:41:03.139
Moreover the law entered that the offense might abound. Notice what the Bible says,

00:41:03.139 --> 00:41:09.499
but where sin abounded. I would say in Genesis 38, sin abounded. The Bible says,

00:41:09.499 --> 00:41:17.059
Grace did much more abound. That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign

00:41:17.179 --> 00:41:22.019
through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord. Verse one of chapter six,

00:41:22.019 --> 00:41:28.059
what shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? Notice very pointedly in

00:41:28.059 --> 00:41:36.739
verse number two, God forbid. How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein? I'm

00:41:36.739 --> 00:41:43.459
thankful that I'm no longer a servant of sin. Notice in verse 17 of chapter six, it says,

00:41:43.459 --> 00:41:50.459
But God be thanked that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form

00:41:50.459 --> 00:41:55.419
of doctrine which was delivered to you. Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants

00:41:55.419 --> 00:42:02.099
of righteousness. I'd rather be a servant of righteousness than a servant of sin. And I'm

00:42:02.099 --> 00:42:07.099
thankful that our God is gracious. The reality that God is gracious, this reality that we see

00:42:07.099 --> 00:42:13.779
in this portion of scripture, does not promote sinful living. Understand this evening that the

00:42:13.779 --> 00:42:18.859
truth that our God is gracious and He's ready to pardon and ready to forgive, and that with thee

00:42:18.859 --> 00:42:24.659
as the psalmist is there is forgiveness, that reality with regard to who our God is, that does

00:42:24.659 --> 00:42:33.179
not promote sinful living amongst the people of God. It is far better, on so many levels,

00:42:33.219 --> 00:42:42.219
it is far better to not sin. But it certainly is a blessing to know that our God is gracious and

00:42:42.219 --> 00:42:49.939
that He's ready to pardon. That as He says in 1 John 1, 9, that if we confess our sins, He is

00:42:49.939 --> 00:42:55.379
faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. I wonder this evening,

00:42:55.379 --> 00:43:00.539
when's the last time we confessed our sins? You understand the word confess means to say the same

00:43:00.899 --> 00:43:08.619
thing, to agree with God. I would say this, it's not just a matter of God if I sin today, no, no,

00:43:08.619 --> 00:43:16.939
no, start over. It's not God if I sin today, would you forgive me? Because we know that we've sinned

00:43:16.939 --> 00:43:23.499
and it's coming clean with God and coming before God and saying, God, that thought, that action,

00:43:23.499 --> 00:43:32.219
that word, that fill-in-the-blank, that was sin. God, forgive me, cleanse me, help me to walk in

00:43:32.219 --> 00:43:36.219
the Spirit so that I would not fulfill the lust of the flesh. And so we find that our God is

00:43:36.219 --> 00:43:41.939
gracious, that's not an excuse, that does not promote sinful living. It's better, again, on so

00:43:41.939 --> 00:43:46.779
many levels that we live a life that's pure and holy. He said that we're to live holy, that we're

00:43:46.779 --> 00:43:51.539
to be holy in all manner of conversation, that we're to live a life of obedience to the Lord.

00:43:51.539 --> 00:43:56.859
But I'm so thankful that though we are saved, we have this flesh and I'm gonna sin and you're

00:43:56.859 --> 00:44:01.219
gonna sin, but we have a God who's gracious and he's merciful. You know why we understand that

00:44:01.219 --> 00:44:06.979
from this passage of Scripture? As you conclude Genesis chapter 38, you read about twins that are

00:44:06.979 --> 00:44:14.539
born. The Bible tells us that as she, Tamar, was with child, that it says in verse 27, it came to

00:44:14.539 --> 00:44:19.779
pass in the time of her travail that, behold, twins were in her womb. Notice in verse number 29,

00:44:19.779 --> 00:44:23.500
it says, and it came to pass as he drew back his hand that, behold, his brother came out. She said,

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:28.579
how hast thou broken forth this breach to be upon thee? Therefore, his name was called Phares. And

00:44:28.579 --> 00:44:33.419
afterward came out his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand and his name was called Zara.

00:44:33.419 --> 00:44:38.259
And you can read of that scarlet thread back in verse 28 to see what the midwife did with regard

00:44:38.259 --> 00:44:42.940
to tying that scarlet thread on. But I want you to see that these twins are born. You say, okay,

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:46.059
pastor, that's wonderful. But I want you to understand this evening when we think about the

00:44:46.059 --> 00:44:53.459
grace and mercy of God that Phares is listed in the genealogy of the Lord Jesus Christ. If you read

00:44:53.459 --> 00:45:00.859
in Matthew chapter 1 in verse number 3, you see this son of Judah that is in the line, the messianic

00:45:00.859 --> 00:45:09.579
line of our Savior. That's grace. That's grace. Remember that Hebrews 7 in verse number 14, as it's

00:45:09.579 --> 00:45:14.859
speaking about the priesthood of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, that we have a great high

00:45:14.899 --> 00:45:19.179
priest. Remember, he's not after the Aaronic priesthood. He's after a different priesthood,

00:45:19.179 --> 00:45:25.979
after the order of Melchizedek. And the Bible tells us that we know that he, Christ, came from

00:45:25.979 --> 00:45:36.220
the tribe of Judah. That's grace. That's grace. Listen again, I want to say this and I want to

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:42.500
make sure it's abundantly clear. The fact that our God is gracious, the fact that one of these twin

00:45:42.659 --> 00:45:48.859
boys is in the genealogy of the Lord Jesus Christ and that our Savior came from the tribe of Judah

00:45:48.859 --> 00:45:58.699
does not promote sinful living. It doesn't. And on so many levels, all of those other truths that

00:45:58.699 --> 00:46:03.339
we shared this evening from this portion of Scripture could cause us, should cause us to say,

00:46:03.339 --> 00:46:08.819
I don't want to sin. I understand I have the flesh and I'm still going to sin and so are you,

00:46:09.339 --> 00:46:15.899
but I look at sin and I say, I don't want to sin. We look at the cost, we understand what it cost

00:46:15.899 --> 00:46:20.419
our Savior and we understand how it forfeits and how it jeopardizes our walk with God,

00:46:20.419 --> 00:46:25.779
our fellowship with God. My relationship with God is consistent. I'm still his child. He's

00:46:25.779 --> 00:46:31.299
still my father. What a blessing. But don't you want the fellowship with your Savior to be sweet?

00:46:31.299 --> 00:46:40.579
The songwriter said, nothing between my soul and my Savior. We find that Paul says that he

00:46:40.579 --> 00:46:47.179
exercised himself to be, to have always a conscience that was pure before God and man.

00:46:47.179 --> 00:46:52.419
And this evening, we look at a portion of Scripture like Genesis 38, you say,

00:46:52.419 --> 00:46:56.500
pastor, some wicked things that were recorded in that passage of Scripture. Thanks be to God that

00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:02.339
he hasn't recorded your life and my life. As we look at these principles this evening,

00:47:02.339 --> 00:47:08.339
understand every human being has a sin nature. Understand and recognize this evening you cannot

00:47:08.339 --> 00:47:15.019
control the consequences of your sin. You just can't do it. Number three, you cannot hide your

00:47:15.019 --> 00:47:21.220
sin from God. He knows all about it. Number four, sin is deceptive. We get so busy looking at others,

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:24.099
look at what they're doing, look at what they're, we can do it with the world. We can look at what's

00:47:24.099 --> 00:47:28.299
going on in the headlines. Say, can you see what's going on in the world? While at the same time,

00:47:28.299 --> 00:47:38.139
we're ignoring our own sin. But God is gracious. Thank God. Thank God for his grace. Listen,

00:47:38.139 --> 00:47:42.739
you can come and just say, Lord, search me. If there be any wicked way in me, say,

00:47:42.739 --> 00:47:47.099
I don't even have to ask. I know God's already pointed things out in my life. Can I tell you

00:47:47.099 --> 00:47:56.699
this evening? Confess it and find forgiveness. God uses clean vessels. I want to be a vessel

00:47:56.699 --> 00:48:02.419
that's meat for the master's use. Let's pray. Father, we love you. Thank you for loving us.

00:48:02.419 --> 00:48:13.019
Lord, I pray this evening that in so many ways this message has been preventative. But God,

00:48:13.059 --> 00:48:23.579
I'm not so naive to believe that in a room of any size that there's unconfessed sin. God,

00:48:23.579 --> 00:48:28.899
I pray that in this moment of invitation, as we take just a few moments, I pray, Lord,

00:48:28.899 --> 00:48:34.739
that we do business with you, that we'd allow the Holy Spirit to have his will and way. God,

00:48:34.739 --> 00:48:46.219
we would come to you and seek your forgiveness. God, that we determine that we would flee

00:48:46.219 --> 00:48:52.820
youthful lust, as Paul speaks to Timothy about. God, that we determine in our lives that we're

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:56.700
going to walk in the Spirit so we would not fulfill the lust of the flesh. Maybe it's with

00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:00.619
some things that we need to change in our lives, some things we need to get rid of,

00:49:00.659 --> 00:49:06.019
some controls we need to put in place. I don't know what it might be. But God,

00:49:06.019 --> 00:49:10.820
I pray that your Spirit would work in the hearts of your people, that we do business

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:16.219
with you tonight. Lord, that we could leave and truly be able to sing that song,

00:49:16.219 --> 00:49:22.219
There's Nothing Between My Soul and My Savior. I thank you that you're a gracious, merciful God.

00:49:22.219 --> 00:49:29.140
I thank you that with thee there's forgiveness, that you are ready to pardon, ready to forgive.

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:34.099
I pray that you'd move and work in these moments as only you can. We'll thank you for what you'll

00:49:34.099 --> 00:49:37.659
do, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed,

00:49:37.659 --> 00:49:42.299
eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano. And as she does, the altar is open.
