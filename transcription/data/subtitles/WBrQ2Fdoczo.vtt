WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.199
We continue to make our way through this book, we'll be looking at the first nine verses

00:00:04.199 --> 00:00:05.199
this evening.

00:00:05.199 --> 00:00:10.760
Over the last couple of messages we've gone through chapter 26 and chapter 27 and both

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.680
of them in their entirety in single messages.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.399
And of course last week as we studied the 27th chapter of the book of Genesis we noted

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:24.559
the carnality and the deception and we of course as you go through the passage of Scripture

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:30.559
and see all that's taking place we ended in Genesis chapter 27 by dealing with the

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:37.959
subject matter of Rebekah of course speaking to Isaac with regard to Jacob being sent away.

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:44.240
She had heard how Esau said that he was going to kill his brother after he had buried his

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.840
father and so of course there's some drama that's going on there.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.159
As we enter into the 28th chapter we find that the Bible says this, that Isaac called

00:00:53.799 --> 00:01:00.400
The 27th chapter ends with Rebekah speaking to Isaac about this situation and about the

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:07.239
grief of heart that she would have if Jacob were to marry one from Canaan.

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:08.839
And so it tells us in verse number one that

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.559
thy mother's brother.

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:28.599
We'll look at the first nine verses this evening.

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:34.559
I've titled the message tonight there from verse number one, Isaac blessed him and charged

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:35.559
him.

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:39.519
As we look at this passage of Scripture of course we're mindful of the blessing that

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:44.760
was given in the 27th chapter and we read this with regard to Isaac blessing Jacob in

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.760
verses 28 and 29 and then of course Jacob departs and Esau enters and all that takes

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.760
place.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.000
And now as we come to Genesis chapter number 28 obviously there's an awareness as to all

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.080
that has just transpired in the life of this family and we find that the discussion took

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.919
place and Isaac agrees with the recommendation and he's going to give a blessing and a charge.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.600
And as we look at this passage of Scripture I want to note first of all in these first

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.199
few verses the instruction from Isaac.

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:18.880
Notice the instruction that is given.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.199
The Bible says that he blessed him and charged him but we note first of all the instruction

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:28.000
from Isaac with regard to marriage.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.360
In verses one, the end of verse number one and verse number two we see that there's information

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.000
given to us with regard to this instruction that is being given regarding marriage.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.600
Notice at the end of verse number one it says specifically who was prohibited, who was not

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.600
allowed.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.839
It says thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:55.720
Now you'll remember in our study a couple of weeks ago at the end of chapter number

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.559
26 the Bible told us in verse number 34 that Esau was 40 years old when he took to wife

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:07.720
Judith the daughter of Barai the Hittite and Bashamath the daughter of Elon the Hittite

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.960
and it tells us this which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.720
That situation really was something that was used by Rebekah when she says to Isaac

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.880
at verse number 46 in Genesis 27 she says to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.039
the daughters of Heth.

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:33.440
If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth such as these which are of the daughters of

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.600
the land what good shall my life do me?

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.100
And so we find that this instruction that is given from Isaac to Jacob begins first

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.419
of all with the subject matter of marriage.

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:51.059
He says you thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:57.059
He then says this in verse number 2, Arise go to Paddan Aram to the house of Bethuel

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:58.860
thy mother's father.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:06.339
Notice now who is permitted and take thee a wife from Fentz of the daughters of Laban

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:08.279
thy mother's brother.

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:15.479
So we find that this instruction is being provided from Isaac to Jacob and it's instruction

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:17.040
that is really necessary.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.480
I would say this with regard to the instruction that is given in the end of verse number 1

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.320
and verse number 2 that instruction regarding marriage is critical.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.359
It's absolutely critical and I believe that parents should purpose to properly instruct

00:04:32.359 --> 00:04:34.880
their children with regard to marriage.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.559
We believe that marriage is designed by God, right?

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:46.239
Marriage is God's plan and God has given instruction within his word with regard to marriage.

00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:51.079
It's not man's idea, it's not the government's idea, it's not their place to define what

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:55.040
marriage is or to give details with regard to how marriage works.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:01.079
We find that God in his precious book, the Bible, has given us the institution of marriage,

00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:02.839
the institution of the home.

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:09.059
He's given us the instruction with regard to the home and really apart from salvation,

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:15.059
the individual that your son or daughter is going to marry is probably the biggest decision

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:17.880
of their life.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.880
You think about that.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:25.000
Think about the weight of that decision of who your son or your daughter marries and

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.480
how important that decision is.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.880
It's not a decision that we enter into lightly.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.480
It's not a decision that we don't need counsel with regard to that decision.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:44.359
We need, parents need to recognize the importance of our counsel to our children with regard

00:05:44.359 --> 00:05:47.959
to this all-important decision.

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:49.899
We don't take marriage lightly.

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:54.320
We don't approach marriage the way that perhaps the world would approach marriage, that we're

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.640
just going to try it out, that we're just going to see how this works, that we could

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.200
always get a divorce if it doesn't work.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.399
That's not the mindset of a child of God.

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:04.399
Amen?

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:06.760
That's not how we approach it.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:16.559
And we approach it as it is, a sacred marriage that is designed by God Almighty.

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:22.880
And as I think about this instruction that is given, the reality is that this instruction

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.339
that's given doesn't mean that instruction is going to be followed, right?

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:33.160
We understand that we can give instruction and we can give the counsel to our children

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.359
with regard to marriage, but it doesn't mean that they're going to follow it.

00:06:37.359 --> 00:06:42.760
There should be some parameters by which godly parents are able to give instruction to their

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:49.000
children with regard to, as I've noted the two categories here, some that are prohibited

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.640
and some that are permitted.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.399
I'm not suggesting that we would have some type of an arranged marriage.

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:58.119
I'm not suggesting that we would do that sort of thing.

00:06:58.119 --> 00:07:03.760
But what I'm saying is that we need to give some counsel to our children.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.119
I was young when I got married.

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:09.239
I was 21 years old when I got married, and that's young.

00:07:09.239 --> 00:07:14.720
And I needed some counsel with regard to that decision and understanding that I was entering

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.040
into a lifelong commitment.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:25.519
Now 20 and a half years later, I'm thankful that Holly is still standing by my side, amen?

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:28.640
And I'm thankful for the counsel that I received.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.279
But now it's my responsibility, I have three children.

00:07:32.279 --> 00:07:35.200
Those of you that have children, to give that instruction.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:41.320
Begin praying now for your children with regard to that decision regarding marriage.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.440
How important this is.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.519
Perhaps how things might have been different, I understand that we cannot play the perhaps

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:53.600
game in scripture and try to use the hypotheticals, but perhaps if instruction had been properly

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.440
given to Esau, could it have changed the course of his decisions?

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.920
We don't know the answer to the question.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:06.799
Because we understand that instruction given doesn't mean instruction will be followed.

00:08:06.799 --> 00:08:10.640
But this instruction that is provided here is of utmost importance.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:16.519
I know that we've sat down with our children and we've gone through some things with regard

00:08:16.519 --> 00:08:22.239
to, hey listen, who's somebody that would be qualified to be able to marry?

00:08:22.239 --> 00:08:23.239
What is the criteria?

00:08:23.239 --> 00:08:26.679
There ought to be some criteria, amen?

00:08:26.679 --> 00:08:34.640
And listen, at the top of the list isn't, they're so beautiful, amen?

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.080
Because that's not the number one important thing.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.039
You know what the top of the list should be for a saved person?

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:45.099
That they're saved, amen?

00:08:45.099 --> 00:08:49.260
And then you begin to think about that truth of not being unequally yoked.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.380
It doesn't just mean saved and saved, though that's where it starts.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:09:00.739
But we ought to desire for our children to have a spouse who has a spiritual mind and

00:09:00.739 --> 00:09:05.859
a desire to serve God and live for God.

00:09:05.859 --> 00:09:11.099
We find that this instruction is given, why is it that in verse number two, he gives the

00:09:11.099 --> 00:09:13.739
instruction with regard to who was permitted.

00:09:13.739 --> 00:09:17.700
I believe that there's some insight given to us, obviously Rebecca had some influence,

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:23.460
but go back to Genesis chapter 25 if you will and look here, Genesis 24, excuse me, I want

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:27.380
you to look in Genesis chapter number 24.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:33.099
You'll be mindful of this passage of scripture, it records for us the marriage of Isaac.

00:09:33.099 --> 00:09:38.340
You'll remember that Abraham, he was concerned that Isaac properly marry.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:43.820
However, he says this in verse number three, and I will make thee swear by the Lord, the

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:49.299
God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of

00:09:49.299 --> 00:09:54.500
the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell, but thou shalt go unto my country

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.539
and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac.

00:09:57.539 --> 00:10:00.020
Man, doesn't that sound similar to what Isaac did?

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.740
Isaac is now saying about Jacob.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.920
And we find here that Abraham had given this instruction

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.260
to his servant, I believe it's Eleazar,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.760
and we give this instruction, but I want you to see,

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.100
and we studied this passage in great detail,

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:17.180
there was very specific prayer with regard to the one

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.780
that God would send, and we know that the servant

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.500
prayed specifically, and God answered specifically,

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.780
and the servant worshiped, and we find that in verse 48,

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.500
if you skip all the way over there,

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.160
it says that I bowed down my head and worshiped the Lord.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.100
At this point, he's there in the home,

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.340
he's speaking to Laban and Bethuel,

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.980
the father and brother of Rebekah,

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.460
and he says, I bowed down my head and worshiped the Lord

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.100
and blessed the Lord God of my master Abraham,

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.740
which had led me in the right way to take my master's

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.840
brother's daughter unto his son,

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.540
and now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master,

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.180
tell me, and if not, tell me, that I may turn

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.420
to the right hand or to the left.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.440
Now notice what it said, then Laban and Bethuel,

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.660
this is the brother and father of Rebekah,

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.540
they answered, notice what they say,

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.660
the thing proceedeth from the Lord.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.860
There was obviously some understanding that they had,

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.140
some influence that had been given to them,

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.900
because they understood as the servant of Abraham

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.540
rehearsed what he had experienced,

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:25.660
they respond by saying the thing proceedeth from the Lord,

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.340
we cannot speak unto thee bad or good,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.020
behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her and go,

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.580
and let her be thy master's son's wife

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.260
as the Lord hath spoken.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.100
And now as we come to chapter number 28,

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.100
we find that the Bible says that he,

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.100
Isaac is giving this instruction,

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.420
it says that he calls Jacob, he blessed him,

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.540
he charged him, and the charge, the instruction

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.620
is with regard to marriage at the end of verse number one,

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.140
and in verse number two.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.980
I would say this, parents understand the responsibility

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.820
of giving such instruction, pray for,

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.260
don't undervalue the importance of prayer,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.140
do not undervalue the impact of prayer.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.300
And I would say this to young people,

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.700
listen to your parents.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.020
I'm not saying that parents are always right,

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.820
maybe you're in a condition, a situation,

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.160
where maybe it's not maybe a why situation,

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.420
but the reality is if you have godly parents,

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.580
God-fearing parents, man, I'd put some weight

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.620
into the counsel of my parents, amen?

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:34.100
And I'd understand that my parents have some experience,

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.380
and they have some wisdom, and they have,

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.900
we understand this, God in his sovereignty

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.420
gave you the parents that he gave you, amen?

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.860
And we ought to rejoice in that and be thankful for that.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.680
Notice as this instruction continues,

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.740
really it's the blessing, notice in verse number three

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.060
and verse number four, the Bible says,

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.540
and God Almighty bless thee.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:03.460
Notice he says, and God Almighty bless thee.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.860
I'm so thankful that our God is a God

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.300
who blesses his people.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.580
You think about the blessings,

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.500
Jeff mentioned this morning where the psalmist says

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.820
that he daily loadeth me with benefits.

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.940
We speak about the blessings of the Lord.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.700
You find that later on in the Pentateuch

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.260
that Moses will stand before the people of God,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.420
and he will say that I lay before you today

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:27.780
a blessing and a curse.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.720
And we find that so often in the scriptures,

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.580
the blessing is tied directly to obedience.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.800
And as we obey the voice of God,

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.800
the blessing of God flows out.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.640
The songwriter said,

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.780
count your blessings, name them one by one.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.140
And you think about that exercise,

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:49.420
and you think about the benefit of rehearsing those benefits.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.740
And as we rehearse the blessings

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.020
and how we're encouraged,

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.100
and we then have the opportunity to encourage others.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.340
And Isaac says, and God Almighty bless thee

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.140
and make thee fruitful and multiply thee

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.120
that thou mayest be a multitude of people.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.740
Notice what he says in verse number four,

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.420
and give thee the blessing of Abraham.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.620
Now remember that God specifically blessed Abraham,

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.180
and God had given that blessing to Abraham,

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.300
and God blessed and told him about a land and a seed.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.980
And we've studied that for weeks and weeks

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.340
as you've looked through those portions

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:26.580
of the book of Genesis.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.940
And now we find that Isaac is now mentioning

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.820
and specifically tying the blessing

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.780
from God to Abraham to Jacob.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:39.620
It says this, to thee and to thy seed with thee

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.500
that thou mayest inherit the land

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.020
wherein thou art a stranger,

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:47.180
which God gave unto Abraham.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.940
And so you find now as we look at this blessing

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.100
that is regarded as the,

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:56.380
often we refer to as the Abrahamic covenant, right?

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.220
The seed and the land.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.140
And now Isaac is called Jacob.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.420
He's blessed him and he's charged him.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.820
He's given him instruction with regard to marriage.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.420
He's rehearsed the blessing.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.500
He's specifically invoking the blessing of Abraham upon him

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:16.220
with regard to the seed and also with regard to the land.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.300
And what a blessing to see this unfolding

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.780
as you continue to make your way

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.700
through the book of Genesis.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.420
We leave the instruction from Isaac

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.300
and we see number two this evening in verse number five,

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.620
number two, the departure of Jacob.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.940
We find the Bible tells us,

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.380
and Isaac sent away Jacob and he went to Paddan Aram,

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.660
unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian,

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:42.260
the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
And so we see that Jacob departed

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.220
just as he was instructed.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.460
And I wanna remind you as what we studied last week,

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.420
if you turn back, maybe it's on the same page for you,

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:55.100
but in Genesis 27, in verse number 43,

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.460
at this point, it's Rebekah speaking to Jacob.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.740
And Rebekah says, now, therefore, my son,

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.660
obey my voice and arise,

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.900
flee thou to Laban, my brother, to Haran,

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.700
and tarry with him a few days

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.260
until thy brother's fury turn away.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.300
She says this, until thy brother's anger

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.380
turn away from thee and he forget

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.180
that which thou hast done to him,

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.660
then I will send and fetch thee from thence.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.060
Why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.380
And so we find that initially when Rebekah had heard

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.820
about the response of Esau, his hatred,

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.900
and what he said with regard to the days of mourning

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.500
being at hand for the death of his father,

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.740
he said, then will I slay my brother Jacob

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.340
at the end of verse number 41.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.900
And Rebekah's seeking to provide some level of safety

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.660
for her son, Jacob, and as she's seeking

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.820
to provide this safety from Jacob,

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:53.340
she says this, flee thou to Laban, my brother, to Haran.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.220
At this particular moment in verse number 43,

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.220
she's really not thinking about a spouse for Jacob,

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.880
she's simply thinking about safety for Jacob.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.780
We find that she invokes and speaks about the spouse

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.700
in verse number 46, and thus gets Isaac on board

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.340
to give the instruction that we've just rehearsed

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.780
at the beginning of Genesis chapter 28.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.420
But I want you to notice that safety

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.840
is what she's thinking of in verse number 43.

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.460
She's also thinking this is going to be

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.300
a very temporary situation.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.180
She says in verse number 43, verse number 44, excuse me,

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.620
for a few days, a few days.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.660
And then she says in verse number 45

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.900
that when your brother's anger turn away from thee

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.200
and he forgets what you've done,

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.300
then I'm gonna send and fetch you that you'll return.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.020
Now we understand as you read the next several chapters

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:44.580
of the book of Genesis, this departure that is recorded

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.900
for us in verse number five, the next several chapters

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.420
are going to record for us the events

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:55.300
in the days and years ahead in the life of Jacob.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.020
These several chapters provide us

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.380
with a record of these events,

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.800
and we know based on the scriptures

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.500
that these few days that were spoken of by Rebekah

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.260
in fact turn into many years.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:09.940
In Genesis chapter number 31,

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.860
if you skip over just a few chapters,

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:15.460
and we made note of this very briefly last Sunday evening,

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.320
but you notice in verse number 38

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.540
when he's having this discussion before he is leaving,

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.660
it says here this 20 years have I been with thee,

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.580
thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.780
and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:31.800
Who's he speaking to?

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.059
Well, in verse number 36, it says that Jacob was wroth

00:18:35.059 --> 00:18:38.140
and chode with Laban, right?

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.260
So we see that this is the context,

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:45.780
and he says this 20 years have I been with thee.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.900
And so the instruction at the end of verse number 27

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:53.020
was to go for a few days for the purpose of that safety,

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.460
and we find that that few days turned into years,

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.220
and we have the next several chapters

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.020
to read of those events that take place.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.540
I made note of this last week.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.980
It's worth repeating that at this time of departure

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.940
when the Bible says that Isaac sent away Jacob,

00:19:08.739 --> 00:19:10.340
that this would be the last day on this earth

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.500
that Jacob would ever see Rebecca.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.200
And she said in verse number 14, 13 it was,

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.980
of Genesis chapter 27, upon me be thy curse,

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.160
my son, only obey my voice and go and fetch me them.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:29.440
And what a sad situation, a sad response

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.900
of this really carnality and deception

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.540
of Genesis chapter 27.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.720
But we now find that Isaac sent away Jacob,

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.720
and he went to where he was supposed to go.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.480
Remember he told him in verse number two,

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.280
arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Bethuel,

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.200
thy mother's father, and take thee a wife from thence

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.480
of the daughters of Laban.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.119
And it tells us in verse number five

00:19:49.119 --> 00:19:52.520
that he went to Paddan Aram unto Laban,

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.760
son of Bethuel, the Syrian, the brother of Rebecca,

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.440
Jacob's and Esau's mother.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.920
And so I'm thankful that as we look

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.000
at what's taking place here,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.800
that there's a level of obedience.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:06.840
obedience on the side of Jacob and going to the place in which he was instructed to go.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:11.400
And we read, and again, the next several chapters, we're going to read and study of all of the

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.920
events that transpired during his journey, and then, of course, while he's there with

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:21.680
Laban and not only his wives, but also the children that God blesses him with, and we'll

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.800
study those things over the next several chapters.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:30.680
The next several chapters, in fact, focus very much predominantly in the life of Jacob.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:35.440
Notice in verse number six down through verse number nine of our text of Scripture, number

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.920
three, the response of Esau.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.720
So we've seen the instruction of Isaac, we've seen the departure of Jacob, and now note

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.360
the response of Esau.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.240
It's interesting to me because as you look at this passage of Scripture and you find

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:55.160
in verse number one, the Bible says that Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and charged him.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.580
Obviously, Rebekah and Isaac had had the conversation.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:05.920
The last time we saw Esau, at the end of chapter number 27, he was very disappointed,

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.260
very angry.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:13.060
The Bible tells us that he hated Jacob because of the blessing, and he was very distraught

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.980
over what had taken place.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:20.340
But as we read verses six through nine, here in Genesis chapter number 28, we find that

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.380
Esau is very aware of what's taking place.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:28.560
Esau is very aware of what's taking place and what has transpired.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:34.920
Notice the Bible says in verse number six, when Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:41.800
and sent him away to Paddan Aram to take him a wife from Thense, and that as he blessed

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:50.160
him, he gave him a charge saying, thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.360
So Esau was aware of what happened.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.680
Esau was aware of this blessing and this charge.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.720
What was it that Esau desired so much?

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.040
He desired a blessing, right?

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:07.240
Remember, when Esau entered in Genesis chapter number 27, it tells us that he came back from

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:12.680
hunting in verse number 31, that he made that savory meat.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.580
And his father in verse number 32 said, who art thou?

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:21.000
And it says in verse number 33 that Isaac trembled very exceedingly and said, who?

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.520
Where is he that hath taken venison and brought it me?

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:29.240
And I have eaten of all before thou camest and have blessed him, yea, and he shall be

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.240
blessed.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:35.280
And we find that Esau says to his father in verse number 38, hast thou but one blessing,

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.800
O father?

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.920
Bless me, even me also, O my father.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.420
And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.800
He wanted the blessing.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.260
He wanted to have a blessing from his father.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:54.020
Of course, we understand that the blessing that is mentioned that Isaac his father answered

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:58.620
and said unto him, behold, in verse 39, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:04.100
and the dew of heaven from above by thy sword shalt thou live and shalt serve thy brother.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:08.700
It shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion that thou shalt break his yoke

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.140
from off thy neck.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:16.420
And we mentioned of the turmoil between the descendants of Jacob and the descendants of

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.420
Esau.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:23.660
As you read throughout the Old Testament, you see such a conflict between the descendants

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.660
of Jacob.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.660
Who are they?

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:26.660
The children of Israel.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.660
The descendants of Esau.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:28.660
Who are they?

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:29.660
The Edomites.

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.820
And you read about the conflict between the Edomites and about the children of Israel

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.740
and you find that it was there according to verse number 40 when it says it shall come

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:42.540
to pass when thou shalt have the dominion that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:43.540
neck.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.940
Now, that did not happen during the reign of Jehoram.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:51.420
According to 2 Kings chapter number 8, we looked at that briefly last week, but we find

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:55.180
that Esau was desiring a blessing.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:24:00.420
And we find that when he observes what's taking place, he's aware of what's happened.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:03.140
He's heard the charge that was received.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:08.420
You notice specifically that it tells us in verse number 6 and that it says that when

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:17.640
Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, sent him away to Paddan Aram to take him away from

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:23.640
fence and that as he blessed him, he gave him a charge saying, thou shalt not take a

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.940
wife of the daughters of Canaan.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:31.940
I'd say this, Esau was paying attention, wasn't he?

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.300
I mean, he saw what had taken place.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:38.940
He was observing and he was attentive to what was transpiring.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:43.980
And the Bible tells us that not only did he see and was he aware of what had happened,

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:48.540
but in verse number 7, he then observes the obedience of his brother Jacob.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:53.940
The Bible says that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother and was gone to Paddan Aram

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:58.100
and Esau saw that.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:02.300
So now I believe that as you look at these next few verses of Scripture, that in the

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:08.500
mind of Esau, again, not a ton of information given to us, but it seems like the response

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:15.420
of Esau is based upon what he has seen, what he has observed, and how he might be able

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.780
to receive some type of a blessing.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:24.940
He sees the obedience of Jacob, his brother, and he understands that his choice in marriage

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:29.260
did not please his parents, Isaac specifically.

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:36.460
It says in verse number 8, and Esau, seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac,

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:37.460
his father.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:42.580
Now I want you to just pause there for a moment because we find again that the Bible tells

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:49.300
us at the end of chapter number 26 that Esau was 40 years old when he took these two to

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.540
be his wives.

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.340
We find that the marriage is there.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:57.680
These both are hit tights according to verse number 34 of Genesis 26.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:03.160
The Bible tells us that they were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah, and we

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:11.960
find that here as Esau heard that Jacob was told, thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:12.960
of Canaan.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:17.600
Okay, well, I have two wives of the daughters of Canaan, right?

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.700
Esau's in that situation.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:25.400
So he's aware of the fact, he has heard the instruction, he's aware of the fact that these

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:31.840
daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac, his father.

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.280
So now what is he going to do?

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:41.640
The Bible tells us in verse number 9 that he responds, and he went, it says, then went

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:50.680
Esau unto Ishmael and took unto the wives which he had, Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael,

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:57.320
Abraham's son, the sister of Nebuchadnezzar, to be his wife.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.200
So now he takes another wife, right?

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:05.020
So he has two hit tights that are his wives according to the end of Genesis 26.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:12.280
Now in response to what he's heard, in response to that which has been communicated from Isaac

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:16.720
to Jacob, he's going to go out and make another decision.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:25.020
It seems as if, in his own mind, he has this idea that somehow this is going to bring some

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.720
kind of good graces in his life.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.960
Why do we think that, or why would I say that?

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:35.360
Well, the interesting thing is that he does not go and take another hit tight to be his

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.360
wife.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:41.240
I want you to think about this just for a moment, and really this is, as we look at

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:46.040
what's happening, and I'm just trying to dissect this for us this evening, to understand that

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:52.160
there are times in which we can use some bad logic and some bad reasoning, and we are

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:57.340
trusting in our own selves instead of trusting the Lord, and I think Esau here is certainly

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.800
doing that.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:03.240
The Bible tells us that he went, it says he went unto Ishmael.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.960
Now who is Laban?

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:10.320
Laban is where Jacob has been sent to find a wife, right?

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:14.960
He says, here's who's prohibited, thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:20.680
in verse number 1, here's who's permitted, and go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Bethuel,

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:27.040
thy mother's father, and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban, thy

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.100
mother's brother.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.100
So who is Laban?

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:33.080
Well, that's the maternal uncle, right?

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.520
That's who that is.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.840
Who's Ishmael?

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:40.760
He's the paternal uncle, right?

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:46.280
Because Ishmael and Isaac are both the descendants of Abraham, right?

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:51.680
And so we find, again, I believe it's very poor logic, but I'm trying to get into the

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:56.280
mind of Esau as to why he's responding the way that he is.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:02.360
I believe that he's trying in his own way to try to figure out how I can get some kind

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.360
of a blessing.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:10.320
And if the maternal uncle's daughters are going to be satisfactory and that's going

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:17.500
to please Isaac and Rebekah for Jacob, then maybe if I go to Ishmael and get a daughter

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:22.540
from Ishmael, that too will result in some kind of a blessing.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:26.920
Now that's just all my kind of trying to figure out what Esau's doing.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:31.940
If you have a different thought, it's okay that we disagree on that, and I'm not even

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.780
saying that's exactly what he's doing.

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:37.060
It could just be that he's saying, I don't care, I'm already out of graces, I'm just

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.060
going to go get another wife.

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:46.820
But it seems as if as much as he wants a blessing, as much as he knows what has happened and

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:53.380
how Jacob has been instructed and he heard and he observed, it seems as if there's something

00:29:53.380 --> 00:30:00.220
within Esau that in his own way he's trying to somehow get back into the graces so that

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:04.420
He's going about it all the wrong way.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:13.500
And we find here that he takes now this daughter of Ishmael, Mahalath, as you see there in

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.940
verse number 9.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.300
And I want you to think about this.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:21.420
We've often mentioned about some of these just people groups throughout the book of

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:28.980
Genesis and some of the long-term conflict between the children of Israel and other people

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:29.980
groups.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:35.460
You think about the Canaanites, the Hittites, of course you're familiar with the Philistines.

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.180
And we mentioned that as we studied the 27th chapter.

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:41.860
Remember the Philistines envied him and all that had taken place.

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:47.460
You think about the conflicts with the Egyptians that you find throughout the Old Testament.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:53.500
And there's much conflict there between the children of Israel and the children of Esau,

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.540
the Edomites.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:31:00.460
But then now there's this intermarriage, if you will, where Esau is taking a descendant

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:02.300
of Ishmael.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.740
And it just gets real muddy.

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:11.620
And the reality is that here, as we've mentioned in many times over the last couple of chapters,

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:18.380
it seems as if Esau really has no spiritual desires whatsoever.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:24.820
The Bible told us, as we looked in Genesis chapter number 25, when you looked at all

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:31.560
that was going on with regard to the marriage of Isaac and Rebekah, that the Bible told

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:35.020
us that Rebekah was barren.

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:38.660
The Bible told us that they, Isaac and Rebekah, entreated the Lord.

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:43.100
They sought God with regard to their barrenness and not having children.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:49.820
And the Bible tells us that she conceived in Genesis chapter 25 and verse number 21.

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:53.780
And then the Bible rehearses for us a struggle within the womb.

00:31:53.780 --> 00:32:00.180
And she inquires of the Lord, and God told her that two nations are in thy womb, and

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:04.960
two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels, and the one people shall be stronger

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.860
than the other people, and the elder shall serve the younger.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:13.060
And of course, we find that the Bible tells us that the first one came out red all over

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:17.740
in hairy garment, like in hairy garment, excuse me, and they called his name Esau in verse

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.300
number 25.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:26.580
And as we begin to understand all that has transpired in really considering that symbolism

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:32.500
that was given to us in Genesis chapter number 25, we noted that there was some supplication,

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.460
there was a struggle, and then there was some symbolism.

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:38.100
And we spoke about the two nations.

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:42.740
And we understand, Romans 9 talks about it, and you can study the Scriptures and you can

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:51.180
see the selection of a nation contextually, that's what God's dealing with, the Israelites

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:57.420
and God's plan for the nation of Israel, and the older shall serve the younger.

00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:58.420
We looked at that.

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:05.020
But then we also mentioned not only the contextual symbolism and understanding the interpretation,

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:11.060
but we mentioned the two natures, the application, really, of what we looked at in verse number

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:15.060
23 of Genesis chapter number 25.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:19.140
And when I mentioned those two natures and we spoke about the application, we really

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:22.780
talked about the old man versus the new man.

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:28.500
And we said this, that the older shall serve the younger.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:35.140
And it really goes in line with what we discussed this morning with the reality of this loving

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:40.500
not the world and understanding that we walked according to the course of this world.

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:44.820
And what's older, the old man or the new man?

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.100
The old man, right?

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:51.940
And you were saved after you were born, years later.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:57.540
And we find that as we would walk in the Spirit so that we would not fulfill the lust of the

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:03.780
flesh, as we would take the truth of God's Word and we would apply it in our hearts and

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:10.860
lives that we can be in a position where we are pleasing the Lord with the decisions that

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:11.860
we make.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.660
I was going to turn to the Galatians, but let me just get back to Genesis and we'll

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:15.980
finish up there.

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:19.980
Notice in Genesis chapter number 28, again, the passage that we're dealing with, I want

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:27.380
you to consider with me the situation as it unfolds in this idea of pleasing and thinking

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:34.380
about the natures here, the behavior of Jacob, the behavior of Esau, and understanding if

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:39.620
we can take from this passage and we can see what's happening, yes, the historical context,

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:42.620
but say, okay, why is God giving us this information?

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:43.940
Why is it here?

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:47.860
God's speaking about the charge and the blessing.

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:52.340
And then we see there are several verses that are given to us with regard to the response

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:57.140
of Esau and how he handled things.

00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:01.100
You can't manufacture God's blessing in your life.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:08.500
You can try, but you can't manufacture God's blessing in your life.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:15.620
We must purpose to live our lives pleasing to God in obedience.

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:19.660
How was Jacob going to receive the blessing?

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:21.820
We see the obedience.

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.560
He was blessed and he was charged.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:31.320
We understand the nature of the Abrahamic covenant, as it's mentioned here, and really

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:36.060
given in verses three and four, invoked by Isaac upon Jacob.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:43.160
But I would say this, the obedience of Jacob is essential to his response to his father

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.720
with regard to the instruction that has been given.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:51.720
And he responds, according to verse number five, in obedience and going to that place.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.840
And I want you to think about this.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:58.720
Jacob went to a place where he didn't know where he was going.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:05.160
We understand that the Bible tells us, as we will study next week in verses 10 and following,

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:10.200
and you'll see the encounter and the dream that he has and the way in which God speaks

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.200
to him.

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.920
And what a blessing.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:19.720
But you understand that he had to take the instruction that was given to him by his father

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.440
and respond in obedience.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:26.720
The blessing of God cannot be manufactured in your life.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.440
It can't be manufactured in my life.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:35.080
And as Esau would hear what has taken place, as Esau would process it in his own mind in

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:42.720
being the old man and thinking about the approach of maybe that type of thinking, and he says,

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.120
okay, well, here's what I'm going to do.

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.120
I'm going to do this.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.680
I'm going to try to manufacture this blessing.

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.760
It can't happen.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:51.480
You're not going to manufacture God's blessing in your life.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:56.320
The blessing of the Lord is precious.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:00.720
And there are times in which perhaps in our lives that we can go through life and try

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:07.040
to pretend as if we have God's blessing, pretend as if we have God's favor, we've learned how

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.860
to put things together.

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:14.920
You understand that if you look, and we don't have time to look at it, but it's really interesting

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:21.240
the way that Solomon had those golden shields and Rehoboam put brass.

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:25.920
The reality is that we find that it's a cheap imitation.

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:34.200
Oh, on the outside it looks like it's the same, but it's not the same.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:37.040
And we want God's blessing in our life.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:41.400
Do we understand as we look at a passage of Scripture like this and look at the historical

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.400
context?

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.000
And it's certainly important to understand that.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.080
But as we begin to think about our own lives and say, well, I want God's blessing in my

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:56.600
life, yes, we see the instruction with regard to marriage, but let's just make it real broad

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.600
tonight.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.260
I want God's blessing, period.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:02.640
I want God's blessing in my life.

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:06.720
I want to please my God.

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.320
And how can I please Him?

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:15.160
How can I behave in such a way that He would be pleased and He would be, that I would be

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.040
in a position where I could be blessable?

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:22.500
I want you to think about that just for a moment in closing tonight.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:27.200
I believe tonight that God wants to bless His people, don't you?

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.360
God wants to bless His people.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.800
But I want to ask myself this question I want you to ask.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.880
I'm inviting you to ask yourself the question as well.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.880
Am I blessable?

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.280
What do I mean by that?

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:41.000
I understand the Bible says, the goodness of God leadeth thee to the repentance.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.500
I understand that.

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.920
But let me just use a quick illustration.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:54.640
As we think about the human relationships between parents and children, parents, I want

00:38:54.640 --> 00:39:02.200
to bless my children, but there's sometimes that their behavior doesn't permit the blessing.

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.440
Does that make sense?

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:08.520
You want to be gracious to them, and you want to bless them, and you want to…

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:11.720
Has there been a time in your family's life, maybe you can think about when you were a

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:15.400
child where you missed out on some kind of blessing from your parents because of your

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.680
behavior or maybe even because of the behavior of a sibling?

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.320
You say, man, we lost out.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.720
We missed out on that.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:28.840
And obviously only two of my children are here, and Julianna's down in college.

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.560
But Holly and I, we've desired, we want to bless our children.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:37.000
We want to bestow blessings on them as we can.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:50.240
But there are times, very few times, that maybe their behavior prevents a blessing.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.360
We understand that humanly speaking, do we not?

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:56.480
I want you to think about it spiritually.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:59.000
God is able to bless us abundantly.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000
Let me say this.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:00.000


00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.880
blessed us abundantly. He has been so good to us, but I want you to think about

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:12.320
the blessings that He has in store for us and ask ourselves the question, am I

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:20.600
living a life that is blessable? Is God going to see fit to bless my life? Am I

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:26.440
living in obedience to Him? Am I trusting Him? Am I following Him? Am I living

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:35.000
pleasing in His life? Because our God is able to bless us abundantly. Again, He has

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:41.520
blessed us beyond measure, but I wonder, are there some blessings that maybe I

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:48.920
have forfeited because of my disobedience? Are there some blessings?

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:54.400
I'm asking myself, but I'm inviting you to ask yourself. Are there some blessings

00:40:54.440 --> 00:41:01.560
that I have forfeited from the hand of my good God because of my disobedience? I

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:07.480
think tonight if we'd all be honest, we'd say yes. There's some times in our lives

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:12.200
that we've not been obedient to God and perhaps we've missed out on a blessing

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:18.080
from God. I want to live in such a way that I am blessed and I am blessable. I

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:26.240
can't manufacture God's blessing. I can try. You can try, but a manufactured

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:34.120
blessing pales in comparison to the real thing. Amen? And I want God's blessing

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:38.320
upon my life and I hope that you want it. I know that you do. You want God's

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:42.960
blessing on your life. And so we must live lives that are blessable, that are

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:49.200
pleasing to the Lord. Let's pray. Father, we love you. Thank you for loving us. As

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.920
we think about the passage, we understand the historical context and all that's

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:58.040
transpired. I thank you for the obedience of Jacob and responding to the

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:03.160
instruction that's been given. And as we study the next several chapters and see

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:08.160
all that has transpired in his life and your blessing, we know that he's not

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:14.600
perfect and obviously there's plenty of problems that we've already pointed out

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:19.200
in the life of Jacob, but in this instant we find that he responded in obedience.

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:28.200
He departed as he was instructed to. Lord, I see the response of Esau and how

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:35.120
sometimes we can maybe try to manufacture a blessing. And God, I pray

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:39.360
that you'd help us to look at this passage and not only understand the

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:45.360
historical context, but desire and purpose to live lives that are pleasing

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:53.780
in your sight. That we'd be living and behaving in a manner in which is

00:42:53.780 --> 00:43:07.300
blessable by you. We thank you that you are so good to us. God, I pray that you'd

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:11.740
move and work as only you can. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:15.580
with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. We're gonna have just a brief moment of

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:19.780
invitation this evening, give you an opportunity. Maybe you want to come and

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:24.220
thank God for his blessings. Maybe you want to come and ask God to help you to

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:30.540
live a life that is pleasing in his sight, that you would be blessable. God, I don't

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:34.780
want to forfeit any blessings in my life. I don't want to try to manufacture

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:40.540
blessings in my life. I want to live in obedience to your revealed will. As

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:42.420
Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
