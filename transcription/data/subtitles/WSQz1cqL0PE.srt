1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
in this wonderful book, the book of Genesis.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,519
50 chapters, and it's been a long time.

3
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:10,399
This is message number 103.

4
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:14,319
I mentioned that during the morning service today.

5
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:17,559
103 messages through this book,

6
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,520
and some of them were multiple part messages

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,399
based upon just the content of what we were dealing with.

8
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:29,079
But of course, as we've mentioned throughout the study,

9
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,240
the series over these number of years,

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,599
that the book of Genesis is so foundational.

11
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:37,159
It is so important.

12
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:39,279
We find that in our world today,

13
00:00:39,279 --> 00:00:43,119
that really the content of the first 11 chapters

14
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,720
of the book of Genesis is regularly under attack.

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,919
And it's regularly under attack

16
00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:52,360
because if the enemy can cause the individual

17
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,060
to doubt the record of Genesis one through 11,

18
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,240
then the reality is that the enemy

19
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,139
can get anybody to doubt any portion of God's word.

20
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,779
If he is not the creator,

21
00:01:06,779 --> 00:01:09,139
then how do we know he's really the redeemer?

22
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:13,260
And really, that's the path that they go down

23
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,059
in trying to cause doubt and uncertainty

24
00:01:17,059 --> 00:01:18,620
with the Genesis record.

25
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,900
I'm thankful that the creator God gave us

26
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,540
this wonderful book of beginnings,

27
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,919
and it begins in the beginning God.

28
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:30,099
What a wonderful book, what a wonderful content.

29
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:33,459
And then of course now we end with the life of Joseph.

30
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:37,180
I've titled the message, So Joseph Died.

31
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,699
And as we begin to look at this passage of scripture,

32
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,660
the Bible tells us in verse 22,

33
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,720
and Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father's house,

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,660
and Joseph lived in 110 years.

35
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,660
And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation.

36
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,360
The children also of Mekir, the son of Manasseh,

37
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,480
were brought up upon Joseph's knees.

38
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,959
And Joseph said unto his brethren,

39
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,279
I die, and God will surely visit you

40
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:10,000
and bring you out of this land,

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,639
and to the land which he swore to Abraham,

42
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,399
to Isaac, and to Jacob.

43
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,679
And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel,

44
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:22,399
saying, God will surely visit you,

45
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:25,940
and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.

46
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,320
So Joseph died, being 110 years old.

47
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,320
They embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

48
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,699
I wanna remind you if you wanna take and turn over quickly,

49
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:43,380
but you don't need to, but in Psalm 116,

50
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,979
God gives us a precious verse of scripture.

51
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:50,740
In Psalm 116, it's a verse that we often will turn to

52
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,899
at the time of a loved one that departs,

53
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:55,500
enters into eternity.

54
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,300
The Bible says in Psalm 116, in verse number 15,

55
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,960
precious in the sight of the Lord

56
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,839
is the death of his saints.

57
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:09,600
Precious in the sight of the Lord

58
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,800
is the death of his saints.

59
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,440
As we begin to think about this portion of scripture

60
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,820
and ending the book of Genesis,

61
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,500
we find that for the majority of the last 13 chapters

62
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,679
of the book of Genesis,

63
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:25,119
we have traced the steps of the life of Joseph.

64
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:27,179
He comes on the scene in chapter 37.

65
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:31,440
We're introduced to this exemplary Bible character.

66
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,759
He's 17 years old in Genesis chapter 37

67
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,720
when he comes on the scene.

68
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,440
We find that the Bible would record for us

69
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,160
many aspects of his life,

70
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,000
and as we come here to Genesis chapter number 50,

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,399
we're told that Joseph is 110 years old.

72
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:50,699
It's very interesting because the text of scripture

73
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:53,220
that I read to you beginning in verse 22 this evening

74
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,639
and through the end of the chapter,

75
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,460
really this portion of scripture

76
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,759
covers about 53 or 54 years of Joseph's life.

77
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:04,940
Joseph's dad died, Jacob.

78
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,339
We read of that and we studied that

79
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:09,660
the last couple of messages in the end of chapter 49

80
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,559
and the beginning of chapter number 50,

81
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:14,699
but we find that from the death of Jacob

82
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:16,779
until the death of Joseph,

83
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:19,880
it's about 54 years that passes,

84
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,920
and we find that there's really not much

85
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,079
that's given to us with regard to the life of Joseph

86
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,000
during those 54 years.

87
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,160
But I think about the content that is given to us

88
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,179
with the life of Joseph.

89
00:04:34,179 --> 00:04:35,920
As we begin to think about his life

90
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,959
and we begin to think about the example that he is,

91
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,339
and of course, many of you know,

92
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:41,500
I've said it over the years,

93
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,600
that Joseph is my favorite Bible character,

94
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:47,540
and thus, when God blessed us with a son,

95
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,279
we named him Joseph,

96
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,459
and the reality is that when you study the life of Joseph,

97
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,859
it's an amazing account,

98
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:57,959
a record that God gives us of a life that is well-lived,

99
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,660
a life that is exemplary,

100
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,640
a life that is marked by several things.

101
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,220
In fact, we're gonna look at those things this evening.

102
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,700
It is a life that as you look at the record

103
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,820
that God provides,

104
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,299
there's really no sin that's mentioned.

105
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:13,399
It doesn't mean that Joseph was sinless,

106
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,700
it's just not recorded for us.

107
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,700
There are many Bible characters that you can go to

108
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,059
and you can study their lives

109
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:22,380
and you can see the content of the life that's recorded

110
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,380
and the blessings and the great triumphs in their life,

111
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,980
but then also troubles and difficulties and sin

112
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,820
and what have you,

113
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,739
but here in the life of Joseph,

114
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:36,339
though many difficulties are recorded,

115
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:39,380
we don't read of any sin in the life of Joseph.

116
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,540
He was a man that walked with God.

117
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:44,279
He was a man, I believe, that pleased God.

118
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,079
He was a man that lived a life

119
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,079
that had no doubt a major impact

120
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,079
amongst those that he came in contact with.

121
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,679
I wonder this evening as we,

122
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:59,239
even at the very beginning of the message tonight,

123
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:02,440
we're gonna look at four things about the life of Joseph.

124
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,320
I wonder this evening if my life,

125
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,320
if your life had this kind of record provided

126
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:13,579
and for generations of people to be able to examine

127
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:17,059
and to read your life story,

128
00:06:17,059 --> 00:06:19,260
what would people walk away with?

129
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,619
What would they summarize?

130
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:23,459
How would they summarize your life

131
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:26,339
if they were to read as we have the opportunity

132
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:28,980
to read of the life of Joseph

133
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,380
as it's recorded for us by God in his precious word?

134
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,660
What is it that we summarize?

135
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,940
How is it that we conclude?

136
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,100
What is it that we learn?

137
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,339
And I wonder tonight if our lives

138
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,959
were under the microscope in that fashion,

139
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,000
what would people say of you?

140
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,920
What would people say of me?

141
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,720
I have four thoughts for you this evening

142
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,839
that I hope would be a blessing,

143
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:51,200
things that mark the life of Joseph.

144
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,480
And as we look at his life

145
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,519
and we find that we come here to the end

146
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:58,959
and we see his death recorded for us,

147
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,600
I'd like to say this, number one,

148
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,160
that Joseph's life was a life marked by obedience.

149
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,299
His life was a life marked by obedience.

150
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:14,299
By the way, God expects obedience from his children.

151
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:16,940
Not only does God expect obedience,

152
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,940
but I would say it this way, God deserves obedience, amen?

153
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,140
It is appropriate for our God to expect

154
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,100
that we as his people would obey him.

155
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,100
It's a honorable thing for us as the people of God

156
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,600
to take the truth that God has given to us

157
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,920
and to live it, to obey it, to practice what God says,

158
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,239
to be doers of the word and not hearers only.

159
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:47,480
When I think about this life

160
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,279
being a life marked by obedience,

161
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,959
I would say first and foremost

162
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,359
that Joseph learned to obey God.

163
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:56,239
He learned to obey God.

164
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:59,559
By the way, that's the most important thing

165
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:02,880
that any of us could learn is learning to obey God.

166
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,619
That we just determine we're gonna obey God,

167
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,980
that we're not gonna live a life of rebellion,

168
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,799
we're not gonna live a life in distance

169
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:13,779
from what God has said for us to do,

170
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:16,459
that we're simply going to live a life of obedience,

171
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:19,540
that we're gonna determine that with God's help

172
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,459
and by God's grace, we're going to obey.

173
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:25,660
You know, it's very interesting, all of us can obey.

174
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,739
Not all of us can do the same thing.

175
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:31,820
Not all of us can,

176
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,239
Lydia was in here playing the piano before church tonight

177
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:36,520
and I said, Lydia, have you ever heard me play the piano?

178
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,880
And she kind of looked at me sideways,

179
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,679
like, what are you talking about, you play the piano?

180
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,320
I said, oh yeah, I got a couple songs

181
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,159
and I came over here and I played a couple of partial songs

182
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,919
that I know just a few notes of, right?

183
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,880
And I was just kind of messing with Lydia a little bit,

184
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,979
but the reality is I don't play the piano.

185
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,000
But I can obey God, even though I don't play the piano.

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,719
See, there's things sometimes we begin to look at,

187
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:00,599
well, I can't do this or I can't do that,

188
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:04,419
but all of us can obey and God gives us the strength

189
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:08,380
and the capacity to obey His commands.

190
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,299
God never gives us instruction

191
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:15,299
that He does not give us the ability to obey, amen?

192
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:18,419
He enables us, it is His enabling.

193
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:21,000
I preached this on Wednesday evening

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,380
there from the book of 1 Thessalonians,

195
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,979
you look at all of that instruction,

196
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:27,219
how could I ever do this?

197
00:09:27,219 --> 00:09:30,179
You can't, but faithful is he that calleth you,

198
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:31,840
who also will do it.

199
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,799
And He works in us and through us and He enables us

200
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:37,599
and we find that as we look at the life of Joseph,

201
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:40,039
that his life is marked by obedience.

202
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:42,080
Yes, first and foremost to the Lord,

203
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,179
I see it in his life that he was obedient to his dad.

204
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,760
His dad sent him on errands,

205
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,080
his dad gave him responsibility

206
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,919
and yet we find that even in his life,

207
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,359
he obeyed that instruction.

208
00:09:57,419 --> 00:09:58,919
I believe that he was obedient,

209
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:02,219
don't specifically call it out in this fashion,

210
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:04,279
but I believe that he was obedient

211
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,719
to those who were in authority over him.

212
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,879
I think that when he was in Potiphar's house,

213
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,479
that he was obedient, he made himself subject

214
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:13,039
to the authority that was over him.

215
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,719
I believe that was in prison.

216
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:17,799
Why is it that he came to the position that he came to?

217
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:20,799
I believe that he was an obedient individual

218
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,599
because ultimately he understood

219
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:25,879
that he was obeying the Lord, he was obeying the Lord.

220
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:29,719
You know, we all have people in authority over us.

221
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:30,959
There are people that say, I can't wait

222
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,439
until I can get to a place of authority

223
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:35,359
and nobody is gonna tell me what to do.

224
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:37,059
I remember I was in Bible college.

225
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:41,399
Sometimes Bible colleges are known for a bunch of rules

226
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,759
and I found this out in life

227
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,279
that every rule is there for a reason.

228
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:50,739
The most crazy rule you can think of in a rule book,

229
00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:53,999
there's somebody that did something somewhere along the way

230
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:56,879
that resulted in that rule being put in the rule book.

231
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,439
This is how it works.

232
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:00,299
And sometimes you can let your mind wander

233
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:03,159
and you can wonder, I wonder where this rule came from,

234
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:05,679
right, I wonder what some knucklehead did

235
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,579
that came up with this rule being put in place.

236
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,379
And I remember in Bible college, there's one young man

237
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:17,919
and he said, I'm tired of all these rules.

238
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,519
I'm tired of people telling me what to do.

239
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,119
I'm going to the Marine Corps.

240
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:26,039
He was about 19 years old.

241
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:28,639
My whole life, I feel like I grew up in the Marine Corps

242
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,359
because I was born and my dad was a Marine.

243
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:31,999
I went to college, my dad's a Marine.

244
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:33,519
He didn't retire until my middle

245
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,079
of my freshman year in college.

246
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:37,039
And he said, I'm going to the Marines.

247
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:39,599
And I was like, good luck with that, man.

248
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,999
So much for I don't have to do

249
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:43,399
what anyone tells me to do, right?

250
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,759
The reality is that obedience

251
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:50,479
is a good trait of God's people.

252
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:52,799
We're obedient, we're obedient.

253
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:56,639
Turn to the book of 1 Samuel chapter 15, if you will.

254
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,039
It's a portion of scripture that's familiar to many of us.

255
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:08,559
In 1 Samuel 15, we read of Saul and his partial obedience.

256
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,459
And you've often heard me say that partial obedience

257
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,039
is really nothing more than disobedience.

258
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:21,319
The command that was given from the Lord

259
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:25,519
through Samuel to Saul was very plain and very clear.

260
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,959
And yet we find that Saul did not obey

261
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:31,919
the command that had been given to him.

262
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,579
Samuel comes on the scene

263
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:37,119
and Samuel is aware of the disobedience,

264
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:39,439
not only because of the word of the Lord,

265
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:41,999
but because of what he could hear and observe himself.

266
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:45,839
He knew of the disobedience of Saul.

267
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,159
And I just wanna draw your attention,

268
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,799
we're not gonna read the entirety of the text

269
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,719
or even much of it, just a verse of scripture.

270
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:54,059
Notice in verse 22, the Bible says,

271
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:54,899
and Samuel said,

272
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,159
hath the Lord as great delight

273
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,299
in burnt offerings and sacrifices.

274
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:02,359
Why is it that Samuel says that?

275
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:05,639
Well, because Saul tries to excuse his disobedience

276
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,099
by saying we're gonna make an offering,

277
00:13:07,099 --> 00:13:08,799
we're gonna make a sacrifice.

278
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,239
And so I'm gonna justify my disobedience

279
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:16,439
by saying that I'm making a sacrifice.

280
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:19,839
Listen, there's no justification for disobedience.

281
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,279
The proper response to disobedience is confession.

282
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:28,479
That's the proper response, confession.

283
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:32,559
God, I disobeyed, I sinned and we confess and we forsake.

284
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,039
He continues and says,

285
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:37,639
hath the Lord as great delight

286
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,399
in burnt offerings and sacrifices

287
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:44,399
as in obeying the voice of the Lord.

288
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,799
Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice

289
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,799
and to hearken than the fat of rams.

290
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:58,719
To obey is better, to obey is better.

291
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:00,959
Think about the life of Joseph,

292
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,359
a life that's well-lived,

293
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:07,359
a life that here in Genesis 50 comes to an end,

294
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:10,159
110 years old, and I believe it was a life

295
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,159
that was marked by obedience.

296
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:16,759
I wonder tonight if we were to examine our lives,

297
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,479
if others were to examine our lives,

298
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:23,119
would they say of us that our life is marked by obedience?

299
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:26,439
Is it clear in our lives that we're obedient people,

300
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:28,359
that we obey the Lord,

301
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:30,519
that our life is marked by obedience,

302
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:33,919
that not just occasionally they happen to obey,

303
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,879
but they are an obedient follower of Jesus Christ?

304
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:40,279
Number two this evening, the life of Joseph,

305
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,379
not only a life marked by obedience,

306
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:45,439
but I would say this, a life marked by troubles,

307
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:48,719
a life marked by troubles.

308
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:50,359
You know, the reality this evening

309
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:54,079
is that Joseph faced a number of troubles in his life.

310
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,239
We're familiar with them,

311
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:58,199
we've studied them now over these past several months

312
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:59,599
of studying the book of Genesis

313
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:03,039
and particularly this last portion of the book of Genesis

314
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:07,079
and we find that his life had many troubles,

315
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:08,599
but we find that in our lives,

316
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:10,519
that our lives too have many troubles.

317
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:13,039
Listen, trouble is never an excuse to disobey.

318
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:16,199
Trouble is never an excuse to just quit

319
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:17,239
and throw in the towel and say,

320
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:18,759
you know what, it's not worth it.

321
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:21,439
I got all these problems and all these troubles

322
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:24,079
and no one understands and woe is me

323
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,879
and I have a right to, no, no, no.

324
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,159
Trouble is no excuse to disobey the Lord.

325
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,999
Trouble is no excuse to give up on following the Lord.

326
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,599
Job says this in Job chapter 14,

327
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:38,119
a verse that we're familiar with,

328
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:43,119
man that is born of woman is a few days and full of trouble.

329
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:45,039
And you say, man, I found that to be the case.

330
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:50,039
That is my new life verse and my life is full of troubles.

331
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:53,859
The reality is that trouble,

332
00:15:53,859 --> 00:15:56,679
sometimes we get our own selves in trouble, amen.

333
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,839
We do crazy things and get ourselves in trouble

334
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:00,919
and it's our own fault, it's our own doing.

335
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:04,279
But other times life just has troubles.

336
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:05,519
There's just troubles in life.

337
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,279
There are difficulties, there's those that oppose us.

338
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,439
I think about Joseph here as we think about his life.

339
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:14,799
I think about the troubles that he had with his brothers.

340
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,759
Really, was there anything that Joseph did

341
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,279
that resulted in that trouble?

342
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:20,319
No, Joseph didn't go asking for it.

343
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:23,799
Joseph didn't mess up and get himself in trouble, no.

344
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,839
Joseph was obedient to his father.

345
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,119
Joseph was, he was the one that received

346
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,239
the coat of many colors.

347
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,839
He didn't go ask his dad for it.

348
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,959
He wasn't trying to compete for it.

349
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,439
As best we can tell from scripture,

350
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:36,839
there was no competition among the brothers

351
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:39,599
for who would get the trophy, if you will,

352
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,839
be the recipient of this coat of many colors.

353
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,039
No, Jacob bestowed it upon him

354
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:46,559
because he was his really favorite son,

355
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:47,879
if we're honest with scripture.

356
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:50,479
And he was the son of his old age and he gave him that.

357
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:51,799
And his brothers hated him

358
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:54,359
and his brothers could not speak peaceably unto him.

359
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:57,519
And he goes out following the command of his father.

360
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,119
As you study through the scriptures

361
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,599
and you find that he goes to sea

362
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:04,119
to bring a report back to dad

363
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:07,879
and they see him afar off and they conspire against him.

364
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:09,479
Let us kill him.

365
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:10,599
Here comes that dreamer.

366
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,919
Let's see what's gonna happen.

367
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,079
Let's see what's gonna come of these dreams.

368
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,479
And Joseph just happens to come upon them

369
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:21,079
and they snatch him and they tear that coat off of him

370
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,279
and they throw him into a pit

371
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:24,079
and they're planning to kill him.

372
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:26,559
They sell him into slavery.

373
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,639
Think about those troubles.

374
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:33,639
It's really nothing that he did wrong

375
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,919
that resulted in those troubles.

376
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,279
They were just troubles that came in his life.

377
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:40,639
He gets sold into slavery,

378
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:42,359
ends up in Egypt in a foreign land.

379
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,559
And we find that he's there,

380
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:47,239
that he's purchased by Potiphar and he's a servant.

381
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:50,759
Really he's of great position within the house of Potiphar.

382
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:53,479
He says so much so that there's none greater

383
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:55,079
in the house than me.

384
00:17:57,879 --> 00:17:59,039
What a great position.

385
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:03,639
But Potiphar's wife came after him.

386
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,359
She lied about him and he ends up in prison.

387
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,319
He didn't do anything wrong.

388
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:12,719
In fact, he did everything right.

389
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:13,959
Amen?

390
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,999
Biblically speaking, he did everything right.

391
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,559
I often, and I said it during the message of that chapter,

392
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,999
he lost his coat, but he retained his character.

393
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:29,159
Better to lose his coat and be falsely accused

394
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:31,719
than to jeopardize his walk with God.

395
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:34,440
He said, how then can I do this great wickedness

396
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,959
and sin against God?

397
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:41,479
The trouble came, he ends up in prison and we understand.

398
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:43,679
And again, when we think about the life of Joseph,

399
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,799
when we think about a life marked by troubles,

400
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:48,760
listen, we have troubles in our lives.

401
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,200
Sometimes our own doing,

402
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,839
but many times outside of our control,

403
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,399
just things that happen.

404
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,959
The enemy attacking and the enemy trying to cause us

405
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:02,839
to stop serving the Lord.

406
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:07,719
I think about Psalm 34, it's a precious Psalm of David.

407
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:11,440
David makes two powerful statements in this chapter

408
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,359
with regard to troubles.

409
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:16,359
The first one is this in Psalm 34 in verse number six.

410
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:21,000
He says, this poor man cried and the Lord heard him

411
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,320
and saved him out of all his troubles.

412
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,639
Now David had some troubles that were not of his own doing.

413
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:32,479
David had some troubles that were the result

414
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,639
of his own doing.

415
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,239
All right, really you can look at David's life

416
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:37,639
in two aspects and you can see some of the troubles

417
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:40,159
that David had, they're his own doing.

418
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,919
Some of the troubles that David had, he had nothing to do.

419
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:45,320
He didn't ask to be anointed to be the king.

420
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:50,119
He didn't ask to go and to be in the place where he was

421
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,919
there with Saul, to be hunted by Saul

422
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,039
and all of those things.

423
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,639
And we find that he says, this poor man cried

424
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:59,239
and the Lord heard him and saved him out of.

425
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:03,999
all of his troubles, but I want you to skip over, you see that in verse 6 of Psalm 34,

426
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:07,959
look at verse 19 if you will.

427
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:12,159
I find the truth of verse number 6, I'm actually going to back it up and look at verse 17,

428
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,239
but I think of the truth of verse number 6 where David is sharing his testimony, he's

429
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:19,999
testifying of his own personal experience.

430
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:24,639
This is my experience, I had troubles but God heard me when I cried and God delivered

431
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:25,639
me.

432
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:33,439
The Bible says this, the righteous cry, and the Lord heareth and delivereth them out of

433
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:36,159
all their troubles.

434
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,719
Notice this verse 18, the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and save

435
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:44,799
it such as be of a contrite spirit.

436
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:54,039
Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.

437
00:20:54,039 --> 00:21:00,519
And I'm so thankful that though we have trouble in life, we have a God who is greater.

438
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:03,439
We have a God who has purpose.

439
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:09,719
We have a God that in the midst of the trouble he can bring to pass great things.

440
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:15,039
If we simply remain faithful, if we simply remain steadfast, if we simply remain obedient

441
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,079
and keeping our eyes on the Lord, even in the midst of the trouble and the difficulty,

442
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:22,519
we can see God work.

443
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,919
We see that in the life of Joseph.

444
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:30,479
We see a man who walked with God in spite of the troubles, in spite of the difficulties.

445
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:35,119
I mean I think about the time in prison and we don't know exactly how long Joseph was

446
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:40,959
in prison, but we know that he was forgotten in prison for two years.

447
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:45,119
How long was he in prison before the butler and the baker came into prison and had the

448
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,119
dream?

449
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:50,959
We don't know for sure the timeline, but we know that after the butler and the baker were

450
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:58,519
delivered and the butler was told, remember me, and given that instruction, the text begins

451
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:04,919
that two years, after two years, that's when Pharaoh had a dream.

452
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:10,759
That's when the butler remembered about his experience in prison with Joseph and the dream

453
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:17,239
that he had and the dream that the baker had and the interpretation thereof.

454
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:21,559
We find that Joseph, during that two years, as best we can tell from Scripture, he just

455
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:24,479
continued to walk with God.

456
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:29,399
He just continued to do what he was supposed to do, praise the Lord, in the midst of trouble

457
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:31,559
and the midst of difficulty.

458
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:35,959
He didn't run a campaign, woe is me, I'm here and I don't deserve to be here and I've been

459
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:39,439
falsely accused and imprisoned and so on and so forth.

460
00:22:39,439 --> 00:22:47,079
No, he just was obedient to the Lord and he was used of God in that place.

461
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:50,799
The Bible tells us the Lord was with him.

462
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,919
We find a life marked by obedience and a life marked by troubles.

463
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:59,439
I would say this, number three, a life marked by blessing, a life marked by blessing.

464
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:01,999
You want blessing in your life?

465
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:08,759
Better learn to obey, amen, because the result of obedience is blessing.

466
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:12,799
You say, but pastor, you just said that Joseph obeyed the Lord and there were troubles.

467
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,759
Yeah, I did say that.

468
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:21,399
Listen, not everything that we call a blessing is really a blessing.

469
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:24,919
And not everything the world would identify as not being a blessing is not a blessing.

470
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:30,519
I'm thankful, listen, the psalmist says that he rejoiced for being afflicted.

471
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,679
Why?

472
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,799
Because it was then that he learned the statutes of the Lord.

473
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,479
Some of us wouldn't look at being afflicted as being a blessing, but I would submit to

474
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:44,399
you this evening that indeed it was a blessing.

475
00:23:44,399 --> 00:23:50,119
Because if we learn more about our God in that time of difficulty, then to God be the

476
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:55,159
glory that he allowed us to experience that.

477
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:00,679
Brother Armando shared with me not long ago how that during that trial of great health

478
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:06,199
trial when he was in Guatemala and thought he was going to die, how close he got to God

479
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:10,199
during that time.

480
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:16,199
We find this evening that we could look at the life of Joseph and yes, it's not contradictory

481
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:21,319
to say that it was a life marked by troubles, but also a life marked by blessing.

482
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:26,559
God knows his people, God has a plan for his people, and God blesses obedience.

483
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,279
I begin to think about the position of Joseph.

484
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:38,359
In Genesis chapter 41 and verse number 43, God tells us that Pharaoh made Joseph ruler

485
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:41,759
over all the land of Egypt.

486
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:47,839
When Joseph was in that pit, when Joseph was in that prison, he really didn't know that

487
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:54,099
he would one day be in a palace and be the ruler over all the land of Egypt.

488
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:58,079
We know that because we are familiar with the account of the life of Joseph because

489
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,919
we've read it and we've studied it and so we're familiar with it.

490
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:07,039
But I want you to, even as I mentioned this morning, consider that first read of the life

491
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,880
of Joseph, if you will.

492
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,440
And as you're reading the life of Joseph and you see him in the pit and you see him in

493
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,319
the prison and you see all that's taking place, and then you find how that eventually he comes

494
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:24,239
to the palace, it's amazing how God orchestrated all of those circumstances.

495
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:32,279
In fact, the reality is that had the butler remembered Joseph prior to the Pharaoh having

496
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:37,880
the dream, the Pharaoh probably couldn't care less that there was a man in prison that could

497
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,559
interpret dreams.

498
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:40,599
Why?

499
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:45,239
He had plenty of magicians and astrologers and those that he would go to for interpreting

500
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:50,359
of dreams, but it was at the very moment that he had a dream and there were none within

501
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:53,799
Egypt that could interpret.

502
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:58,000
The butler says, I remember.

503
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,119
And with haste they bring Joseph and they bring him into the presence.

504
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:07,079
He cleans himself up and he comes in the presence and Pharaoh says, I understand that you can

505
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:09,239
interpret dreams.

506
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:15,679
And Joseph says this, he says that it's not in him, it's not in me, but God shall give

507
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,720
Pharaoh an answer of peace.

508
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,039
What a great testimony.

509
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:29,759
God brings Joseph to this place of position and we find that Pharaoh so much so in understanding

510
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:36,079
the interpretation and the plan that is set forth, he says that he was going to set this

511
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:38,079
man Joseph in charge.

512
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,079
Why?

513
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:46,959
Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?

514
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:49,880
And he sets him in charge.

515
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,720
He tells him that only in the throne would Pharaoh be greater.

516
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,679
Joseph was 30 years old when this took place.

517
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,160
We find that he had this blessing of a position.

518
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,359
We find that God blessed him with family in the same chapter.

519
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:13,000
We're told of the wife that he receives but also of his two sons and the Bible tells us

520
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,799
in Genesis 41 and verse 50, unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came

521
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:23,839
which Asenath, the daughter of Potiphar, a priest of Ahon, bear unto him.

522
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:28,359
And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh.

523
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:34,239
Names meant something very significant during Bible times, sometimes still today, and some

524
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:39,000
cultures names carry great significance in their meaning.

525
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,919
Unfortunately, in many of our American culture ideas, we pick our names because we like the

526
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:46,919
name.

527
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:51,919
We don't want much significance or thought that is put into the particular name.

528
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,599
We find that the Bible says that he named him Manasseh.

529
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:55,599
Why?

530
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:03,039
For God said he hath made me forget all my toil in all my father's house.

531
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:10,739
The name of the second called Ephraim, notice this, for God hath caused me to be fruitful

532
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:12,919
in the land of my affliction.

533
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:15,759
Isn't that a great statement?

534
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,919
You know, you can be fruitful.

535
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,679
You can have the blessing of God no matter where you are.

536
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:22,679
It's amazing.

537
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:27,160
We've now been in Northern Virginia for 13 years and I remember many years before we

538
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,639
ever moved to Northern Virginia saying something like this, who would ever want to live in

539
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:33,440
Northern Virginia?

540
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,440
I remember passing through this corridor on many a time visiting family, my brother's

541
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,359
station in North Carolina and we in Pennsylvania where we lived and we'd have to drive through

542
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:48,919
this corridor, this 95 corridor, right, going through the beltway and all of that.

543
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:52,159
And it didn't seem to matter what time of day you ever made the journey, you always

544
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,719
figured you'd hit traffic in Northern Virginia.

545
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:59,020
You always try to time it and, you know, miss the traffic.

546
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,880
People ask me now after living here all these years, how's traffic?

547
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,880
It's bad all the time.

548
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,479
I mean, there's just really not a good time to go.

549
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:07,640
It's just the way it is.

550
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,799
And then you try to jump on the expressway and you might as well just, I don't know,

551
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:17,599
run over your paycheck or something if you're going to pay for the tolls and it's crazy.

552
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:20,359
But I remember saying, who would ever want to live there?

553
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:24,559
I remember saying that, I'm being honest with you.

554
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,520
And then I remember when God orchestrated and we found out about this church in Oakton

555
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,479
and I thought, man, I've told this story before but I thought that's a sweet little name of

556
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:36,719
a town named after a tree, right, an oak tree.

557
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:41,559
And in my mind's eye I had a picture of Oakton being something like what you would see in

558
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:46,719
the southwestern part of our state, just kind of a quaint little town, nice little,

559
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:47,719
you know, whatever.

560
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:52,880
And then I looked it up on the internet and I said to Holly, this might as well be Washington,

561
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,119
D.C.

562
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:56,359
And sure enough.

563
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:59,119
But God called us here.

564
00:29:59,119 --> 00:29:59,279
And you know.

565
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,879
You know, the reality is that as many people as we've met over the years, I was talking

566
00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:08,999
to somebody not long ago, to our children actually, in the time that we've had the

567
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:14,199
privilege of being here, we've had, I believe the number now is 56 different families that

568
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:16,919
have joined the church over these years.

569
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:22,559
And out of the 56 families that have joined the church, 34 of them have moved away.

570
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,859
And you begin to think about that, why, what happens?

571
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:27,039
You know how many people say, I don't like it here?

572
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,539
They want to move.

573
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:32,939
That's just the idea, they get here and they say, I don't like the pace of life, I don't

574
00:30:32,939 --> 00:30:36,099
like this, I don't like that, so on and so forth.

575
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:40,859
Listen, God has us here for a reason.

576
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:42,519
God has us here for a reason.

577
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:46,939
You know the world is in our backyard?

578
00:30:46,939 --> 00:30:50,459
The world is in our backyard.

579
00:30:50,459 --> 00:30:54,899
You can meet people from every continent, save Antarctica, I've never met anyone from

580
00:30:54,899 --> 00:31:00,599
there, but you can meet people from all over the globe.

581
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:02,479
What a great opportunity.

582
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:07,159
See, we need to be careful of how we view things, and we need to understand that God

583
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:09,519
can bless.

584
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:15,279
God has you here for a season and for a reason.

585
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:20,079
And we begin to understand that this is where God wants me and this is where God has me,

586
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:26,979
and as we're in the place where God has us, that God can make us fruitful and allow us

587
00:31:26,979 --> 00:31:29,419
to have blessing.

588
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:34,819
What a joy to know that we're in the place where God has us, even if we might call it

589
00:31:34,819 --> 00:31:36,059
the land of our affliction.

590
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:38,579
I don't refer to it that way, I love it.

591
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:42,059
I never thought I would say that I love Northern Virginia, but I really did.

592
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:47,739
There are certain aspects of it that drive you crazy, you just kind of get used to it.

593
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:54,959
But the reality is that I'm thankful that Joseph understood that he could have the blessing

594
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:58,679
of God and be fruitful in the place where he was.

595
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:03,479
I think about the life marked by a blessing, even in the reunion with his family.

596
00:32:03,479 --> 00:32:08,439
If you were to read, and we've studied in recent weeks, the 46th and 47th chapter of

597
00:32:08,439 --> 00:32:14,039
the book of Genesis, when Joseph reveals his identity to his brothers and says to have

598
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:19,979
dad and the family come, and it would be in the place of Egypt that Joseph would provide

599
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:26,579
for them a place, and he would sustain them, and how you read of the reunion with his father,

600
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:28,899
and what joy.

601
00:32:28,899 --> 00:32:34,859
I mean, just even looking at the reunion with his brothers, the ones who hated him, the

602
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:40,099
ones that sold him into slavery, but there's a sweet reunion that God records for us in

603
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:45,199
the 46th chapter of the book of Genesis, and then you read at the end where Jacob comes,

604
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:53,519
and what a blessing to consider the opportunity that God gave him, and how the obedience of

605
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,919
Joseph through his life, it's a life that's marked by a blessing.

606
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:07,919
We mentioned this just a few weeks ago in Genesis chapter 49, when Jacob, dad, has all

607
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,579
the boys brought before him.

608
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:15,339
He begins in verse 22, speaking of Joseph, and he says that Joseph is a fruitful bow,

609
00:33:15,339 --> 00:33:19,959
even a fruitful bow by a well, whose branches run over the wall.

610
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:26,299
The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him, but his bow abode in

611
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:28,019
strength.

612
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:34,459
The arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob.

613
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:38,719
On fence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel.

614
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:46,999
What a blessing to think about Joseph's life, a life that's marked by a blessing.

615
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:53,639
I would say finally this evening, the life of Joseph is a life that is marked by faith.

616
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:55,679
Life that is marked by faith.

617
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,359
We come to this 50th chapter, and we find that Joseph, the Bible tells us that he's

618
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:06,419
110 years old, and he says to his brethren in verse 24, I die.

619
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:11,219
Very similar to what we've read with regard to Jacob, knowing that he would soon die,

620
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:17,899
and he calls for his family to be in his presence, and he gives that final request, and puts

621
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:21,019
his feet back up in bed and dies.

622
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:23,499
And Joseph says to his brethren, I die.

623
00:34:23,499 --> 00:34:28,919
But I want you to see what Joseph says, and how we see that his life was a life marked

624
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:30,119
by faith.

625
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:40,839
The Bible says that he says in verse 24, God will surely visit you, and bring you out of

626
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:49,559
this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

627
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:54,839
Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye

628
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:59,439
shall carry up my bones from hence.

629
00:34:59,439 --> 00:35:05,799
So Joseph died being 110 years old, and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in

630
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:06,799
Egypt.

631
00:35:06,799 --> 00:35:12,279
Begin to think about the faith of Joseph, and a life that's marked by faith.

632
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:17,939
We see it in these statements, and he believed that God would do what God said he would do.

633
00:35:17,939 --> 00:35:23,999
He believed that God had promised to Abraham, and to Isaac, and to Jacob a land.

634
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:30,199
He believed, even as God had shared with Jacob in chapter 46, before Jacob would leave

635
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:37,119
that land and go to Egypt, that God said to Jacob, I am God, the God of thy father, fear

636
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,999
not to go down into Egypt, for I will there make of thee a great nation, and I will go

637
00:35:41,999 --> 00:35:48,239
down with thee into Egypt, and I will also surely bring thee up again, and Joseph shall

638
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:50,199
put his hand upon thine eyes.

639
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:52,119
Genesis 46, three and four.

640
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:56,319
And Joseph believed that.

641
00:35:56,319 --> 00:36:03,279
Joseph did not live long enough to see it come to pass, but his eye of faith, he says

642
00:36:03,279 --> 00:36:09,519
in verse number 24, and again in verse 25, notice he says, God will surely visit you.

643
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:16,639
I mean, confident faith, expecting that God will do what God said he will do.

644
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:22,199
Not only was he convinced that God would visit and bring the nation into the land that

645
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:28,599
he promised, but he says in verse number 25 that he took an oath of them, saying, carry

646
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:32,479
up my bones from hence.

647
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:38,879
You know, it's not until Joshua chapter 24 that we read of that being fulfilled, and

648
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:44,759
we find that after, if you think about Genesis chapter 50, and you think about the period

649
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:49,399
if you enter into the book of Exodus where there's another pharaoh, another king of Egypt

650
00:36:49,399 --> 00:36:54,519
that rises up that doesn't know Joseph, and all that generation dies, and you begin to

651
00:36:54,519 --> 00:37:00,959
think about the Egyptian bondage and all that takes place, and eventually you come to the

652
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:07,239
place of the Exodus and the deliverance from Egypt land, followed by what?

653
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,559
The wilderness wanderings.

654
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:13,079
Though God never intended that that would be the plan, his plan was to deliver them

655
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:18,759
from Egypt into the land, because of their disobedience and lack of faith, they wandered

656
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:23,559
in the wilderness, but we come to the book of Joshua, and the book of Joshua provides

657
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:29,439
us with that record of the entrance into, the conquering of, the inhabiting of the land

658
00:37:29,439 --> 00:37:37,559
of the nation of Israel, the land of Canaan, that land of promise.

659
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:42,639
And we find that as God would give to us the book of Joshua, and we find that we come to

660
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:48,079
the end of the book, and the Bible tells us in verse 29 of Joshua 24, and it came to

661
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,799
pass after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died being

662
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:55,319
a hundred and ten years old.

663
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:59,599
They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath Sarai, which is in Mount Ephraim

664
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,639
on the north side of the hill of Gash, and Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua,

665
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:09,079
and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works

666
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,079
of the Lord that He had done for Israel.

667
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:18,639
And notice verse 32, the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out

668
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:25,639
of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of

669
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:30,879
Hamor, the father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of silver, and it became the inheritance

670
00:38:30,879 --> 00:38:33,439
of the children of Joseph.

671
00:38:33,439 --> 00:38:41,319
That's a long time that passes, but Joseph's bones are taken out of Egypt.

672
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:48,719
We find that they're brought into this burying place that God tells us of in Shechem, in

673
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:54,119
Joshua 24 and verse 32, but I want you to think about a life marked by faith.

674
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:59,319
It's interesting, for Joseph finds himself in the Hall of Faith chapter, sort of the

675
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:04,519
book of Hebrews, if you will, the 11th chapter, and we'll end here this evening.

676
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:08,839
We think of Hebrews chapter 11, we've often referred to this chapter as the Hall of Faith

677
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:10,599
chapter.

678
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:16,679
Those that, by faith, they believed God and how they were moved and what they did and

679
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:25,319
so on and so forth, and we find that Joseph, the statement that we read in Genesis 50,

680
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,599
is recorded for us in Hebrews chapter 11.

681
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:35,239
It tells us this in Hebrews 11 and verse 22.

682
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:43,159
By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel

683
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:49,599
and gave commandment concerning his bones.

684
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,719
By faith he believed God.

685
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:58,519
The Bible tells us the just shall live by faith.

686
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:00,239
Amen?

687
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:05,739
The Bible tells us in this chapter, in Hebrews chapter 11 and verse number 6, without faith

688
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:09,119
it is impossible to please Him.

689
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,359
For he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that

690
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:19,219
diligently seek Him.

691
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:25,559
God desires that His people would live a life of faith, that we believe God.

692
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:33,119
I believe the most simple definition of faith is believing God, taking God at His Word.

693
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,599
It doesn't mean that you can understand how everything's going to work out, it just means

694
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,279
that you believe God.

695
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:47,719
I think of Paul when he's in the storm, the end of the book of Acts, and he stands and

696
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:57,379
he simply says, I believe God, that it shall be as it was revealed unto me.

697
00:40:57,379 --> 00:41:02,539
There was an angel that stood by him and told him of the deliverance that would come to

698
00:41:02,539 --> 00:41:03,539
pass.

699
00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:07,879
And in that particular storm they were hoping and wishing for the day, they thought for

700
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:13,099
sure they were all dead men, but he said, I believe God.

701
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:14,099
Not one will be lost.

702
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:15,099
And you know what?

703
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:16,099
They made it ashore.

704
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:19,919
None of them lost their lives.

705
00:41:19,919 --> 00:41:26,079
This evening we think about the life of Joseph, we end this wonderful book, the book of Genesis,

706
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,719
a life that's marked by obedience, a life that's marked by troubles, a life that's marked

707
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:36,099
by blessing, and a life that's marked by faith.

708
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:43,479
I wonder tonight if each of us were to examine our own lives, better yet if someone to read

709
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:48,539
your story, what would they walk away with?

710
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:55,039
See, most of us are probably pretty glad that God didn't record our story for countless

711
00:41:55,039 --> 00:42:04,019
generations of people to study, amen?

712
00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:08,539
But if He did, how would someone conclude your life?

713
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:13,159
What would the summary statements be that are made of your life?

714
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:20,319
I hope that it could be said, even as it's said of Joseph, as we make these conclusion

715
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:27,699
type statements, it's a life marked by obedience, troubles, yes, blessings, abundant, a life

716
00:42:27,699 --> 00:42:28,939
of faith.

717
00:42:28,939 --> 00:42:29,939
He believed God.

718
00:42:29,939 --> 00:42:32,899
Oh, that God would help us to have faith.

719
00:42:32,899 --> 00:42:37,419
Oh, that God would help us to obey Him, to just follow Him.

720
00:42:37,419 --> 00:42:40,739
You say, but the troubles, yes, the troubles will come.

721
00:42:40,739 --> 00:42:44,919
Keep your eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.

722
00:42:44,919 --> 00:42:45,919
He's got a plan.

723
00:42:45,919 --> 00:42:47,679
He does, He doeth all things well.

724
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,679
We serve a great God.

725
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:58,639
Joseph, 54 years summarized in just a few verses of Scripture, an exemplary Bible character,

726
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:03,259
one in which we look at his life and we say, oh, that God would allow me to be used in

727
00:43:03,259 --> 00:43:04,739
like fashion.

728
00:43:04,739 --> 00:43:05,739
Let's pray together.

729
00:43:05,739 --> 00:43:07,299
Father, we love You.

730
00:43:07,299 --> 00:43:08,379
Thank You for loving us.

731
00:43:08,379 --> 00:43:11,179
Thank You for Your Word, the truth that's contained therein.

732
00:43:11,179 --> 00:43:13,379
We thank You for the life of Joseph.

733
00:43:13,379 --> 00:43:19,579
I pray, Lord, that You'd help us to be men and women of faith, men and women of obedience.

734
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:21,619
Help us to be used of Thee.

735
00:43:21,619 --> 00:43:24,859
I pray, Lord, that in this moment of invitation that You'd have Your will and way.

736
00:43:24,859 --> 00:43:28,719
Lord, maybe there's someone that's been living in disobedience, Lord, someone that's tried

737
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:30,899
to justify some of their disobedience.

738
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:36,579
Oh, I pray, Holy Spirit, that You'd convict them and help them, Lord, to respond not by

739
00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:39,939
justification but respond with confession.

740
00:43:39,939 --> 00:43:42,099
Lord, help us to have faith.

741
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:43,579
Help us to live by faith.

742
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:46,579
I pray that You'd increase our faith.

743
00:43:46,579 --> 00:43:47,579
Help us to believe You.

744
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:51,859
I pray that You'd move and work as only You can for it's in Christ's name we pray.

745
00:43:51,859 --> 00:43:52,859
Would You stand with me?

746
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:53,859
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

747
00:43:53,859 --> 00:43:58,779
Holly's going to play quietly on the piano, and as she does, the altar is open.
