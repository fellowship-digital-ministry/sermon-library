00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
in this wonderful book, the book of Genesis.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.519
50 chapters, and it's been a long time.

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:10.399
This is message number 103.

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:14.319
I mentioned that during the morning service today.

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:17.559
103 messages through this book,

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:20.520
and some of them were multiple part messages

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.399
based upon just the content of what we were dealing with.

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:29.079
But of course, as we've mentioned throughout the study,

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.240
the series over these number of years,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.599
that the book of Genesis is so foundational.

00:00:35.599 --> 00:00:37.159
It is so important.

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:39.279
We find that in our world today,

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:43.119
that really the content of the first 11 chapters

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:46.720
of the book of Genesis is regularly under attack.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.919
And it's regularly under attack

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:52.360
because if the enemy can cause the individual

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.060
to doubt the record of Genesis one through 11,

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.240
then the reality is that the enemy

00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:03.139
can get anybody to doubt any portion of God's word.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.779
If he is not the creator,

00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:09.139
then how do we know he's really the redeemer?

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:13.260
And really, that's the path that they go down

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.059
in trying to cause doubt and uncertainty

00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:18.620
with the Genesis record.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.900
I'm thankful that the creator God gave us

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.540
this wonderful book of beginnings,

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.919
and it begins in the beginning God.

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:30.099
What a wonderful book, what a wonderful content.

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:33.459
And then of course now we end with the life of Joseph.

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:37.180
I've titled the message, So Joseph Died.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.699
And as we begin to look at this passage of scripture,

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:41.660
the Bible tells us in verse 22,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.720
and Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father's house,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.660
and Joseph lived in 110 years.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.660
And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.360
The children also of Mekir, the son of Manasseh,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.480
were brought up upon Joseph's knees.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.959
And Joseph said unto his brethren,

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.279
I die, and God will surely visit you

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:10.000
and bring you out of this land,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.639
and to the land which he swore to Abraham,

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.399
to Isaac, and to Jacob.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.679
And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel,

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:22.399
saying, God will surely visit you,

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:25.940
and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.320
So Joseph died, being 110 years old.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.320
They embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.699
I wanna remind you if you wanna take and turn over quickly,

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:43.380
but you don't need to, but in Psalm 116,

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.979
God gives us a precious verse of scripture.

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:50.740
In Psalm 116, it's a verse that we often will turn to

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.899
at the time of a loved one that departs,

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:55.500
enters into eternity.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.300
The Bible says in Psalm 116, in verse number 15,

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.960
precious in the sight of the Lord

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.839
is the death of his saints.

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:09.600
Precious in the sight of the Lord

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.800
is the death of his saints.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.440
As we begin to think about this portion of scripture

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.820
and ending the book of Genesis,

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.500
we find that for the majority of the last 13 chapters

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.679
of the book of Genesis,

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:25.119
we have traced the steps of the life of Joseph.

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:27.179
He comes on the scene in chapter 37.

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:31.440
We're introduced to this exemplary Bible character.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.759
He's 17 years old in Genesis chapter 37

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:36.720
when he comes on the scene.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.440
We find that the Bible would record for us

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.160
many aspects of his life,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.000
and as we come here to Genesis chapter number 50,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.399
we're told that Joseph is 110 years old.

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:50.699
It's very interesting because the text of scripture

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:53.220
that I read to you beginning in verse 22 this evening

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.639
and through the end of the chapter,

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.460
really this portion of scripture

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.759
covers about 53 or 54 years of Joseph's life.

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:04.940
Joseph's dad died, Jacob.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.339
We read of that and we studied that

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:09.660
the last couple of messages in the end of chapter 49

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.559
and the beginning of chapter number 50,

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:14.699
but we find that from the death of Jacob

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.779
until the death of Joseph,

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:19.880
it's about 54 years that passes,

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.920
and we find that there's really not much

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.079
that's given to us with regard to the life of Joseph

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:28.000
during those 54 years.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.160
But I think about the content that is given to us

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.179
with the life of Joseph.

00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:35.920
As we begin to think about his life

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.959
and we begin to think about the example that he is,

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:40.339
and of course, many of you know,

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:41.500
I've said it over the years,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.600
that Joseph is my favorite Bible character,

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:47.540
and thus, when God blessed us with a son,

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.279
we named him Joseph,

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:53.459
and the reality is that when you study the life of Joseph,

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:54.859
it's an amazing account,

00:04:54.859 --> 00:04:57.959
a record that God gives us of a life that is well-lived,

00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:59.660
a life that is exemplary,

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.640
a life that is marked by several things.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.220
In fact, we're gonna look at those things this evening.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.700
It is a life that as you look at the record

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.820
that God provides,

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.299
there's really no sin that's mentioned.

00:05:11.299 --> 00:05:13.399
It doesn't mean that Joseph was sinless,

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:15.700
it's just not recorded for us.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.700
There are many Bible characters that you can go to

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.059
and you can study their lives

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:22.380
and you can see the content of the life that's recorded

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.380
and the blessings and the great triumphs in their life,

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.980
but then also troubles and difficulties and sin

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.820
and what have you,

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.739
but here in the life of Joseph,

00:05:32.739 --> 00:05:36.339
though many difficulties are recorded,

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:39.380
we don't read of any sin in the life of Joseph.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.540
He was a man that walked with God.

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:44.279
He was a man, I believe, that pleased God.

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:46.079
He was a man that lived a life

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:51.079
that had no doubt a major impact

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.079
amongst those that he came in contact with.

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:56.679
I wonder this evening as we,

00:05:56.679 --> 00:05:59.239
even at the very beginning of the message tonight,

00:05:59.239 --> 00:06:02.440
we're gonna look at four things about the life of Joseph.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.320
I wonder this evening if my life,

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.320
if your life had this kind of record provided

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:13.579
and for generations of people to be able to examine

00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:17.059
and to read your life story,

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:19.260
what would people walk away with?

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.619
What would they summarize?

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:23.459
How would they summarize your life

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:26.339
if they were to read as we have the opportunity

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:28.980
to read of the life of Joseph

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.380
as it's recorded for us by God in his precious word?

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.660
What is it that we summarize?

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.940
How is it that we conclude?

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.100
What is it that we learn?

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.339
And I wonder tonight if our lives

00:06:39.359 --> 00:06:41.959
were under the microscope in that fashion,

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:43.000
what would people say of you?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.920
What would people say of me?

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.720
I have four thoughts for you this evening

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.839
that I hope would be a blessing,

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:51.200
things that mark the life of Joseph.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.480
And as we look at his life

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.519
and we find that we come here to the end

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:58.959
and we see his death recorded for us,

00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:00.600
I'd like to say this, number one,

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.160
that Joseph's life was a life marked by obedience.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.299
His life was a life marked by obedience.

00:07:09.299 --> 00:07:14.299
By the way, God expects obedience from his children.

00:07:15.299 --> 00:07:16.940
Not only does God expect obedience,

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.940
but I would say it this way, God deserves obedience, amen?

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.140
It is appropriate for our God to expect

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.100
that we as his people would obey him.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:34.100
It's a honorable thing for us as the people of God

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.600
to take the truth that God has given to us

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.920
and to live it, to obey it, to practice what God says,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.239
to be doers of the word and not hearers only.

00:07:46.239 --> 00:07:47.480
When I think about this life

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.279
being a life marked by obedience,

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:50.959
I would say first and foremost

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:53.359
that Joseph learned to obey God.

00:07:54.359 --> 00:07:56.239
He learned to obey God.

00:07:56.239 --> 00:07:59.559
By the way, that's the most important thing

00:07:59.559 --> 00:08:02.880
that any of us could learn is learning to obey God.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:05.619
That we just determine we're gonna obey God,

00:08:05.619 --> 00:08:07.980
that we're not gonna live a life of rebellion,

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.799
we're not gonna live a life in distance

00:08:10.799 --> 00:08:13.779
from what God has said for us to do,

00:08:13.779 --> 00:08:16.459
that we're simply going to live a life of obedience,

00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:19.540
that we're gonna determine that with God's help

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.459
and by God's grace, we're going to obey.

00:08:22.459 --> 00:08:25.660
You know, it's very interesting, all of us can obey.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.739
Not all of us can do the same thing.

00:08:30.619 --> 00:08:31.820
Not all of us can,

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.239
Lydia was in here playing the piano before church tonight

00:08:34.239 --> 00:08:36.520
and I said, Lydia, have you ever heard me play the piano?

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.880
And she kind of looked at me sideways,

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.679
like, what are you talking about, you play the piano?

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.320
I said, oh yeah, I got a couple songs

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.159
and I came over here and I played a couple of partial songs

00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:46.919
that I know just a few notes of, right?

00:08:46.919 --> 00:08:48.880
And I was just kind of messing with Lydia a little bit,

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.979
but the reality is I don't play the piano.

00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:57.000
But I can obey God, even though I don't play the piano.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.719
See, there's things sometimes we begin to look at,

00:08:58.719 --> 00:09:00.599
well, I can't do this or I can't do that,

00:09:00.619 --> 00:09:04.419
but all of us can obey and God gives us the strength

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:08.380
and the capacity to obey His commands.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.299
God never gives us instruction

00:09:10.299 --> 00:09:15.299
that He does not give us the ability to obey, amen?

00:09:15.419 --> 00:09:18.419
He enables us, it is His enabling.

00:09:18.419 --> 00:09:21.000
I preached this on Wednesday evening

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.380
there from the book of 1 Thessalonians,

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.979
you look at all of that instruction,

00:09:24.979 --> 00:09:27.219
how could I ever do this?

00:09:27.219 --> 00:09:30.179
You can't, but faithful is he that calleth you,

00:09:30.719 --> 00:09:31.840
who also will do it.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.799
And He works in us and through us and He enables us

00:09:34.799 --> 00:09:37.599
and we find that as we look at the life of Joseph,

00:09:37.599 --> 00:09:40.039
that his life is marked by obedience.

00:09:40.039 --> 00:09:42.080
Yes, first and foremost to the Lord,

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.179
I see it in his life that he was obedient to his dad.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.760
His dad sent him on errands,

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.080
his dad gave him responsibility

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.919
and yet we find that even in his life,

00:09:53.919 --> 00:09:56.359
he obeyed that instruction.

00:09:57.419 --> 00:09:58.919
I believe that he was obedient,

00:09:58.919 --> 00:10:02.219
don't specifically call it out in this fashion,

00:10:02.219 --> 00:10:04.279
but I believe that he was obedient

00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:06.719
to those who were in authority over him.

00:10:06.719 --> 00:10:08.879
I think that when he was in Potiphar's house,

00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:11.479
that he was obedient, he made himself subject

00:10:11.479 --> 00:10:13.039
to the authority that was over him.

00:10:13.039 --> 00:10:14.719
I believe that was in prison.

00:10:14.719 --> 00:10:17.799
Why is it that he came to the position that he came to?

00:10:17.799 --> 00:10:20.799
I believe that he was an obedient individual

00:10:20.799 --> 00:10:22.599
because ultimately he understood

00:10:22.599 --> 00:10:25.879
that he was obeying the Lord, he was obeying the Lord.

00:10:26.719 --> 00:10:29.719
You know, we all have people in authority over us.

00:10:29.719 --> 00:10:30.959
There are people that say, I can't wait

00:10:30.959 --> 00:10:32.439
until I can get to a place of authority

00:10:32.439 --> 00:10:35.359
and nobody is gonna tell me what to do.

00:10:35.359 --> 00:10:37.059
I remember I was in Bible college.

00:10:38.039 --> 00:10:41.399
Sometimes Bible colleges are known for a bunch of rules

00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:43.759
and I found this out in life

00:10:43.759 --> 00:10:46.279
that every rule is there for a reason.

00:10:47.759 --> 00:10:50.739
The most crazy rule you can think of in a rule book,

00:10:50.739 --> 00:10:53.999
there's somebody that did something somewhere along the way

00:10:53.999 --> 00:10:56.879
that resulted in that rule being put in the rule book.

00:10:56.879 --> 00:10:58.439
This is how it works.

00:10:58.439 --> 00:11:00.299
And sometimes you can let your mind wander

00:11:00.299 --> 00:11:03.159
and you can wonder, I wonder where this rule came from,

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:05.679
right, I wonder what some knucklehead did

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:09.579
that came up with this rule being put in place.

00:11:10.799 --> 00:11:14.379
And I remember in Bible college, there's one young man

00:11:14.379 --> 00:11:17.919
and he said, I'm tired of all these rules.

00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:20.519
I'm tired of people telling me what to do.

00:11:20.519 --> 00:11:22.119
I'm going to the Marine Corps.

00:11:22.279 --> 00:11:26.039
He was about 19 years old.

00:11:26.039 --> 00:11:28.639
My whole life, I feel like I grew up in the Marine Corps

00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:30.359
because I was born and my dad was a Marine.

00:11:30.359 --> 00:11:31.999
I went to college, my dad's a Marine.

00:11:31.999 --> 00:11:33.519
He didn't retire until my middle

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:35.079
of my freshman year in college.

00:11:35.079 --> 00:11:37.039
And he said, I'm going to the Marines.

00:11:37.039 --> 00:11:39.599
And I was like, good luck with that, man.

00:11:39.599 --> 00:11:40.999
So much for I don't have to do

00:11:40.999 --> 00:11:43.399
what anyone tells me to do, right?

00:11:43.399 --> 00:11:46.759
The reality is that obedience

00:11:46.759 --> 00:11:50.479
is a good trait of God's people.

00:11:50.479 --> 00:11:52.799
We're obedient, we're obedient.

00:11:53.719 --> 00:11:56.639
Turn to the book of 1 Samuel chapter 15, if you will.

00:11:56.639 --> 00:12:01.039
It's a portion of scripture that's familiar to many of us.

00:12:03.559 --> 00:12:08.559
In 1 Samuel 15, we read of Saul and his partial obedience.

00:12:10.559 --> 00:12:14.459
And you've often heard me say that partial obedience

00:12:14.459 --> 00:12:17.039
is really nothing more than disobedience.

00:12:18.039 --> 00:12:21.319
The command that was given from the Lord

00:12:21.319 --> 00:12:25.519
through Samuel to Saul was very plain and very clear.

00:12:25.519 --> 00:12:29.959
And yet we find that Saul did not obey

00:12:29.959 --> 00:12:31.919
the command that had been given to him.

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:33.579
Samuel comes on the scene

00:12:33.579 --> 00:12:37.119
and Samuel is aware of the disobedience,

00:12:37.119 --> 00:12:39.439
not only because of the word of the Lord,

00:12:39.439 --> 00:12:41.999
but because of what he could hear and observe himself.

00:12:41.999 --> 00:12:45.839
He knew of the disobedience of Saul.

00:12:45.839 --> 00:12:47.159
And I just wanna draw your attention,

00:12:47.159 --> 00:12:48.799
we're not gonna read the entirety of the text

00:12:48.799 --> 00:12:50.719
or even much of it, just a verse of scripture.

00:12:50.719 --> 00:12:54.059
Notice in verse 22, the Bible says,

00:12:54.059 --> 00:12:54.899
and Samuel said,

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:57.159
hath the Lord as great delight

00:12:57.159 --> 00:12:59.299
in burnt offerings and sacrifices.

00:12:59.299 --> 00:13:02.359
Why is it that Samuel says that?

00:13:02.359 --> 00:13:05.639
Well, because Saul tries to excuse his disobedience

00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:07.099
by saying we're gonna make an offering,

00:13:07.099 --> 00:13:08.799
we're gonna make a sacrifice.

00:13:08.799 --> 00:13:12.239
And so I'm gonna justify my disobedience

00:13:12.239 --> 00:13:16.439
by saying that I'm making a sacrifice.

00:13:16.439 --> 00:13:19.839
Listen, there's no justification for disobedience.

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:24.279
The proper response to disobedience is confession.

00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:28.479
That's the proper response, confession.

00:13:28.479 --> 00:13:32.559
God, I disobeyed, I sinned and we confess and we forsake.

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:34.039
He continues and says,

00:13:35.499 --> 00:13:37.639
hath the Lord as great delight

00:13:37.639 --> 00:13:39.399
in burnt offerings and sacrifices

00:13:39.399 --> 00:13:44.399
as in obeying the voice of the Lord.

00:13:44.799 --> 00:13:49.799
Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice

00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:55.799
and to hearken than the fat of rams.

00:13:55.799 --> 00:13:58.719
To obey is better, to obey is better.

00:13:58.719 --> 00:14:00.959
Think about the life of Joseph,

00:14:00.959 --> 00:14:02.359
a life that's well-lived,

00:14:02.359 --> 00:14:07.359
a life that here in Genesis 50 comes to an end,

00:14:07.879 --> 00:14:10.159
110 years old, and I believe it was a life

00:14:10.159 --> 00:14:13.159
that was marked by obedience.

00:14:13.159 --> 00:14:16.759
I wonder tonight if we were to examine our lives,

00:14:17.639 --> 00:14:19.479
if others were to examine our lives,

00:14:19.479 --> 00:14:23.119
would they say of us that our life is marked by obedience?

00:14:23.119 --> 00:14:26.439
Is it clear in our lives that we're obedient people,

00:14:26.439 --> 00:14:28.359
that we obey the Lord,

00:14:28.359 --> 00:14:30.519
that our life is marked by obedience,

00:14:30.519 --> 00:14:33.919
that not just occasionally they happen to obey,

00:14:33.919 --> 00:14:37.879
but they are an obedient follower of Jesus Christ?

00:14:37.879 --> 00:14:40.279
Number two this evening, the life of Joseph,

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:42.379
not only a life marked by obedience,

00:14:42.379 --> 00:14:45.439
but I would say this, a life marked by troubles,

00:14:46.459 --> 00:14:48.719
a life marked by troubles.

00:14:48.719 --> 00:14:50.359
You know, the reality this evening

00:14:50.359 --> 00:14:54.079
is that Joseph faced a number of troubles in his life.

00:14:54.079 --> 00:14:55.239
We're familiar with them,

00:14:55.239 --> 00:14:58.199
we've studied them now over these past several months

00:14:58.199 --> 00:14:59.599
of studying the book of Genesis

00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:03.039
and particularly this last portion of the book of Genesis

00:15:03.039 --> 00:15:07.079
and we find that his life had many troubles,

00:15:07.079 --> 00:15:08.599
but we find that in our lives,

00:15:08.599 --> 00:15:10.519
that our lives too have many troubles.

00:15:10.519 --> 00:15:13.039
Listen, trouble is never an excuse to disobey.

00:15:13.959 --> 00:15:16.199
Trouble is never an excuse to just quit

00:15:16.199 --> 00:15:17.239
and throw in the towel and say,

00:15:17.239 --> 00:15:18.759
you know what, it's not worth it.

00:15:18.759 --> 00:15:21.439
I got all these problems and all these troubles

00:15:21.439 --> 00:15:24.079
and no one understands and woe is me

00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:26.879
and I have a right to, no, no, no.

00:15:26.879 --> 00:15:30.159
Trouble is no excuse to disobey the Lord.

00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:33.999
Trouble is no excuse to give up on following the Lord.

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:36.599
Job says this in Job chapter 14,

00:15:36.599 --> 00:15:38.119
a verse that we're familiar with,

00:15:38.119 --> 00:15:43.119
man that is born of woman is a few days and full of trouble.

00:15:43.119 --> 00:15:45.039
And you say, man, I found that to be the case.

00:15:45.039 --> 00:15:50.039
That is my new life verse and my life is full of troubles.

00:15:51.239 --> 00:15:53.859
The reality is that trouble,

00:15:53.859 --> 00:15:56.679
sometimes we get our own selves in trouble, amen.

00:15:56.679 --> 00:15:58.839
We do crazy things and get ourselves in trouble

00:15:58.839 --> 00:16:00.919
and it's our own fault, it's our own doing.

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:04.279
But other times life just has troubles.

00:16:04.279 --> 00:16:05.519
There's just troubles in life.

00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:08.279
There are difficulties, there's those that oppose us.

00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:11.439
I think about Joseph here as we think about his life.

00:16:11.439 --> 00:16:14.799
I think about the troubles that he had with his brothers.

00:16:14.799 --> 00:16:16.759
Really, was there anything that Joseph did

00:16:16.759 --> 00:16:18.279
that resulted in that trouble?

00:16:18.279 --> 00:16:20.319
No, Joseph didn't go asking for it.

00:16:20.319 --> 00:16:23.799
Joseph didn't mess up and get himself in trouble, no.

00:16:23.799 --> 00:16:25.839
Joseph was obedient to his father.

00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:28.119
Joseph was, he was the one that received

00:16:28.159 --> 00:16:29.239
the coat of many colors.

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:30.839
He didn't go ask his dad for it.

00:16:30.839 --> 00:16:32.959
He wasn't trying to compete for it.

00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:34.439
As best we can tell from scripture,

00:16:34.439 --> 00:16:36.839
there was no competition among the brothers

00:16:36.839 --> 00:16:39.599
for who would get the trophy, if you will,

00:16:39.599 --> 00:16:41.839
be the recipient of this coat of many colors.

00:16:41.839 --> 00:16:44.039
No, Jacob bestowed it upon him

00:16:44.039 --> 00:16:46.559
because he was his really favorite son,

00:16:46.559 --> 00:16:47.879
if we're honest with scripture.

00:16:47.879 --> 00:16:50.479
And he was the son of his old age and he gave him that.

00:16:50.479 --> 00:16:51.799
And his brothers hated him

00:16:51.799 --> 00:16:54.359
and his brothers could not speak peaceably unto him.

00:16:54.359 --> 00:16:57.519
And he goes out following the command of his father.

00:16:57.519 --> 00:16:59.119
As you study through the scriptures

00:16:59.119 --> 00:17:01.599
and you find that he goes to sea

00:17:01.599 --> 00:17:04.119
to bring a report back to dad

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:07.879
and they see him afar off and they conspire against him.

00:17:07.879 --> 00:17:09.479
Let us kill him.

00:17:09.479 --> 00:17:10.599
Here comes that dreamer.

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:11.919
Let's see what's gonna happen.

00:17:11.919 --> 00:17:15.079
Let's see what's gonna come of these dreams.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:17.479
And Joseph just happens to come upon them

00:17:17.479 --> 00:17:21.079
and they snatch him and they tear that coat off of him

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:22.279
and they throw him into a pit

00:17:22.279 --> 00:17:24.079
and they're planning to kill him.

00:17:25.159 --> 00:17:26.559
They sell him into slavery.

00:17:27.519 --> 00:17:28.639
Think about those troubles.

00:17:28.639 --> 00:17:33.639
It's really nothing that he did wrong

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:34.919
that resulted in those troubles.

00:17:34.919 --> 00:17:37.279
They were just troubles that came in his life.

00:17:39.279 --> 00:17:40.639
He gets sold into slavery,

00:17:40.639 --> 00:17:42.359
ends up in Egypt in a foreign land.

00:17:42.359 --> 00:17:43.559
And we find that he's there,

00:17:43.559 --> 00:17:47.239
that he's purchased by Potiphar and he's a servant.

00:17:47.239 --> 00:17:50.759
Really he's of great position within the house of Potiphar.

00:17:50.759 --> 00:17:53.479
He says so much so that there's none greater

00:17:53.479 --> 00:17:55.079
in the house than me.

00:17:57.879 --> 00:17:59.039
What a great position.

00:18:00.159 --> 00:18:03.639
But Potiphar's wife came after him.

00:18:04.559 --> 00:18:08.359
She lied about him and he ends up in prison.

00:18:08.359 --> 00:18:10.319
He didn't do anything wrong.

00:18:10.319 --> 00:18:12.719
In fact, he did everything right.

00:18:12.719 --> 00:18:13.959
Amen?

00:18:13.959 --> 00:18:16.999
Biblically speaking, he did everything right.

00:18:19.519 --> 00:18:22.559
I often, and I said it during the message of that chapter,

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:25.999
he lost his coat, but he retained his character.

00:18:25.999 --> 00:18:29.159
Better to lose his coat and be falsely accused

00:18:29.159 --> 00:18:31.719
than to jeopardize his walk with God.

00:18:31.719 --> 00:18:34.440
He said, how then can I do this great wickedness

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.959
and sin against God?

00:18:38.279 --> 00:18:41.479
The trouble came, he ends up in prison and we understand.

00:18:41.479 --> 00:18:43.679
And again, when we think about the life of Joseph,

00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:45.799
when we think about a life marked by troubles,

00:18:45.799 --> 00:18:48.760
listen, we have troubles in our lives.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.200
Sometimes our own doing,

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.839
but many times outside of our control,

00:18:52.839 --> 00:18:54.399
just things that happen.

00:18:55.359 --> 00:18:59.959
The enemy attacking and the enemy trying to cause us

00:18:59.959 --> 00:19:02.839
to stop serving the Lord.

00:19:02.839 --> 00:19:07.719
I think about Psalm 34, it's a precious Psalm of David.

00:19:07.719 --> 00:19:11.440
David makes two powerful statements in this chapter

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.359
with regard to troubles.

00:19:13.359 --> 00:19:16.359
The first one is this in Psalm 34 in verse number six.

00:19:16.359 --> 00:19:21.000
He says, this poor man cried and the Lord heard him

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.320
and saved him out of all his troubles.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.639
Now David had some troubles that were not of his own doing.

00:19:30.599 --> 00:19:32.479
David had some troubles that were the result

00:19:32.479 --> 00:19:33.639
of his own doing.

00:19:33.639 --> 00:19:35.239
All right, really you can look at David's life

00:19:35.239 --> 00:19:37.639
in two aspects and you can see some of the troubles

00:19:37.639 --> 00:19:40.159
that David had, they're his own doing.

00:19:40.159 --> 00:19:42.919
Some of the troubles that David had, he had nothing to do.

00:19:42.919 --> 00:19:45.320
He didn't ask to be anointed to be the king.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:50.119
He didn't ask to go and to be in the place where he was

00:19:50.119 --> 00:19:51.919
there with Saul, to be hunted by Saul

00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:53.039
and all of those things.

00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:55.639
And we find that he says, this poor man cried

00:19:55.639 --> 00:19:59.239
and the Lord heard him and saved him out of.

00:19:59.239 --> 00:20:03.999
all of his troubles, but I want you to skip over, you see that in verse 6 of Psalm 34,

00:20:03.999 --> 00:20:07.959
look at verse 19 if you will.

00:20:07.959 --> 00:20:12.159
I find the truth of verse number 6, I'm actually going to back it up and look at verse 17,

00:20:12.159 --> 00:20:16.239
but I think of the truth of verse number 6 where David is sharing his testimony, he's

00:20:16.239 --> 00:20:19.999
testifying of his own personal experience.

00:20:19.999 --> 00:20:24.639
This is my experience, I had troubles but God heard me when I cried and God delivered

00:20:24.639 --> 00:20:25.639
me.

00:20:26.239 --> 00:20:33.439
The Bible says this, the righteous cry, and the Lord heareth and delivereth them out of

00:20:33.439 --> 00:20:36.159
all their troubles.

00:20:36.159 --> 00:20:41.719
Notice this verse 18, the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and save

00:20:41.719 --> 00:20:44.799
it such as be of a contrite spirit.

00:20:44.799 --> 00:20:54.039
Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.

00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:00.519
And I'm so thankful that though we have trouble in life, we have a God who is greater.

00:21:00.519 --> 00:21:03.439
We have a God who has purpose.

00:21:03.439 --> 00:21:09.719
We have a God that in the midst of the trouble he can bring to pass great things.

00:21:09.719 --> 00:21:15.039
If we simply remain faithful, if we simply remain steadfast, if we simply remain obedient

00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:19.079
and keeping our eyes on the Lord, even in the midst of the trouble and the difficulty,

00:21:19.079 --> 00:21:22.519
we can see God work.

00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:24.919
We see that in the life of Joseph.

00:21:24.919 --> 00:21:30.479
We see a man who walked with God in spite of the troubles, in spite of the difficulties.

00:21:30.479 --> 00:21:35.119
I mean I think about the time in prison and we don't know exactly how long Joseph was

00:21:35.119 --> 00:21:40.959
in prison, but we know that he was forgotten in prison for two years.

00:21:40.959 --> 00:21:45.119
How long was he in prison before the butler and the baker came into prison and had the

00:21:45.119 --> 00:21:46.119
dream?

00:21:46.119 --> 00:21:50.959
We don't know for sure the timeline, but we know that after the butler and the baker were

00:21:50.959 --> 00:21:58.519
delivered and the butler was told, remember me, and given that instruction, the text begins

00:21:58.519 --> 00:22:04.919
that two years, after two years, that's when Pharaoh had a dream.

00:22:04.919 --> 00:22:10.759
That's when the butler remembered about his experience in prison with Joseph and the dream

00:22:10.759 --> 00:22:17.239
that he had and the dream that the baker had and the interpretation thereof.

00:22:17.239 --> 00:22:21.559
We find that Joseph, during that two years, as best we can tell from Scripture, he just

00:22:21.559 --> 00:22:24.479
continued to walk with God.

00:22:24.479 --> 00:22:29.399
He just continued to do what he was supposed to do, praise the Lord, in the midst of trouble

00:22:29.399 --> 00:22:31.559
and the midst of difficulty.

00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:35.959
He didn't run a campaign, woe is me, I'm here and I don't deserve to be here and I've been

00:22:35.959 --> 00:22:39.439
falsely accused and imprisoned and so on and so forth.

00:22:39.439 --> 00:22:47.079
No, he just was obedient to the Lord and he was used of God in that place.

00:22:47.719 --> 00:22:50.799
The Bible tells us the Lord was with him.

00:22:50.799 --> 00:22:53.919
We find a life marked by obedience and a life marked by troubles.

00:22:53.919 --> 00:22:59.439
I would say this, number three, a life marked by blessing, a life marked by blessing.

00:22:59.439 --> 00:23:01.999
You want blessing in your life?

00:23:01.999 --> 00:23:08.759
Better learn to obey, amen, because the result of obedience is blessing.

00:23:08.759 --> 00:23:12.799
You say, but pastor, you just said that Joseph obeyed the Lord and there were troubles.

00:23:12.799 --> 00:23:14.759
Yeah, I did say that.

00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:21.399
Listen, not everything that we call a blessing is really a blessing.

00:23:21.399 --> 00:23:24.919
And not everything the world would identify as not being a blessing is not a blessing.

00:23:24.919 --> 00:23:30.519
I'm thankful, listen, the psalmist says that he rejoiced for being afflicted.

00:23:30.519 --> 00:23:31.679
Why?

00:23:31.679 --> 00:23:36.799
Because it was then that he learned the statutes of the Lord.

00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:40.479
Some of us wouldn't look at being afflicted as being a blessing, but I would submit to

00:23:40.479 --> 00:23:44.399
you this evening that indeed it was a blessing.

00:23:44.399 --> 00:23:50.119
Because if we learn more about our God in that time of difficulty, then to God be the

00:23:50.119 --> 00:23:55.159
glory that he allowed us to experience that.

00:23:55.159 --> 00:24:00.679
Brother Armando shared with me not long ago how that during that trial of great health

00:24:00.679 --> 00:24:06.199
trial when he was in Guatemala and thought he was going to die, how close he got to God

00:24:06.199 --> 00:24:10.199
during that time.

00:24:10.199 --> 00:24:16.199
We find this evening that we could look at the life of Joseph and yes, it's not contradictory

00:24:16.199 --> 00:24:21.319
to say that it was a life marked by troubles, but also a life marked by blessing.

00:24:21.319 --> 00:24:26.559
God knows his people, God has a plan for his people, and God blesses obedience.

00:24:26.559 --> 00:24:31.279
I begin to think about the position of Joseph.

00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:38.359
In Genesis chapter 41 and verse number 43, God tells us that Pharaoh made Joseph ruler

00:24:38.599 --> 00:24:41.759
over all the land of Egypt.

00:24:41.759 --> 00:24:47.839
When Joseph was in that pit, when Joseph was in that prison, he really didn't know that

00:24:47.839 --> 00:24:54.099
he would one day be in a palace and be the ruler over all the land of Egypt.

00:24:54.099 --> 00:24:58.079
We know that because we are familiar with the account of the life of Joseph because

00:24:58.079 --> 00:25:01.919
we've read it and we've studied it and so we're familiar with it.

00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:07.039
But I want you to, even as I mentioned this morning, consider that first read of the life

00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:08.880
of Joseph, if you will.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.440
And as you're reading the life of Joseph and you see him in the pit and you see him in

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:17.319
the prison and you see all that's taking place, and then you find how that eventually he comes

00:25:17.319 --> 00:25:24.239
to the palace, it's amazing how God orchestrated all of those circumstances.

00:25:24.239 --> 00:25:32.279
In fact, the reality is that had the butler remembered Joseph prior to the Pharaoh having

00:25:32.359 --> 00:25:37.880
the dream, the Pharaoh probably couldn't care less that there was a man in prison that could

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.559
interpret dreams.

00:25:39.559 --> 00:25:40.599
Why?

00:25:40.599 --> 00:25:45.239
He had plenty of magicians and astrologers and those that he would go to for interpreting

00:25:45.239 --> 00:25:50.359
of dreams, but it was at the very moment that he had a dream and there were none within

00:25:50.359 --> 00:25:53.799
Egypt that could interpret.

00:25:53.799 --> 00:25:58.000
The butler says, I remember.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.119
And with haste they bring Joseph and they bring him into the presence.

00:26:02.119 --> 00:26:07.079
He cleans himself up and he comes in the presence and Pharaoh says, I understand that you can

00:26:07.079 --> 00:26:09.239
interpret dreams.

00:26:09.239 --> 00:26:15.679
And Joseph says this, he says that it's not in him, it's not in me, but God shall give

00:26:15.679 --> 00:26:18.720
Pharaoh an answer of peace.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.039
What a great testimony.

00:26:21.519 --> 00:26:29.759
God brings Joseph to this place of position and we find that Pharaoh so much so in understanding

00:26:29.759 --> 00:26:36.079
the interpretation and the plan that is set forth, he says that he was going to set this

00:26:36.079 --> 00:26:38.079
man Joseph in charge.

00:26:38.079 --> 00:26:39.079
Why?

00:26:39.079 --> 00:26:46.959
Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?

00:26:46.959 --> 00:26:49.880
And he sets him in charge.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:55.720
He tells him that only in the throne would Pharaoh be greater.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.679
Joseph was 30 years old when this took place.

00:26:59.679 --> 00:27:04.160
We find that he had this blessing of a position.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:08.359
We find that God blessed him with family in the same chapter.

00:27:08.359 --> 00:27:13.000
We're told of the wife that he receives but also of his two sons and the Bible tells us

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.799
in Genesis 41 and verse 50, unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came

00:27:19.799 --> 00:27:23.839
which Asenath, the daughter of Potiphar, a priest of Ahon, bear unto him.

00:27:23.839 --> 00:27:28.359
And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh.

00:27:28.359 --> 00:27:34.239
Names meant something very significant during Bible times, sometimes still today, and some

00:27:34.239 --> 00:27:39.000
cultures names carry great significance in their meaning.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.919
Unfortunately, in many of our American culture ideas, we pick our names because we like the

00:27:45.919 --> 00:27:46.919
name.

00:27:46.919 --> 00:27:51.919
We don't want much significance or thought that is put into the particular name.

00:27:51.919 --> 00:27:54.599
We find that the Bible says that he named him Manasseh.

00:27:54.599 --> 00:27:55.599
Why?

00:27:55.599 --> 00:28:03.039
For God said he hath made me forget all my toil in all my father's house.

00:28:03.039 --> 00:28:10.739
The name of the second called Ephraim, notice this, for God hath caused me to be fruitful

00:28:10.739 --> 00:28:12.919
in the land of my affliction.

00:28:12.919 --> 00:28:15.759
Isn't that a great statement?

00:28:15.759 --> 00:28:17.919
You know, you can be fruitful.

00:28:17.919 --> 00:28:21.679
You can have the blessing of God no matter where you are.

00:28:21.679 --> 00:28:22.679
It's amazing.

00:28:22.679 --> 00:28:27.160
We've now been in Northern Virginia for 13 years and I remember many years before we

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.639
ever moved to Northern Virginia saying something like this, who would ever want to live in

00:28:30.639 --> 00:28:33.440
Northern Virginia?

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:38.440
I remember passing through this corridor on many a time visiting family, my brother's

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:43.359
station in North Carolina and we in Pennsylvania where we lived and we'd have to drive through

00:28:43.359 --> 00:28:48.919
this corridor, this 95 corridor, right, going through the beltway and all of that.

00:28:48.919 --> 00:28:52.159
And it didn't seem to matter what time of day you ever made the journey, you always

00:28:52.159 --> 00:28:55.719
figured you'd hit traffic in Northern Virginia.

00:28:55.719 --> 00:28:59.020
You always try to time it and, you know, miss the traffic.

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:01.880
People ask me now after living here all these years, how's traffic?

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:02.880
It's bad all the time.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.479
I mean, there's just really not a good time to go.

00:29:05.479 --> 00:29:07.640
It's just the way it is.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:11.799
And then you try to jump on the expressway and you might as well just, I don't know,

00:29:11.799 --> 00:29:17.599
run over your paycheck or something if you're going to pay for the tolls and it's crazy.

00:29:17.599 --> 00:29:20.359
But I remember saying, who would ever want to live there?

00:29:20.359 --> 00:29:24.559
I remember saying that, I'm being honest with you.

00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:29.520
And then I remember when God orchestrated and we found out about this church in Oakton

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:33.479
and I thought, man, I've told this story before but I thought that's a sweet little name of

00:29:33.479 --> 00:29:36.719
a town named after a tree, right, an oak tree.

00:29:36.719 --> 00:29:41.559
And in my mind's eye I had a picture of Oakton being something like what you would see in

00:29:41.559 --> 00:29:46.719
the southwestern part of our state, just kind of a quaint little town, nice little,

00:29:46.719 --> 00:29:47.719
you know, whatever.

00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:52.880
And then I looked it up on the internet and I said to Holly, this might as well be Washington,

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.119
D.C.

00:29:54.119 --> 00:29:56.359
And sure enough.

00:29:56.359 --> 00:29:59.119
But God called us here.

00:29:59.119 --> 00:29:59.279
And you know.

00:29:59.279 --> 00:30:03.879
You know, the reality is that as many people as we've met over the years, I was talking

00:30:03.879 --> 00:30:08.999
to somebody not long ago, to our children actually, in the time that we've had the

00:30:08.999 --> 00:30:14.199
privilege of being here, we've had, I believe the number now is 56 different families that

00:30:14.199 --> 00:30:16.919
have joined the church over these years.

00:30:16.919 --> 00:30:22.559
And out of the 56 families that have joined the church, 34 of them have moved away.

00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:24.859
And you begin to think about that, why, what happens?

00:30:24.859 --> 00:30:27.039
You know how many people say, I don't like it here?

00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:29.539
They want to move.

00:30:29.539 --> 00:30:32.939
That's just the idea, they get here and they say, I don't like the pace of life, I don't

00:30:32.939 --> 00:30:36.099
like this, I don't like that, so on and so forth.

00:30:36.099 --> 00:30:40.859
Listen, God has us here for a reason.

00:30:40.859 --> 00:30:42.519
God has us here for a reason.

00:30:42.519 --> 00:30:46.939
You know the world is in our backyard?

00:30:46.939 --> 00:30:50.459
The world is in our backyard.

00:30:50.459 --> 00:30:54.899
You can meet people from every continent, save Antarctica, I've never met anyone from

00:30:54.899 --> 00:31:00.599
there, but you can meet people from all over the globe.

00:31:00.599 --> 00:31:02.479
What a great opportunity.

00:31:02.479 --> 00:31:07.159
See, we need to be careful of how we view things, and we need to understand that God

00:31:07.159 --> 00:31:09.519
can bless.

00:31:09.519 --> 00:31:15.279
God has you here for a season and for a reason.

00:31:15.279 --> 00:31:20.079
And we begin to understand that this is where God wants me and this is where God has me,

00:31:20.079 --> 00:31:26.979
and as we're in the place where God has us, that God can make us fruitful and allow us

00:31:26.979 --> 00:31:29.419
to have blessing.

00:31:29.419 --> 00:31:34.819
What a joy to know that we're in the place where God has us, even if we might call it

00:31:34.819 --> 00:31:36.059
the land of our affliction.

00:31:36.059 --> 00:31:38.579
I don't refer to it that way, I love it.

00:31:38.579 --> 00:31:42.059
I never thought I would say that I love Northern Virginia, but I really did.

00:31:42.059 --> 00:31:47.739
There are certain aspects of it that drive you crazy, you just kind of get used to it.

00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:54.959
But the reality is that I'm thankful that Joseph understood that he could have the blessing

00:31:54.959 --> 00:31:58.679
of God and be fruitful in the place where he was.

00:31:58.679 --> 00:32:03.479
I think about the life marked by a blessing, even in the reunion with his family.

00:32:03.479 --> 00:32:08.439
If you were to read, and we've studied in recent weeks, the 46th and 47th chapter of

00:32:08.439 --> 00:32:14.039
the book of Genesis, when Joseph reveals his identity to his brothers and says to have

00:32:14.039 --> 00:32:19.979
dad and the family come, and it would be in the place of Egypt that Joseph would provide

00:32:19.979 --> 00:32:26.579
for them a place, and he would sustain them, and how you read of the reunion with his father,

00:32:26.579 --> 00:32:28.899
and what joy.

00:32:28.899 --> 00:32:34.859
I mean, just even looking at the reunion with his brothers, the ones who hated him, the

00:32:34.859 --> 00:32:40.099
ones that sold him into slavery, but there's a sweet reunion that God records for us in

00:32:40.099 --> 00:32:45.199
the 46th chapter of the book of Genesis, and then you read at the end where Jacob comes,

00:32:45.199 --> 00:32:53.519
and what a blessing to consider the opportunity that God gave him, and how the obedience of

00:32:53.519 --> 00:32:58.919
Joseph through his life, it's a life that's marked by a blessing.

00:32:58.919 --> 00:33:07.919
We mentioned this just a few weeks ago in Genesis chapter 49, when Jacob, dad, has all

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:09.579
the boys brought before him.

00:33:09.579 --> 00:33:15.339
He begins in verse 22, speaking of Joseph, and he says that Joseph is a fruitful bow,

00:33:15.339 --> 00:33:19.959
even a fruitful bow by a well, whose branches run over the wall.

00:33:19.959 --> 00:33:26.299
The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him, but his bow abode in

00:33:26.299 --> 00:33:28.019
strength.

00:33:28.019 --> 00:33:34.459
The arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob.

00:33:34.459 --> 00:33:38.719
On fence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel.

00:33:38.719 --> 00:33:46.999
What a blessing to think about Joseph's life, a life that's marked by a blessing.

00:33:46.999 --> 00:33:53.639
I would say finally this evening, the life of Joseph is a life that is marked by faith.

00:33:53.639 --> 00:33:55.679
Life that is marked by faith.

00:33:55.679 --> 00:34:00.359
We come to this 50th chapter, and we find that Joseph, the Bible tells us that he's

00:34:00.359 --> 00:34:06.419
110 years old, and he says to his brethren in verse 24, I die.

00:34:06.419 --> 00:34:11.219
Very similar to what we've read with regard to Jacob, knowing that he would soon die,

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:17.899
and he calls for his family to be in his presence, and he gives that final request, and puts

00:34:17.899 --> 00:34:21.019
his feet back up in bed and dies.

00:34:21.019 --> 00:34:23.499
And Joseph says to his brethren, I die.

00:34:23.499 --> 00:34:28.919
But I want you to see what Joseph says, and how we see that his life was a life marked

00:34:28.919 --> 00:34:30.119
by faith.

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:40.839
The Bible says that he says in verse 24, God will surely visit you, and bring you out of

00:34:40.839 --> 00:34:49.559
this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

00:34:49.559 --> 00:34:54.839
Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye

00:34:54.839 --> 00:34:59.439
shall carry up my bones from hence.

00:34:59.439 --> 00:35:05.799
So Joseph died being 110 years old, and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in

00:35:05.799 --> 00:35:06.799
Egypt.

00:35:06.799 --> 00:35:12.279
Begin to think about the faith of Joseph, and a life that's marked by faith.

00:35:12.279 --> 00:35:17.939
We see it in these statements, and he believed that God would do what God said he would do.

00:35:17.939 --> 00:35:23.999
He believed that God had promised to Abraham, and to Isaac, and to Jacob a land.

00:35:23.999 --> 00:35:30.199
He believed, even as God had shared with Jacob in chapter 46, before Jacob would leave

00:35:30.199 --> 00:35:37.119
that land and go to Egypt, that God said to Jacob, I am God, the God of thy father, fear

00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:41.999
not to go down into Egypt, for I will there make of thee a great nation, and I will go

00:35:41.999 --> 00:35:48.239
down with thee into Egypt, and I will also surely bring thee up again, and Joseph shall

00:35:48.239 --> 00:35:50.199
put his hand upon thine eyes.

00:35:50.199 --> 00:35:52.119
Genesis 46, three and four.

00:35:52.119 --> 00:35:56.319
And Joseph believed that.

00:35:56.319 --> 00:36:03.279
Joseph did not live long enough to see it come to pass, but his eye of faith, he says

00:36:03.279 --> 00:36:09.519
in verse number 24, and again in verse 25, notice he says, God will surely visit you.

00:36:09.519 --> 00:36:16.639
I mean, confident faith, expecting that God will do what God said he will do.

00:36:16.639 --> 00:36:22.199
Not only was he convinced that God would visit and bring the nation into the land that

00:36:22.199 --> 00:36:28.599
he promised, but he says in verse number 25 that he took an oath of them, saying, carry

00:36:28.599 --> 00:36:32.479
up my bones from hence.

00:36:32.479 --> 00:36:38.879
You know, it's not until Joshua chapter 24 that we read of that being fulfilled, and

00:36:38.879 --> 00:36:44.759
we find that after, if you think about Genesis chapter 50, and you think about the period

00:36:44.879 --> 00:36:49.399
if you enter into the book of Exodus where there's another pharaoh, another king of Egypt

00:36:49.399 --> 00:36:54.519
that rises up that doesn't know Joseph, and all that generation dies, and you begin to

00:36:54.519 --> 00:37:00.959
think about the Egyptian bondage and all that takes place, and eventually you come to the

00:37:00.959 --> 00:37:07.239
place of the Exodus and the deliverance from Egypt land, followed by what?

00:37:07.239 --> 00:37:08.559
The wilderness wanderings.

00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:13.079
Though God never intended that that would be the plan, his plan was to deliver them

00:37:13.079 --> 00:37:18.759
from Egypt into the land, because of their disobedience and lack of faith, they wandered

00:37:18.759 --> 00:37:23.559
in the wilderness, but we come to the book of Joshua, and the book of Joshua provides

00:37:23.559 --> 00:37:29.439
us with that record of the entrance into, the conquering of, the inhabiting of the land

00:37:29.439 --> 00:37:37.559
of the nation of Israel, the land of Canaan, that land of promise.

00:37:37.559 --> 00:37:42.639
And we find that as God would give to us the book of Joshua, and we find that we come to

00:37:42.639 --> 00:37:48.079
the end of the book, and the Bible tells us in verse 29 of Joshua 24, and it came to

00:37:48.079 --> 00:37:52.799
pass after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died being

00:37:52.799 --> 00:37:55.319
a hundred and ten years old.

00:37:55.319 --> 00:37:59.599
They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath Sarai, which is in Mount Ephraim

00:37:59.599 --> 00:38:04.639
on the north side of the hill of Gash, and Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua,

00:38:04.639 --> 00:38:09.079
and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works

00:38:09.079 --> 00:38:11.079
of the Lord that He had done for Israel.

00:38:11.079 --> 00:38:18.639
And notice verse 32, the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out

00:38:18.639 --> 00:38:25.639
of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of

00:38:25.639 --> 00:38:30.879
Hamor, the father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of silver, and it became the inheritance

00:38:30.879 --> 00:38:33.439
of the children of Joseph.

00:38:33.439 --> 00:38:41.319
That's a long time that passes, but Joseph's bones are taken out of Egypt.

00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:48.719
We find that they're brought into this burying place that God tells us of in Shechem, in

00:38:48.719 --> 00:38:54.119
Joshua 24 and verse 32, but I want you to think about a life marked by faith.

00:38:54.119 --> 00:38:59.319
It's interesting, for Joseph finds himself in the Hall of Faith chapter, sort of the

00:38:59.319 --> 00:39:04.519
book of Hebrews, if you will, the 11th chapter, and we'll end here this evening.

00:39:04.519 --> 00:39:08.839
We think of Hebrews chapter 11, we've often referred to this chapter as the Hall of Faith

00:39:08.839 --> 00:39:10.599
chapter.

00:39:10.599 --> 00:39:16.679
Those that, by faith, they believed God and how they were moved and what they did and

00:39:16.679 --> 00:39:25.319
so on and so forth, and we find that Joseph, the statement that we read in Genesis 50,

00:39:25.359 --> 00:39:29.599
is recorded for us in Hebrews chapter 11.

00:39:29.599 --> 00:39:35.239
It tells us this in Hebrews 11 and verse 22.

00:39:35.239 --> 00:39:43.159
By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel

00:39:43.159 --> 00:39:49.599
and gave commandment concerning his bones.

00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:53.719
By faith he believed God.

00:39:53.719 --> 00:39:58.519
The Bible tells us the just shall live by faith.

00:39:58.519 --> 00:40:00.239
Amen?

00:40:00.239 --> 00:40:05.739
The Bible tells us in this chapter, in Hebrews chapter 11 and verse number 6, without faith

00:40:05.739 --> 00:40:09.119
it is impossible to please Him.

00:40:09.119 --> 00:40:14.359
For he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that

00:40:14.359 --> 00:40:19.219
diligently seek Him.

00:40:19.219 --> 00:40:25.559
God desires that His people would live a life of faith, that we believe God.

00:40:25.559 --> 00:40:33.119
I believe the most simple definition of faith is believing God, taking God at His Word.

00:40:33.119 --> 00:40:37.599
It doesn't mean that you can understand how everything's going to work out, it just means

00:40:37.599 --> 00:40:39.279
that you believe God.

00:40:39.279 --> 00:40:47.719
I think of Paul when he's in the storm, the end of the book of Acts, and he stands and

00:40:47.719 --> 00:40:57.379
he simply says, I believe God, that it shall be as it was revealed unto me.

00:40:57.379 --> 00:41:02.539
There was an angel that stood by him and told him of the deliverance that would come to

00:41:02.539 --> 00:41:03.539
pass.

00:41:03.539 --> 00:41:07.879
And in that particular storm they were hoping and wishing for the day, they thought for

00:41:07.879 --> 00:41:13.099
sure they were all dead men, but he said, I believe God.

00:41:13.099 --> 00:41:14.099
Not one will be lost.

00:41:14.099 --> 00:41:15.099
And you know what?

00:41:15.099 --> 00:41:16.099
They made it ashore.

00:41:16.099 --> 00:41:19.919
None of them lost their lives.

00:41:19.919 --> 00:41:26.079
This evening we think about the life of Joseph, we end this wonderful book, the book of Genesis,

00:41:26.079 --> 00:41:31.719
a life that's marked by obedience, a life that's marked by troubles, a life that's marked

00:41:31.719 --> 00:41:36.099
by blessing, and a life that's marked by faith.

00:41:36.099 --> 00:41:43.479
I wonder tonight if each of us were to examine our own lives, better yet if someone to read

00:41:43.479 --> 00:41:48.539
your story, what would they walk away with?

00:41:48.539 --> 00:41:55.039
See, most of us are probably pretty glad that God didn't record our story for countless

00:41:55.039 --> 00:42:04.019
generations of people to study, amen?

00:42:04.019 --> 00:42:08.539
But if He did, how would someone conclude your life?

00:42:08.539 --> 00:42:13.159
What would the summary statements be that are made of your life?

00:42:13.839 --> 00:42:20.319
I hope that it could be said, even as it's said of Joseph, as we make these conclusion

00:42:20.319 --> 00:42:27.699
type statements, it's a life marked by obedience, troubles, yes, blessings, abundant, a life

00:42:27.699 --> 00:42:28.939
of faith.

00:42:28.939 --> 00:42:29.939
He believed God.

00:42:29.939 --> 00:42:32.899
Oh, that God would help us to have faith.

00:42:32.899 --> 00:42:37.419
Oh, that God would help us to obey Him, to just follow Him.

00:42:37.419 --> 00:42:40.739
You say, but the troubles, yes, the troubles will come.

00:42:40.739 --> 00:42:44.919
Keep your eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.

00:42:44.919 --> 00:42:45.919
He's got a plan.

00:42:45.919 --> 00:42:47.679
He does, He doeth all things well.

00:42:47.679 --> 00:42:49.679
We serve a great God.

00:42:49.679 --> 00:42:58.639
Joseph, 54 years summarized in just a few verses of Scripture, an exemplary Bible character,

00:42:58.639 --> 00:43:03.259
one in which we look at his life and we say, oh, that God would allow me to be used in

00:43:03.259 --> 00:43:04.739
like fashion.

00:43:04.739 --> 00:43:05.739
Let's pray together.

00:43:05.739 --> 00:43:07.299
Father, we love You.

00:43:07.299 --> 00:43:08.379
Thank You for loving us.

00:43:08.379 --> 00:43:11.179
Thank You for Your Word, the truth that's contained therein.

00:43:11.179 --> 00:43:13.379
We thank You for the life of Joseph.

00:43:13.379 --> 00:43:19.579
I pray, Lord, that You'd help us to be men and women of faith, men and women of obedience.

00:43:19.579 --> 00:43:21.619
Help us to be used of Thee.

00:43:21.619 --> 00:43:24.859
I pray, Lord, that in this moment of invitation that You'd have Your will and way.

00:43:24.859 --> 00:43:28.719
Lord, maybe there's someone that's been living in disobedience, Lord, someone that's tried

00:43:28.719 --> 00:43:30.899
to justify some of their disobedience.

00:43:30.899 --> 00:43:36.579
Oh, I pray, Holy Spirit, that You'd convict them and help them, Lord, to respond not by

00:43:36.579 --> 00:43:39.939
justification but respond with confession.

00:43:39.939 --> 00:43:42.099
Lord, help us to have faith.

00:43:42.099 --> 00:43:43.579
Help us to live by faith.

00:43:43.579 --> 00:43:46.579
I pray that You'd increase our faith.

00:43:46.579 --> 00:43:47.579
Help us to believe You.

00:43:47.579 --> 00:43:51.859
I pray that You'd move and work as only You can for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:43:51.859 --> 00:43:52.859
Would You stand with me?

00:43:52.859 --> 00:43:53.859
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:43:53.859 --> 00:43:58.779
Holly's going to play quietly on the piano, and as she does, the altar is open.
