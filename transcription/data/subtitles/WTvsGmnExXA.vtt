WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920
what a blessing to be able to regularly, daily study the Word of God and to be able to be

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.960
encouraged and strengthened through the truth that is contained therein.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.399
And so this morning, as will be in the book of Colossians chapter number 2, we'll be looking

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:16.340
at verses 8 through 10.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.780
And as you find your place there, we noted last week that there's a danger that is exposed

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.680
in verse number 4 that is further developed in verse number 8.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.700
Last week, we studied verses 4 through 7, and we dealt with that initial comment when

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.900
Paul says in verse number 4,

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.639
And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:43.200
And as we looked at that verse of Scripture, we understood that there was a word of caution

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.000
that the Apostle Paul would give to the believers in Colossae.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.680
And one of the aspects of the ministry of the Apostle Paul was to warn every man.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.799
He mentions that, of course, in Colossians chapter number 1.

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:56.279
You don't need to turn there, but I want to read a verse to you in Acts chapter number

00:00:56.279 --> 00:01:02.479
20, when the Apostle Paul is meeting with the church leaders from the church at Ephesus.

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.440
And Paul says this in Acts 20 and verse number 31.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.440
He says,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.440
Therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn everyone

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.540
night and day with tears.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.599
And so Paul understood the importance of this aspect of ministry as he's sharing the truth

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:24.400
with the believers in Ephesus, with the church leaders there.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.599
He makes them aware of the fact that there would come in, he says in verse 29,

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:35.199
For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:36.199
the flock.

00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:40.199
These false teachers that would be there, of course, we understand this.

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:44.599
We've been studying the book of Colossians, that they're there in Colossae, they're active.

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:50.440
And it is important that as we look at the truth of the Word of God that we understand

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.959
contained therein, not only does God reveal to us attributes concerning Himself, the plan,

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:01.959
the way in which He created, the plan of redemption, so on and so forth, but we find there are

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.959
many warnings contained therein.

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:09.600
I was reading this morning in my personal devotions to the history of Israel and looking

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.919
at the kings of Israel in particular, and how sad to read how that God would send prophet

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:22.559
after prophet, but yet they would not hear the message from the Word of God, from the

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.000
truth of the prophets as they would proclaim that message.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.559
Of course, Israel would be taken away into Assyrian captivity.

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:33.279
I read about that this morning, and how sad that is, for that was not the plan of God.

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:39.139
Yet because of the disobedience of the people of God and a lack to heed the warning and

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:46.940
to receive the reproof and the correction, we find that they dealt with these consequences

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.139
of being carried into captivity.

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:54.500
I wonder this morning, as we think about this aspect of the Apostle Paul ministering to

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.100
the believers in Colossae, and I think about the aspect of warning, and it's important

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.559
that we would review and understand the warning that is being issued, but more importantly

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:09.479
really is how we respond to warning.

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:14.360
How is it that we respond when someone would issue a warning to us?

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.839
Do we take heed to that warning, or do we just say, well, that's not really important

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:22.320
for me, not something I need to be concerned about, I've got this figured out.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.520
And the reality is that our response to the warning is of significant importance.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.320
As I think about the believers in Colossae, and I think about the receiving of this letter

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.440
that we refer to as the Book of Colossians, and in my mind's eye I see that they're receiving

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.759
and reviewing and reading this short epistle, and as they're reading the Word of God, I

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:51.160
wonder this morning how the people in the church at Colossae responded to the content

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.479
that is before us this morning.

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:58.720
We know, and we've often repeated in the last several weeks in particular, that spiritual

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.139
growth is the best defense against false teaching.

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:07.000
We made that known as we looked at the challenge that the Apostle Paul would give to these

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.720
believers in Colossae in verses 6 and 7.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.559
He challenged them with regard to their walk, he challenged them with regard to their growth,

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:17.760
and he challenged them with regard to their gratitude.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.859
And we find that as Paul would give them the truth, and as he would challenge them with

00:04:22.859 --> 00:04:29.019
regard to spiritual growth, it's imperative that we today are growing spiritually.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:33.059
That we do not flounder around, that we do not just get comfortable, but that we're ever

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:39.299
desiring to grow to know the Lord Jesus Christ in a more intimate way to understand the truth

00:04:39.299 --> 00:04:45.239
of the Word of God, and that we would seek His face regularly, desiring to grow.

00:04:45.239 --> 00:04:46.859
Notice what Paul says in the Book of Ephesians.

00:04:46.859 --> 00:04:51.500
You can hold your place in the Book of Colossians, but notice in Ephesians chapter number 4,

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.619
the Apostle Paul is giving truth to these believers with regard to the way in which

00:04:56.619 --> 00:05:00.700
the Lord has gifted the church, the offices, if you will.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.700
And he says in verse number 11, and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:11.619
and some pastors and teachers, and then he tells us why he did that, for the perfecting

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:17.339
of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:21.540
we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.619
perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:31.859
Notice verse 14, that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried

00:05:31.859 --> 00:05:37.540
about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.179
lie in wait to deceive.

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:46.500
Remember it was there in Colossians 2 and verse number 4 that Paul said, this I say,

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.820
lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.779
Verse number 8 of Colossians 2, we'll be looking at verses 8 through 10 this morning.

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:00.739
It begins by saying, beware.

00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:05.579
I wonder this morning how we respond to this word, beware.

00:06:05.579 --> 00:06:12.299
Or this morning, when you see maybe a warning sign, you see beware, I wonder what goes through

00:06:12.299 --> 00:06:17.399
your mind, what your initial reaction is to seeing that word.

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:22.980
As I look in the Word of God and I think about this word, beware, it causes me to stop, to

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.940
pause and to really consider the significance of that which would follow and to ensure that

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.700
we would take heed to this message.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.619
We understand that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God and it's profitable

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:36.459
and what a blessing that is.

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:41.059
We look at a text of Scripture like this, which is before us this morning, and it begins

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:42.260
with this beware.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:48.059
I want to pay special attention and I want to be certainly clear as to what it is that

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:52.299
God is seeking to communicate to us through the Word of God.

00:06:52.299 --> 00:06:56.700
If you are taking notes, we've simply entitled the message this morning, Beware.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.700
Beware.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:04.940
Notice in verse 8 of Colossians 2, the Bible says this, beware lest any man spoil you through

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:12.299
philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world,

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:15.179
and not after Christ.

00:07:15.179 --> 00:07:23.179
For in him, in Christ, dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and ye are complete

00:07:23.179 --> 00:07:28.660
in him which is the head of all principality and power.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.140
You'll be mindful of the fact as we've studied the book of Colossians that in Colossians

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:37.380
chapter number 1, really beginning in verse number 14 and 15 in there, down through verse

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:44.380
number 19, you really read as to how the Apostle Paul exalted the Lord Jesus Christ and here

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:51.140
once again in verses 9 and 10, he's reminding these believers in Colossae of the person

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:56.899
of Jesus Christ, of who he is, God in flesh, and what a blessing it is to know the Lord

00:07:56.899 --> 00:07:58.420
Jesus Christ.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.700
We are complete in him.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:04.820
We of course have used for our theme throughout this year that thought from verse number 10,

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.339
complete in Christ.

00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:14.540
And I'm so thankful that in him, in Christ, dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.500
Remember in Colossians 1 and verse number 19, it says that it pleased the Father that

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.459
in him, in Christ, should all fullness dwell.

00:08:23.459 --> 00:08:25.260
Let's look at the passage of Scripture this morning.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:30.880
If you're taking notes, I want you to notice first of all the enemy and their approach.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.539
The enemy and their approach.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:38.380
The Bible tells us to beware, to take heed, and I'm so thankful that the Lord is faithful

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.179
to instruct his people.

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:46.619
I'm so thankful that the omnipotent, omniscient God has given us a book that enables us to

00:08:46.619 --> 00:08:49.799
be aware of the approach of the enemy.

00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:54.880
Not only does it allow us to know that we have an enemy, but God is faithful to tell

00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.440
us and to instruct us, to warn us as to how the enemy operates.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:05.239
And we see here in this text of Scripture and we understand the enemy and their approach

00:09:05.239 --> 00:09:13.320
and we notice that it says beware, and notice what the Bible says, lest any man spoil you.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.280
Lest any man spoil you.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.559
It's an interesting phraseology, the phrase there, spoil you.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:25.200
It has the idea of to carry one off as a captive.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.039
To carry one off as a captive.

00:09:29.039 --> 00:09:35.000
To lead away from the truth and subject to one's way.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.359
Now think about that.

00:09:36.359 --> 00:09:40.780
The Lord Jesus Christ, he said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.239
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:09:43.239 --> 00:09:47.640
I'm thankful that he's given us a body of doctrine, the truth of the Word of God, and

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:52.960
I'm thankful that he has been faithful to preserve his Word throughout the generations

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.159
and that we have in our hand this morning the complete canon of Scripture.

00:09:57.159 --> 00:09:59.960
But we find that he says beware, lest any man...

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:05.480
And there are individuals in our world today, just as there were during the first century,

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:13.840
that were active and operating there in Colossae that sought to spoil these believers, to carry

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.520
them away.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:21.000
We find that the Bible tells us in verse number four, as we mentioned, that this truth is

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.400
started there, this danger is exposed, and then further developed in verse number eight.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:32.360
And you'll notice the contrast and really the progression, maybe is a better word, the

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.720
progression of what these false teachers seek to do.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.400
And you notice in verse number four, the Bible says, this I say, lest any man should beguile

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.360
you with enticing words.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:49.560
Now it's interesting that in verse number four, the word of God says, beguile you.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:55.560
But yet when we come to verse number eight, we find the word of God says, spoil you.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:00.400
Before they can spoil you, they have to beguile you.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:07.040
And if they've beguiled you, you can rest assured that their desire is to spoil you.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:12.360
They're not content with simply beguiling you, they desire to spoil you.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:17.400
And we find that that word, as we noticed last week, the idea of beguile you is to deceive

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.400
by false reasoning.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.280
And we understood that the Bible said that it was, that they would use, lest any man

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:29.720
should beguile you with enticing words, that speech that would be adapted to persuade.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:34.120
I mentioned last week as we were looking at that passage of Scripture that the false teacher

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.020
does not come upon the scene and announce that he's a false teacher.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:43.400
He does not make clear that he is a false teacher, no rather, he would come in and seek

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:49.080
to wax eloquent, to use the same terminology that we're familiar with, but mean something

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.040
entirely different.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:56.760
We find that Paul is issuing this warning to the believers in Colossae, and he says,

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:06.280
beware, lest any man spoil you, literally to carry one off as a captive.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:11.000
You think about the imagery of this word, and you think about the military context in

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.320
which would be used, and even as we looked last week as Paul would commend the believers

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:20.600
in Colossae that he said to them that he was beholding their order in verse number 5, and

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.720
their steadfastness of your faith in Christ, and we mentioned how that Paul was likening

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.260
them to an orderly army.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:34.560
But in that same use of those terminologies and understanding the military aspect in which

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.200
he is referring to in verse number 5, when you look in verse number 8 and you think about

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.680
a man being carried away, spoiled.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:48.080
And here this morning, we find that he says, beware, lest any man spoil you, and then notice

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.520
that word through.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.260
Here's how they seek to do it.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:13:00.080
God gives us these four truths in this single verse of Scripture with regard to the approach

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.320
of the enemy.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.760
We've said that here as we look at verse number 8, we're dealing with the enemy and their

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.040
approach.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.160
It's good to know that you have an enemy.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.760
But I'm telling you what, when you know how they operate, when you know their approach,

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.540
it certainly helps you.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.200
It gives you an advantage, amen?

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.520
When you know the approach, you know how they're going to operate, you understand what

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:28.720
they seek to do, and we find that Paul says, number one, through philosophy.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.840
Through philosophy.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.560
Love of wisdom.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.560
We understand that this wisdom that would be spoken of through this passage of Scripture

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:43.400
taken in context and understanding the false teachers and even understanding the time in

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:49.800
which these individuals in Colossae would be using this philosophy, it is not the wisdom

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.960
of God, it is worldly wisdom.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.100
It is human philosophy.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:58.280
It reminds me of what Paul dealt with back in Acts chapter number 17, if you want to

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:02.960
hold your place there in the book of Colossians, and journey over to Acts chapter number 17,

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.680
you'll be mindful that it was in this passage of Scripture, in Acts 17, that as Paul is

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:13.200
traveling, that they come to Thessalonica, they then go to Berea, and the Bible tells

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.700
us that Paul is then sent away to go to Athens.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:21.960
And while Paul was waiting in Athens, the Bible tells us that his spirit was stirred

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.960
in him.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.960
Why?

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.320
Because he saw a city that was wholly given to idolatry.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.920
But here within the text of Scripture, in Acts 17, God reveals something interesting

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.840
to us about the Athenians.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.380
Notice in verse number 21 of Acts 17, it says for all the Athenians and strangers which

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:47.020
were there, spent their time in nothing else, look at this, but either to tell or to hear

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:50.580
some new thing.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:55.940
The philosophers of this particular era, and the philosophies that they would seek to promote,

00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:01.500
and we understand that they were separated from God, that they did not use the truth

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:07.740
of God's Word that had been handed down, it was human wisdom, it was human philosophy.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:15.660
James warns us in James chapter number 3 about this human philosophy, of this human wisdom,

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:21.220
if you will, and in James chapter number 3, notice what the Word of God says, and beginning

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:26.820
really in verse number 13, you'll be mindful that it's in chapter number 1 of the book

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:33.140
of James, that God says, if any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth all men liberally

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.140
and upbraideth not.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:39.020
Aren't you thankful for God that is the all-wise God that will give you wisdom, that will give

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.020
me wisdom?

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:44.940
Can I tell you this morning that you have to recognize that you lack it before you're

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:48.380
ever going to ask for it.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:54.380
Some people have a hard time acknowledging that they lack wisdom, honestly, but we need

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:55.700
the wisdom of God.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:16:00.820
Look in James 3 and verse 13, notice what the Bible says, who is a wise man and endued

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.620
with knowledge among you?

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:07.060
Let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom, but if you

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:12.860
have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, lie not against the truth.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:21.500
This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, and devilish.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:25.660
For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work, but the wisdom

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:33.220
that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:38.380
mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.260
I'm thankful for the wisdom that cometh from above.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:46.660
I'm thankful to have a relationship with the God of heaven, the omniscient one.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.580
I'm thankful to have the Word of God, the mind of Christ.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:55.300
This morning we're mindful of what Paul said there in the book of Romans, in Romans chapter

00:16:55.300 --> 00:17:03.660
one, when the Bible says in verse 22, professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:07.140
I think that we see that in our day and age in which we're living.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.580
Amen.

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:13.780
Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:20.260
We find that Paul says, how is it that these false teachers are going to seek to spoil

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.260
you?

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.820
They're going to use philosophy.

00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:33.580
Back in Colossians chapter two, the second phrase that Paul uses is, vain deceit, empty,

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.340
void of truth.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:40.780
We mentioned how that he used the phraseology in verse number four, lest any man should

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:48.580
beguile you with enticing words, speech that is adapted to persuade, specious discord leading

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.500
others into error.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:55.540
And we find that here in verse number eight, Paul would use this phraseology and he would

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.180
say it's vain deceit.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:04.020
So we find that he says that it's going to be empty, void of truth.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:09.220
Notice as we continue to look through this passage of Scripture and see how it is that

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.980
these false teachers would seek to spoil you.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:21.260
Number three, after the tradition of men, the tradition of men, that which is handed

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:25.100
down a precept or an ordinance of man.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:29.100
I would say this as you study the gospel records that you would find that the Pharisees and

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:34.340
Sadducees were really good at this.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:38.780
Your fathers say, but God's Word says.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.980
What say ye?

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:45.980
We find that Jesus would very wisely interact with the Pharisees and the Sadducees and he

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:53.020
would challenge them with regard to their rules and their traditions versus what saith

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.740
the Lord.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:19:01.020
We find that here Paul is saying to these believers in Colossae, I want you to understand.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.020
I want you to beware.

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:10.780
I want you to take heed lest any man spoil you, literally carry you away as captive.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:15.860
And here's how they're going to seek to do it through philosophy, vain deceit, the tradition

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:16.860
of men.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:22.260
Notice number four, after the rudiments of the world.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.220
After the rudiments of the world.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:29.980
Really the idea of rudiment is something that is primary or fundamental, a fundamental principle

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:33.160
of any art, science, or discipline.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.460
If you want to think about rudiments, you can think about the alphabet, ABCs, right?

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.020
You know, you think about the little kids in preschool, kindergarten, that they're learning

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.140
how to say their ABCs.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:48.140
And the reality is that that is a really row education, if you will.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.320
It's some kind of memorization that you do.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.820
And we find here that he's speaking about these rudiments.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:59.980
Now, it's interesting because it's a fundamental principle of any art, science, or discipline.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.620
And it's interesting that Paul would use this phraseology

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.820
because these deceivers,

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.740
these false teachers in Colossae,

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.160
they were coming against the Colossians

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.000
and they were saying,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.420
well, we have this higher level of wisdom.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:19.380
We have these mysteries that we want to make you aware of.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.540
And Paul refers to their teachings

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.980
as being rudimentary, if you will,

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.620
the rudiments of the world.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.660
No doubt, as we look at this passage of Scripture

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.980
and we think about these four areas

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:37.040
and we find the phraseology rudiments of the world,

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.100
our mind, at least for me,

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.420
my mind immediately goes to the truth

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.780
that God has given us with regard to the world

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:44.820
in which we live.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.540
The world system, the philosophy and the logic

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.740
and reasoning of the world in which we live.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.860
You understand this morning

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.820
that if you have a biblical worldview,

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.140
you are as opposite of this world

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.580
as you could possibly be.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.640
Honestly, what has influenced your worldview?

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.740
Honestly, has it been this book?

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:13.540
I hope this morning you'd say,

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.540
yeah, it's the Word of God that's influenced my worldview.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.420
And when I think about the things that are going on

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.420
in the society today in which we live

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:23.980
being things different than that

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.140
which the believers in Colossae would deal with

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.500
and each generation faces its own circumstances

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.580
and difficulties in which they deal with

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.540
and we would think about the day and age

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.540
in which we're living

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:37.300
and I wonder how the philosophy of the world,

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.300
the rudiments of the world, has it influenced us?

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:44.260
Can we defend our position biblically

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:49.100
when we think about the key issues of the day

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.340
in which we're dealing with,

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.940
the social issues in which we're dealing with

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:56.580
when you think about all of the current events,

00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:01.260
if you will, remember the Word of God is eternal.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.780
The Word of God is relevant for every generation.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.260
And therefore, as we begin to look at the social issues

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.820
of the day in which we deal with,

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.740
and oh, they are many,

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:15.580
we would find that the Word of God must be our guide.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.580
The Word of God must be that

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.740
which would develop our worldview.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.780
You understand that it's probably

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:26.220
not gonna be the most popular, but that's okay.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.100
It's never been popular.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.180
I'd rather be right than popular.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:34.940
Amen?

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.820
I'd rather please God than man.

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.780
I'm gonna stand before God one day and so are you.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.380
What's man gonna do to us?

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:51.180
I'll say like preacher of yesteryear said,

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.820
when the man pulled the gun on him, D.L. Moody,

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.540
you can't threaten me with heaven.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.020
I mean, really, that's the worst thing

00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.260
that man could do to you.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:01.860
We're gonna stand before God one day.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.940
I'd rather please him than man.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.620
But think about this rudiments of the world.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.060
Turn over, if you will, to the book of James.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:08.940
We've been there once,

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.300
we'll visit James again, chapter number four.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:17.580
He says the rudiments of the world,

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:20.660
this is the way in which the false teachers

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:22.620
are going to seek to spoil you,

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.380
to carry you off as one captive

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.260
through their philosophy, their vain deceit,

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.060
tradition of men, rudiments of the world.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.620
Notice in James four in verse number four,

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.340
ye adulterers and adulteresses.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:38.420
That's an exciting greeting, is it not?

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.260
Say man, that's not politically correct.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.900
Most of the Bible isn't.

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:44.900
Amen?

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.340
I mean, honestly, there are countries around the world

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.420
that are seeking to imprison men of God

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.020
for preaching the word of God.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.380
Ye adulterers and adulteresses,

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:02.380
know ye not that the friendship of the world

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.940
is enmity with God?

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:10.540
Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:12.540
is the enemy of God.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.260
You say, Pastor, isn't that a little strong?

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:15.420
That's the word of God.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:17.980
That's the word of God.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.540
You say, well, I felt like I was kind of dabbling

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:23.940
over here a little bit and listening to this a little bit.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.460
Listen to James four four.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.820
He's speaking about spiritual adultery.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.100
Have you ever read the book of Hosea?

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.020
What a great picture of spiritual adultery

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:37.820
that God is giving through the prophet Hosea

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.980
in his own relationship with regard to how

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:44.220
the nation of Israel had left God

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.420
and served all kinds of idols.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.380
Jeremiah deals with it in Jeremiah chapter number three

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:54.380
about that spiritual adultery.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.780
And here we find that in the New Testament

00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:00.020
that God would say that, listen,

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:05.020
that friendship of the world is enmity with God.

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.500
Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.980
is the enemy of God.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.780
I don't want to be the enemy of God.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:13.580
Amen?

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.700
First John chapter number two,

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.060
notice what the Bible says with regard to this world,

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:23.820
this world's philosophy that's being spoken of here,

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.020
the rudiments of the world.

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.860
In first John chapter number two in verse number 15,

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:32.980
love not the world,

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:35.780
neither the things that are in the world.

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.060
If any man love the world,

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.620
the love of the Father is not in him

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.220
for all that is in the world.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:41.980
The love that is in the world,

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.980
the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.700
and the pride of life is not of the Father,

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:46.540
but is of the world.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.100
Notice verse 17,

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:52.580
and the world passeth away and the lust thereof.

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:56.580
But he that doeth the will of God abideth forever.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.580
The four aspects in Colossians two

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:02.100
in which we notice the enemy in his approach,

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.060
the enemy in their approach,

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.940
how is it that they're going to seek to spoil you?

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.220
Why is it that believers in Colossae

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.460
that we today at Fellowship Baptist Church,

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:13.940
why is it that we need to take heed?

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.020
Why do we need to be aware?

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.420
Well, because there's some false teachers.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.740
The enemy is active,

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:22.820
just as he was there in Colossae.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:25.140
And he says the enemy desires to spoil you,

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.820
to carry you away captive,

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:27.980
and here's his approach.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:28.860
Here's what he's gonna do.

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:30.540
Through philosophy, vain deceit,

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:31.860
tradition of men,

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.380
the rudiments of the world.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.180
Notice the last phrase of verse number eight.

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:40.420
And not after Christ.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.020
And not after Christ.

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.380
I'm so thankful for the teachings

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.540
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:50.060
I'm so thankful for the teachings of the Bible.

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:51.900
We understand even as we've mentioned

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.100
in previous messages,

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.300
how that false religions, cults if you will,

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.020
these false teachers have one thing in common,

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:03.500
and that is their attack upon the person of Jesus Christ.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.580
And we find that as we would understand

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.260
the truth of the Word of God,

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.300
and we would understand the information,

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.980
the warning that is being given

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.900
to these believers in Colossae.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:17.540
Paul says, beware, lest any man spoil you,

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:20.300
the enemy and their approach.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.140
I believe this morning that by reading

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:22.980
verse number eight,

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.620
we gain a valuable advantage.

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.660
Because we can begin to understand

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:32.280
and maybe a better sense as to how it is

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.600
that the enemy will operate.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.540
How it is that these false teachers

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.380
will seek to not only beguile you,

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.940
but to spoil you.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.780
You say, not me, not me.

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.500
Oh, beware.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.180
Beware.

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:48.780
I can listen to this stuff,

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.740
and I can watch this stuff,

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:51.820
and I can...

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.980
Beware.

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.780
Beware.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.740
They make it sound good.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.780
They make it sound truth.

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.700
But it's void of truth.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.060
They mean something entirely different.

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:09.140
You read the words of these false teachers,

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:11.100
and you read what it is that they're saying,

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.860
and they mean something entirely different

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.780
than what you've been taught biblically.

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:19.580
From what the Word of God would teach.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.100
We find that in verses 9 and 10,

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:25.420
Paul would once again give two powerful truths

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.380
for these believers.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.500
A desire that they would understand, of course,

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.820
as he would share with them this great warning

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:32.780
in verse number eight

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.860
that would teach them the approach of the enemy.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.300
He says this,

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.020
speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:38.980
in verse number 9,

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.540
for in Him dwelleth all the fullness

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:44.380
of the Godhead bodily.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.180
Isn't that wonderful?

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:48.060
The songwriter said,

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.500
Christ is all I need.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.820
All, all I need.

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:55.620
And He is.

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.020
And I'm so thankful

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.540
that the Word of God reveals to us

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.260
who the Lord Jesus Christ is.

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:04.980
Think about this truth when it says,

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:08.300
for in Him dwelleth all the fullness

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.620
of the Godhead bodily.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:10.820
Go over to the book of John.

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:11.860
You're familiar with the passage

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:14.460
in John 1.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.260
In John 1, verses 1-3,

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.380
the Bible gives us great truth

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.140
with regard to the incarnation of Jesus Christ.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.020
And I'm so thankful that in Him

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:26.700
dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:30.180
This is the plan of God from ages past

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.660
as we find in 1 Peter 1.

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.700
As we find in Ephesians 1.

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.020
But here in John 1,

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:38.380
the Bible says in the beginning

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:41.300
was the Word.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:44.740
Is Word in your Bible capitalized?

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.060
Amen.

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:49.380
And the Word was with God,

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.540
and the Word was God.

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.620
The same was in the beginning with God.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.340
All things were made by Him,

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:59.180
and without Him was not anything made

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:00.180
that was made.

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.720
Notice, if you would, skip down to verse number 14,

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:06.760
and the Word, is it still capitalized in your Bible?

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:07.940
Amen.

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:14.940
And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:19.200
Literally, the idea is to tabernacle amongst us.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.520
The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us,

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.180
and we beheld His glory,

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:26.380
the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:31.880
full of grace and truth.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.300
The Bible says in verse 17,

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:34.880
"...for the law was given by Moses,

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.420
but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:39.100
No man hath seen God at any time.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.300
The only begotten Son,

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.960
which is the bosom of the Father,

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.720
He hath declared it."

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.560
We may know already as we've studied

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.680
through Colossians 1 how the Lord Jesus Christ

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:53.140
manifested God to man.

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:56.020
And we find that Paul would remind these believers

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.700
as he would give them the warning of verse number 8

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.980
and understand the approach of the enemy.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.820
He says, I want to remind you,

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.500
we already looked at this previous

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.420
because in Colossians 1,

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.260
I mean, he dealt with the exalted Christ.

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.100
I said this when I preached

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.700
through that passage of Scripture,

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.100
that in just that few number of verses,

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.780
you'd be hard-pressed to find any four

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.780
or five-verse passage of Scripture

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.580
in all of the New Testament

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.700
that would be as powerful as you find in Colossians 1

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:27.700
to exalt the person of Jesus Christ.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:31.060
I mean, Paul just really in an eloquent way,

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:33.740
we understand all Scripture is given by inspiration of God

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.060
and what power it is,

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:38.460
and so Paul is going to remind these believers,

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:41.700
listen, the enemy has a desire to beguile you

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:42.940
and to spoil you,

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.140
but remember that in Him, in Christ,

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.540
with all the fullness of the Godhead bodily,

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:49.500
and furthermore, verse number 10,

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:54.660
ye are complete in Him.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:57.180
If you are complete in Him,

00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:01.020
why are you looking for anything else?

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.820
If something is complete,

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.140
we don't need to add anything to it.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.900
Correct?

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.900
I love the imagery of the artwork

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.860
of our theme this year with the puzzle pieces.

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:13.740
I hate puzzles.

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.100
But I love the artwork.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.820
Ed and Jackie are sitting over in the fellowship hall

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.140
and Ed loves puzzles.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.940
And folks from the congregation regularly

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.420
will bring Ed a puzzle and say,

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.020
we left a puzzle in there for Ed

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.100
if you can make sure he gets it.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.580
I don't know, I can't remember for sure.

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:35.580
He was up somewhere 35, 40 puzzles he's done this winter.

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.860
I said, I've not done 35 or 40 puzzles in all my life.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:41.060
Unless you want to count the ones

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.300
that you do with the little toddlers

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.420
that are eight-piece puzzles,

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.900
those are my kind of puzzles, amen?

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.580
I mean, 500-piece, 1,000-piece puzzles,

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:52.660
oh my word, I don't have time for that.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:53.940
You think about a puzzle.

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.180
Have you ever gotten near the end,

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.060
you had 499 pieces in place

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.340
and you did not find the 500-piece?

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:01.380
Make you want to cry.

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:04.140
If you're a woman.

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:07.140
I won't tell you what it wants you to do if you're a man.

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:10.140
That puzzle would find somewhere to go, amen?

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:14.180
But the reality is that if you have that 500th piece

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:17.580
and you put it in there and it's complete,

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.580
do you continue to look for more pieces?

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:23.340
It'd be kind of foolish, wouldn't it not?

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:24.180
Why?

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:26.140
The puzzle is complete.

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:27.780
I don't need any more pieces.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:31.860
Johnny comes in and says, I found a piece, I found a piece.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.980
It's for a different puzzle.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.460
Because this one is complete.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.980
And Paul says to these believers in Colossae,

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.340
not only the truth that in him, in Christ,

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.420
will let all the fullness of the Godhead bodily,

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:47.020
but he says to these believers,

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:51.860
and ye are complete in him.

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:55.100
These false teachers that want to come

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.620
and tell you that there's something new

00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:00.860
and something more and some mystery and some philosophy.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.580
No, no, I'm complete in Christ.

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.780
He has given me the complete canon of Scripture.

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.460
I'm just going to go ahead and study the Bible.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:09.900
I'm just going to allow the word of God

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.060
to determine my worldview.

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.860
I'm not going to listen to the popular beliefs of the day.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.100
I'm not going to be entertained

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:18.260
by the talking heads of the media.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:22.700
And I'm not going to allow Hollywood to impact my worldview.

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.260
It's the word of God.

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:26.380
But it's not popular.

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.860
That's okay.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:28.700
It's right.

00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:32.420
He says, you're complete in him, in Christ.

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.860
Notice again, how he exalts the Lord,

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:39.860
which is the head of all principality and power.

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:45.620
And power, not the head of some, but the head of all.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.580
He is superior.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:50.500
Look at the book of Hebrews.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:51.500
We studied that last year.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:52.700
Christ is better.

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:53.540
Better than what?

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.860
Doesn't matter what you put on the other side.

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:55.820
Christ is better.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:59.380
Doesn't matter how much you put on the other side.

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.540
Christ is better.

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.740
And ye are complete in him.

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.020
We've noticed this morning,

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.980
the enemy and their approach.

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:12.980
Number two, the examination and our acknowledgement.

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.140
Really, as I look at this passage of scripture,

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.540
as I would use this second point this morning,

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:23.460
and by the way, the message only has two points today.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:28.100
You would find, I believe, that really this idea,

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.340
this final section of our message this morning

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.220
is dealing with the application of God's word.

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:36.860
So important to apply the word of God.

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.340
We're to be doers of the word and not hearers only.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:41.220
I think about these believers in Colossae,

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.620
as I said by way of introduction this morning,

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.060
they would receive a warning,

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:48.420
and certainly it's important to understand the warning,

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.940
but you gotta apply it.

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.100
You have to take heed to it.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:57.620
Perhaps you've witnessed or experienced a situation,

00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:00.540
a circumstance in life where someone did something

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.820
that caused some type of bodily injury

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:04.580
or harm to themselves or someone else,

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:06.100
and you said, didn't you know?

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.740
And they said, yeah, I knew.

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:09.340
I mean, I warned you.

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.460
I told you that this was gonna happen.

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:14.220
But what happened?

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.060
They didn't take heed.

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:20.780
Perhaps they thought they could complete the task

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:24.660
without that adverse thing taking place.

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.140
And we find here this morning

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:29.220
that as we would think about the enemy and their approach,

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:32.420
that it's important that we, as believers today,

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.020
that we would go through a process of examination

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.580
and then make an acknowledgement.

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:39.060
The believers in Colossae, I believe this morning,

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.060
had to examine themselves.

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.460
Living in the midst of these false teachers

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:47.700
and all that was going on and how active they were

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.620
there in Colossae, they had to examine themselves,

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:53.180
but then I believe that they had to do this.

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:55.460
They had to be able to determine

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.660
if they had been impacted by these false teachers,

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:02.540
the examination and their acknowledgement.

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:08.180
It's good to know that the false teachers exist.

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.940
It's good to know their approach.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.740
It's not so fun to make an examination

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.580
or an evaluation of our own lives

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.460
because the reality is that most of us

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.300
don't wanna go through that process.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:27.500
Most of us don't really wanna know

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:32.460
how the false teachers have influenced or impacted us.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:37.180
We may not desire to know truthfully this morning

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:41.260
how it is that maybe what part of the path we're on

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:44.420
in the enemy's attack in our lives.

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.020
We mentioned in verse number four, he says,

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:52.580
beguile you, that deception by false teaching.

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:54.980
And then he says in verse number eight,

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:58.660
it would spoil you to carry off as a captive.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:03.660
As you examine your life, as these believers in Colossae

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.060
would evaluate and examine their lives,

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:08.820
as they would take the truth of that

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.540
which is being presented to them,

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:13.500
they must sit down and examine and say,

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:14.820
has it influenced me?

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:19.380
Have they deceived me?

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.700
I mentioned last week as we looked at verse number four,

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:22.940
lest any man beguile you.

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.620
I don't like being deceived.

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:28.020
Most people don't.

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.660
I don't like it when someone lies to me.

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:31.820
Do you?

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:32.820
No way, man.

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.660
You find out, maybe you've gone down a path a little ways

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:40.740
and you find out at some point that you've been deceived,

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:44.900
that this individual or this group of individuals

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.300
that they have deceived you.

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.620
And that's aggravating.

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:52.500
I don't like to be deceived.

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:53.860
I don't like to be lied to.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:57.140
Lest any man beguile you,

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:59.900
but then he says, lest any man spoil you

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:01.700
to be carried away as captive.

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:05.300
As these believers, and I believe this morning

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.940
as we would examine our lives,

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.820
I think that the challenge for us

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.180
is number one, to be honest,

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:14.740
and number two, to be transparent before the Lord.

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.780
One of the hardest things I think,

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:22.820
and we dealt with, we observed the Lord's Supper

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:23.700
last Sunday evening.

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:25.460
We mentioned how it's a table of examination,

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:27.500
the importance of self-examination.

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:32.580
I think often in our day and age in which we live

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:37.580
that that practice of self-examination is often overlooked.

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.500
And that's a sad thing.

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:45.340
And as we would think about this passage of Scripture,

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:48.100
listen, we understand the false teachers exist today.

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:50.740
And you understand that every false teacher

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.340
isn't robed in some cloak

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.580
and acting like they're a priest or a pastor.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:57.460
False teachers are all over the place.

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:00.060
Humanism.

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:05.060
they would say of themselves that they are a new religion.

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.060
Now we understand that they've been around for a long time,

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:11.060
but that's how they would refer to themselves as being a new religion.

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:15.060
And you understand that they have made it a point

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:19.060
that they would invade every area of the public arena

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:23.060
in order to propagate their quote-unquote new religion.

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:28.060
Classrooms all over the place.

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:31.060
You think about politics? Absolutely.

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:34.060
Why wouldn't they enter into that arena?

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:37.060
Media? Absolutely.

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:40.060
They enter all of these arenas,

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:46.060
and they seek to promote and propagate their false teaching.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:52.060
False teachers are not confined to just some church house somewhere.

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:55.060
They're all over society.

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:59.060
And as we would think about these false teachers being all over society

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:01.060
and promoting and propagating their truth,

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.060
you know, it's interesting.

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:06.060
Personally, the news drives me crazy.

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:10.060
You know, there was a time in our society

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:17.060
that you could have news anchors that just honestly gave you the news.

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:20.060
But now everything needs to be slanted one way or the other

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:23.060
and this and that, and they're trying to get their philosophies in

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:30.060
and explain this, and it'll drive you crazy, make you go nuts.

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:35.060
Again, you think about this evaluation, this examination,

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:38.060
and that we would be honest and transparent before the Lord.

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:44.060
I believe this morning that there were probably some in Colossae

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:47.060
that had already been beguiled.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.060
They'd already been deceived.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:57.060
And they were well on their way to being spoiled, to being carried away.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:59.060
I believe that.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:04.060
And I think this morning it would be foolish to think that

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:09.060
there might not be one amongst us that's already been beguiled,

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:15.060
that's perhaps on their way to being spoiled, to being carried away.

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:19.060
And thus the warning of the Word of God is given.

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:23.060
Beware lest any man spoil you.

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:27.060
He tells us through philosophy, through vain deceit,

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:30.060
through tradition of men, through the rudiments of the world,

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.060
and not after Christ.

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:36.060
And this morning, I don't like to be deceived.

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:39.060
I don't want to be beguiled.

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:43.060
But I'll tell you what, if I've been deceived, if I've been beguiled,

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:46.060
I want to find out.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:50.060
I don't want to continue to be deceived, right?

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:56.060
Because that path of deception leads to being carried away in verse number 8.

00:42:56.060 --> 00:43:00.060
The enemy is not satisfied with simply deceiving you.

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:04.060
The enemy wants to spoil you.

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:08.060
And so this morning, just as the believers in Colossae

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:11.060
needed to have an examination and an acknowledgment of,

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:16.060
you know what, there have been some things, I've entertained these false teachers.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:19.060
Maybe I didn't know they were false teachers.

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:24.060
I had no idea that they were promoting something that I should not be entertaining.

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:28.060
But I've been listening to, I've been influenced by.

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:33.060
This morning, we'd be foolish to think, oh, not us.

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:35.060
Not us.

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:39.060
No, no, we didn't take heed of the warning.

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:42.060
And I would ask this question.

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:48.060
Perhaps we didn't even know we had been beguiled.

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:53.060
We didn't know that we were on the path of being spoiled.

00:43:53.060 --> 00:44:00.060
And as we would examine and make an acknowledgment, be honest before the Lord,

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:04.060
we could ask ourselves this question, what do we do?

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:06.060
What do we do?

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:09.060
Well, I think the first thing to do would be to get rid of

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:13.060
whatever that source of false teaching would be.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:18.060
To stop entertaining the teaching, the philosophy,

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:22.060
the worldly ideas and wherever they're coming from.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:25.060
Number two, you better get into the Word of God.

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:31.060
I said to some folks early on, maybe you're one of them that I said it to in this last year,

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:34.060
so much media attention and so many things going on,

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:37.060
and I said, listen, for every 15 minutes you spend watching the news,

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:40.060
listening to the media, you better get in the Word of God for an hour.

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:42.060
And they said, an hour?

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:45.060
I said, I just made up the ratio in my mind, I don't know why,

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:50.060
but I would just say multiply times four, whatever it is that you've been listening to or hearing,

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:52.060
and get into the Bible.

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:55.060
Why? So the Bible can get into us.

00:44:56.060 --> 00:45:01.060
So that we can be able to identify and deal with truth.

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:12.060
I believe that Romans 12 gives us great truth with regard to this response of ours,

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:17.060
as we would examine and acknowledge, and perhaps there's one

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:22.060
that would not be too proud to acknowledge before God.

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:26.060
God already knows that if you've been beguiled.

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:30.060
He's just trying to help you understand that you've been beguiled.

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:32.060
He already knows.

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:35.060
He's trying to help you to know that you've been beguiled,

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:38.060
and on your way to being spoiled.

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:41.060
And if you would humble yourself and acknowledge that,

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:44.060
and let God help you.

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:46.060
Romans 12, we're familiar with verse number one,

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:49.060
I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:52.060
that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:56.060
which is your reasonable service. Notice verse number two.

00:45:56.060 --> 00:46:01.060
And be not conformed to this world.

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:08.060
You know, it's easy to just kind of try to fit in.

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:16.060
Fitting in can bring a certain level of comfort, if you will.

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:18.060
Temporary.

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:20.060
But just kind of go with the flow.

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:22.060
I don't want to cause any...

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:24.060
You understand what I'm saying?

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:28.060
But God says, be not conformed to this world.

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:33.060
But, notice, be transformed how?

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:37.060
By the renewing of your mind.

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:39.060
How do we renew our mind?

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:41.060
Through the Word of God.

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:43.060
The Word of God.

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:47.060
There's some things that perhaps the false teachers have said,

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:51.060
those that are in various aspects of our society today

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:56.060
that have sought to permeate our society and propagate their teaching.

00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:58.060
And I say, I want my mind to be renewed.

00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:00.060
I need to get into the Word of God.

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:02.060
What does God's Word say about?

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:05.060
And just start going through whatever the social issues are.

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:07.060
Whatever the hot topics are of the day.

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:12.060
By the way, I've preached on a lot of them.

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:16.060
What does God's Word say about adultery?

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:18.060
You say, we don't hear a whole lot about that.

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:21.060
I know, because it's just become so commonplace.

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:25.060
That people aren't even shamed about it anymore.

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:27.060
Right?

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.060
What does the Word of God say about marriage?

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:31.060
What does the Word of God say about abortion?

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:33.060
I mean, we just go right through it.

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:37.060
God's Word deals with it.

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:43.060
And it doesn't matter what the world says is right or accepted or acceptable.

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:45.060
But what does God say?

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:47.060
And we stand on truth.

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:50.060
By the renewing of your mind,

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:57.060
that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

00:47:57.060 --> 00:48:01.060
I believe this morning

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:05.060
that one of the, I would never say the way, because there's many,

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:13.060
but I think one of the ways in which the church has lost its influence in a world

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:18.060
is because we've become worldly.

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:22.060
We've adopted the philosophy of the world.

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:26.060
We've been influenced by the world.

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:32.060
And therefore we've, in a certain regard, lost our ability

00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:36.060
to be the influence that God has called us to be.

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:41.060
See, if I could use the analogy this morning of a light,

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:45.060
and the reason why I'd like to use the analogy is because God said,

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:48.060
you are the light of the world.

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:51.060
We're to let our light so shine.

00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:55.060
But I would say to you this morning that even as we would think about a lighthouse,

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:59.060
many of us have seen lighthouses, and we understand that for a long period of time

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:06.060
in human history, lighthouses served a very important purpose.

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:08.060
Amen?

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:13.060
In some parts of the world, they still serve a very important purpose.

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:16.060
There are some that you can go to that are just relics, if you will.

00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:19.060
They're no longer operating in the way in which they did.

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:25.060
They're set up for tourists to be able to come and visit and so on and so forth.

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:29.060
But you know one of the dangers?

00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:35.060
When the glass gets dirty, the light doesn't shine as it's supposed to.

00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:39.060
Why? Because the glass has gotten dirty.

00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:43.060
If we took some of these light bulbs that shine brightly,

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:50.060
and we spray paint them, they're not going to shine as much.

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:52.060
The electricity is still flowing.

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:57.060
The particular elements of that light bulb are still operating.

00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:00.060
But it's gotten dirty.

00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:04.740
And it doesn't shine as bright.

00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:09.260
Sometimes your headlights get dirty.

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:13.740
Sometimes they'll build up a film, and you've got to deal with that.

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:20.700
I would say this morning that sadly, but if we would honestly evaluate and admit, the

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:28.780
church in a certain sense, one of the reasons that we have lost the ability to influence

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:34.500
the world in which we're living is because we've adopted a lot of their philosophies.

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:36.900
We've been influenced by the world.

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:43.740
We've been beguiled and well on our way to being spoiled.

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:48.060
See this morning, the warning is there for our good.

00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:53.440
Paul says, I warn you because you're my beloved sons in the book of 1 Corinthians.

00:50:53.440 --> 00:51:01.080
He says in Ephesians 17, 31, I was warning you night and day with tears.

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:05.840
It's good to know the warning, but how do we respond to the warning?

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:16.080
Would we examine ourselves this morning and honestly before God say, have we been beguiled?

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:17.900
And how do we respond to that?

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:19.120
What is it that we do?

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:27.640
Oh, that we run back to God, get in this book, and determine to have a biblical worldview

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:31.440
and to shine as a bright and burning light as John the Baptist did.

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:32.440
Amen?

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:33.440
Let's pray.

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:34.560
Father, we love You.

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:38.360
We thank You for loving us.

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:42.240
We thank You for Your Word and the warnings that are contained therein.

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:47.120
By them is Thy servant warned.

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:52.400
Beware lest any man spoil You.

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:58.600
I don't want to be beguiled, certainly don't want to be spoiled.

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:08.000
Lord, just as these believers in Colossae needed to do some examination after reviewing

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:16.720
such powerful truth, I believe this morning we need to let Your Spirit work, that we'd

00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:20.720
be honest, transparent.

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:25.640
Maybe there's some among us that have been beguiled, we've been deceived, we've been

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:30.960
listening to the wrong people, we've not spent as much time in Your Word.

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:39.040
Our worldview has been shaped more by the popular opinions of the talking heads of our

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:41.880
world than it has been by Your Word.

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:51.640
Lord, would You move and work as only You can, help us to be the influence in this world

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:55.840
that You've called us to be.

00:52:55.840 --> 00:53:01.400
We'll thank You and praise You for that which You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:02.400
Amen.

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:04.000
Would You stand with me?

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.720
We're going to have a moment of invitation here.

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:13.720
I'm going to challenge the folks at home to go through a process of examination as well.

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:17.160
Don't just go and get your supper and all that sort of thing, but really let the Word

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:20.400
of God, let the Holy Spirit have His way.

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:26.200
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano, the altar's open, make your pew an altar.

00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:27.560
Let Him have His way.

00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:29.600
Thank Him for the warning.

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:31.960
Respond properly to the warning as Kimberly plays.
