WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.239
2, and we'll be looking at a passage of Scripture and continuing with this series, this thought

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:14.239
of doing what we ought to do, and we'll be looking at 1 John 2 this evening, particularly

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:18.840
verse number 6, and we'll look at this portion of Scripture.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.959
I do believe that it will take us two to three weeks to get through this particular admonition

00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:32.200
that we find here in 1 John 2, 6, because it's such depth to the statement that is made,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.040
and I'm going to begin reading in verse number 1, 1 John chapter 2 is such a powerful, God's

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.119
Word is powerful, we understand that, and all of it is powerful, it is God's Word and

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:50.360
we're thankful to have it preserved for us, but I love 1 John chapter 2, and it begins

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.000
by saying this, my little children, these things write I unto you that you sin not.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.400
If any man sin, by the way, that's all of us, right, after salvation we still sin, and

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.000
of course our goal is to not sin, and that's why he says that you sin not, and as we continue

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.819
to draw closer and closer to the Lord as we abide in Him and we walk with Him, we should

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:16.779
be sinning less and less, but we'll never be sinless until we get to Heaven.

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:23.400
And so he says if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, notice it says Jesus

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.980
Christ the righteous, aren't you so thankful that we have an advocate with the Father,

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:36.739
and it says this in verse 2, He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:44.059
for the sins of the whole world, and praise the Lord for that wonderful truth, I'm so

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:49.059
thankful that Christ took my place and took your place and paid for the sin of the entire

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:54.099
world, there's not one person that's ever walked upon the face of the earth that is

00:01:54.099 --> 00:02:00.019
beyond the ability of God's saving grace, and I'm so thankful for that.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:06.379
Verse 3, and hereby we do know that we know Him if we keep His commandments, he that saith

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:12.460
I know Him and keepeth not His commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him, but

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.820
whoso keepeth His word and him verily is the love of God perfected, hereby know we

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.580
that we are in Him, notice verse 6, the text for our study this evening, he that saith

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:30.820
he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk even as He walked.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.979
I've titled the message this evening, We Ought to Walk as Christ Walked.

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:41.699
The truth of 1 John chapter 2 and verse number 6 requires for every believer to really examine

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:42.699
the scriptures.

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:43.699
Why do I say that?

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:51.179
Well, the Bible says that he that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:53.500
even as He walked.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.259
So what is it that requires some examination of the scriptures on the part of every child

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:59.259
of God?

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:02.300
Well, it's for us to know how Christ walked.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.539
I'm thankful that God has given us the records of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the gospel

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:11.660
accounts, and we have the privilege of being able to read about the life and ministry of

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.020
the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:19.059
And so we find that here as we look at this thought that we ought, that he that saith

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:25.020
he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk even as He walked, and then we're reminded

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:31.259
that this truth or this thought of the phrase our walk, that throughout the Bible it is

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:36.660
clearly understood that our walk is really referring to how we live our lives.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.100
It's not talking about our gait, in other words, how we walk physically, our posture

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.259
in our particular gait in our walk.

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:47.500
No, it's talking about our lives.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.679
It's talking about how we lead and live our lives.

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:56.220
It's also important for us to know a concept that is found in this second chapter of First

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.419
John.

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:02.139
We find that on three occasions here in First John chapter number two, the Bible will say

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.779
this, he that saith, he that saith.

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:10.539
In our text it says he that saith he abideth in Him.

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:16.339
Now we understand John 15, Jesus said abide in me and I in you, and He talks about the

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:21.019
vine and the branches and the truth that's contained in that passage of Scripture, and

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.459
so we understand as the people of God, the children of God, that we're to abide in Him,

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:30.019
but here the text says he that saith he abideth in Him.

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:34.700
Now listen, we can say whatever we want to say, but as the old saying goes, the proof

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:41.339
is in the pudding, and here we find he that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:44.459
so to walk even as he walked.

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:50.420
The claim that the individual believer makes must be supported by their behavior.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.220
Earlier in the text in verse number three, it talked about the one that says, and hereby

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.380
do we know that we know Him if we keep His commandments.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.980
Someone can say, I'm a believer, I'm a Christian, but they don't obey, they don't keep the

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.500
commandments of God, they have no regard for God's Word, well the reality is that the Bible

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:15.420
says that there are evidences that should be present in the life of its people.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:23.339
The reality is that we can ask it this way, is there evidence to support the claim?

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:25.619
Is there evidence that supports the claim?

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:31.940
If you say that you love me, but you hate your brother, right, it's what God says also,

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.140
right, and so we understand throughout this book there's claims that are made, but what's

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.140
the evidence?

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.380
By the way, the evidence is seen in our behavior, seen in how we live our lives, how we lead

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.380
our lives.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.619
And so when we begin to think about this truth, we ought to walk as Christ walked, I'm reminded

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:51.619
of a couple of truths that God gives us.

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:55.980
Notice this in your Bible there at 1 John, turn back if you will to 1 Peter and chapter

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:01.440
number two, 1 Peter chapter number two, and I want you to see a familiar verse of Scripture,

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.899
we often reference part of this verse, but I want you to see it here by way of introduction

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:13.899
as we get into the thought tonight, how is, how did Christ walk, how did He live His life

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:19.019
so that we could know that we're to walk like Him, am I walking like Him, I've said it before

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:24.739
and you've heard me say it, that this little idea of what would Jesus do, I believe that

00:06:24.739 --> 00:06:31.619
many people that have that shirt that says it or the little bracelet that says WWJD and

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:36.220
so on and so forth, I believe, and I'm not trying to be unkind or whatever, but I believe

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.380
that many of them have absolutely no idea what Jesus would do because they've never

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.980
actually studied the Scriptures to know how Christ behaved and how He lived.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.839
They say, well, Christ loved, listen, the way that they say that He loved is different

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:57.899
than how He actually loved, amen, because they think, well, Jesus is love, God is love,

00:06:57.899 --> 00:07:01.339
so He permits us to do whatever we want to do because He loves me.

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:05.820
That's not what the Bible teaches, and so we must get into the Scriptures.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.779
Notice in 1 Peter 2 and verse 21, for even here unto were ye called, because Christ also

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:16.299
suffered for us, leaving us an example that we should follow His steps, who did no sin,

00:07:16.299 --> 00:07:20.299
neither was guile found in His mouth, who when He was reviled, reviled not again.

00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:27.140
When He suffered, He threatened not, but committed Himself to Him that judgeth righteously,

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:33.660
who His own self bare our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins,

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.500
should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye are healed.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.980
For ye were as sheep going astray, but are now returned to the shepherd and bishop of

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:42.980
your souls.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.540
And by the way, aren't you thankful that you're not what you once were?

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:52.739
Because we were as sheep going astray, but now, He says, are returned to the shepherd

00:07:52.739 --> 00:07:53.739
and bishop of your souls.

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:59.019
I'm so thankful, Psalm 23, the Lord is my shepherd, amen, and what a joy to have that

00:07:59.019 --> 00:08:04.179
personal understanding, but the Bible tells us in verse 21 that Jesus lived His life,

00:08:04.179 --> 00:08:08.140
He left us an example that we would follow His steps.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:13.260
If you will, in the book of Acts, in the 10th chapter, Acts chapter number 10, and

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:19.739
then we'll get into some thoughts with regard to how Christ walked and how, therefore, we,

00:08:19.739 --> 00:08:25.299
as Christ followers of those that say we abide in Him, how we ought to walk.

00:08:25.299 --> 00:08:31.100
In Acts chapter 10, in verse number 38, we find that Peter is preaching here, and he's

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:37.780
there with Cornelius, and you may have some level of being familiar with this passage

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:43.619
of Scripture, and here we find that God had orchestrated amazingly for Peter to go and

00:08:43.619 --> 00:08:48.179
to speak and preach to Cornelius and those that he had gathered to preach the gospel,

00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:52.580
but right in the middle of his message, in verse number 38, notice what Peter says, how

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:58.700
God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power, notice this phrase,

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:04.460
who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil, for God

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.460
was with Him.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:11.380
I want you to understand this evening that there's none good but God, He's the only one

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.099
that's good, but He walked about doing good.

00:09:14.099 --> 00:09:22.460
Listen, as the people of God, as Christians, we have a testimony that we need to be concerned

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.460
about.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:28.219
We need to be concerned that we live our lives in such a way that we're not bringing a reproach

00:09:28.219 --> 00:09:30.140
against the name of God.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:35.739
It ought not be that someone looks at our behavior and says, and they claim to be a

00:09:35.739 --> 00:09:36.739
Christian.

00:09:36.739 --> 00:09:41.340
I've heard employers that have made the comment that they don't want to hire Christians because

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.739
they're lazy employees.

00:09:43.739 --> 00:09:46.820
Can I tell you, that's terrible, that's a terrible testimony.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:52.140
A Christian ought to be the hardest working employee that the employer ever did hire,

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:58.539
because what thy hand findeth to do, do it as unto the Lord and not unto men, amen?

00:09:58.539 --> 00:10:00.140
When we find that it's...

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:08.120
important how we walk, not only for the testimony of those around us, but to please our God.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:13.540
So if we say that we abide in Him, we ought to walk in the manner in which He walked.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.500
We ought to walk as Christ walked.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.700
And so how did He walk?

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.880
I have several things that we're going to look at.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.700
Number one, if you're taking notes, Jesus walked wisely.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:23.700
He walked wisely.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.060
He walked in wisdom.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:29.220
If there's ever a day in which we need wisdom, it's today.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.820
We need the wisdom of God.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.500
We find that He walked wisely.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:38.060
Notice in the book of John, if you will, and of course with each of these particular thoughts

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:42.120
that I'll give you on how Christ walked, and by the way, it's not an exhaustive list.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.140
It's just six things, and I am nowhere going to get through all six of them this evening.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.060
That's why I said it'd be at least two weeks.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:54.820
But the list is not exhaustive, but we will find with each of these items that I provide

00:10:54.820 --> 00:11:01.540
you with that within the gospel records, we see the evidence of Jesus walking in this

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.540
manner.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:07.500
In John chapter number seven, John chapter number seven, we find that Jesus walked wisely.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.860
Why do we say that?

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:13.960
Notice, if you will, in verse number one, the Bible says after these things, Jesus walked

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.360
in Galilee.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.620
He walked in Galilee.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:18.620
Notice this.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:19.940
He would not walk in Jewry.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:20.940
Why?

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.420
Because the Jews sought to kill Him.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.660
Now, He knew the intent of the Jewish people.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:32.820
By the way, many times throughout the Scriptures, you find that the religious leaders were seeking

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.900
how they might destroy or how they might kill Jesus.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:43.500
And so here we find that Jesus knew, and therefore He walked in Galilee, but not in Jewry.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:47.340
And we find that as He would walk here, and we look through the text of Scripture, we

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:52.900
see the feast of what's going on, and He tells them to go up because He's not going up yet.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.540
And by the way, that word yet is so important because He does go up, but in so many of the

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:02.980
modern versions, it's missing, and they then bring the charge that Jesus lied because He

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.520
said He wasn't going, and then He did go.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.260
And so we find that He says, I'm not going yet.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.740
And so He knew, and by the way, even as He gets there and He begins to say about those

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:18.140
that were desiring to kill Him, there was some objection to the claim, but we know what

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.140
was taking place.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.580
And so He walked wisely.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:26.300
Turn over to John 11, if you will, just a few chapters over, John chapter number 11.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:31.860
Look if you will here as we see what's taking place, again, in the life of the Lord Jesus

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.100
Christ.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:37.940
And verse number 54, I'll just pick it up right in the middle here, and again, the same

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.940
similar context and idea of what we saw in John 7.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:48.540
Here in John chapter 11 and verse 54, Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:53.900
Jews, but went fenced into a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim,

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.180
and there continued with His disciples.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.620
And so was it that He did not walk openly in John chapter number 7 and verse number

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:01.620
1?

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:05.800
Is it that He, here in John chapter 11 and verse 54, that He didn't walk openly among

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.220
the Jews because He was fearful?

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.540
No, it's because He was wise.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.940
See throughout the book of John, it's very interesting, there's this phrase that's used

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.860
about the hour.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:18.180
And we find that it's first introduced to us in John chapter number 2, and if you were

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.540
to trace the use of the phrase throughout the book of John, you find that it starts

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:27.700
in John chapter number 2, that mine hour is not yet come, and it goes all the way to John

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.140
17 when He says the hour is come.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:37.540
And in between that period of time, we find that Jesus was fulfilling all that had to

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:42.660
be fulfilled, and He was doing all that He was supposed to do until that appointed time,

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.480
until the hour was come.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:49.760
And so knowing the intent of those religious leaders, knowing their heart to kill Him,

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:54.480
He didn't, He wasn't walking fearfully, He was walking wisely.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.020
Can I tell you this evening, that we as the people of God, we need to walk in wisdom,

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.120
we need to walk wisely.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.480
Notice if you will, in Matthew chapter 10, as we consider some instruction for us as

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:10.520
the people of God, if we're seeking to take this truth from 1 John 2 and verse 6 to say

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:15.680
that we ought to walk as Christ walked, we look at how He walked, and then we say, okay,

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:21.680
what instruction do we have in God's Word for us as individual followers of Jesus Christ

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.720
that we're to walk in like manner?

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:29.160
Notice in Matthew chapter 10, and it's a verse of Scripture that we've often referred to,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:35.440
notice what Jesus says in Matthew 10, and in verse number 16, the Bible says this, behold,

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.700
I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:47.020
Be therefore, what's it say, wise as serpents and harmless as doves.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:53.900
You know, we understand the use of the analogies, and you find here that He says, I send you

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.980
forth as sheep in the midst of wolves.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.500
How's that gonna fare for the sheep?

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:04.940
Well, there's gonna be problems, there's danger, there's difficulty, but He says therefore

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.500
we're to walk wisely, we're to walk in wisdom.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:12.100
I'm thankful that the shepherd gives us the protection that we need, but He says that

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.580
we're to be therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:20.100
Notice in Colossians, if you will, in chapter number four, it's, we'll be looking at a lot

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:25.900
of Scripture this evening, keep your fingers going, and Colossians chapter number four,

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:32.620
and look if you will at verse number five, very simply, the Bible says walk in wisdom.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.620
Praise the Lord.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:37.980
I mean, talk about walking wisely, Colossians four and verse five, walk in wisdom toward

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.500
them that are without, redeeming the time.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:47.420
Back in Ephesians, if you will, and look here in Ephesians chapter five, we read that the

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:54.900
Bible teaches us that we're to walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:16:00.860
So in Ephesians five and verse 15, we find that God tells us, as Paul is writing to these

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:05.420
believers in Ephesus, that they're to walk circumspect, they're to be aware of their

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.900
surroundings, they're to walk, basically, if you kind of get the idea, with your eyes

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.840
wide open.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:17.820
And He says this, He ends the verse, not as fools, but as wise.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.860
Notice in the book of James, the Bible tells us a verse that we often quote in the first

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:26.300
chapter, we'll look at James chapter three as well, but notice in James chapter number

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:33.020
one, we think about this idea that Jesus walked wisely, and we also, as His people,

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:38.020
as we understand tonight, we ought to walk as Christ walked, that we need to walk in

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.260
wisdom, we need to walk wisely.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:44.860
In James chapter one, the Bible says in verse number five, if any of you lack wisdom, can

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:48.380
I tell you this evening, that's all of us.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:52.900
You say, no, I'm wise, but we're not all wise.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.140
We don't know everything.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:00.140
And we must acknowledge that as we go through life, that I need God's wisdom.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:03.860
I need God's wisdom every day, for every scenario.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:07.020
There are no two scenarios that are going to ever be identical.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:11.260
And by the way, I want you to remember, when the Philistines came against David and the

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:17.180
people of God, and David, he goes to God and he says, should I go out against the Philistines?

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.780
And He says, yes, go.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:22.180
And they defeat the Philistines, and then the Philistines come again, and they, they're

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:27.380
going to, you know, regroup and attack again, and God, what does, what does David do?

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:32.480
He seeks the face of God, and God says, yes, but not the same way you went last time.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:37.140
This time do this, wait for the sound in the mulberry trees, right?

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:43.380
And you begin to think, listen, if we just presume upon God and don't seek God for wisdom,

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.180
we may approach things in our wisdom.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:52.020
And so when he says, if any of you lack wisdom, notice it says this, let them ask of God that

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:58.180
giveth to all men liberally, and it braideth not, and it shall be given him.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:05.940
Now that's a great promise, absolutely wonderful to know that, okay, I lack wisdom, but I know

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:13.060
the all wise God, He's my God, He's my Father, and He said, I will give you wisdom.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:17.900
Notice verse number six, it says this, but let him ask how?

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.100
In faith.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:25.380
Nothing wavering, for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.380
and tossed.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.900
And so what does it mean to ask in faith?

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:33.820
Believing that God hears and answers prayer, believing that God is the all wise God, believing

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:42.380
that God can give me the wisdom that I need for the situation in which I'm facing.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:45.340
Rarely people say, pastor, can I meet with you?

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:48.340
I'd really like it if people would say, pastor, can I meet with you, and here's what I want

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.059
to meet about.

00:18:50.059 --> 00:18:53.980
But rarely does that happen, and I'm not saying that it needs to be that way, I'm just saying

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:59.299
what happens is I have no idea what that conversation is going to be like.

00:18:59.299 --> 00:19:03.020
Man, that helps me ask for wisdom.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.500
Because you know, as God, you know what's on their heart, you know what they want to

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:11.820
talk about, but I have no idea, I have no way of preparing, I have no way, God, I need

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.020
your wisdom.

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.299
And I'm thankful that God gives wisdom.

00:19:16.299 --> 00:19:19.580
Notice in chapter three, when we think about the subject of wisdom here in James chapter

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:24.340
number three, the Bible says this in verse number 13.

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.500
Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:32.540
Let him show of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:36.500
But if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.500
the truth.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.820
But this wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.940
For where envying and strife is, there is confusion in every evil work, but the wisdom

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:51.380
that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:56.420
mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.059
The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.

00:20:00.059 --> 00:20:04.779
So we see here, there's this contrast that the wisdom that, notice in verse 15,

00:20:04.779 --> 00:20:09.659
this wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly. And then we see verse 17,

00:20:09.659 --> 00:20:15.659
but the wisdom that is from above. Listen, we want that heavenly wisdom. We need God's wisdom.

00:20:17.019 --> 00:20:22.859
We find that Jesus, when we consider the thought of 1 John 2, 6, that we ought to walk as Jesus

00:20:22.859 --> 00:20:27.899
walked, that we understand that we have to go back and find, okay, how did he walk?

00:20:28.539 --> 00:20:33.979
Because if I say that I abide in him, and by the way, we are commanded to abide in him,

00:20:33.979 --> 00:20:42.699
so if I'm abiding in him, the evidence that John tells us that he gives us is that he ought to

00:20:42.699 --> 00:20:48.619
himself also so to walk even as he walked. And so we ought to walk as Christ walked.

00:20:48.619 --> 00:20:54.459
How do I know how Christ walked? Well, thank God for the Gospels. And I go back and I begin to

00:20:54.459 --> 00:20:59.499
read and study, so we see number one, Jesus walked wisely. Number two, Jesus walked humbly.

00:21:00.539 --> 00:21:05.739
The humility of the Lord Jesus Christ is absolutely phenomenal. It's amazing to think

00:21:05.739 --> 00:21:14.619
about God in flesh. He's eternal. He has no beginning and no end. He's enjoyed the

00:21:16.059 --> 00:21:20.699
glory of heaven, but he left it to come to this sin-cursed world.

00:21:21.419 --> 00:21:26.939
The humility of the Lord Jesus Christ. And notice, if you will, in Mark chapter 10, again,

00:21:26.939 --> 00:21:32.699
as we look at the Gospel records to see some evidence with regard to the humility of Jesus

00:21:32.699 --> 00:21:38.139
Christ, that he walked humbly. We find that he walked wisely. Praise the Lord for the truth of

00:21:38.139 --> 00:21:43.500
that and the admonition that we have to walk also in wisdom. Now we find that he walked humbly. In

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:49.819
Mark chapter 10, the Bible says this, in verse number 41, it says, and when the ten heard it,

00:21:49.819 --> 00:21:53.739
they began to be much displeased with James and John. What did they hear? Well, there was some

00:21:53.739 --> 00:21:59.180
question about a position and so on and so forth back in verse 35. And James and John, the sons of

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:03.419
Zebedee, came unto him saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall

00:22:03.419 --> 00:22:08.619
desire. And Jesus says, what would you that I should do for you? In verse 36 and verse 37,

00:22:08.619 --> 00:22:13.179
they said unto him, grant us that we may sit one on thy right hand and the other on thy left in

00:22:13.179 --> 00:22:19.580
thy glory. And so the Bible tells us in verse number 41 that the ten heard what James and John

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:27.099
were discussing and they were much displeased, but Jesus, verse 42, called them to him and saith

00:22:27.099 --> 00:22:33.419
unto them, ye know not that ye know, excuse me, ye know that they which are accounted to rule over

00:22:33.419 --> 00:22:40.139
the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and their great ones exercise authority upon them,

00:22:40.139 --> 00:22:46.940
but so shall it not be among you, but whosoever will be great among you shall be your, what's it

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:54.699
say? Minister. Minister. You ever see people that think they're above something? I mean, here in

00:22:54.699 --> 00:22:59.500
northern Virginia, you see people every day that think they're above something. Amen? You just get

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:04.220
out on the road. I mean, I saw a guy, I'm not like, I was just at, you know, this little hairpin turn

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:08.059
down here at Waples Mill? I was sitting at the red light just, just the other day, Monday morning,

00:23:08.059 --> 00:23:12.220
I'm sitting at the red light, and I'm coming down Waples Mill turning right onto Oakton.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:18.380
And there's this joker that's going straight, right, on Waples Mill, got a red light, people

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.819
coming the other way are the ones that have a green light, and he waits and he looks and he

00:23:21.819 --> 00:23:25.899
just goes, just absolutely blows the red light, because why? He can't, he's, he's privileged.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:36.619
It's unbelievable. People got a problem with pride. Seriously. But Jesus says whosoever will

00:23:36.619 --> 00:23:43.419
be great among you shall be your minister. Notice in verse 44, and whosoever of you will be the

00:23:43.419 --> 00:23:50.139
chiefest shall be servant of all. You ever meet those kind of people that want the preeminence?

00:23:51.099 --> 00:23:54.860
They want to, they want all the recognition, they want to be looked at, they want to have the

00:23:54.860 --> 00:24:01.259
chiefest of seats, they want all of that. And Jesus says, listen, whoever here is going to be

00:24:01.339 --> 00:24:07.099
chiefest shall be servant of all. It reminds me of diatrophies in the book of 3 John. The Bible

00:24:07.099 --> 00:24:15.819
says that he loveth to have the preeminence. In verse 45, notice the humility of Jesus, because

00:24:15.819 --> 00:24:22.619
we are mentioning that Jesus walked humbly. Notice in verse 45, for even the Son of Man came not to

00:24:22.619 --> 00:24:29.100
be ministered unto, but to minister, to give his life a ransom for many. Aren't you thankful for

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:37.500
that? He came not to be ministered unto, but he came to minister. And oh, how he ministered. Notice

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:43.980
in John 13, if you will, we see this declaration in Mark 10, but notice in John 13, I mean, this is

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:49.980
the passage in which Jesus is washing the feet of the disciples. I mean, it is the lowest of low tasks

00:24:51.339 --> 00:24:58.700
to wash the feet. It was the, I mean, it was so low, I'm told, as I study and read and those that

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:03.660
have studied with many years of looking at the culture and what have you,

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:08.139
that you weren't even permitted to force a servant to do this task. It was so low.

00:25:10.779 --> 00:25:13.660
And the Bible says in John 13, beginning in verse number 4,

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:18.859
he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself.

00:25:19.419 --> 00:25:23.260
After that, he poureth water into a base and began to wash the disciples' feet,

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:33.660
and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. Can you imagine? God in flesh,

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:39.019
the Lord Jesus Christ. I mean, I think, I hope,

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:43.899
that some of us would probably respond the way that Peter did.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:53.500
Jesus, you're my master. You're my Lord. You're going to wash my feet?

00:25:57.339 --> 00:26:00.700
Verse 6, then cometh he to Simon Peter, and Peter saith unto him, Lord,

00:26:01.579 --> 00:26:07.739
dost thou wash my feet? Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now,

00:26:07.739 --> 00:26:13.260
but thou shalt know hereafter. Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:19.260
I mean, can you understand why Peter's saying this? Peter lived in the culture. Peter understood.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:26.059
And he knew who, listen, this is Peter that when Jesus said, Peter, all the disciples were there,

00:26:26.059 --> 00:26:30.779
but Peter's the one that answers. He says to all of them, and only Peter answers, says,

00:26:30.779 --> 00:26:36.459
Whom do men say that I am? Well, some say John the Baptist, some say one of the other prophets,

00:26:36.459 --> 00:26:43.419
Elijah, Jeremiah, whatever. But whom say ye that I am? And Peter says, Thou art the Christ,

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:49.739
the Son of the living God. And now he's going to wash his feet.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:57.820
I understand why Peter would say, Thou shalt never wash my feet.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:04.540
Jesus said, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. Then Peter changes. I mean,

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:09.500
180-degree turn here. He saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.

00:27:11.019 --> 00:27:15.579
Because when Jesus said, You have no part with me, he's like, I'm all in. I get it.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:21.339
Verse 10, Jesus saith unto him, He that is washed, he is not to say to wash his feet,

00:27:21.339 --> 00:27:25.500
but is clean every whip, and ye are clean, but not all. Of course, he's speaking of Judas,

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.339
but it says in verse 11, For he knew who should betray him, therefore said he,

00:27:29.339 --> 00:27:33.820
ye are not all clean. So after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:39.260
set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? Ye call me master and lord.

00:27:40.059 --> 00:27:46.380
Notice this, and ye say, Well, for so I am. He is master and he is lord.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:53.739
If I then, your lord and master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet.

00:27:54.459 --> 00:28:01.579
What humility that Jesus gave. Listen, the people of God should be humble. We should walk humbly.

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:06.859
Notice, if you will, in Philippians chapter 2, a favorite passage of scripture.

00:28:08.139 --> 00:28:13.579
Philippians chapter 2 begins in verse number 5 by saying, Let this mind be in you which was also

00:28:13.579 --> 00:28:23.739
in Christ Jesus. Begin to see this unfolding truth in Philippians chapter 2, and the example

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:30.220
of humility of our Lord and Savior is just amazing here. Such a

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:39.739
wonderful passage of scripture. It says, Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.

00:28:39.739 --> 00:28:43.900
Notice verse 6, Who being in the form of God, thought it not, Robert, to be equal with God,

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:50.299
but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the

00:28:50.299 --> 00:28:58.700
likeness of men. Being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, became obedient unto death,

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:03.739
even the death of the cross. It's interesting, in verse number 7, the Bible says, But he made

00:29:03.739 --> 00:29:08.539
himself of no reputation. You know, a lot of people today are trying to make a reputation

00:29:08.539 --> 00:29:14.140
for themselves. Jesus is God. He's the master. He owns everything. He created it all.

00:29:15.099 --> 00:29:23.099
And he made himself of no reputation. He walked humbly. Oh, that God's people would walk humbly.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:32.940
We're aware of in our society, unfortunately, they've hijacked a month of our calendar,

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:38.299
and they've called it Pride Month. I have a pastor friend, some of you know him, Mark

00:29:38.539 --> 00:29:45.820
DeLoach. And Brother DeLoach determined this year that in his church in the month of June,

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:54.380
it was going to be called Humility Month. And every single Sunday, my understanding is that

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:59.900
he was planning to preach on the subject matter of how we as God's people are to walk in humility.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.340
because God resisteth the proud."

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.460
If we're not careful, we can be prideful.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.540
We can be prideful.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:11.900
We find that for us here in Philippians chapter 2,

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.780
we see the example of Christ in verses 5 through 8.

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:16.780
Notice, if you will, just a few verses before.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.900
Before Paul gives the example of great humility,

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:23.740
he gives to the people at Philippi this instruction.

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.100
In verse number 3, he says,

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.940
"'Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory,

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.620
but in lowliness of mind,

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.780
let each esteem other better than themselves.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.660
Look not every man on his own things,

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.580
but every man also on the things of others.'"

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:41.900
And then he gives the example of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.980
And the reality, when he says in verse 3,

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:46.620
"'Let nothing be done through strife and vainglory,'

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:48.060
where does the strife come from?

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.900
Well, the Bible tells us in the book of Proverbs

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.980
that by pride cometh contention, contention and strife.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:57.660
And we find that it says, but in lowliness of mind."

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:03.340
It's not necessarily having a low self-esteem.

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.660
It's not that idea of getting caught up

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:11.020
into this psychology area of things in our society.

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.980
No, it's just recognizing how great our God is.

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.620
Because really, if we're going to deal

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.540
with the subject of walking humbly,

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:22.540
if we're going to walk in humility as the people of God,

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.500
the best way for us to do that is really just get our eyes on God

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.620
and see how great He is.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:32.460
And then we recognize how blessed we are,

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:39.260
that He would even love us, hear us, save us.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:39.900
It's amazing.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.580
We find this evening in the book of James,

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.100
we'll finish and wrap up here in James chapter 4.

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.180
We see it in 1 Peter as well,

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.780
but this instruction for us,

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:56.700
we find that we're to walk, we ought to walk as Christ walked.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:57.980
Well, how did Christ walk?

00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.740
Well, He walked wisely.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:02.060
All right, we also are to walk wisely.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:05.660
And by the way, it's not with the earthly wisdom,

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:06.940
it's with the heavenly wisdom.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:08.620
It's with God's wisdom.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:10.060
He's the all wise God.

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:11.660
Well, Jesus walked humbly.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.820
Okay, we too are to walk humbly.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:15.500
We're to walk in humility.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.740
Notice the truth of James 4 in verse number 6.

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.500
The Bible says, but He giveth more grace.

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.980
By the way, aren't you thankful for God's grace?

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.340
It says this, wherefore He saith,

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:31.580
God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:41.180
Sometimes I wonder if we really allow the significance

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.900
of this verse of Scripture to really permeate our minds,

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:48.460
that God resisteth the proud.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:51.420
You know, God hates pride.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.540
He hates pride.

00:32:56.220 --> 00:33:00.940
You know, the enemy, Satan, Lucifer, it was pride.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:05.020
I will be like, it was pride.

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:06.780
God says, I hate pride.

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:13.260
He says, He resisteth the proud, but He gives grace unto the humble.

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.940
You know, sometimes it's really easy to become prideful.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.420
It really is.

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:24.700
The best way I have found to keep our feet on the ground

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:29.580
and keep a proper perspective is to keep our eyes on Jesus.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.660
We keep our eyes on Jesus and it will help us to walk humbly.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.260
This evening, we see this truth.

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.700
We ought to walk as Christ walked.

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:43.740
How do I know if I'm walking like Christ?

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.900
Well, I go to the Gospels, I begin to study.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.620
Tonight, two simple thoughts.

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:49.740
We'll continue next week.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:51.260
Walk wisely.

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:52.860
How are we doing with that?

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:54.460
Are we walking in wisdom?

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:56.140
Do we have God's wisdom?

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:57.900
Are we seeking for God's wisdom?

00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.900
Are we asking for God's wisdom?

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.620
Do we even acknowledge that we need God's wisdom?

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:04.940
Are we walking humbly?

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:11.260
Are we walking as God walked?

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.060
The Bible tells us this in 2 Corinthians.

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:18.060
I'm just reminded of the depth of this verse of Scripture.

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.220
And in 2 Corinthians 8 and verse 9,

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:22.380
for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:25.420
that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor,

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:27.900
that you through his poverty might be rich.

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:30.780
Wow, what a great truth.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:35.580
This evening, we'll walk humbly.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:39.420
We can't get prideful about, I got the right position.

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:42.940
I got the right, no, no, no, don't get prideful.

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:45.740
We are blessed to have been given a Bible,

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.300
to have been exposed to the truth of God's word.

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:52.220
And because we've been blessed,

00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:54.700
it's not so that we'd respond in being prideful,

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:56.460
it's that we'd understand we're accountable.

00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:00.540
Because to whom much has been given, much is required.

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:04.380
Can I say this evening, we've been given much, really have.

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:06.780
And much is required.

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.140
Let's walk in wisdom.

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:12.140
Let's walk in humility as we seek to walk as Christ walked.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:12.780
Let's pray together.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:13.980
Father, we love you.

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.100
Thank you for loving us.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.460
Thank you for the blessings.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.700
Thank you for the truth of your word.

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:22.220
I pray God that you'd help us to walk as Christ walked.

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:24.860
I pray that we'd live our lives in such a way

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.620
that you'd be pleased, honored, and glorified.

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:27.900
Bless our time of prayer.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.860
I pray that you'd be glorified for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:31.820
Amen.

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.100
All right, start on the back of the prayer.
