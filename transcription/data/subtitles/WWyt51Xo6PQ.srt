1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,619
and uh... he was kinda of my mindset there's no reason to cancel church

2
00:00:03,619 --> 00:00:06,940
whoever can make it can make it those that can't can't

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,180
and uh... that's what he decided to do

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,300
and uh... there are several other church in the area that canceled and so they

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,579
knew he was having service so a bunch of them came but there's still kind of a

6
00:00:15,579 --> 00:00:16,659
light crowd

7
00:00:16,659 --> 00:00:19,860
and uh... he was up on the platform but they were kind of just meeting on one

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,579
side of the auditorium and

9
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:24,479
uh... he forgot that he was on the platform and he went to walk over where

10
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:27,579
the song leader was and he tumbled right down the steps

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,680
and uh... he said that video went viral

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,080
and uh... he said it was more hits than any other video the church ever had out

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,040
and so i don't want to do that amen

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,560
and uh... anyway colossians chapter number three

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,319
colossians chapter number three will be finishing up the third chapter

16
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:47,240
and entering into the fourth chapter this morning

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,439
and uh... we'll be looking at chapter three verse twenty two down through the

18
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:52,479
first verse of chapter number four

19
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:55,520
and as we conclude this portion of scripture this part of the book of

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,619
colossians

21
00:00:56,619 --> 00:01:01,659
we're mindful that the third chapter of the book of colossians it started

22
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:06,860
with a reminder of our position in christ and i'm so thankful

23
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,980
to be in christ i'm so thankful to be a child of his amen

24
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:16,519
and the reality is that we as we studied the first portion of colossians three

25
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,860
we understood

26
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,819
that my position

27
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:23,339
will impact my pursuits

28
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,519
what am i pursuing in life

29
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,519
and when i understand my position will understand this world is not my home

30
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,760
amen i'm just passing through

31
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,760
i'm so thankful to know

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,480
that heaven is my home that i'm a stranger in a pilgrim

33
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,000
i'm not home but i'm going home amen

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,400
and uh... the reality is that our position will impact our pursuits

35
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,800
we then looked at the next section and it was a weighty section in colossians

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,639
three

37
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:53,620
dealing really with the process of sanctification

38
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:58,660
and it is the plan of god that the child of god would be conformed to the image

39
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,500
of the lord jesus christ

40
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,360
and uh... his dear son and we are to be like christ and

41
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,139
as we go through the christian life we understand that it's not in my power

42
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,500
it's not in your power to live the christian life

43
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,940
it's christ in us it is walking in the spirit

44
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,979
so that we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh and we went through a number

45
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,800
of truths that were provided in that section of colossians three

46
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,600
and then really the last several lessons we've dealt with now how does

47
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,199
that impact my behavior

48
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,279
how is it

49
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:34,600
that your behavior how is it that my behavior

50
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,600
in our daily lives is going to be impacted

51
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,279
by the truth that is given to us in this chapter in colossians three

52
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:47,839
if i follow the instructions if i put off the old man the flesh and i

53
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,059
put on the new man the spirit if i'm walking in the

54
00:02:51,059 --> 00:02:54,179
the spirit so that i'm not fulfilling the lust of the flesh by the way that's

55
00:02:54,179 --> 00:02:56,820
not just for ten thirty on sunday morning

56
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,100
that is for our lives that is every day of our lives

57
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,380
we represent the lord jesus christ and we understand again that it's not our

58
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,539
own power

59
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:08,699
it's through his power

60
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:13,419
we looked at the truth of how this would impact our behavior

61
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:15,619
in the church house

62
00:03:15,619 --> 00:03:16,779
in the church house

63
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,759
we understand the church in corinth they

64
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:22,119
had all kinds of problems and divisions and schisms and they were

65
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:26,559
i'm of paul and i'm of apollos and all of this debate and division that was

66
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:27,380
present

67
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,119
that is not the plan of god that is not pleasing to the lord

68
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:33,320
and so we find that there's behavior

69
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,639
uh... in the church house that will be impacted as we follow the instruction we

70
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,240
then

71
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,600
look at the section dealing with in our homes

72
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,160
a home where the lord is glorified and i'm so thankful

73
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,899
that god instituted the home that god designed the home that god

74
00:03:49,899 --> 00:03:52,500
has provided instruction for the home

75
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,940
as we look at that particular message and dealt with that section here in

76
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,220
colossians three

77
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,779
we understood that it's god that designed the home

78
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:06,179
and therefore it is god that is the authority with regard to the operation

79
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,940
of the home

80
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,259
we can debate it

81
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:10,500
we can fight it

82
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,660
we can resist it we can try to listen to somebody else and some other

83
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,839
authorities we can listen to culture

84
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,000
and society

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,359
but the reality is that god is the authority

86
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,980
and is in our best interest to just simply submit

87
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,920
to what god has said

88
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,040
and we can have a home where god is honored

89
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,940
this morning

90
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,600
we'll be looking at our behavior in the workplace

91
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,000
you say man even the bible deals with our behavior in the workplace absolutely

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,320
because god's word deals with every area of our lives

93
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:46,000
we understand that as we look at this particular passage of scripture

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,859
that the terminology will be used with that relationship between servants and

95
00:04:49,859 --> 00:04:50,899
masters

96
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:54,540
and though that relationship doesn't exist in the same context in which we

97
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,480
deal with in this particular

98
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,140
era in which this was written i believe that it would be appropriate for us to

99
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,980
make the application

100
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,179
with regard to our behavior in the workplace

101
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,859
how is it that we behave in the workplace what is it

102
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:12,299
as i've understood my position in christ and its impact at my pursuits as

103
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:13,399
i've understood

104
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,799
the process of sanctification if i

105
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:19,519
put off the old man and i put on the new man if i'm walking

106
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,399
in the power of the holy spirit of god so that i'm not fulfilling the lust of my

107
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,440
own flesh

108
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,359
that should be seen

109
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,279
in our workplace

110
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:31,320
and as we look at this passage of scripture there's great truth that is

111
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,040
given to us that i believe

112
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,040
will help us and i'll mention this at the end of the message as well this

113
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:36,739
morning

114
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:39,779
but i truly believe that if we would take

115
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:42,739
the principles that god provides us with

116
00:05:42,739 --> 00:05:45,299
in his word and apply them

117
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:48,299
in our lives specifically dealing here

118
00:05:48,299 --> 00:05:52,220
uh... with this aspect of our behavior in the workplace i believe it could be a

119
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,299
catalyst for revival

120
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:55,380
i really do

121
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,619
because the people that you work with the people that see you on a daily basis

122
00:05:59,619 --> 00:06:04,500
they need to see that mystery that paul spoke of in colossians one

123
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,679
do they see christ in you

124
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:08,480
the hope of glory

125
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,320
do they see something different about us when we're in that workplace we're

126
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,119
dealing with those uh... various aspects of of being in the corporate world do

127
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:18,440
they see

128
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,679
in us something different do they see christ in you

129
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:23,920
the hope of glory

130
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,640
or is that reserved to just the church service times and then

131
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,920
uh... we just kind of put that off and then we go into the corporate world and

132
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,079
now i'm working in corporate america

133
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,260
it ought not be and we find here

134
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,660
uh... great truth that is given to us notice if you will

135
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,820
uh... as we begin the passage of scripture in verse number twenty two

136
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,179
the bible says this servants obey

137
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:49,299
in all things your masters according to the flesh not with eye service as men

138
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:50,260
pleasers

139
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,220
but in singleness of heart fearing god

140
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,019
and whatsoever you do do it heartily as to the lord and not unto men

141
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:01,299
knowing that of the lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance

142
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,600
for you serve the lord christ

143
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,380
but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done

144
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,119
and there is no respect of persons

145
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:14,160
masters given to your servants that which is just and equal

146
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,480
knowing that you also have a master

147
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,600
in heaven

148
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,000
as we begin to look at this portion of scripture i'd say number one examine the

149
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,480
principle god gives us a principle here

150
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,720
in verse number twenty two that is worth our examination

151
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,959
again as we look at this passage of scripture and deal with the servants and

152
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,619
the masters i'll be looking

153
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,119
uh... this morning at making the application of the servant to that of

154
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:37,339
the employee

155
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:40,660
as we think about the principle that is given here we find first of all there's

156
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,700
a principle of obedience

157
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,880
a principle of submission

158
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,660
we find that he says obey in all things

159
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,920
your masters according to the flesh

160
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,660
the reality is that you and i do not have to work for the company that we

161
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,559
work for

162
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:58,299
but if we make a decision to work for the company in whom we work for

163
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,839
and they have standards they have rules then we must follow those rules

164
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:07,079
we must obey we must submit it is a responsibility that we have

165
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,799
as a child of god

166
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:12,320
and i understand this morning that we live in a time in which those things are

167
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,480
hotly debated i understand all that's taking place

168
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,600
uh... with regard to the overreach and so on and so forth but the reality

169
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,799
is that we understand that god has given us a principle

170
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:28,339
and i believe that as we examine the principle and we begin to understand

171
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:33,260
how this principle is played out and how it's effective in our lives

172
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,059
and being able to reach others with the gospel

173
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:41,820
we find that here as he says not only this truth of obedience but i believe

174
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,219
that we also see a very important principle that is given to us in verse

175
00:08:45,219 --> 00:08:46,380
number twenty two

176
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,580
and that is a principle of integrity

177
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,900
you know we live in a day and age in which integrity is missing

178
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:55,760
there are people that do not operate with integrity

179
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,359
we find here that it says at the end of the verse

180
00:08:58,359 --> 00:09:02,000
not with eye service as men pleasers

181
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,760
now think about that statement

182
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,640
there are plenty of folks that no doubt you've heard the

183
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,119
the phraseology the cliche that has been around for

184
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:12,840
uh... no doubt decades that while the

185
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,359
cats away the mice will play you've heard that

186
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:19,479
it's something that we've become familiar with their times in which as i

187
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:21,159
worked in the corporate world

188
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:24,280
uh... there would be folks that would be doing all sorts of things that were

189
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,080
not in line with what the job duties were

190
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,039
with what the responsibilities were

191
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,159
but as soon as the boss came into the room as soon as the boss came into the

192
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:35,200
area in which those employees were

193
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,299
all of a sudden they straighten up and they're gonna start doing what they're

194
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:41,000
supposed to be doing

195
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,280
often i heard it i i can tell you how many times i heard

196
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,340
uh... when i work in the corporate world you gotta look busy

197
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,619
what do you mean look busy?

198
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:54,140
you're either doing your job or you're not

199
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,299
amen

200
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:58,739
if you're getting paid to do a job you ought to have integrity and you ought to work

201
00:09:58,739 --> 00:09:59,539
you ought to be the

202
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:01,699
The reality is that the Christian in the workplace,

203
00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:05,739
they ought to be the best employee that that workplace has.

204
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:09,659
Honestly, ought to be the absolute best employee.

205
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:10,499
Why?

206
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:13,059
Because the principle is that we're not doing this

207
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:15,859
with eye service as men pleasers.

208
00:10:15,859 --> 00:10:19,539
Because I live in a completely different realm.

209
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:22,499
I live in the heavenlies, if you will.

210
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:24,579
I'm seated already positionally.

211
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:28,019
Remember, the chapter begins with our position in Christ.

212
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:30,379
And that position impacts my pursuits.

213
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,699
I'm not trying to please my boss,

214
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:35,139
I'm trying to please my Savior.

215
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:35,979
Amen?

216
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:37,819
And as I please my Savior,

217
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:41,139
and as I do what I'm supposed to do in the sight of God,

218
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:43,219
then the outflow of that,

219
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:46,299
one of the results of that is that my employer

220
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:48,139
also is going to be pleased.

221
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:51,619
We find here that the Bible says,

222
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:54,299
not with eye service as men pleasers,

223
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:55,779
but notice what it says,

224
00:10:55,779 --> 00:11:00,459
but in singleness of heart, fearing God.

225
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:06,579
How often we lose the principle

226
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:08,659
that is given to us here,

227
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:11,019
and we get into the workplace,

228
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:15,779
and we just begin to perhaps be impacted and affected

229
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,219
by those in which we work with,

230
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,499
and by their lack of integrity,

231
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:22,619
their lack of purpose,

232
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:24,539
and their lack of hard work,

233
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:27,779
and it will rub off on the child of God.

234
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,499
Oh, you're just an overachiever,

235
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:31,859
always trying to please, blah, blah, blah.

236
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,619
People say that kind of stuff.

237
00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:35,459
Why?

238
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:36,779
Because they don't get it.

239
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,979
They don't understand that we have a Bible

240
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:44,619
that teaches us not only how we behave in the house of God,

241
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:47,819
not only how we behave in our homes as families,

242
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:50,619
but also how we behave in the workplace.

243
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:52,179
And as I understand the principle

244
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:54,179
that is given to us in verse number 22,

245
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:56,219
I find that it's a principle of obedience,

246
00:11:56,219 --> 00:11:57,859
a principle of integrity.

247
00:11:57,859 --> 00:12:01,139
We're not seeking to simply please men.

248
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:03,059
We're seeking to please our God.

249
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:07,379
In singleness of heart, fearing God.

250
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:09,099
Man, that's precious.

251
00:12:09,099 --> 00:12:10,339
And it really leads us,

252
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:11,699
not only as we look at the principle,

253
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:12,539
but if you're taking notes,

254
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:13,859
I want you to notice number two,

255
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,419
that we're to embrace the perspective.

256
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:20,059
I understand that as we work in the work world,

257
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:22,059
as we work in the corporate environment,

258
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:26,219
there are times in which we will be adversely affected

259
00:12:26,219 --> 00:12:29,179
and perhaps ridiculed because of our integrity,

260
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:30,899
because of our work ethic.

261
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,899
And there will be folks that will seek to attack us,

262
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,819
but we must embrace the perspective that is given

263
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:39,019
in the next two verses of Scripture.

264
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:41,299
When I have a proper, I will say this,

265
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:46,299
a biblical perspective, it makes a world of difference.

266
00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:50,179
If I ask myself the question, why am I here?

267
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:53,979
Or maybe I ask myself this question,

268
00:12:53,979 --> 00:12:56,219
and we'll deal with this at the end of the message as well,

269
00:12:56,219 --> 00:12:58,739
who am I here for?

270
00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:01,459
Why does God have you where he has you?

271
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:04,279
Why did God give you the job that he gave you?

272
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:08,059
Those are questions that we begin to ask ourselves,

273
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:10,939
and we understand the perspective that is given here,

274
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:13,819
and as we have that biblical perspective,

275
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:15,779
it makes a world of difference.

276
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,539
Notice what it says in verse 23.

277
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:20,339
And whatsoever ye do.

278
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:23,979
Now, that's pretty all-inclusive, is it not?

279
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:24,819
Amen?

280
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:27,299
I mean, and whatsoever you do.

281
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:28,619
Find some wiggle room.

282
00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:30,339
I mean, well, that doesn't apply here.

283
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:31,219
Well, that doesn't apply.

284
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:33,299
No, whatsoever you do.

285
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:34,539
Whatsoever you do.

286
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:37,499
Whatsoever you do.

287
00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:38,339
Do it how?

288
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,679
Notice what he says, heartily.

289
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:43,019
Heartily.

290
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:44,619
You ever hear somebody say, well, that's good enough

291
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:46,739
for government work?

292
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:49,019
Right?

293
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:51,359
Oh, that's good enough.

294
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:53,499
You ever have that?

295
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,219
Man, somebody just mails it in, so to speak,

296
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:59,439
just kind of takes it easy.

297
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:02,399
Well, what's our perspective

298
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,939
when we think about the work environment?

299
00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:06,899
What is it that God is telling us?

300
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,779
As I look here, it says, whatsoever you do,

301
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:14,579
do it heartily, with not half-heartedness,

302
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:17,259
not just it's good enough for government work,

303
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:21,979
or not just I'm a better employee than my coworker,

304
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:25,099
because it's not about comparing ourselves

305
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:26,579
amongst ourselves.

306
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,179
I believe that we can even use,

307
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:32,399
adopt what Paul says to the Corinthians in that violation.

308
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,379
We can adopt that even into the application

309
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:35,979
of in the workplace.

310
00:14:35,979 --> 00:14:39,299
I'm not seeking to just compare myself to my coworker,

311
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:40,659
and by the way, if I wanna do that,

312
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:42,859
I'm probably gonna find the worst coworker that I have

313
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:44,459
to compare myself with then.

314
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:48,939
But the Bible says that we're to do it heartily.

315
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:50,299
Notice what it says.

316
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:55,299
As to the Lord, and not to men.

317
00:14:58,459 --> 00:14:59,459
As to the Lord.

318
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:03,259
What a great perspective.

319
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:08,259
When you go to work, when you engage at that workplace,

320
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:11,819
when you understand that God has placed me here

321
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:14,139
for his purpose, for his glory,

322
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:19,019
and I'm doing this job that I'm doing for him.

323
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:22,659
As to the Lord.

324
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:25,299
You know, that's gonna change your perspective,

325
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,779
because all of a sudden, you're not gonna view your boss

326
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:30,339
the same way that you currently view your boss,

327
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:32,299
because it's not about your boss.

328
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,039
Oh, there's still things that you have to deal with,

329
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:36,279
there's still things that you're gonna have to manage,

330
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:38,579
and so on and so forth, but all of a sudden,

331
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:40,819
you say, well, I'm not really working for that person,

332
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:43,539
I'm working for God, as to the Lord.

333
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:46,779
I'm doing this for my Savior, I'm doing this for my Master.

334
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:51,779
I'm seeking to have a good testimony for God in this place.

335
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,799
And I do it as to the Lord, not unto men.

336
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:00,499
It is absolutely possible that we could get,

337
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:03,279
we could receive the accolades of man,

338
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,979
and yet displease God.

339
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:07,099
It's possible.

340
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:11,779
We begin to think about this particular perspective

341
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:14,539
that is given to us, and I believe this morning,

342
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:16,759
that it's important when we think about a perspective,

343
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,499
that we would embrace it.

344
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:21,939
That we would say, this is how I want to have my focus

345
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,099
when I get up and I go into the workplace,

346
00:16:24,099 --> 00:16:28,059
when I, this week, tomorrow, as I go into the workplace,

347
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:29,899
I wanna have this perspective,

348
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:32,219
I wanna embrace this perspective.

349
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:34,459
I guarantee you, the enemy's gonna fight you.

350
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:36,459
I guarantee you, something's gonna happen,

351
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:40,879
and it's gonna cause you that moment of frustration,

352
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:42,579
and then you just kinda can take a step back

353
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:46,499
and say, listen, I'm doing this not as a men pleaser,

354
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:49,599
I'm doing this heartily as to the Lord.

355
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:53,339
Notice in verse 24, knowing that of the Lord,

356
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,939
ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance,

357
00:16:55,939 --> 00:16:57,859
and then notice this last phrase,

358
00:16:57,859 --> 00:17:00,939
for ye serve the Lord Christ.

359
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:02,619
You serve the Lord Christ.

360
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:04,179
I want you to think about this.

361
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:08,379
We, as Bible believers, as those that have trusted Christ

362
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:12,019
as our Savior, we're saved, we're heaven-bound.

363
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:15,139
The reality is that I'm going to heaven.

364
00:17:15,139 --> 00:17:18,459
I'm not looking to just receive a plaque

365
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:20,579
with my name on it in the front office.

366
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,599
I'm not looking for that corner office

367
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,299
for some level of accolades.

368
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:28,219
It's fine to be accomplished, and it's fine to pursue

369
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:30,019
and to have that recognition,

370
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:33,339
but ultimately, my perspective is the fact

371
00:17:33,339 --> 00:17:36,579
that I'm serving Christ and I'm going to heaven one day.

372
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:38,819
And I can get so busy with trying

373
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:40,939
to pursue the corner office,

374
00:17:40,939 --> 00:17:43,899
I can get so busy with trying to get my name on a plaque

375
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:46,359
and with all of the recognition and accolades

376
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,139
that could come in the workplace,

377
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:50,579
I can get so busy with those things

378
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:55,299
that I have in my mind compartmentalized spiritual

379
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:57,699
from carnal, if you will.

380
00:17:57,699 --> 00:17:59,179
Carnal's a bad word to use,

381
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:02,159
but just the everyday monotony of life,

382
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:04,359
and saying, well, this is the workplace,

383
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:06,419
and therefore, I really don't have

384
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,599
any responsibilities here.

385
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:10,259
No, God has placed you there.

386
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:13,319
You are the light in your workplace.

387
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:17,719
We begin to understand how this perspective

388
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:20,379
will demand our best.

389
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:22,519
It will demand that we understand

390
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,919
that we're living for Christ

391
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:26,919
and we're serving the Lord Christ.

392
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:30,799
This is really, this truth is given to us in every area.

393
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,419
We look at the application here

394
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:33,839
with regard to the workplace

395
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:36,000
and we think about our behavior in the workplace,

396
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,559
but as I am working at the church house,

397
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:42,979
I'm cutting grass, I'm cleaning the church house.

398
00:18:42,979 --> 00:18:44,899
Man, I'm doing that for the Lord.

399
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm doing it for Christ.

400
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,159
And as I finish up the job, the task that's at hand,

401
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:55,199
I look back and I say, would my Savior be pleased with that?

402
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:58,440
Did I do my best?

403
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,079
Did I put in, did I do it as a men-pleaser

404
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,199
or did I do it with singleness of heart,

405
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:07,799
fearing God, serving God?

406
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:11,759
It'll change how we operate, it really will,

407
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,599
when I recognize that I'm doing it for the Lord.

408
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:17,199
Number of years ago, I would not mention

409
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:19,880
the individual's name for sake of embarrassment,

410
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,959
for some may know who they are,

411
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,759
but a number of years ago, I remember sitting

412
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:25,679
and watching an individual

413
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,320
and as they were doing some work here at the church

414
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,119
and they could not get a piece of machinery to work

415
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,820
that they were trying to get to work

416
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,880
and they were trying to blow off the parking lot

417
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,959
with all of the debris after cutting grass

418
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:42,119
and they could not get the unit to work

419
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:44,000
and literally, I saw on the cameras,

420
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,059
the individual with a broom to sweep the parking lot.

421
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:54,679
Wow, I thought, man, would I do that?

422
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:55,599
Or would I just be like, man,

423
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,839
I couldn't get the thing to start, I'm sorry.

424
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,559
But they were like, you know what?

425
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,959
I think, I never actually spoke to the individual about it,

426
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:08,079
but I think the perspective was, I'm doing this for God.

427
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,419
I'm doing this for God.

428
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:13,919
I went out and helped get the machine started

429
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,799
so they could use the blower and not have to push.

430
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,919
Could you imagine sweeping this parking lot?

431
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:20,919
I've shoveled this parking lot more times

432
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,159
than I could count,

433
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,459
but I can't imagine sweeping the parking lot.

434
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:28,039
But that perspective is a perspective,

435
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:31,479
listen, they didn't know anyone was even watching or knew.

436
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,199
They're doing it for God.

437
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,599
I like that perspective.

438
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:40,479
Romans 12 and verse number 11, the Bible says this,

439
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:41,799
in this portion of Scripture,

440
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:44,359
when we think about the responsibility,

441
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,639
it says in the workplace,

442
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:49,799
not slothful in business,

443
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:54,279
fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.

444
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:57,959
Not slothful in business.

445
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,239
Again, when we understand the principle

446
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:02,319
that is given to us in verse 22,

447
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:05,519
with regard to obedience, submission, integrity,

448
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:07,439
and then we see this perspective,

449
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:10,939
this biblical perspective that I'm working not for man,

450
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:12,759
I'm working as to the Lord.

451
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:15,199
I understand that I serve the Lord Christ,

452
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:19,439
then we find that I cannot be slothful in business.

453
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:21,659
It's going to demand my best.

454
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:24,759
It's going to require that I give it my all.

455
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,879
Not because I'm looking for accolades from man,

456
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:31,680
but because I'm serving my Savior.

457
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,159
We find that as we continue looking

458
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:34,319
at the portion of Scripture,

459
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:37,000
that not only do we see the need

460
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,399
to examine the principle, embrace the perspective,

461
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:42,119
but I find that we're to eliminate partiality.

462
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:44,839
In verse 25 and then in verse number one

463
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:45,979
of chapter number four,

464
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:48,119
we find that we're to eliminate partiality.

465
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:50,239
You'll remember that the subject of partiality

466
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:52,159
was addressed in verse number 11.

467
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,759
It was back there where Paul said

468
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,319
where there is neither Greek nor Jew,

469
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:57,519
circumcision nor uncircumcision.

470
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,639
Barbarians get thee in bond nor free,

471
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:02,500
but Christ is all and in all.

472
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,959
We come to verse 25 of this third chapter

473
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:05,799
and the Bible says,

474
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:07,959
but he that doeth wrong shall receive

475
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,419
for the wrong which he hath done.

476
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:10,819
Notice this phrase,

477
00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:14,360
there is no respect of persons.

478
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,520
Verse one, master is given to your servants

479
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,440
that which is just and equal,

480
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,020
knowing that ye also have a master in heaven.

481
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,739
No doubt, there have been times in our lives

482
00:22:25,739 --> 00:22:29,739
where we have observed partiality in the workplace.

483
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:32,039
No doubt, there's times in which someone

484
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:35,259
gets preferential treatment because of their last name,

485
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:37,139
because of their relationship with the boss,

486
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:40,459
because they go golfing with the CEO,

487
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,020
whatever the circumstance is,

488
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,580
we have witnessed, we have observed

489
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,259
partiality in the workplace.

490
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:48,880
But the biblical truth is that our God

491
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,880
is no respecter of persons

492
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,500
and therefore we, as his people,

493
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,199
should be no respecter of persons, amen?

494
00:22:57,199 --> 00:23:00,380
There's some that sit within the congregation,

495
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,440
there are some that are listening via livestream today,

496
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,479
that you find your place in a place of supervision

497
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:09,479
in the workplace, that you find that your position

498
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:11,639
is one in which you have individuals

499
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:14,800
that would be responsible, accountable to you

500
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,959
as a supervisor, manager,

501
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:20,360
some level of executive leadership or management,

502
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,959
whatever it may be, and the reality is that

503
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:25,759
it is absolutely essential that there is

504
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:28,639
no respect of persons,

505
00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:32,080
that we understand that our God is no respecter of persons

506
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,440
and therefore we are to be no respecter of persons.

507
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,599
We see it in our society,

508
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,419
but it doesn't make it right, amen?

509
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,080
In fact, there are many times in which

510
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,720
we'll observe partiality and it will bother us.

511
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,720
We find that God has given the truth here

512
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,360
in this portion of Scripture that there should be

513
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,440
no partiality, we're to eliminate the partiality.

514
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,919
There should be fairness in punishment as well

515
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:00,839
as in reward.

516
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,360
Notice what it says in verse 25,

517
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,720
but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong

518
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,839
which he hath done.

519
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:09,800
Verse number one, master is given to your servants

520
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,080
that which is just and equal.

521
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,360
And so we understand this truth of fairness

522
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,440
not only in punishment, but also in reward.

523
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,440
Notice over in the book of Galatians, if you will,

524
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,799
hold your spot here in Colossians.

525
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:23,279
We'll be back in just a moment,

526
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,639
but look in Galatians chapter number six.

527
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:28,040
And I want you to see what we find here

528
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,559
in this portion of Scripture with regard to the truth

529
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:32,679
that God gives us.

530
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,480
He is, again, no respecter of persons

531
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,279
and I am thankful that he's given us that truth

532
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:41,279
in his word and we too are to be no respecter of persons.

533
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,519
It says in Galatians six and verse number seven,

534
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:44,919
be not deceived.

535
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,720
God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man soweth,

536
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,799
that shall he also reap.

537
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:53,600
There are consequences for our actions.

538
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,239
It's just the way it works, amen.

539
00:24:57,239 --> 00:25:01,720
And we understand in our lives the importance

540
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,160
of this truth of us understanding it before God,

541
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,399
but us also carrying judgment out in like fashion.

542
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:10,679
Notice in verse number eight, there is oftentimes

543
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:12,519
as we think about verse number seven,

544
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:16,279
we think about it strictly in the negative context.

545
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:18,880
But if you look at verse number eight of Galatians six

546
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,919
with verse number seven, you find that the principle,

547
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,639
may I say law, that is established here

548
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:28,639
is a principle or law that is both positive and negative.

549
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:32,200
It's easy to focus on the negative,

550
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,799
but the reality is that verse number eight reveals to us

551
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,839
that it's both positive and negative.

552
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:39,839
It says, for he that soweth to his flesh

553
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:42,720
shall of the flesh reap corruption.

554
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,839
That's negative, all right?

555
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:45,799
That's not a good deal.

556
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:47,799
You don't want that fruit.

557
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:51,559
That's the individual, as a preacher of yesteryear said,

558
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:56,079
that there are people that claim to be followers of Christ

559
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:00,079
that sow seeds of wickedness Monday through Saturday,

560
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:02,200
and then come to the church house on Sunday

561
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,500
and pray for crop failure.

562
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,320
That's a great quote.

563
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,160
It's foolish.

564
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,359
That's a great quote.

565
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,519
They sow seeds of wickedness,

566
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:17,320
and then they pray for crop failure.

567
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,880
No, God says, for he that soweth to his flesh

568
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,119
shall of the flesh reap corruption.

569
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:28,880
But he that soweth to the Spirit

570
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,720
shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.

571
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,839
That's positive.

572
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,519
And so the law, the principle that God has established

573
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:38,720
of sowing and reaping,

574
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,959
we understand biblically

575
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:42,200
that there's a negative aspect of that,

576
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,119
but there's a positive aspect of that.

577
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:47,720
And the reality is that we need to be sowing good seeds

578
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,359
so that we're reaping a good harvest, amen?

579
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,519
So that we don't have to worry

580
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:54,839
about praying for crop failure.

581
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:57,279
We can say, man, I want the crop to come in,

582
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,760
and I want it to come in good.

583
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,200
I mean, I want it to be plentiful.

584
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,040
Why?

585
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,359
Because I've sown some good seeds,

586
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:09,519
and I'm looking for that good harvest, amen?

587
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:12,760
And we find that here we're to be no respecter of persons.

588
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,720
We must eliminate partiality.

589
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,440
As we think about this truth in Colossians chapter three,

590
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,880
to end the chapter and to begin the fourth chapter,

591
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,160
we think about our behavior in the workplace.

592
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,760
And yes, there's principle, there's perspective.

593
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,760
We're to eliminate this partiality.

594
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,679
But I would submit to you this morning

595
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,160
that I believe that our behavior in the workplace,

596
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,559
as I mentioned by way of introduction,

597
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,559
can be, may I say should be, a catalyst for revival.

598
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:46,679
I wonder this morning if we could just for a few moments

599
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:48,399
as we conclude the service

600
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,959
and think about this aspect of our behavior in the workplace

601
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:55,160
and we think about the truth that God has given us

602
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,880
and we say, how does this truth apply in my life?

603
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,160
I wonder this morning if when we would consider ourselves

604
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,519
those that are employees this morning,

605
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:08,320
those that have a place of employment,

606
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,880
whether you're at the bottom of the corporate ladder

607
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,760
or you're at the top of the corporate ladder, matters not,

608
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,639
but you have a place of employment,

609
00:28:16,639 --> 00:28:18,639
there's some place that you'll go,

610
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:20,359
perhaps even tomorrow,

611
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:22,160
and you'll go to that place of employment.

612
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,519
I wonder this morning

613
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,540
if we would begin to consider ourselves missionaries.

614
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:31,320
Not a missionary to a country,

615
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:33,760
but a missionary to a company.

616
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:38,679
Understanding that God has placed us there.

617
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:41,320
I read a book, I actually finished it yesterday,

618
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,080
it's called The Business Revival.

619
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,080
It's written by an individual

620
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,279
that probably doesn't believe everything biblically

621
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,559
as I believe or as you would believe,

622
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:51,679
but it's written by an individual that believes,

623
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,520
he's trusted Christ as a savior

624
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,320
by his testimony in the book,

625
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,479
and he believes that God hears and answers prayer

626
00:28:57,479 --> 00:29:00,719
and he believed that God had him in his place of employment

627
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:03,520
for a greater reason than just making a living.

628
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,080
And man, it's a great book.

629
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,880
I'd encourage you to get it and read it.

630
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,880
Again, I would not endorse

631
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,479
all of what he would believe biblically or theologically,

632
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:17,400
but what God has done through this man

633
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,140
and this perspective of how God is able to work is amazing.

634
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,320
And really the thought this morning

635
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,119
that I'm not just a missionary to,

636
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:30,159
or I'm not looking at just a missions map

637
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,320
saying these are the missionaries that we support

638
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,679
that are going to foreign countries,

639
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,960
but I wonder this morning, what if we could,

640
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,599
what if we took the time to put together

641
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:42,719
some sort of internal document of the companies

642
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:44,960
that our members are missionaries to?

643
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,239
And we began to pray one for another

644
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:50,440
the way that we pray for our missionaries.

645
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,200
Begin to think about, I'll use myself as an example,

646
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,359
when I worked in the corporate world

647
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,919
that I worked for Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation,

648
00:29:56,919 --> 00:29:59,239
what if I had a group of people in the church

649
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:01,080
that I attended during that period?

650
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,620
the period of time of my life

651
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:08,060
that they prayed for the missionary at Sikorsky.

652
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:12,140
The way that they prayed for the missionary in Scotland.

653
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,780
You see how it changed our perspective?

654
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,280
We begin to see that God has you in that place

655
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,200
for a reason, for a time, for a purpose.

656
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,720
And it's so much greater

657
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,040
than just making a living.

658
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,080
So often we get caught up in the corporate world

659
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,600
and all the culture and the society.

660
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,400
We understand that God can take care of us

661
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,880
any way He chooses to take care of us.

662
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,560
Amen?

663
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,520
He used a raven to feed His prophet.

664
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,000
God can take care of us.

665
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,160
In this particular era, in this particular time,

666
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,200
we find that often He uses a place of employment

667
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,360
in order to take care of us,

668
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,760
but we must understand

669
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,800
that it's not about just making a living.

670
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,280
The author of this book, he says it this way.

671
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,760
He said, I think it's great.

672
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,400
Do you have a desire to make a difference

673
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,080
or just to make a mortgage payment?

674
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,360
That was a quote from his book.

675
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,080
That's what he says.

676
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,520
And it's making that difference.

677
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,480
And see, oftentimes what happens,

678
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,920
and again, as we begin to think about

679
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,120
this portion of Scripture

680
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,720
and begin to think about our perspective

681
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,880
and all that takes place,

682
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,040
I wonder this morning how many people

683
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,440
in our place of employment,

684
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,720
how many people that we've come into contact with,

685
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,760
and perhaps we've worked at this place

686
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,280
for a short period of time,

687
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,440
perhaps we've worked there for a long period of time,

688
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,240
how many people in that particular place of employment

689
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,400
know that you're a follower of Jesus Christ?

690
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,080
I'm not suggesting this morning

691
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,080
that we steal the time of our employers

692
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,320
and we're there seeking to simply propagate the gospel

693
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,080
and being a bad employee.

694
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,200
No, I'm suggesting that we're good employees,

695
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,680
the best employees,

696
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,920
but I'm suggesting that, hey,

697
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,920
is there somebody that you're praying for in your workplace?

698
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,160
Is there somebody that you know

699
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,320
that's dealing with a problem,

700
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,400
that's dealing with,

701
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,160
how many of you,

702
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,640
I'm not gonna ask you any names,

703
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,880
but I am gonna ask you to raise your hand,

704
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,080
how many of you know somebody

705
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,960
that you work with that's lost?

706
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,680
Everybody that has a job,

707
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,600
now, I can't raise my hand

708
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,920
because I work with Holly,

709
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,040
and she's saved, amen.

710
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,960
But the reality is, listen,

711
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,000
if you work somewhere,

712
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,200
you probably know a lost person, right?

713
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,720
Have you ever prayed for them?

714
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,040
Do you have a list of coworkers?

715
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,280
Maybe start with the one that bothers you the most.

716
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,120
Seriously.

717
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,120
Because guess what?

718
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,520
God hears and answers prayer.

719
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,640
You don't have to neglect one minute on the clock

720
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,160
of working for your employer

721
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,640
to do what you're supposed to do

722
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,040
to pray for a coworker.

723
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,800
Pray that God would open up a door,

724
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,040
give you an opportunity.

725
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,400
And when you embrace the perspective

726
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,960
that we dealt with earlier in the message,

727
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,960
as we are doing what we're doing

728
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,160
not for the boss,

729
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,440
but for the Lord,

730
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,280
when somebody says,

731
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,040
man, this boss, I can't stand,

732
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,480
he's just a tyrant,

733
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,360
he's this, he's that,

734
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,880
blah, blah, blah, blah,

735
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,960
I could share stories with you

736
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,800
from the corporate world.

737
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,160
I worked in the corporate world for years.

738
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,760
I understand what that difficulty is like.

739
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,760
I may not understand your specific person,

740
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,600
but we can just exchange names.

741
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,760
Because you're always going to find someone

742
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,760
that's that way.

743
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,120
But I wonder this morning,

744
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,280
do they see Christ in us,

745
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,040
the hope of glory?

746
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,480
Do the coworkers understand that,

747
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,000
listen, how can you deal with this guy,

748
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
blah, blah, blah?

749
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,960
I'm looking beyond that person

750
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,520
because I'm working as unto the Lord,

751
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,000
not unto men.

752
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,000
I believe this morning,

753
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,840
it's interesting,

754
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,600
I planned to preach this message several weeks ago.

755
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,520
In fact, it was the week after

756
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,640
Brother Savalle was here

757
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,320
that I was planning to preach this message,

758
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,840
and through a series of circumstances,

759
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,680
the Lord led me to preach a message

760
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,400
on the return of Christ.

761
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,800
And then last week,

762
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,400
we had a baby dedication.

763
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,840
But I believe that it's very interesting

764
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,800
how that we look at this passage of Scripture

765
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,880
this morning,

766
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,760
and I believe that there's a direct correlation,

767
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,320
connection, if you will,

768
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,320
to the message that I'll be preaching this evening

769
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,720
from Genesis 21.

770
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,360
And I will not deal with much of that

771
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,000
because I'll be preaching it this evening,

772
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,520
but Abimelech says this of Abraham in Genesis 21

773
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,320
in verse number 22,

774
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,320
God is with thee

775
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,840
in all that thou doest.

776
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,120
God is with thee

777
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,120
in all that thou doest.

778
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,000
And I just wonder this morning,

779
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,440
we think about the workplace,

780
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,160
the behavior in our workplace,

781
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,520
I wonder this morning,

782
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,960
is there anyone

783
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,080
that we work with that would say of us

784
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,720
what Abimelech said of Abraham?

785
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,880
God is with thee

786
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,480
in all that thou doest.

787
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,760
Do they see God's hand of favor upon us?

788
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,040
Do they see that there's something different about us?

789
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,080
The reason that I believe

790
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,360
that this is a catalyst for revival,

791
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,680
our behavior in the workplace,

792
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,120
a catalyst for revival,

793
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,760
is because there are connections

794
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,560
that you have in your workplace

795
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,880
that God can allow

796
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,880
because of various relationships

797
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,480
for you to be able to share the gospel with them

798
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,560
and they get saved

799
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,760
and they get added to the church

800
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,360
and amazing things can happen.

801
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,040
Do you know that when I go and knock on someone's door,

802
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,080
they don't know who I am

803
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,560
and they probably don't want me there?

804
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,640
I have no relationship with them whatsoever

805
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,560
and I'm gonna go there

806
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,640
and I'm gonna try to reach them with the gospel

807
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,480
but you have people that you work with

808
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,400
that there's a level,

809
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,320
your neighbors is another aspect,

810
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,320
we won't deal with that this morning,

811
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,400
but the people that you work with,

812
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,680
there's a relationship there.

813
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,400
You pray for them and you work

814
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,160
and you ask God to open up doors of opportunity

815
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,800
and I understand there are times we say,

816
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,720
oh, there's no way that's gonna happen.

817
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,920
Do you believe God?

818
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,680
Do you believe that God is able

819
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,360
to do something in your workplace?

820
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,600
Do you believe that God is able to use you,

821
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,880
that he planted you there?

822
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,680
Again, the question was asked by this author

823
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,960
in the book that he wrote that I just finished yesterday,

824
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,760
who am I here for?

825
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,000
He gives the testimony that he had a career change

826
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,160
and in his career change,

827
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,400
as he started in the new place of employment,

828
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,040
he had some struggles and things that he was dealing with,

829
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,240
with just trying to learn a new industry

830
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,200
and so on and so forth,

831
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,080
but the reality is that he wanted to have this perspective,

832
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,760
who am I here for?

833
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,200
Not only to answer that question that I'm here,

834
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,800
God has placed me here,

835
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,680
but did God place me here in order to reach certain people

836
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,520
with the gospel?

837
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,640
The answer is yes, because we're his ambassadors, amen?

838
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,840
And just as we look at that missions map

839
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,760
and we focus upon and we speak about the importance

840
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,080
of world missions and I'm for it and I'm behind it

841
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,200
and I give to missions every month

842
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,200
and I love missions and we pray for our missionaries

843
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,200
and we're excited to hear updates from our missionaries

844
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,360
about what God is doing and how God is working.

845
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,040
But wouldn't it be encouraging if next Sunday

846
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,120
or eight Sundays from now,

847
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,480
there's someone sitting in the pew next to you?

848
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,560
Says, oh, nice to meet you, this is one of my coworkers.

849
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,160
Let me share with you how God worked and what God did

850
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,240
and how God opened doors.

851
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,680
Man, that's what it's about.

852
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,200
It's not about just making a living.

853
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,240
And so often we live in this culture,

854
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,480
we live in this society that we can gain that perspective.

855
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,320
I understand that culture and society is beating us up

856
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,560
every single day, I understand that.

857
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,560
And it's very easy to get our eyes shifted

858
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,360
from what the biblical principle is

859
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,000
and get into the monotony of life,

860
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
to the monotony, the mundane behavior of I just go to work,

861
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,320
I'm just in and out and I'm just doing.

862
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,720
No, no, God has you there for a purpose.

863
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,720
When I understand this morning that whatsoever I do,

864
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,320
I do it heartily as to the Lord, not unto men.

865
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,320
I'm seeking to please God.

866
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,040
And you know, God can move us wherever he wants to move us

867
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,040
and he can give us employment wherever he wants

868
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,239
to give us employment and we seek to be,

869
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:51,119
even in that place, his representative.

870
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,440
Are there challenges?

871
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,480
Absolutely.

872
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,880
You know why there are challenges?

873
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,920
Because the devil doesn't want you to do it.

874
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,360
So there'll be challenges.

875
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,920
But the reality is that we can pray to the God of heaven

876
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,760
who can move in hearts and lives

877
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,239
and can bring to pass amazing things.

878
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:13,720
Listen, you might not be able to talk to your coworker

879
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,640
about the Lord in certain settings

880
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,480
because of the task at hand

881
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,280
and the responsibility of being a good employee,

882
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,360
but if you get a lunch break,

883
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,200
there's nothing that says

884
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,080
that you can't have lunch with someone.

885
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,080
And here's the thing, and this is,

886
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,440
God's been helping me in this,

887
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,880
not only through just a variety of means,

888
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,280
talking with some of our missionaries

889
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,480
and learning some things

890
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,360
about some of what our missionaries are dealing with

891
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,320
and some of the difficulties that they have faced

892
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,559
and so on and so forth is that,

893
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:45,679
maybe what we do is we just spend consistent time

894
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:47,239
in prayer for an individual

895
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,160
before we start trying to beat them over the head with Bible.

896
00:39:53,799 --> 00:39:55,799
And just pray that God would soften their heart,

897
00:39:55,799 --> 00:39:57,679
that God would allow things in their lives

898
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:00,320
that will help them to understand their need for Christ.

899
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,559
Maybe it's your neighbor.

900
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:05,639
or maybe it's a family member that we just pray for.

901
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:07,639
Within the context of this text of scripture,

902
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:08,799
maybe it's a co-worker.

903
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:12,279
When we ended the revival meeting,

904
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:14,699
Pastor Edwards made this statement on one of the nights,

905
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:16,479
I think it was Tuesday evening.

906
00:40:16,479 --> 00:40:20,139
He asked this question about God placing someone's name

907
00:40:20,139 --> 00:40:22,199
on your heart to pray for.

908
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,699
And I just wonder this morning,

909
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:25,879
as you think about your workplace,

910
00:40:25,879 --> 00:40:29,399
and you think about the context of this particular message,

911
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:30,999
maybe there's a decision that we need to make

912
00:40:30,999 --> 00:40:35,999
that, you know what, I've kind of lost focus a little bit.

913
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:38,199
I've kind of lost my way in the workplace.

914
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:41,939
I've gotten caught up in the politics of work.

915
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:45,759
The office politics and the office whatever.

916
00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:50,759
And I've not really been working heartily as to the Lord.

917
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:54,179
I've not really been the employee that I ought to be.

918
00:40:54,179 --> 00:40:56,059
You know that, God knows that.

919
00:40:57,459 --> 00:40:59,239
But maybe this morning,

920
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:01,879
maybe God would put someone's name on your heart.

921
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,319
And you just wanna make a commitment to God,

922
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:06,519
I'm gonna pray for them.

923
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,619
And I'm gonna pray that God will open up

924
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:11,680
a door of opportunity.

925
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,819
I believe with all of my heart that when we pray

926
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:17,639
that God will open opportunities and we make a commitment

927
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:19,839
that will seize those opportunities,

928
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:22,639
that those are prayers that God delights in answering.

929
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,959
Oftentimes it's easy to see an opportunity going

930
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:28,319
then coming.

931
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,279
We say, man, I missed that opportunity.

932
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:36,199
But if we're specifically engaged in praying for a coworker

933
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:38,519
and praying that God will open their heart

934
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:40,360
to the truth of the gospel and praying

935
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,559
that God would give us the opportunity.

936
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,199
I had plenty of times where I had coworkers

937
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:52,699
that would come to me and say, say it in different ways.

938
00:41:52,699 --> 00:41:54,319
I know you're a, I had somebody say,

939
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,079
I know you're a man of the cloth.

940
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,599
And the world is that, man.

941
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:00,479
Anyway, they'd say it different ways.

942
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,279
But they'd say, you know what?

943
00:42:04,279 --> 00:42:07,839
We just found out somebody's got cancer,

944
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,759
somebody's got my this, my that.

945
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:11,860
Would you pray for me?

946
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,279
Because God works in the hearts of people.

947
00:42:18,279 --> 00:42:21,080
And if you begin to pray for those opportunities

948
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,199
and you begin to pray for that one

949
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:26,039
that God will put on your heart and mind,

950
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:27,839
and you faithfully do that,

951
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:30,080
and you're the best worker that you can be

952
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,679
because you're serving Christ,

953
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,119
God will open up doors of opportunity.

954
00:42:36,479 --> 00:42:37,959
And you may be the one that they come to

955
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:40,239
and say, would you pray for me?

956
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:41,720
You can pray for them.

957
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:46,720
You see how that door just got opened for God to work.

958
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,959
And of course, the greatest need that anyone needs,

959
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:53,759
the greatest need that any individual has

960
00:42:53,759 --> 00:42:55,599
is the need for salvation.

961
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:00,039
Oftentimes, it will be a need for health,

962
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:01,520
it'll be a need for finances,

963
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,160
it'll be a need for marriage,

964
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,000
it'll be a need for fill in the blank

965
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
that will bring them to the place of realizing

966
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,720
they're falling apart, their life is a mess.

967
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,119
And then, ultimately, through conversation

968
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,119
and through biblical truth,

969
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,279
they'll realize what they really need is Christ.

970
00:43:22,279 --> 00:43:24,080
What they need is Christ.

971
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:26,839
And God has you in your place.

972
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:29,639
I would not do it for sake of the fact

973
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:31,880
that we're on live stream,

974
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,319
but if I could, if I knew,

975
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:36,759
I don't even know everywhere that people work in our church,

976
00:43:36,759 --> 00:43:39,239
but if I knew the name of each employer,

977
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:42,039
in my heart and in my mind,

978
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:44,199
it's we have a missionary to fill in the blank,

979
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:45,479
a missionary to fill in the blank,

980
00:43:45,479 --> 00:43:47,479
a missionary to fill in the blank.

981
00:43:47,479 --> 00:43:50,039
These are the missionaries from our church

982
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:52,880
that this week, that tomorrow,

983
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,160
get to go into all of those workplaces

984
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,319
and let your light shine.

985
00:43:59,319 --> 00:44:01,559
We tell the kids, we sing it with the kids.

986
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:04,039
This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.

987
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:06,279
Hide it under a bushel.

988
00:44:06,279 --> 00:44:07,479
No!

989
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:08,639
But man, we go to the workplace,

990
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:10,800
we say, man, I left that light at home

991
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,679
because I am, right?

992
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:16,839
But we're his representatives, we're his ambassadors.

993
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,880
And I believe this morning in the culture,

994
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,079
in the age in which we're living,

995
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:26,839
that this truth about our behavior in the workplace

996
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:30,919
can be the catalyst to revival in our world

997
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:34,559
because we go all over the place,

998
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:37,760
all of our different respective places of employment,

999
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,040
and we can reach people with the gospel.

1000
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,880
Let's pray.

1001
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,519
Father, we love you this morning.

1002
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:45,919
We thank you for loving us.

1003
00:44:45,919 --> 00:44:49,480
God, we thank you for your Word

1004
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,799
and how your Word gives us instruction

1005
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,600
truly in every area of our lives.

1006
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,399
This morning, as we focus our attention

1007
00:45:00,399 --> 00:45:01,880
upon this portion of Scripture

1008
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,320
and deal with our behavior in the workplace,

1009
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,399
I thank you for the places of employment

1010
00:45:08,399 --> 00:45:10,359
that you've given to our church family,

1011
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,519
the places in which you have chosen

1012
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:17,720
to plant them,

1013
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:26,239
not solely for the purpose of making a living,

1014
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,760
for the purpose of being your representative.

1015
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,880
There are souls that daily come in contact

1016
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,480
with those that are sitting in this building

1017
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,519
and those that are listening via live stream

1018
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:49,919
that do not know the Lord Jesus Christ.

1019
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:57,440
Lord, as we faithfully pray for our missionaries,

1020
00:46:00,399 --> 00:46:01,839
pray this morning that you would help us

1021
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,760
to faithfully pray for one another

1022
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,559
with the thought that we go as missionaries

1023
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,119
not to a foreign country, but to a company.

1024
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,359
God, I pray that you'd help us to be

1025
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,639
the employees that we're to be.

1026
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:27,639
Would you help us to operate with integrity,

1027
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:30,959
singleness of heart?

1028
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:33,639
Would you help us in whatsoever we do

1029
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:36,440
to do it heartily as unto the Lord, not unto men?

1030
00:46:38,279 --> 00:46:41,040
Would you help us, God, to exalt and magnify you

1031
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,000
in our lives and even in the workplace?

1032
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,799
Put that name of that coworker

1033
00:46:48,799 --> 00:46:51,119
on folks' hearts this morning.

1034
00:46:51,959 --> 00:46:53,919
I pray that we would make a commitment

1035
00:46:53,919 --> 00:46:56,720
to pray faithfully and diligently

1036
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:00,639
that you would open up doors of opportunity,

1037
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:02,720
that those opportunities would be seized.

1038
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,119
Lord, you'd help us to see souls saved and lives changed.

1039
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:14,119
But truly, this could be a catalyst for revival.

1040
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,160
We pray that you'd seal every decision,

1041
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,440
that you'd work as only you can.

1042
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,399
We'll thank you for it, in Christ's name we pray.

1043
00:47:22,399 --> 00:47:23,239
Would you stand?
