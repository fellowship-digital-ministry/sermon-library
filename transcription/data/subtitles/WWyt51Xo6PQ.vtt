WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.619
and uh... he was kinda of my mindset there's no reason to cancel church

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:06.940
whoever can make it can make it those that can't can't

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.180
and uh... that's what he decided to do

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.300
and uh... there are several other church in the area that canceled and so they

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.579
knew he was having service so a bunch of them came but there's still kind of a

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:16.659
light crowd

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:19.860
and uh... he was up on the platform but they were kind of just meeting on one

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.579
side of the auditorium and

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.479
uh... he forgot that he was on the platform and he went to walk over where

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:27.579
the song leader was and he tumbled right down the steps

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.680
and uh... he said that video went viral

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.080
and uh... he said it was more hits than any other video the church ever had out

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.040
and so i don't want to do that amen

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.560
and uh... anyway colossians chapter number three

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.319
colossians chapter number three will be finishing up the third chapter

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:47.240
and entering into the fourth chapter this morning

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.439
and uh... we'll be looking at chapter three verse twenty two down through the

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:52.479
first verse of chapter number four

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:55.520
and as we conclude this portion of scripture this part of the book of

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.619
colossians

00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:01.659
we're mindful that the third chapter of the book of colossians it started

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.860
with a reminder of our position in christ and i'm so thankful

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.980
to be in christ i'm so thankful to be a child of his amen

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.519
and the reality is that we as we studied the first portion of colossians three

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:18.860
we understood

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.819
that my position

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:23.339
will impact my pursuits

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.519
what am i pursuing in life

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:29.519
and when i understand my position will understand this world is not my home

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:31.760
amen i'm just passing through

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.760
i'm so thankful to know

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.480
that heaven is my home that i'm a stranger in a pilgrim

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.000
i'm not home but i'm going home amen

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.400
and uh... the reality is that our position will impact our pursuits

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.800
we then looked at the next section and it was a weighty section in colossians

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.639
three

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:53.620
dealing really with the process of sanctification

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.660
and it is the plan of god that the child of god would be conformed to the image

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.500
of the lord jesus christ

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.360
and uh... his dear son and we are to be like christ and

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.139
as we go through the christian life we understand that it's not in my power

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.500
it's not in your power to live the christian life

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.940
it's christ in us it is walking in the spirit

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.979
so that we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh and we went through a number

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.800
of truths that were provided in that section of colossians three

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.600
and then really the last several lessons we've dealt with now how does

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.199
that impact my behavior

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:31.279
how is it

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:34.600
that your behavior how is it that my behavior

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.600
in our daily lives is going to be impacted

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.279
by the truth that is given to us in this chapter in colossians three

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:47.839
if i follow the instructions if i put off the old man the flesh and i

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.059
put on the new man the spirit if i'm walking in the

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:54.179
the spirit so that i'm not fulfilling the lust of the flesh by the way that's

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:56.820
not just for ten thirty on sunday morning

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.100
that is for our lives that is every day of our lives

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.380
we represent the lord jesus christ and we understand again that it's not our

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.539
own power

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:08.699
it's through his power

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:13.419
we looked at the truth of how this would impact our behavior

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:15.619
in the church house

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:16.779
in the church house

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.759
we understand the church in corinth they

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:22.119
had all kinds of problems and divisions and schisms and they were

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:26.559
i'm of paul and i'm of apollos and all of this debate and division that was

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:27.380
present

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.119
that is not the plan of god that is not pleasing to the lord

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:33.320
and so we find that there's behavior

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.639
uh... in the church house that will be impacted as we follow the instruction we

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:38.240
then

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.600
look at the section dealing with in our homes

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.160
a home where the lord is glorified and i'm so thankful

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.899
that god instituted the home that god designed the home that god

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:52.500
has provided instruction for the home

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.940
as we look at that particular message and dealt with that section here in

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.220
colossians three

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.779
we understood that it's god that designed the home

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:06.179
and therefore it is god that is the authority with regard to the operation

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:07.940
of the home

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.259
we can debate it

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:10.500
we can fight it

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.660
we can resist it we can try to listen to somebody else and some other

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.839
authorities we can listen to culture

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.000
and society

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.359
but the reality is that god is the authority

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.980
and is in our best interest to just simply submit

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.920
to what god has said

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.040
and we can have a home where god is honored

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.940
this morning

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.600
we'll be looking at our behavior in the workplace

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.000
you say man even the bible deals with our behavior in the workplace absolutely

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.320
because god's word deals with every area of our lives

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:46.000
we understand that as we look at this particular passage of scripture

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.859
that the terminology will be used with that relationship between servants and

00:04:49.859 --> 00:04:50.899
masters

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:54.540
and though that relationship doesn't exist in the same context in which we

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.480
deal with in this particular

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.140
era in which this was written i believe that it would be appropriate for us to

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.980
make the application

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.179
with regard to our behavior in the workplace

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:07.859
how is it that we behave in the workplace what is it

00:05:07.859 --> 00:05:12.299
as i've understood my position in christ and its impact at my pursuits as

00:05:12.299 --> 00:05:13.399
i've understood

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:15.799
the process of sanctification if i

00:05:15.799 --> 00:05:19.519
put off the old man and i put on the new man if i'm walking

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:23.399
in the power of the holy spirit of god so that i'm not fulfilling the lust of my

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:24.440
own flesh

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.359
that should be seen

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:28.279
in our workplace

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:31.320
and as we look at this passage of scripture there's great truth that is

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.040
given to us that i believe

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.040
will help us and i'll mention this at the end of the message as well this

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:36.739
morning

00:05:36.739 --> 00:05:39.779
but i truly believe that if we would take

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:42.739
the principles that god provides us with

00:05:42.739 --> 00:05:45.299
in his word and apply them

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:48.299
in our lives specifically dealing here

00:05:48.299 --> 00:05:52.220
uh... with this aspect of our behavior in the workplace i believe it could be a

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.299
catalyst for revival

00:05:54.299 --> 00:05:55.380
i really do

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.619
because the people that you work with the people that see you on a daily basis

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:04.500
they need to see that mystery that paul spoke of in colossians one

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.679
do they see christ in you

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:08.480
the hope of glory

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.320
do they see something different about us when we're in that workplace we're

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.119
dealing with those uh... various aspects of of being in the corporate world do

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:18.440
they see

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.679
in us something different do they see christ in you

00:06:22.679 --> 00:06:23.920
the hope of glory

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.640
or is that reserved to just the church service times and then

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.920
uh... we just kind of put that off and then we go into the corporate world and

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.079
now i'm working in corporate america

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.260
it ought not be and we find here

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.660
uh... great truth that is given to us notice if you will

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.820
uh... as we begin the passage of scripture in verse number twenty two

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.179
the bible says this servants obey

00:06:45.179 --> 00:06:49.299
in all things your masters according to the flesh not with eye service as men

00:06:49.299 --> 00:06:50.260
pleasers

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.220
but in singleness of heart fearing god

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:58.019
and whatsoever you do do it heartily as to the lord and not unto men

00:06:58.019 --> 00:07:01.299
knowing that of the lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.600
for you serve the lord christ

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.380
but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.119
and there is no respect of persons

00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:14.160
masters given to your servants that which is just and equal

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.480
knowing that you also have a master

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.600
in heaven

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.000
as we begin to look at this portion of scripture i'd say number one examine the

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.480
principle god gives us a principle here

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.720
in verse number twenty two that is worth our examination

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.959
again as we look at this passage of scripture and deal with the servants and

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.619
the masters i'll be looking

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:36.119
uh... this morning at making the application of the servant to that of

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:37.339
the employee

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:40.660
as we think about the principle that is given here we find first of all there's

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.700
a principle of obedience

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.880
a principle of submission

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.660
we find that he says obey in all things

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.920
your masters according to the flesh

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.660
the reality is that you and i do not have to work for the company that we

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.559
work for

00:07:54.559 --> 00:07:58.299
but if we make a decision to work for the company in whom we work for

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.839
and they have standards they have rules then we must follow those rules

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:07.079
we must obey we must submit it is a responsibility that we have

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:08.799
as a child of god

00:08:08.799 --> 00:08:12.320
and i understand this morning that we live in a time in which those things are

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.480
hotly debated i understand all that's taking place

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.600
uh... with regard to the overreach and so on and so forth but the reality

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.799
is that we understand that god has given us a principle

00:08:23.799 --> 00:08:28.339
and i believe that as we examine the principle and we begin to understand

00:08:28.339 --> 00:08:33.260
how this principle is played out and how it's effective in our lives

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.059
and being able to reach others with the gospel

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:41.820
we find that here as he says not only this truth of obedience but i believe

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.219
that we also see a very important principle that is given to us in verse

00:08:45.219 --> 00:08:46.380
number twenty two

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.580
and that is a principle of integrity

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.900
you know we live in a day and age in which integrity is missing

00:08:52.919 --> 00:08:55.760
there are people that do not operate with integrity

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.359
we find here that it says at the end of the verse

00:08:58.359 --> 00:09:02.000
not with eye service as men pleasers

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.760
now think about that statement

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.640
there are plenty of folks that no doubt you've heard the

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.119
the phraseology the cliche that has been around for

00:09:10.119 --> 00:09:12.840
uh... no doubt decades that while the

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.359
cats away the mice will play you've heard that

00:09:16.359 --> 00:09:19.479
it's something that we've become familiar with their times in which as i

00:09:19.479 --> 00:09:21.159
worked in the corporate world

00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:24.280
uh... there would be folks that would be doing all sorts of things that were

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.080
not in line with what the job duties were

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.039
with what the responsibilities were

00:09:29.039 --> 00:09:33.159
but as soon as the boss came into the room as soon as the boss came into the

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:35.200
area in which those employees were

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.299
all of a sudden they straighten up and they're gonna start doing what they're

00:09:38.299 --> 00:09:41.000
supposed to be doing

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.280
often i heard it i i can tell you how many times i heard

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.340
uh... when i work in the corporate world you gotta look busy

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.619
what do you mean look busy?

00:09:51.619 --> 00:09:54.140
you're either doing your job or you're not

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.299
amen

00:09:55.299 --> 00:09:58.739
if you're getting paid to do a job you ought to have integrity and you ought to work

00:09:58.739 --> 00:09:59.539
you ought to be the

00:09:59.539 --> 00:10:01.699
The reality is that the Christian in the workplace,

00:10:01.699 --> 00:10:05.739
they ought to be the best employee that that workplace has.

00:10:05.739 --> 00:10:09.659
Honestly, ought to be the absolute best employee.

00:10:09.659 --> 00:10:10.499
Why?

00:10:10.499 --> 00:10:13.059
Because the principle is that we're not doing this

00:10:13.059 --> 00:10:15.859
with eye service as men pleasers.

00:10:15.859 --> 00:10:19.539
Because I live in a completely different realm.

00:10:19.539 --> 00:10:22.499
I live in the heavenlies, if you will.

00:10:22.499 --> 00:10:24.579
I'm seated already positionally.

00:10:24.579 --> 00:10:28.019
Remember, the chapter begins with our position in Christ.

00:10:28.019 --> 00:10:30.379
And that position impacts my pursuits.

00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:32.699
I'm not trying to please my boss,

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:35.139
I'm trying to please my Savior.

00:10:35.139 --> 00:10:35.979
Amen?

00:10:35.979 --> 00:10:37.819
And as I please my Savior,

00:10:37.819 --> 00:10:41.139
and as I do what I'm supposed to do in the sight of God,

00:10:41.139 --> 00:10:43.219
then the outflow of that,

00:10:43.219 --> 00:10:46.299
one of the results of that is that my employer

00:10:46.299 --> 00:10:48.139
also is going to be pleased.

00:10:49.339 --> 00:10:51.619
We find here that the Bible says,

00:10:51.619 --> 00:10:54.299
not with eye service as men pleasers,

00:10:54.299 --> 00:10:55.779
but notice what it says,

00:10:55.779 --> 00:11:00.459
but in singleness of heart, fearing God.

00:11:01.579 --> 00:11:06.579
How often we lose the principle

00:11:06.819 --> 00:11:08.659
that is given to us here,

00:11:08.659 --> 00:11:11.019
and we get into the workplace,

00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:15.779
and we just begin to perhaps be impacted and affected

00:11:15.779 --> 00:11:18.219
by those in which we work with,

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:20.499
and by their lack of integrity,

00:11:20.499 --> 00:11:22.619
their lack of purpose,

00:11:22.619 --> 00:11:24.539
and their lack of hard work,

00:11:24.539 --> 00:11:27.779
and it will rub off on the child of God.

00:11:27.779 --> 00:11:29.499
Oh, you're just an overachiever,

00:11:29.499 --> 00:11:31.859
always trying to please, blah, blah, blah.

00:11:31.859 --> 00:11:33.619
People say that kind of stuff.

00:11:34.619 --> 00:11:35.459
Why?

00:11:35.459 --> 00:11:36.779
Because they don't get it.

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:39.979
They don't understand that we have a Bible

00:11:39.979 --> 00:11:44.619
that teaches us not only how we behave in the house of God,

00:11:44.619 --> 00:11:47.819
not only how we behave in our homes as families,

00:11:47.819 --> 00:11:50.619
but also how we behave in the workplace.

00:11:50.619 --> 00:11:52.179
And as I understand the principle

00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:54.179
that is given to us in verse number 22,

00:11:54.179 --> 00:11:56.219
I find that it's a principle of obedience,

00:11:56.219 --> 00:11:57.859
a principle of integrity.

00:11:57.859 --> 00:12:01.139
We're not seeking to simply please men.

00:12:01.139 --> 00:12:03.059
We're seeking to please our God.

00:12:03.059 --> 00:12:07.379
In singleness of heart, fearing God.

00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:09.099
Man, that's precious.

00:12:09.099 --> 00:12:10.339
And it really leads us,

00:12:10.339 --> 00:12:11.699
not only as we look at the principle,

00:12:11.699 --> 00:12:12.539
but if you're taking notes,

00:12:12.539 --> 00:12:13.859
I want you to notice number two,

00:12:13.859 --> 00:12:16.419
that we're to embrace the perspective.

00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:20.059
I understand that as we work in the work world,

00:12:20.059 --> 00:12:22.059
as we work in the corporate environment,

00:12:22.179 --> 00:12:26.219
there are times in which we will be adversely affected

00:12:26.219 --> 00:12:29.179
and perhaps ridiculed because of our integrity,

00:12:29.179 --> 00:12:30.899
because of our work ethic.

00:12:30.899 --> 00:12:33.899
And there will be folks that will seek to attack us,

00:12:33.899 --> 00:12:36.819
but we must embrace the perspective that is given

00:12:36.819 --> 00:12:39.019
in the next two verses of Scripture.

00:12:39.019 --> 00:12:41.299
When I have a proper, I will say this,

00:12:41.299 --> 00:12:46.299
a biblical perspective, it makes a world of difference.

00:12:46.819 --> 00:12:50.179
If I ask myself the question, why am I here?

00:12:51.179 --> 00:12:53.979
Or maybe I ask myself this question,

00:12:53.979 --> 00:12:56.219
and we'll deal with this at the end of the message as well,

00:12:56.219 --> 00:12:58.739
who am I here for?

00:12:58.739 --> 00:13:01.459
Why does God have you where he has you?

00:13:01.459 --> 00:13:04.279
Why did God give you the job that he gave you?

00:13:06.179 --> 00:13:08.059
Those are questions that we begin to ask ourselves,

00:13:08.059 --> 00:13:10.939
and we understand the perspective that is given here,

00:13:10.939 --> 00:13:13.819
and as we have that biblical perspective,

00:13:13.819 --> 00:13:15.779
it makes a world of difference.

00:13:15.779 --> 00:13:18.539
Notice what it says in verse 23.

00:13:18.539 --> 00:13:20.339
And whatsoever ye do.

00:13:20.339 --> 00:13:23.979
Now, that's pretty all-inclusive, is it not?

00:13:23.979 --> 00:13:24.819
Amen?

00:13:24.819 --> 00:13:27.299
I mean, and whatsoever you do.

00:13:27.299 --> 00:13:28.619
Find some wiggle room.

00:13:28.619 --> 00:13:30.339
I mean, well, that doesn't apply here.

00:13:30.339 --> 00:13:31.219
Well, that doesn't apply.

00:13:31.219 --> 00:13:33.299
No, whatsoever you do.

00:13:33.299 --> 00:13:34.539
Whatsoever you do.

00:13:35.939 --> 00:13:37.499
Whatsoever you do.

00:13:37.499 --> 00:13:38.339
Do it how?

00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:40.679
Notice what he says, heartily.

00:13:42.179 --> 00:13:43.019
Heartily.

00:13:43.019 --> 00:13:44.619
You ever hear somebody say, well, that's good enough

00:13:44.619 --> 00:13:46.739
for government work?

00:13:48.179 --> 00:13:49.019
Right?

00:13:50.059 --> 00:13:51.359
Oh, that's good enough.

00:13:52.659 --> 00:13:53.499
You ever have that?

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:56.219
Man, somebody just mails it in, so to speak,

00:13:56.219 --> 00:13:59.439
just kind of takes it easy.

00:14:00.899 --> 00:14:02.399
Well, what's our perspective

00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:04.939
when we think about the work environment?

00:14:04.939 --> 00:14:06.899
What is it that God is telling us?

00:14:06.899 --> 00:14:09.779
As I look here, it says, whatsoever you do,

00:14:09.779 --> 00:14:14.579
do it heartily, with not half-heartedness,

00:14:15.419 --> 00:14:17.259
not just it's good enough for government work,

00:14:17.259 --> 00:14:21.979
or not just I'm a better employee than my coworker,

00:14:23.019 --> 00:14:25.099
because it's not about comparing ourselves

00:14:25.099 --> 00:14:26.579
amongst ourselves.

00:14:26.579 --> 00:14:28.179
I believe that we can even use,

00:14:28.179 --> 00:14:32.399
adopt what Paul says to the Corinthians in that violation.

00:14:32.399 --> 00:14:34.379
We can adopt that even into the application

00:14:34.379 --> 00:14:35.979
of in the workplace.

00:14:35.979 --> 00:14:39.299
I'm not seeking to just compare myself to my coworker,

00:14:39.299 --> 00:14:40.659
and by the way, if I wanna do that,

00:14:40.659 --> 00:14:42.859
I'm probably gonna find the worst coworker that I have

00:14:42.859 --> 00:14:44.459
to compare myself with then.

00:14:46.979 --> 00:14:48.939
But the Bible says that we're to do it heartily.

00:14:48.939 --> 00:14:50.299
Notice what it says.

00:14:50.299 --> 00:14:55.299
As to the Lord, and not to men.

00:14:58.459 --> 00:14:59.459
As to the Lord.

00:15:00.759 --> 00:15:03.259
What a great perspective.

00:15:03.259 --> 00:15:08.259
When you go to work, when you engage at that workplace,

00:15:08.659 --> 00:15:11.819
when you understand that God has placed me here

00:15:11.859 --> 00:15:14.139
for his purpose, for his glory,

00:15:14.139 --> 00:15:19.019
and I'm doing this job that I'm doing for him.

00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:22.659
As to the Lord.

00:15:22.659 --> 00:15:25.299
You know, that's gonna change your perspective,

00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:27.779
because all of a sudden, you're not gonna view your boss

00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:30.339
the same way that you currently view your boss,

00:15:30.339 --> 00:15:32.299
because it's not about your boss.

00:15:32.299 --> 00:15:34.039
Oh, there's still things that you have to deal with,

00:15:34.039 --> 00:15:36.279
there's still things that you're gonna have to manage,

00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:38.579
and so on and so forth, but all of a sudden,

00:15:38.579 --> 00:15:40.819
you say, well, I'm not really working for that person,

00:15:40.819 --> 00:15:43.539
I'm working for God, as to the Lord.

00:15:43.539 --> 00:15:46.779
I'm doing this for my Savior, I'm doing this for my Master.

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:51.779
I'm seeking to have a good testimony for God in this place.

00:15:52.799 --> 00:15:57.799
And I do it as to the Lord, not unto men.

00:15:58.299 --> 00:16:00.499
It is absolutely possible that we could get,

00:16:00.499 --> 00:16:03.279
we could receive the accolades of man,

00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:04.979
and yet displease God.

00:16:06.259 --> 00:16:07.099
It's possible.

00:16:08.099 --> 00:16:11.779
We begin to think about this particular perspective

00:16:11.779 --> 00:16:14.539
that is given to us, and I believe this morning,

00:16:14.539 --> 00:16:16.759
that it's important when we think about a perspective,

00:16:16.759 --> 00:16:18.499
that we would embrace it.

00:16:18.499 --> 00:16:21.939
That we would say, this is how I want to have my focus

00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:24.099
when I get up and I go into the workplace,

00:16:24.099 --> 00:16:28.059
when I, this week, tomorrow, as I go into the workplace,

00:16:28.059 --> 00:16:29.899
I wanna have this perspective,

00:16:29.899 --> 00:16:32.219
I wanna embrace this perspective.

00:16:32.219 --> 00:16:34.459
I guarantee you, the enemy's gonna fight you.

00:16:34.459 --> 00:16:36.459
I guarantee you, something's gonna happen,

00:16:36.459 --> 00:16:40.879
and it's gonna cause you that moment of frustration,

00:16:40.879 --> 00:16:42.579
and then you just kinda can take a step back

00:16:42.579 --> 00:16:46.499
and say, listen, I'm doing this not as a men pleaser,

00:16:46.499 --> 00:16:49.599
I'm doing this heartily as to the Lord.

00:16:49.599 --> 00:16:53.339
Notice in verse 24, knowing that of the Lord,

00:16:53.339 --> 00:16:55.939
ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance,

00:16:55.939 --> 00:16:57.859
and then notice this last phrase,

00:16:57.859 --> 00:17:00.939
for ye serve the Lord Christ.

00:17:00.939 --> 00:17:02.619
You serve the Lord Christ.

00:17:02.619 --> 00:17:04.179
I want you to think about this.

00:17:04.179 --> 00:17:08.379
We, as Bible believers, as those that have trusted Christ

00:17:08.379 --> 00:17:12.019
as our Savior, we're saved, we're heaven-bound.

00:17:12.019 --> 00:17:15.139
The reality is that I'm going to heaven.

00:17:15.139 --> 00:17:18.459
I'm not looking to just receive a plaque

00:17:18.459 --> 00:17:20.579
with my name on it in the front office.

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:22.599
I'm not looking for that corner office

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:24.299
for some level of accolades.

00:17:24.299 --> 00:17:28.219
It's fine to be accomplished, and it's fine to pursue

00:17:28.219 --> 00:17:30.019
and to have that recognition,

00:17:30.019 --> 00:17:33.339
but ultimately, my perspective is the fact

00:17:33.339 --> 00:17:36.579
that I'm serving Christ and I'm going to heaven one day.

00:17:36.579 --> 00:17:38.819
And I can get so busy with trying

00:17:38.819 --> 00:17:40.939
to pursue the corner office,

00:17:40.939 --> 00:17:43.899
I can get so busy with trying to get my name on a plaque

00:17:43.899 --> 00:17:46.359
and with all of the recognition and accolades

00:17:46.359 --> 00:17:48.139
that could come in the workplace,

00:17:48.139 --> 00:17:50.579
I can get so busy with those things

00:17:50.579 --> 00:17:55.299
that I have in my mind compartmentalized spiritual

00:17:55.299 --> 00:17:57.699
from carnal, if you will.

00:17:57.699 --> 00:17:59.179
Carnal's a bad word to use,

00:17:59.179 --> 00:18:02.159
but just the everyday monotony of life,

00:18:02.159 --> 00:18:04.359
and saying, well, this is the workplace,

00:18:04.359 --> 00:18:06.419
and therefore, I really don't have

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:07.599
any responsibilities here.

00:18:07.599 --> 00:18:10.259
No, God has placed you there.

00:18:10.259 --> 00:18:13.319
You are the light in your workplace.

00:18:14.679 --> 00:18:17.719
We begin to understand how this perspective

00:18:17.719 --> 00:18:20.379
will demand our best.

00:18:20.379 --> 00:18:22.519
It will demand that we understand

00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:24.919
that we're living for Christ

00:18:24.919 --> 00:18:26.919
and we're serving the Lord Christ.

00:18:26.919 --> 00:18:30.799
This is really, this truth is given to us in every area.

00:18:30.799 --> 00:18:32.419
We look at the application here

00:18:32.419 --> 00:18:33.839
with regard to the workplace

00:18:33.839 --> 00:18:36.000
and we think about our behavior in the workplace,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.559
but as I am working at the church house,

00:18:39.559 --> 00:18:42.979
I'm cutting grass, I'm cleaning the church house.

00:18:42.979 --> 00:18:44.899
Man, I'm doing that for the Lord.

00:18:46.079 --> 00:18:48.000
I'm doing it for Christ.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.159
And as I finish up the job, the task that's at hand,

00:18:52.159 --> 00:18:55.199
I look back and I say, would my Savior be pleased with that?

00:18:56.479 --> 00:18:58.440
Did I do my best?

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.079
Did I put in, did I do it as a men-pleaser

00:19:02.079 --> 00:19:05.199
or did I do it with singleness of heart,

00:19:05.199 --> 00:19:07.799
fearing God, serving God?

00:19:07.799 --> 00:19:11.759
It'll change how we operate, it really will,

00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:14.599
when I recognize that I'm doing it for the Lord.

00:19:14.599 --> 00:19:17.199
Number of years ago, I would not mention

00:19:17.199 --> 00:19:19.880
the individual's name for sake of embarrassment,

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.959
for some may know who they are,

00:19:21.959 --> 00:19:23.759
but a number of years ago, I remember sitting

00:19:23.759 --> 00:19:25.679
and watching an individual

00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:30.320
and as they were doing some work here at the church

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.119
and they could not get a piece of machinery to work

00:19:33.119 --> 00:19:34.820
that they were trying to get to work

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.880
and they were trying to blow off the parking lot

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.959
with all of the debris after cutting grass

00:19:39.959 --> 00:19:42.119
and they could not get the unit to work

00:19:42.119 --> 00:19:44.000
and literally, I saw on the cameras,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.059
the individual with a broom to sweep the parking lot.

00:19:49.759 --> 00:19:54.679
Wow, I thought, man, would I do that?

00:19:54.679 --> 00:19:55.599
Or would I just be like, man,

00:19:55.599 --> 00:19:57.839
I couldn't get the thing to start, I'm sorry.

00:19:58.959 --> 00:20:00.559
But they were like, you know what?

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:04.959
I think, I never actually spoke to the individual about it,

00:20:04.959 --> 00:20:08.079
but I think the perspective was, I'm doing this for God.

00:20:09.279 --> 00:20:10.419
I'm doing this for God.

00:20:11.719 --> 00:20:13.919
I went out and helped get the machine started

00:20:13.919 --> 00:20:16.799
so they could use the blower and not have to push.

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:18.919
Could you imagine sweeping this parking lot?

00:20:18.919 --> 00:20:20.919
I've shoveled this parking lot more times

00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:22.159
than I could count,

00:20:22.159 --> 00:20:24.459
but I can't imagine sweeping the parking lot.

00:20:26.039 --> 00:20:28.039
But that perspective is a perspective,

00:20:28.039 --> 00:20:31.479
listen, they didn't know anyone was even watching or knew.

00:20:32.559 --> 00:20:34.199
They're doing it for God.

00:20:34.199 --> 00:20:35.599
I like that perspective.

00:20:36.679 --> 00:20:40.479
Romans 12 and verse number 11, the Bible says this,

00:20:40.479 --> 00:20:41.799
in this portion of Scripture,

00:20:41.799 --> 00:20:44.359
when we think about the responsibility,

00:20:44.359 --> 00:20:46.639
it says in the workplace,

00:20:46.639 --> 00:20:49.799
not slothful in business,

00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:54.279
fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.

00:20:55.279 --> 00:20:57.959
Not slothful in business.

00:20:58.759 --> 00:21:00.239
Again, when we understand the principle

00:21:00.239 --> 00:21:02.319
that is given to us in verse 22,

00:21:02.319 --> 00:21:05.519
with regard to obedience, submission, integrity,

00:21:05.519 --> 00:21:07.439
and then we see this perspective,

00:21:07.439 --> 00:21:10.939
this biblical perspective that I'm working not for man,

00:21:10.939 --> 00:21:12.759
I'm working as to the Lord.

00:21:12.759 --> 00:21:15.199
I understand that I serve the Lord Christ,

00:21:15.199 --> 00:21:19.439
then we find that I cannot be slothful in business.

00:21:19.439 --> 00:21:21.659
It's going to demand my best.

00:21:21.659 --> 00:21:24.759
It's going to require that I give it my all.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.879
Not because I'm looking for accolades from man,

00:21:28.879 --> 00:21:31.680
but because I'm serving my Savior.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.159
We find that as we continue looking

00:21:33.159 --> 00:21:34.319
at the portion of Scripture,

00:21:34.319 --> 00:21:37.000
that not only do we see the need

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.399
to examine the principle, embrace the perspective,

00:21:39.399 --> 00:21:42.119
but I find that we're to eliminate partiality.

00:21:42.119 --> 00:21:44.839
In verse 25 and then in verse number one

00:21:44.839 --> 00:21:45.979
of chapter number four,

00:21:45.979 --> 00:21:48.119
we find that we're to eliminate partiality.

00:21:48.119 --> 00:21:50.239
You'll remember that the subject of partiality

00:21:50.239 --> 00:21:52.159
was addressed in verse number 11.

00:21:52.159 --> 00:21:53.759
It was back there where Paul said

00:21:53.759 --> 00:21:55.319
where there is neither Greek nor Jew,

00:21:55.319 --> 00:21:57.519
circumcision nor uncircumcision.

00:21:57.519 --> 00:21:59.639
Barbarians get thee in bond nor free,

00:21:59.639 --> 00:22:02.500
but Christ is all and in all.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.959
We come to verse 25 of this third chapter

00:22:04.959 --> 00:22:05.799
and the Bible says,

00:22:05.799 --> 00:22:07.959
but he that doeth wrong shall receive

00:22:07.959 --> 00:22:09.419
for the wrong which he hath done.

00:22:09.419 --> 00:22:10.819
Notice this phrase,

00:22:10.819 --> 00:22:14.360
there is no respect of persons.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.520
Verse one, master is given to your servants

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.440
that which is just and equal,

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:23.020
knowing that ye also have a master in heaven.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:25.739
No doubt, there have been times in our lives

00:22:25.739 --> 00:22:29.739
where we have observed partiality in the workplace.

00:22:29.739 --> 00:22:32.039
No doubt, there's times in which someone

00:22:32.039 --> 00:22:35.259
gets preferential treatment because of their last name,

00:22:35.259 --> 00:22:37.139
because of their relationship with the boss,

00:22:37.139 --> 00:22:40.459
because they go golfing with the CEO,

00:22:40.459 --> 00:22:42.020
whatever the circumstance is,

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.580
we have witnessed, we have observed

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.259
partiality in the workplace.

00:22:46.259 --> 00:22:48.880
But the biblical truth is that our God

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.880
is no respecter of persons

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.500
and therefore we, as his people,

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:57.199
should be no respecter of persons, amen?

00:22:57.199 --> 00:23:00.380
There's some that sit within the congregation,

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.440
there are some that are listening via livestream today,

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.479
that you find your place in a place of supervision

00:23:06.479 --> 00:23:09.479
in the workplace, that you find that your position

00:23:09.479 --> 00:23:11.639
is one in which you have individuals

00:23:11.639 --> 00:23:14.800
that would be responsible, accountable to you

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.959
as a supervisor, manager,

00:23:16.959 --> 00:23:20.360
some level of executive leadership or management,

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.959
whatever it may be, and the reality is that

00:23:22.959 --> 00:23:25.759
it is absolutely essential that there is

00:23:25.759 --> 00:23:28.639
no respect of persons,

00:23:28.639 --> 00:23:32.080
that we understand that our God is no respecter of persons

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.440
and therefore we are to be no respecter of persons.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.599
We see it in our society,

00:23:37.599 --> 00:23:40.419
but it doesn't make it right, amen?

00:23:40.419 --> 00:23:42.080
In fact, there are many times in which

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.720
we'll observe partiality and it will bother us.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:50.720
We find that God has given the truth here

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.360
in this portion of Scripture that there should be

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.440
no partiality, we're to eliminate the partiality.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.919
There should be fairness in punishment as well

00:23:59.919 --> 00:24:00.839
as in reward.

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:02.360
Notice what it says in verse 25,

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.720
but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.839
which he hath done.

00:24:07.099 --> 00:24:09.800
Verse number one, master is given to your servants

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.080
that which is just and equal.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.360
And so we understand this truth of fairness

00:24:16.039 --> 00:24:18.440
not only in punishment, but also in reward.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.440
Notice over in the book of Galatians, if you will,

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.799
hold your spot here in Colossians.

00:24:21.799 --> 00:24:23.279
We'll be back in just a moment,

00:24:23.279 --> 00:24:25.639
but look in Galatians chapter number six.

00:24:25.639 --> 00:24:28.040
And I want you to see what we find here

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.559
in this portion of Scripture with regard to the truth

00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:32.679
that God gives us.

00:24:32.679 --> 00:24:35.480
He is, again, no respecter of persons

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.279
and I am thankful that he's given us that truth

00:24:38.279 --> 00:24:41.279
in his word and we too are to be no respecter of persons.

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:43.519
It says in Galatians six and verse number seven,

00:24:43.519 --> 00:24:44.919
be not deceived.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.720
God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man soweth,

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.799
that shall he also reap.

00:24:49.799 --> 00:24:53.600
There are consequences for our actions.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.239
It's just the way it works, amen.

00:24:57.239 --> 00:25:01.720
And we understand in our lives the importance

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:05.160
of this truth of us understanding it before God,

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.399
but us also carrying judgment out in like fashion.

00:25:08.399 --> 00:25:10.679
Notice in verse number eight, there is oftentimes

00:25:10.679 --> 00:25:12.519
as we think about verse number seven,

00:25:12.519 --> 00:25:16.279
we think about it strictly in the negative context.

00:25:16.279 --> 00:25:18.880
But if you look at verse number eight of Galatians six

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.919
with verse number seven, you find that the principle,

00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:24.639
may I say law, that is established here

00:25:24.639 --> 00:25:28.639
is a principle or law that is both positive and negative.

00:25:29.519 --> 00:25:32.200
It's easy to focus on the negative,

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.799
but the reality is that verse number eight reveals to us

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:36.839
that it's both positive and negative.

00:25:36.839 --> 00:25:39.839
It says, for he that soweth to his flesh

00:25:39.839 --> 00:25:42.720
shall of the flesh reap corruption.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.839
That's negative, all right?

00:25:44.839 --> 00:25:45.799
That's not a good deal.

00:25:45.799 --> 00:25:47.799
You don't want that fruit.

00:25:47.799 --> 00:25:51.559
That's the individual, as a preacher of yesteryear said,

00:25:51.559 --> 00:25:56.079
that there are people that claim to be followers of Christ

00:25:56.079 --> 00:26:00.079
that sow seeds of wickedness Monday through Saturday,

00:26:00.079 --> 00:26:02.200
and then come to the church house on Sunday

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.500
and pray for crop failure.

00:26:07.279 --> 00:26:09.320
That's a great quote.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.160
It's foolish.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.359
That's a great quote.

00:26:13.279 --> 00:26:15.519
They sow seeds of wickedness,

00:26:15.519 --> 00:26:17.320
and then they pray for crop failure.

00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:21.880
No, God says, for he that soweth to his flesh

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.119
shall of the flesh reap corruption.

00:26:25.079 --> 00:26:28.880
But he that soweth to the Spirit

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.720
shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.839
That's positive.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.519
And so the law, the principle that God has established

00:26:37.559 --> 00:26:38.720
of sowing and reaping,

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.959
we understand biblically

00:26:39.959 --> 00:26:42.200
that there's a negative aspect of that,

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.119
but there's a positive aspect of that.

00:26:44.119 --> 00:26:47.720
And the reality is that we need to be sowing good seeds

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.359
so that we're reaping a good harvest, amen?

00:26:51.359 --> 00:26:52.519
So that we don't have to worry

00:26:52.519 --> 00:26:54.839
about praying for crop failure.

00:26:54.839 --> 00:26:57.279
We can say, man, I want the crop to come in,

00:26:57.279 --> 00:26:58.760
and I want it to come in good.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.200
I mean, I want it to be plentiful.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.040
Why?

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.359
Because I've sown some good seeds,

00:27:05.359 --> 00:27:09.519
and I'm looking for that good harvest, amen?

00:27:09.519 --> 00:27:12.760
And we find that here we're to be no respecter of persons.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.720
We must eliminate partiality.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.440
As we think about this truth in Colossians chapter three,

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.880
to end the chapter and to begin the fourth chapter,

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.160
we think about our behavior in the workplace.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.760
And yes, there's principle, there's perspective.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.760
We're to eliminate this partiality.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.679
But I would submit to you this morning

00:27:29.679 --> 00:27:34.160
that I believe that our behavior in the workplace,

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.559
as I mentioned by way of introduction,

00:27:36.559 --> 00:27:41.559
can be, may I say should be, a catalyst for revival.

00:27:43.399 --> 00:27:46.679
I wonder this morning if we could just for a few moments

00:27:46.679 --> 00:27:48.399
as we conclude the service

00:27:48.399 --> 00:27:51.959
and think about this aspect of our behavior in the workplace

00:27:51.959 --> 00:27:55.160
and we think about the truth that God has given us

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:58.880
and we say, how does this truth apply in my life?

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.160
I wonder this morning if when we would consider ourselves

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.519
those that are employees this morning,

00:28:04.519 --> 00:28:08.320
those that have a place of employment,

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.880
whether you're at the bottom of the corporate ladder

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.760
or you're at the top of the corporate ladder, matters not,

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.639
but you have a place of employment,

00:28:16.639 --> 00:28:18.639
there's some place that you'll go,

00:28:18.639 --> 00:28:20.359
perhaps even tomorrow,

00:28:20.359 --> 00:28:22.160
and you'll go to that place of employment.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.519
I wonder this morning

00:28:23.519 --> 00:28:27.540
if we would begin to consider ourselves missionaries.

00:28:29.339 --> 00:28:31.320
Not a missionary to a country,

00:28:32.239 --> 00:28:33.760
but a missionary to a company.

00:28:35.719 --> 00:28:38.679
Understanding that God has placed us there.

00:28:38.679 --> 00:28:41.320
I read a book, I actually finished it yesterday,

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.080
it's called The Business Revival.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.080
It's written by an individual

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.279
that probably doesn't believe everything biblically

00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:49.559
as I believe or as you would believe,

00:28:49.559 --> 00:28:51.679
but it's written by an individual that believes,

00:28:51.679 --> 00:28:53.520
he's trusted Christ as a savior

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.320
by his testimony in the book,

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:57.479
and he believes that God hears and answers prayer

00:28:57.479 --> 00:29:00.719
and he believed that God had him in his place of employment

00:29:00.719 --> 00:29:03.520
for a greater reason than just making a living.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.080
And man, it's a great book.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.880
I'd encourage you to get it and read it.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.880
Again, I would not endorse

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.479
all of what he would believe biblically or theologically,

00:29:14.479 --> 00:29:17.400
but what God has done through this man

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:21.140
and this perspective of how God is able to work is amazing.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.320
And really the thought this morning

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.119
that I'm not just a missionary to,

00:29:28.119 --> 00:29:30.159
or I'm not looking at just a missions map

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.320
saying these are the missionaries that we support

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.679
that are going to foreign countries,

00:29:33.679 --> 00:29:35.960
but I wonder this morning, what if we could,

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.599
what if we took the time to put together

00:29:38.599 --> 00:29:42.719
some sort of internal document of the companies

00:29:42.719 --> 00:29:44.960
that our members are missionaries to?

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.239
And we began to pray one for another

00:29:48.239 --> 00:29:50.440
the way that we pray for our missionaries.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.200
Begin to think about, I'll use myself as an example,

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.359
when I worked in the corporate world

00:29:54.359 --> 00:29:56.919
that I worked for Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation,

00:29:56.919 --> 00:29:59.239
what if I had a group of people in the church

00:29:59.239 --> 00:30:01.080
that I attended during that period?

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.620
the period of time of my life

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:08.060
that they prayed for the missionary at Sikorsky.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:12.140
The way that they prayed for the missionary in Scotland.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.780
You see how it changed our perspective?

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:17.280
We begin to see that God has you in that place

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:20.200
for a reason, for a time, for a purpose.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.720
And it's so much greater

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.040
than just making a living.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.080
So often we get caught up in the corporate world

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.600
and all the culture and the society.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.400
We understand that God can take care of us

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.880
any way He chooses to take care of us.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.560
Amen?

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.520
He used a raven to feed His prophet.

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.000
God can take care of us.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.160
In this particular era, in this particular time,

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:48.200
we find that often He uses a place of employment

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.360
in order to take care of us,

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.760
but we must understand

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.800
that it's not about just making a living.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.280
The author of this book, he says it this way.

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:58.760
He said, I think it's great.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:02.400
Do you have a desire to make a difference

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.080
or just to make a mortgage payment?

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.360
That was a quote from his book.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.080
That's what he says.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.520
And it's making that difference.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.480
And see, oftentimes what happens,

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.920
and again, as we begin to think about

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.120
this portion of Scripture

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.720
and begin to think about our perspective

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.880
and all that takes place,

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.040
I wonder this morning how many people

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.440
in our place of employment,

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.720
how many people that we've come into contact with,

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.760
and perhaps we've worked at this place

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.280
for a short period of time,

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.440
perhaps we've worked there for a long period of time,

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:33.240
how many people in that particular place of employment

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:36.400
know that you're a follower of Jesus Christ?

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.080
I'm not suggesting this morning

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.080
that we steal the time of our employers

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.320
and we're there seeking to simply propagate the gospel

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.080
and being a bad employee.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.200
No, I'm suggesting that we're good employees,

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.680
the best employees,

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.920
but I'm suggesting that, hey,

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.920
is there somebody that you're praying for in your workplace?

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.160
Is there somebody that you know

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.320
that's dealing with a problem,

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.400
that's dealing with,

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.160
how many of you,

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.640
I'm not gonna ask you any names,

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.880
but I am gonna ask you to raise your hand,

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.080
how many of you know somebody

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.960
that you work with that's lost?

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:11.680
Everybody that has a job,

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.600
now, I can't raise my hand

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:13.920
because I work with Holly,

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.040
and she's saved, amen.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.960
But the reality is, listen,

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.000
if you work somewhere,

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:24.200
you probably know a lost person, right?

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.720
Have you ever prayed for them?

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:32.040
Do you have a list of coworkers?

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:35.280
Maybe start with the one that bothers you the most.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.120
Seriously.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.120
Because guess what?

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.520
God hears and answers prayer.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.640
You don't have to neglect one minute on the clock

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.160
of working for your employer

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.640
to do what you're supposed to do

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.040
to pray for a coworker.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.800
Pray that God would open up a door,

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.040
give you an opportunity.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.400
And when you embrace the perspective

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.960
that we dealt with earlier in the message,

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.960
as we are doing what we're doing

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.160
not for the boss,

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.440
but for the Lord,

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.280
when somebody says,

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.040
man, this boss, I can't stand,

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.480
he's just a tyrant,

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.360
he's this, he's that,

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.880
blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:16.960
I could share stories with you

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:17.800
from the corporate world.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.160
I worked in the corporate world for years.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.760
I understand what that difficulty is like.

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.760
I may not understand your specific person,

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.600
but we can just exchange names.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.760
Because you're always going to find someone

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.760
that's that way.

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.120
But I wonder this morning,

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.280
do they see Christ in us,

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.040
the hope of glory?

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.480
Do the coworkers understand that,

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.000
listen, how can you deal with this guy,

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
blah, blah, blah?

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.960
I'm looking beyond that person

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.520
because I'm working as unto the Lord,

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.000
not unto men.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.000
I believe this morning,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:56.840
it's interesting,

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:59.600
I planned to preach this message several weeks ago.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.520
In fact, it was the week after

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:05.640
Brother Savalle was here

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.320
that I was planning to preach this message,

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.840
and through a series of circumstances,

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.680
the Lord led me to preach a message

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:13.400
on the return of Christ.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:15.800
And then last week,

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.400
we had a baby dedication.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.840
But I believe that it's very interesting

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.800
how that we look at this passage of Scripture

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.880
this morning,

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.760
and I believe that there's a direct correlation,

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.320
connection, if you will,

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.320
to the message that I'll be preaching this evening

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.720
from Genesis 21.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.360
And I will not deal with much of that

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.000
because I'll be preaching it this evening,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.520
but Abimelech says this of Abraham in Genesis 21

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.320
in verse number 22,

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.320
God is with thee

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.840
in all that thou doest.

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:52.120
God is with thee

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.120
in all that thou doest.

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.000
And I just wonder this morning,

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.440
we think about the workplace,

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.160
the behavior in our workplace,

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.520
I wonder this morning,

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.960
is there anyone

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:10.080
that we work with that would say of us

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.720
what Abimelech said of Abraham?

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.880
God is with thee

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.480
in all that thou doest.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.760
Do they see God's hand of favor upon us?

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.040
Do they see that there's something different about us?

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.080
The reason that I believe

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.360
that this is a catalyst for revival,

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.680
our behavior in the workplace,

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.120
a catalyst for revival,

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.760
is because there are connections

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:32.560
that you have in your workplace

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.880
that God can allow

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.880
because of various relationships

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.480
for you to be able to share the gospel with them

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.560
and they get saved

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:40.760
and they get added to the church

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.360
and amazing things can happen.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.040
Do you know that when I go and knock on someone's door,

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.080
they don't know who I am

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.560
and they probably don't want me there?

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.640
I have no relationship with them whatsoever

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:53.560
and I'm gonna go there

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.640
and I'm gonna try to reach them with the gospel

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.480
but you have people that you work with

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.400
that there's a level,

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.320
your neighbors is another aspect,

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.320
we won't deal with that this morning,

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.400
but the people that you work with,

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.680
there's a relationship there.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.400
You pray for them and you work

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:08.160
and you ask God to open up doors of opportunity

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.800
and I understand there are times we say,

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.720
oh, there's no way that's gonna happen.

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.920
Do you believe God?

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.680
Do you believe that God is able

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.360
to do something in your workplace?

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.600
Do you believe that God is able to use you,

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.880
that he planted you there?

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.680
Again, the question was asked by this author

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.960
in the book that he wrote that I just finished yesterday,

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.760
who am I here for?

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.000
He gives the testimony that he had a career change

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.160
and in his career change,

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.400
as he started in the new place of employment,

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.040
he had some struggles and things that he was dealing with,

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.240
with just trying to learn a new industry

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.200
and so on and so forth,

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.080
but the reality is that he wanted to have this perspective,

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.760
who am I here for?

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.200
Not only to answer that question that I'm here,

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.800
God has placed me here,

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:57.680
but did God place me here in order to reach certain people

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.520
with the gospel?

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.640
The answer is yes, because we're his ambassadors, amen?

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.840
And just as we look at that missions map

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:09.760
and we focus upon and we speak about the importance

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.080
of world missions and I'm for it and I'm behind it

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.200
and I give to missions every month

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:18.200
and I love missions and we pray for our missionaries

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.200
and we're excited to hear updates from our missionaries

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.360
about what God is doing and how God is working.

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:31.040
But wouldn't it be encouraging if next Sunday

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.120
or eight Sundays from now,

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:36.480
there's someone sitting in the pew next to you?

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:42.560
Says, oh, nice to meet you, this is one of my coworkers.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.160
Let me share with you how God worked and what God did

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.240
and how God opened doors.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.680
Man, that's what it's about.

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.200
It's not about just making a living.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.240
And so often we live in this culture,

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.480
we live in this society that we can gain that perspective.

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:04.320
I understand that culture and society is beating us up

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.560
every single day, I understand that.

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:11.560
And it's very easy to get our eyes shifted

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.360
from what the biblical principle is

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.000
and get into the monotony of life,

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000
to the monotony, the mundane behavior of I just go to work,

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.320
I'm just in and out and I'm just doing.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.720
No, no, God has you there for a purpose.

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:33.720
When I understand this morning that whatsoever I do,

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:37.320
I do it heartily as to the Lord, not unto men.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:39.320
I'm seeking to please God.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:42.040
And you know, God can move us wherever he wants to move us

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.040
and he can give us employment wherever he wants

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:47.239
to give us employment and we seek to be,

00:38:47.239 --> 00:38:51.119
even in that place, his representative.

00:38:51.119 --> 00:38:52.440
Are there challenges?

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.480
Absolutely.

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:54.880
You know why there are challenges?

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.920
Because the devil doesn't want you to do it.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.360
So there'll be challenges.

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.920
But the reality is that we can pray to the God of heaven

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.760
who can move in hearts and lives

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.239
and can bring to pass amazing things.

00:39:11.239 --> 00:39:13.720
Listen, you might not be able to talk to your coworker

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:15.640
about the Lord in certain settings

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.480
because of the task at hand

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:21.280
and the responsibility of being a good employee,

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.360
but if you get a lunch break,

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.200
there's nothing that says

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.080
that you can't have lunch with someone.

00:39:26.239 --> 00:39:28.080
And here's the thing, and this is,

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.440
God's been helping me in this,

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.880
not only through just a variety of means,

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.280
talking with some of our missionaries

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:35.480
and learning some things

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.360
about some of what our missionaries are dealing with

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.320
and some of the difficulties that they have faced

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.559
and so on and so forth is that,

00:39:41.559 --> 00:39:45.679
maybe what we do is we just spend consistent time

00:39:45.679 --> 00:39:47.239
in prayer for an individual

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.160
before we start trying to beat them over the head with Bible.

00:39:53.799 --> 00:39:55.799
And just pray that God would soften their heart,

00:39:55.799 --> 00:39:57.679
that God would allow things in their lives

00:39:57.679 --> 00:40:00.320
that will help them to understand their need for Christ.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.559
Maybe it's your neighbor.

00:40:01.559 --> 00:40:05.639
or maybe it's a family member that we just pray for.

00:40:05.639 --> 00:40:07.639
Within the context of this text of scripture,

00:40:07.639 --> 00:40:08.799
maybe it's a co-worker.

00:40:10.119 --> 00:40:12.279
When we ended the revival meeting,

00:40:12.279 --> 00:40:14.699
Pastor Edwards made this statement on one of the nights,

00:40:14.699 --> 00:40:16.479
I think it was Tuesday evening.

00:40:16.479 --> 00:40:20.139
He asked this question about God placing someone's name

00:40:20.139 --> 00:40:22.199
on your heart to pray for.

00:40:22.199 --> 00:40:23.699
And I just wonder this morning,

00:40:24.599 --> 00:40:25.879
as you think about your workplace,

00:40:25.879 --> 00:40:29.399
and you think about the context of this particular message,

00:40:29.399 --> 00:40:30.999
maybe there's a decision that we need to make

00:40:30.999 --> 00:40:35.999
that, you know what, I've kind of lost focus a little bit.

00:40:36.119 --> 00:40:38.199
I've kind of lost my way in the workplace.

00:40:38.199 --> 00:40:41.939
I've gotten caught up in the politics of work.

00:40:41.939 --> 00:40:45.759
The office politics and the office whatever.

00:40:45.759 --> 00:40:50.759
And I've not really been working heartily as to the Lord.

00:40:50.839 --> 00:40:54.179
I've not really been the employee that I ought to be.

00:40:54.179 --> 00:40:56.059
You know that, God knows that.

00:40:57.459 --> 00:40:59.239
But maybe this morning,

00:40:59.239 --> 00:41:01.879
maybe God would put someone's name on your heart.

00:41:03.839 --> 00:41:05.319
And you just wanna make a commitment to God,

00:41:05.319 --> 00:41:06.519
I'm gonna pray for them.

00:41:07.599 --> 00:41:09.619
And I'm gonna pray that God will open up

00:41:09.619 --> 00:41:11.680
a door of opportunity.

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.819
I believe with all of my heart that when we pray

00:41:14.819 --> 00:41:17.639
that God will open opportunities and we make a commitment

00:41:17.639 --> 00:41:19.839
that will seize those opportunities,

00:41:19.839 --> 00:41:22.639
that those are prayers that God delights in answering.

00:41:24.079 --> 00:41:26.959
Oftentimes it's easy to see an opportunity going

00:41:26.959 --> 00:41:28.319
then coming.

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:30.279
We say, man, I missed that opportunity.

00:41:31.199 --> 00:41:36.199
But if we're specifically engaged in praying for a coworker

00:41:36.199 --> 00:41:38.519
and praying that God will open their heart

00:41:38.519 --> 00:41:40.360
to the truth of the gospel and praying

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:42.559
that God would give us the opportunity.

00:41:46.319 --> 00:41:48.199
I had plenty of times where I had coworkers

00:41:48.199 --> 00:41:52.699
that would come to me and say, say it in different ways.

00:41:52.699 --> 00:41:54.319
I know you're a, I had somebody say,

00:41:54.319 --> 00:41:56.079
I know you're a man of the cloth.

00:41:56.079 --> 00:41:57.599
And the world is that, man.

00:41:58.639 --> 00:42:00.479
Anyway, they'd say it different ways.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.279
But they'd say, you know what?

00:42:04.279 --> 00:42:07.839
We just found out somebody's got cancer,

00:42:07.839 --> 00:42:10.759
somebody's got my this, my that.

00:42:10.759 --> 00:42:11.860
Would you pray for me?

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.279
Because God works in the hearts of people.

00:42:18.279 --> 00:42:21.080
And if you begin to pray for those opportunities

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.199
and you begin to pray for that one

00:42:23.199 --> 00:42:26.039
that God will put on your heart and mind,

00:42:26.039 --> 00:42:27.839
and you faithfully do that,

00:42:28.339 --> 00:42:30.080
and you're the best worker that you can be

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.679
because you're serving Christ,

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.119
God will open up doors of opportunity.

00:42:36.479 --> 00:42:37.959
And you may be the one that they come to

00:42:37.959 --> 00:42:40.239
and say, would you pray for me?

00:42:40.239 --> 00:42:41.720
You can pray for them.

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:46.720
You see how that door just got opened for God to work.

00:42:47.839 --> 00:42:50.959
And of course, the greatest need that anyone needs,

00:42:50.959 --> 00:42:53.759
the greatest need that any individual has

00:42:53.759 --> 00:42:55.599
is the need for salvation.

00:42:56.599 --> 00:43:00.039
Oftentimes, it will be a need for health,

00:43:00.039 --> 00:43:01.520
it'll be a need for finances,

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.160
it'll be a need for marriage,

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.000
it'll be a need for fill in the blank

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000
that will bring them to the place of realizing

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.720
they're falling apart, their life is a mess.

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:17.119
And then, ultimately, through conversation

00:43:17.119 --> 00:43:19.119
and through biblical truth,

00:43:19.119 --> 00:43:22.279
they'll realize what they really need is Christ.

00:43:22.279 --> 00:43:24.080
What they need is Christ.

00:43:24.199 --> 00:43:26.839
And God has you in your place.

00:43:26.839 --> 00:43:29.639
I would not do it for sake of the fact

00:43:29.639 --> 00:43:31.880
that we're on live stream,

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.319
but if I could, if I knew,

00:43:33.319 --> 00:43:36.759
I don't even know everywhere that people work in our church,

00:43:36.759 --> 00:43:39.239
but if I knew the name of each employer,

00:43:40.199 --> 00:43:42.039
in my heart and in my mind,

00:43:42.039 --> 00:43:44.199
it's we have a missionary to fill in the blank,

00:43:44.199 --> 00:43:45.479
a missionary to fill in the blank,

00:43:45.479 --> 00:43:47.479
a missionary to fill in the blank.

00:43:47.479 --> 00:43:50.039
These are the missionaries from our church

00:43:50.039 --> 00:43:52.880
that this week, that tomorrow,

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:56.160
get to go into all of those workplaces

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.319
and let your light shine.

00:43:59.319 --> 00:44:01.559
We tell the kids, we sing it with the kids.

00:44:01.559 --> 00:44:04.039
This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.

00:44:04.039 --> 00:44:06.279
Hide it under a bushel.

00:44:06.279 --> 00:44:07.479
No!

00:44:07.479 --> 00:44:08.639
But man, we go to the workplace,

00:44:08.639 --> 00:44:10.800
we say, man, I left that light at home

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:13.679
because I am, right?

00:44:13.679 --> 00:44:16.839
But we're his representatives, we're his ambassadors.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.880
And I believe this morning in the culture,

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.079
in the age in which we're living,

00:44:23.079 --> 00:44:26.839
that this truth about our behavior in the workplace

00:44:26.839 --> 00:44:30.919
can be the catalyst to revival in our world

00:44:31.799 --> 00:44:34.559
because we go all over the place,

00:44:34.559 --> 00:44:37.760
all of our different respective places of employment,

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:41.040
and we can reach people with the gospel.

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:41.880
Let's pray.

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.519
Father, we love you this morning.

00:44:43.519 --> 00:44:45.919
We thank you for loving us.

00:44:45.919 --> 00:44:49.480
God, we thank you for your Word

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.799
and how your Word gives us instruction

00:44:54.399 --> 00:44:56.600
truly in every area of our lives.

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.399
This morning, as we focus our attention

00:45:00.399 --> 00:45:01.880
upon this portion of Scripture

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:05.320
and deal with our behavior in the workplace,

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.399
I thank you for the places of employment

00:45:08.399 --> 00:45:10.359
that you've given to our church family,

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.519
the places in which you have chosen

00:45:14.519 --> 00:45:17.720
to plant them,

00:45:21.239 --> 00:45:26.239
not solely for the purpose of making a living,

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:33.760
for the purpose of being your representative.

00:45:36.239 --> 00:45:40.880
There are souls that daily come in contact

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.480
with those that are sitting in this building

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.519
and those that are listening via live stream

00:45:47.519 --> 00:45:49.919
that do not know the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:45:54.359 --> 00:45:57.440
Lord, as we faithfully pray for our missionaries,

00:46:00.399 --> 00:46:01.839
pray this morning that you would help us

00:46:01.839 --> 00:46:03.760
to faithfully pray for one another

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:10.559
with the thought that we go as missionaries

00:46:10.559 --> 00:46:14.119
not to a foreign country, but to a company.

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.359
God, I pray that you'd help us to be

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:22.639
the employees that we're to be.

00:46:22.639 --> 00:46:27.639
Would you help us to operate with integrity,

00:46:29.559 --> 00:46:30.959
singleness of heart?

00:46:31.959 --> 00:46:33.639
Would you help us in whatsoever we do

00:46:33.639 --> 00:46:36.440
to do it heartily as unto the Lord, not unto men?

00:46:38.279 --> 00:46:41.040
Would you help us, God, to exalt and magnify you

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:45.000
in our lives and even in the workplace?

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.799
Put that name of that coworker

00:46:48.799 --> 00:46:51.119
on folks' hearts this morning.

00:46:51.959 --> 00:46:53.919
I pray that we would make a commitment

00:46:53.919 --> 00:46:56.720
to pray faithfully and diligently

00:46:57.679 --> 00:47:00.639
that you would open up doors of opportunity,

00:47:00.639 --> 00:47:02.720
that those opportunities would be seized.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:08.119
Lord, you'd help us to see souls saved and lives changed.

00:47:09.119 --> 00:47:14.119
But truly, this could be a catalyst for revival.

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.160
We pray that you'd seal every decision,

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.440
that you'd work as only you can.

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:22.399
We'll thank you for it, in Christ's name we pray.

00:47:22.399 --> 00:47:23.239
Would you stand?
