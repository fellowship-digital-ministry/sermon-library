1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,199
Bible, aren't you? And what a blessing to have the Word of God, to know the truth that God has provided us with in His Word and the

2
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:14,239
instruction that He's given to us. In Romans chapter number 6, we'll jump in here in just a moment, but I want you to understand the

3
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:22,440
Christian life is a journey. And how many of you have realized that? It's a journey walking with the Lord. Amen. In fact, in John 15, the

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:30,440
Lord Jesus Christ instructs His followers to abide in Him. We find in the book of Galatians that we, as the people of God, are

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:38,959
instructed to walk in the Spirit. We find that we are reminded in the same text of Scripture that the Spirit and the flesh are

6
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:47,759
contrary the one to the other. And I know that each of us, if you've been saved for any period of time, you have learned that the Spirit

7
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:55,560
and the flesh are at enmity one with the other. They are contrary one to the other. The Bible talks about, in Ephesians chapter number 2,

8
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:05,199
about the lust of the flesh or the desires of the flesh. And the reality is that when you got saved, your flesh was not eradicated and there

9
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:13,959
are still desires of the flesh, but we are to walk in the Spirit, the Bible says, and we should not fulfill the desires of the flesh. And so

10
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:21,839
what a great promise that God gives us. We find in the book of Ephesians, as well as the book of Colossians, that we, as the people of God,

11
00:01:21,839 --> 00:01:32,400
are instructed to put on the new and to put off the old. And we find in our text this evening in Romans chapter number 6, we're going to look at

12
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:43,080
verses 1 through 19 this evening. And as we look at this text of Scripture, you're going to find the word yield used several times. And the word

13
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:52,400
yield is an important word. We could ask ourselves this question tonight, what does it mean to yield? How many of you drive on the roads around here

14
00:01:52,400 --> 00:02:03,519
and you find very commonly that people do not know what the yield sign means? And you see that all the time, they don't understand what yield means.

15
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:11,520
And we find that sometimes we go through the Christian life, we look here in Romans chapter 6 and we see the use of this word, we may not fully

16
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:23,839
understand what it means to yield. Let me ask this question, is it a natural thing to yield? It's not natural. It's not natural. The word yield means to

17
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:34,520
submit, to give way, or to give place. That's what it means. Now we're instructed in the text of Scripture, I've titled the message this evening from

18
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:47,559
verse number 13, that we're to yield ourselves unto God. Yield yourselves unto God. I ask the question, is it natural to yield? And honestly this evening, the

19
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:55,520
subject, the thought of yielding, goes against the flesh. Not only does it go against the flesh, but it goes against the culture that we live in. We live in a

20
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:07,199
culture that feeds the desires of the flesh. We live in a culture, we live in a society that tells you, that tells me, that tells our young people, be what you want to be.

21
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:18,800
Do what you want to do. Do what feels good. If it pleases you, then do it. Is that not the society, the culture that we live in? And we find this evening that as the

22
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:32,639
people of God, as saved individuals, we come to Romans chapter number 6, and we find this truth that we are to yield ourselves unto God. That we're not to be the master of my own life.

23
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:44,880
My flesh, your flesh, wants to rule. Wants to sit on the throne of your heart, of your life. But we find that we have a Savior. We have a good Savior, a good master, a good Lord, and He

24
00:03:44,880 --> 00:04:00,240
deserves to have preeminence in our lives. He deserves to have that place of ownership, and that we would yield to Him. Notice in the text of Scripture, if you're taking notes, number 1 this evening, and it's going to be verses 1 through 14.

25
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm going to get through it kind of quickly this evening, but I want you to notice the counsel. Eventually we'll get through verse 19, but on this first thought this evening, I want you to notice the counsel that is given.

26
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:22,239
And we see that in verses 1 through 14. Notice the way the Bible begins in verse number 1, what shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?

27
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:35,359
Now he's referring back, remember the chapter divisions are added for the ease of our finding passages of Scripture. The chapter divisions, the verse divisions, they were not in the originals.

28
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:45,760
It's not how they were given, but they were provided to us. Could you imagine tonight if we all tried to get to Romans chapter number 6 without having chapter and verse divisions? It'd be quite difficult.

29
00:04:45,760 --> 00:05:01,519
And so we're thankful for them, but we notice at the end of chapter 5, in verse number 20, notice what the Bible says, moreover the law entered that the offense might abound, but where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.

30
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:14,079
Aren't you thankful for that truth? Someone said this, a songwriter said, I don't know what a sinner you are, but I know what a savior he is. And what a joy to know the amazing grace of our God.

31
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:24,079
It says in verse 21, that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.

32
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:34,000
So then he's going to answer a question that he's given here in verse number 1 of chapter 6, what shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?

33
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:48,559
God forbid, that's the answer in verse number 2. See, there are some that don't understand the grace of God. In fact, the false teachers that are creeping in according to the book of Jude, they turn the grace of God into lasciviousness.

34
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:58,079
And that word means unbridled lust. Do what you want, be what you want, because the grace of God allows for that. That's not what the grace of God allows for.

35
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:10,640
According to Titus chapter number 2, the grace of God hath appeared to all men, teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust, we should live godly and soberly and righteously in this present world.

36
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:17,600
And so that's what the grace of God teaches us, but we find that they turn the grace of God into lasciviousness.

37
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:32,160
So Paul says, no, that's not the idea. Though we are rejoicing the fact that where sin did abound, that grace did abound much more, we rejoice in that, but we don't continue in sin that grace may abound.

38
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,480
God forbid, notice verse 2, how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein?

39
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:48,239
Notice he's beginning to reveal to us and help us to understand our position in Christ and who we are and understanding that he says in verse 3,

40
00:06:48,239 --> 00:07:06,480
We are buried with him by baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.

41
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:15,119
We use this verse of scripture every time I baptize someone I say, are you sure of heaven, have you trusted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?

42
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:23,600
And if they say yes I have, and by the way I've already asked them before I get them into the water to make sure, I've already had that conversation, but I say,

43
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:33,839
based upon your profession of faith, I now baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, buried in the likeness of his death, raised to walk in newness of life.

44
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:39,359
The Bible says, if any man be in Christ, he's a new creature, old things are passed away, behold, all things are become new.

45
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:46,640
And we find here that he's telling these believers about the truth of the new life in Christ in verse 5,

46
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:53,440
for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection, knowing this.

47
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,600
Notice what he wants us to know in verse 6, this is something that is to be known.

48
00:07:57,679 --> 00:08:03,200
Remember, as we study the Bible, God does not want his people to be ignorant.

49
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:17,200
He wants us to be informed, he wants us to know things, and he says, knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that's Christ, the picture there,

50
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:31,359
that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin, for he that is dead is freed from sin.

51
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:40,880
Now, if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him, and so I'm to be dead to sin, but alive unto God.

52
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:49,200
It's amazing as we look here, remember the apostle Paul said, I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I, right?

53
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:58,960
Galatians 2.20, he's giving that truth, he's really, in one verse of scripture in Galatians 2, he's summarizing all that he's giving here in Romans 6.

54
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:05,359
And we find in verse number 8, now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him,

55
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:13,039
knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him.

56
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:20,080
Aren't you thankful for that? He conquered sin, death, and the grave, and he is alive forevermore.

57
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:27,679
Revelation says, I am he that was dead, but I'm alive forevermore. Hallelujah, we serve a risen savior.

58
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:33,599
Verse 10, for in that he died, he died unto sin, what does it say? Once.

59
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:41,039
Remember what Hebrews 10 said? For this man after he offered one sacrifice for sin forever, he sat down.

60
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,799
Why? The work was finished, he said, it is done, it is finished, it's complete. Hallelujah.

61
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,799
We find that it continues and says, but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.

62
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:57,599
Now notice as we get into the council here, the apostle Paul in these first 10 verses is helping the believers,

63
00:09:57,599 --> 00:10:00,000
helping these that he's writing to, helping them.

64
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,359
as we have the Bible preserved for us

65
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:05,280
to understand our position.

66
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,880
And the counsel is clear.

67
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,600
He says this in verse 11,

68
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,359
likewise reckon ye also yourselves

69
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:15,159
to be dead indeed unto sin,

70
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:20,159
but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

71
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,239
Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body

72
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:27,340
that you should obey it in the lust thereof.

73
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,760
And here's the counsel, verse 13,

74
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,899
neither yield ye your members

75
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:35,060
as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin,

76
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,979
but yield yourselves unto God

77
00:10:38,979 --> 00:10:41,159
as those that are alive from the dead

78
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:44,720
and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God,

79
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,680
for sin shall not have dominion over you,

80
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,139
for you're not under the law, but under grace.

81
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:53,720
These are some wonderful verses of scripture.

82
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,599
God gives us this counsel in verse number 13

83
00:10:56,599 --> 00:10:59,520
that we're to yield ourselves unto God.

84
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,619
He tells us in verse 14

85
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,339
that sin shall not have dominion over you.

86
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:08,419
You know that when you were lost, you were bound by sin.

87
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:10,300
You're bound by sin.

88
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,639
But we find that when we trust that Christ is our savior,

89
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,819
not only were we delivered from the penalty of sin,

90
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:18,980
which is death,

91
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,019
but we were delivered from the power of sin.

92
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,779
He says here, for sin shall not have dominion over you.

93
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:27,580
We were bound by sin.

94
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,519
We were under the dominion of sin,

95
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,480
but in Christ, we are dead to sin.

96
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,000
We're alive unto God.

97
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,379
We find that we've been delivered from the penalty

98
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:41,319
and from the power of sin.

99
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:42,519
We find the truth, though,

100
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:45,519
that we've not yet been delivered from the presence of sin.

101
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,559
Sin is still here.

102
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,720
You sin today.

103
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:53,540
Amen?

104
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,379
We sin.

105
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,279
But he says here that sin shall not have dominion over you.

106
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:03,879
What a great promise that God has given to us,

107
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:06,680
that he has given us the victory.

108
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,959
But thanks be to God,

109
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:11,440
which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

110
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,720
And so we find the counsel is given,

111
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,800
I believe this evening, that the counsel is clear.

112
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,279
He tells us that as we would understand our position

113
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,479
in Christ, that what we should do

114
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:24,360
is yield ourselves unto God.

115
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:26,000
Notice he says in verse 13,

116
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,860
if you consider the entirety of the counsel,

117
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,699
neither yield ye your members

118
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:32,419
as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin,

119
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,619
but yield yourselves unto God

120
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:37,380
as those that are alive from the dead

121
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,580
and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.

122
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,820
And so that's counsel, that's instruction,

123
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,740
that's what we are instructed to do.

124
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,779
And so we find that we notice the counsel,

125
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,179
but as we continue through the text of Scripture

126
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:53,339
in verses 15 and 16, number two,

127
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,559
I want you to notice the choice.

128
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:57,039
Notice the choice.

129
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:02,039
You know, God has given to his creation, humanity, free will.

130
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:06,839
There's a lot of confusion about free will.

131
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:08,639
And I do not believe,

132
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,639
in fact, I had a conversation with somebody today,

133
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,520
I believe 100% in my mind,

134
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,679
it makes total sense that God is fully sovereign

135
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,059
and he knows all things

136
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:22,160
and he knows the end from the beginning

137
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,220
and he has foreknowledge, he has all knowledge,

138
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,740
he is supreme, he is sovereign, he is God.

139
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,500
And at the same time, he gave man free will.

140
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,020
I believe that those two things can be in perfect harmony.

141
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,860
Why?

142
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,220
Because God made it so.

143
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,860
And so God made it so and he gave us that free will.

144
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,740
And you think about the way that he gives us free will,

145
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,059
he provides us, he provides you and me

146
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,440
and these that are originally receiving this letter

147
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,899
from Paul and every child of God

148
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:57,880
that would read the book of Romans,

149
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,880
they, God gives to them, gives to us valuable counsel.

150
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,220
But he doesn't make us do it.

151
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,679
He gives you a choice.

152
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,940
He gives me a choice.

153
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:15,179
You know, someone, I've been asked the question many times

154
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:18,700
over the years and not that I'm an expert,

155
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,459
I've only pastored now for a little over 13 years,

156
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,359
it's not that long of a time,

157
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:25,000
but oftentimes I will be asked,

158
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,959
in fact, we're in Panama, I was asked the question

159
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,000
by a couple of the young men.

160
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,720
They said, what's the hardest thing about pastoring?

161
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,279
And there's a lot of hard things about pastoring.

162
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:39,279
There's the list is various and so many different things,

163
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,079
but one of the hardest things

164
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,500
is watching people make bad decisions.

165
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,799
You know what a hard thing as a parent

166
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,380
is watching a child make a bad decision.

167
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,179
It's hard as a parent.

168
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:55,299
If you've had children that have made bad decisions

169
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:59,179
and you gave them the counsel, you laid out for them,

170
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:02,700
but you could not make the decision for them

171
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,660
and you watch them make a bad choice, a bad decision,

172
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,820
that's hard.

173
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:12,739
And at some point, there's nothing you can do about it.

174
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,140
There's absolutely nothing you can do about it.

175
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,660
Listen, God gives us free will.

176
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,119
As a pastor, I have the responsibility

177
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:23,839
of preaching the whole counsel of God,

178
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,380
giving the truth of God's word,

179
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,799
but I can't make anybody do anything.

180
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,880
Amen?

181
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,880
It's a choice of the individual.

182
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,380
And we find this evening

183
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,660
that as we look at this passage of Scripture,

184
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,839
that God provides us with this valuable counsel,

185
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,760
but he does not force us to heed it.

186
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,760
I want you to consider, hold your place here,

187
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,500
we'll be right back into the book of Romans,

188
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:49,640
but look over at 2 Peter chapter one, just for a moment,

189
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,119
and as you're turning to 2 Peter chapter number one,

190
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,359
I wanna read a verse of Scripture to you there,

191
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:56,920
but I also, I don't want you to turn to Psalm 19,

192
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,000
if you want, you can if you're quick,

193
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,760
but Psalm 19, I wanna read a couple of verses to you there

194
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,320
as we get back over to 2 Peter chapter one

195
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,600
here in just a moment,

196
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,559
but I want you to see that in Psalm 19,

197
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:11,160
I don't have time to read all of it,

198
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,480
but it begins in verse seven,

199
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,779
speaking about the law of the Lord being perfect

200
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,980
and gives all of these attributes

201
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,799
and various workings of God's word and how it's effective.

202
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,339
In verse number 11, it says,

203
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:27,339
"'Moreover, by them is thy servant warned,

204
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:32,459
and in keeping of them, there is great reward.'"

205
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,980
You can warn people, but you can't force people.

206
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,399
Do we agree with that tonight?

207
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,739
You can warn them, but you can't force them.

208
00:16:42,739 --> 00:16:44,440
And notice in 2 Peter chapter one,

209
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,440
Peter's writing, and in this particular text of scripture,

210
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,799
beginning in verse 16, he's writing about

211
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:52,040
being on the Mount of Transfiguration.

212
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,140
I mean, what an amazing opportunity

213
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,640
that Peter, James, and John had

214
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,600
to be there on the Mount of Transfiguration.

215
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,920
I can't even fully grasp how amazing that must have been,

216
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,119
but we find that he mentions that in verse 16,

217
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,399
and we see it at the end of the verse,

218
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:09,959
he says, but we're eyewitnesses of his majesty,

219
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,380
and he goes through and he's talking about

220
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,579
the word of God that we have here,

221
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,019
that no prophecy came, not by the will of man,

222
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:19,619
but holy men of God spake, in verse 21,

223
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,140
as they were moved by the Holy Ghost,

224
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,579
but I wanna draw your attention to verse 19.

225
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,220
Notice what Peter says,

226
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,779
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

227
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:30,779
he says, we have also a more sure word of prophecy.

228
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:35,100
Now, Peter, God, of course, is the author of scripture,

229
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,299
and God precedes the statement of us

230
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:40,579
having a more sure word of prophecy

231
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:44,959
by revealing that Peter heard the voice of God

232
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,980
on the Mount of Transfiguration,

233
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,040
and then Peter says, but we have,

234
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,059
we have also a more sure word of prophecy,

235
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:53,940
and then notice the center of this verse,

236
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,940
it says, whereunto ye do well, that ye take heed,

237
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,619
and then notice how he illustrates

238
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:03,179
what it means to take heed,

239
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:06,459
as unto a light that shineth in a dark place

240
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:11,179
until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts.

241
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:13,779
You know, this evening, if we were to lose power,

242
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:15,660
and if the emergency lights,

243
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,339
if we were in here for any length of time,

244
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:22,019
and the battery backup of the emergency lights failed,

245
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:24,100
and it was completely dark in here,

246
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,420
the shades were pulled down,

247
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,779
and it was stormy, and it was dark,

248
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:32,580
and we did not have any bearing of our orientation,

249
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,840
I guarantee you this evening,

250
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,799
that if in the midst of that great darkness,

251
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,719
if someone turned on a light,

252
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:42,679
that your attention would go to the light.

253
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,719
So it would happen.

254
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:47,200
Without you thinking about it,

255
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,080
you immediately would look to the light,

256
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,119
and so Peter says that you do well,

257
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,440
that you take heed thereunto.

258
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,119
It is in our best interest,

259
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,400
and so here, back in Romans chapter number six,

260
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,880
when we notice the choice that counsel is given,

261
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,940
it's valuable counsel,

262
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,900
but we find that there's a choice that has to be made,

263
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,419
and so then notice in verse 15,

264
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:08,380
what then?

265
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,859
Shall we sin because we are not under the law,

266
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:11,700
but under grace?

267
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,299
God forbid.

268
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:14,340
Verse 16.

269
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,619
Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants

270
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:22,580
to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey,

271
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,940
whether of sin unto death,

272
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,219
or of obedience unto righteousness.

273
00:19:26,219 --> 00:19:28,500
So do you see the choice in verse 15?

274
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,619
In verse 13, he says neither yield ye,

275
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:33,500
and then he says, but yield yourselves.

276
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,739
He's giving them counsel.

277
00:19:34,739 --> 00:19:36,580
He's telling them what to do,

278
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,700
but in verse 16, he's saying,

279
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,979
know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants

280
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:42,820
to obey.

281
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,979
This is the choice that every believer has to make.

282
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:48,059
Are we gonna yield ourselves to God?

283
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,219
By the way, let me say this.

284
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:53,099
As we note in verse 15 and 16,

285
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:55,219
and we consider the choice that is before

286
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:56,900
every child of God,

287
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,820
the principle of yielding to God is a,

288
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,980
It's a recurring decision.

289
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,880
You know, when you got saved,

290
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,320
it was a moment in time,

291
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,320
and you were born again.

292
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,160
You're not being born again.

293
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,500
Born again is not a process.

294
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,800
Salvation is the miracle of a moment.

295
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,680
Sanctification, practical sanctification,

296
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,440
not positional sanctification,

297
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,200
but practical sanctification,

298
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,400
if I can make that distinction this evening,

299
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,580
the practical aspect of sanctification

300
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,700
is really the process of a lifetime.

301
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,420
It's not the miracle of a moment,

302
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,180
it's the process of a lifetime.

303
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,740
It's that we continually yield ourselves unto God,

304
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,260
moment by moment, day by day.

305
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,460
In fact, I said that yielding to God

306
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,880
is a recurring decision,

307
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,020
but you understand that in your life and in my life,

308
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,960
that we might have to yield to God

309
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,280
multiple times in a single day.

310
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,120
Why?

311
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,440
Because decisions are going to be put before us,

312
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,000
and there's going to be an opportunity

313
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,160
for you to yield to yourself

314
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,120
to what you want to do,

315
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,040
or to yield to God.

316
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,520
And here the Bible says that there's a choice.

317
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,560
I believe that it's clear the choice

318
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,060
that God would want his children to make.

319
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,760
I believe that it's clear

320
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,840
that Paul made it abundantly clear

321
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,060
of the choice that he, as a spiritual leader,

322
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,640
would like for these readers,

323
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,640
these recipients of this letter,

324
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,700
the choice for them to make.

325
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,200
But at the end of the day,

326
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,560
God's given us a free will,

327
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,120
and the choice is yours.

328
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,400
You know what Moses, God,

329
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,260
says to the people in Moses writes?

330
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,160
He says, you're going to make a choice.

331
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,440
Deuteronomy 11.

332
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,040
I set before you a blessing and a curse.

333
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,280
Is that not what God said in Deuteronomy 11?

334
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,840
We read it, we see it, we understand it.

335
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,920
What about Joshua, in Joshua chapter 24?

336
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,960
Choose you this day whom ye will serve.

337
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,400
Is that not what it says?

338
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,780
But as for me and my house,

339
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,300
we will serve the Lord.

340
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,860
See, Joshua said, I've made a choice,

341
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,520
but I can't make the choice for you.

342
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,760
I'm going to make the choice,

343
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,440
and I'm going to lay out the reason

344
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,920
that you ought to make the same choice that I'm making,

345
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,600
and I believe if you read Joshua 24,

346
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,320
that's clear, that Joshua says,

347
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,300
look, let me help you understand

348
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,200
why you should make the same choice that I'm making.

349
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,900
You know what all the people said?

350
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,160
We're going to serve God.

351
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,240
You read it, that's what they say.

352
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,480
We're going to serve God.

353
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,440
And so we find this evening there's a choice,

354
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,920
but that choice is just, it's not a one and done.

355
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,200
Like salvation, you write down the date

356
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,400
that you got saved, and man, you can rejoice

357
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,600
in your spiritual birthday,

358
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,240
and you can know that you're born again,

359
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,480
but with regard to yielding to Christ

360
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,600
multiple times in a day,

361
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,080
you may have to make that decision.

362
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,000
Nope, I'm going to yield to God.

363
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,680
I'm bought with a price.

364
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,340
I belong to Him.

365
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,080
Notice with me as we conclude

366
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,560
looking at verses 17 through 19,

367
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,400
we're going to look at a couple of other,

368
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
just one other passage quickly,

369
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,420
but notice the consequences of this choice.

370
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,080
The consequences, we find that there's a choice to be made,

371
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,440
but the consequences are given to us.

372
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,680
It says, but God be thanked.

373
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,080
Notice what it says in verse 17,

374
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,600
that ye were the servants of sin,

375
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,960
but ye have obeyed from the heart

376
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,560
that form of doctrine which was delivered you.

377
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,320
Isn't that exciting that we were,

378
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,360
but we are not any longer?

379
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,920
He says it in past tense.

380
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,960
Ye were the servants of sin.

381
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,960
I was, you were, I was, everyone.

382
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,520
Listen, Ephesians chapter two makes it abundantly clear

383
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,100
that we all were in that same situation.

384
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,640
It was not something that was unique to you

385
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,880
or to some other person.

386
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,760
No, he says that we all had our conversation

387
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,440
in times past in the lust of our flesh,

388
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,980
fulfilling the desires of the flesh and the mind,

389
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,760
and were by nature the children of wrath even as others.

390
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,040
That was our lot, that was our situation.

391
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,800
Ephesians chapter two, and you look there in that passage

392
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,700
and you see the truth that is given to us

393
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,980
in verse number three.

394
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,000
But God, verse number four, who is rich in mercy,

395
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,839
praise the Lord, for by grace are you saved through faith.

396
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,920
Verse number eight, right?

397
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,100
What a joy to understand this truth of salvation,

398
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,720
but the choice that we make

399
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,360
that we would yield ourselves unto God.

400
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,480
He says that you were the servants of sin,

401
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,380
but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine

402
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,500
which was delivered to you.

403
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,320
Understand with me tonight that the truth of salvation

404
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,160
is so much more than just escaping hell.

405
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,279
Did you catch that tonight?

406
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,279
It's important.

407
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,200
Why is it important?

408
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,679
Because some people have this idea that salvation,

409
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:11,480
the only real reason anyone needs to be saved

410
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,119
is so they would escape like a fire, escape hell.

411
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,080
Though that is true that we would,

412
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,779
if you're saved by the grace of God,

413
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:21,020
you're not gonna go to the lake of fire, hallelujah.

414
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,200
But he didn't save us so that we could live for ourselves.

415
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,839
He didn't save us so that we could walk in sin

416
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:30,679
and continue to fulfill the lust

417
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:31,920
and the desires of the flesh.

418
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:36,820
No, he saved us so that we might be like Christ.

419
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,480
If you read Romans chapter eight in verse number 29,

420
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,000
he predestined us to be conformed

421
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,200
to the image of his dear son.

422
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:48,300
Christ in me, the hope of glory.

423
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,839
That's the idea.

424
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:52,779
And so salvation is not just,

425
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:55,119
I had a man tell me, this was before I even got saved.

426
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:57,500
I was about 13 years old.

427
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,800
My parents had gotten saved.

428
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,240
We're at the church, Grace Baptist Church

429
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,880
in Jacksonville, North Carolina.

430
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,240
And there was this young Marine,

431
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,700
actually a bunch of young Marines that were there.

432
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,119
They were talking about being saved.

433
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:11,080
And this one guy, he was talking about all kinds of sin

434
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,440
and wickedness, he was talking, he was just bad talking.

435
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,520
He's at church, he's right out in the parking lot.

436
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,820
I was like a 13 year old kid

437
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,160
and I was there standing there with him.

438
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,080
And this guy was talking about all kinds of immorality.

439
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,000
And thankfully there were some other young Marines

440
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,559
that were saved by the grace of God

441
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,160
and called him out on it and said,

442
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,100
hey, hey, hey, why are you talking about that stuff?

443
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,600
Why are you doing that kind of stuff?

444
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,440
And you know what he said?

445
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,399
I remember it just like it was yesterday.

446
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:36,920
He said, listen, as long as I'm going to heaven,

447
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,399
I don't really care, I'm just gonna do what I wanna do.

448
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:40,240
You know what I'd say?

449
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,760
I'd question whether that man's really saved.

450
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,279
You know why I'd question if he's really saved?

451
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,119
Because the Bible says,

452
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:47,559
if any man be in Christ, he's a new creature.

453
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:48,540
All things are passed away,

454
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,679
behold, all things will become new.

455
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,360
It doesn't mean that we don't have the desires of the flesh

456
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,000
but it means that the Holy Spirit of God is living in us.

457
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,399
And it means that God said,

458
00:26:56,399 --> 00:26:59,800
for whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth.

459
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,160
Amen, is that what your Bible says?

460
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,839
Well, my Bible says he corrects us,

461
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:05,559
he chastens us because he loves us.

462
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:07,480
And so we're not what we used to be.

463
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
Praise the Lord for that.

464
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,520
Notice in verse 18, back in Romans six,

465
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,040
being then made free from sin,

466
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,200
you became the servants of righteousness.

467
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,679
By the way, I'd rather be a servant of righteousness

468
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,559
than a servant of sin, amen.

469
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,080
You see that contrast between verse 17 and 18.

470
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,000
I would much rather be a servant of righteousness

471
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,480
than a servant of sin.

472
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,420
And verse 19 says this,

473
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,600
I speak after the manner of men

474
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,839
because of the infirmity of your flesh.

475
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:40,640
For as you have yielded your member servants

476
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,119
to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity,

477
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:48,559
even so now yield your member servants

478
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,040
to righteousness unto holiness.

479
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,880
I believe in verse 19, it really goes with the first point

480
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,760
this evening of the counsel that is given to us.

481
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,160
And Paul is saying, listen, you have in the past,

482
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,399
before you got saved,

483
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,440
you yielded your member servants of uncleanness

484
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,399
unto iniquity unto iniquity.

485
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,480
But now that you're saved,

486
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,839
now yield your member servants

487
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,160
to righteousness unto holiness.

488
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,960
In verse 13, however, we do see that the Bible says,

489
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,160
neither yield ye your members

490
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,760
as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin.

491
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,240
So we still can yield to the wrong thing.

492
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,800
It's not an automatic.

493
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,820
You can still yield to yourself,

494
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,200
you can still yield to sin,

495
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,260
you can still yield to unrighteousness,

496
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,160
but the counsel, the compelling truth of Romans six

497
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,619
is yield yourselves unto God.

498
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:46,160
And you know when we do that, God is glorified.

499
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,000
God is glorified.

500
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,380
That's the ultimate consequence is that God is glorified.

501
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,220
Why?

502
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,700
Because we're yielding ourselves to him.

503
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,739
What does it mean to yield?

504
00:28:53,739 --> 00:28:56,780
Again, the word means to submit, to give place

505
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,780
or to give way.

506
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:01,700
And we're acknowledging that he is my Lord and my master,

507
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,380
that he is the one that is to be receiving the honor

508
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,979
and the glory and the praise, and it's all about him.

509
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:10,520
And I'm yielding to him.

510
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,940
My life, Lord, is yours to control.

511
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,580
It's what the songwriter said.

512
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,580
And what a great song.

513
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:19,739
Living for Jesus, we sing the hymn.

514
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:21,020
What a great hymn.

515
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,859
And we find this evening that here,

516
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:26,220
when we come to the place

517
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,320
that we're yielding ourselves to God,

518
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,679
that we understand that God is going

519
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:32,880
to receive the honor and the glory.

520
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,239
We sang this evening, Dare to be a Daniel.

521
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:37,479
Dare to be a Daniel.

522
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:39,280
I want you to turn over to Daniel chapter three,

523
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,119
if you will.

524
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,440
It's not really about Daniel.

525
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,440
It's about his three friends in Daniel chapter number three.

526
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:49,960
Daniel, of course, we find the great truth in Daniel six

527
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,679
of the prayer and what have you.

528
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:52,760
But in Daniel chapter three,

529
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,919
we see that Nebuchadnezzar set up this great statue

530
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:57,320
and he wanted the image and everyone's gonna bow

531
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,640
because he's gonna play the music

532
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,239
and all that's going to happen.

533
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:02,319
and then I won't be able to take the time

534
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:04,279
and go through all of Daniel chapter number three

535
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:05,119
this evening.

536
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,279
If you're not familiar with it,

537
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:08,279
I would encourage you to go back and read it.

538
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,919
But there are three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,

539
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:14,159
and these men did not regard the command of the king.

540
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:16,639
We're not gonna bow.

541
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:21,039
But you're gonna go in a fiery furnace,

542
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,999
but we're not gonna bow.

543
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:24,039
Why?

544
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:27,239
Because God gave us instruction

545
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:30,199
that we're not to have any other gods before him.

546
00:30:30,199 --> 00:30:33,159
We're not to bow to any images or to any idols,

547
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:34,799
and we're just not gonna bow.

548
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,279
But you know what the penalty is?

549
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,679
You're aware of, I'm gonna actually play the music again,

550
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:42,079
and we're gonna give you another opportunity,

551
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,559
really is kinda what Nebuchadnezzar decides to do.

552
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,279
And these three guys, they say, look, you can,

553
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,439
I'm gonna paraphrase, it's not written this way,

554
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:52,679
but basically they say, you can play the music all day,

555
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:53,859
we're not gonna bow.

556
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:57,079
And they say this.

557
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,379
If you're gonna send us in there,

558
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:00,379
I want you to know that our God whom we serve

559
00:31:00,379 --> 00:31:02,419
is able to deliver us.

560
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:06,019
Man, what a great, powerful statement in verse 17.

561
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:09,179
And then he says this in the same verse.

562
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:11,059
Notice, if it be so, our God whom we serve

563
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:13,459
is able to deliver us from the burning, fiery furnace,

564
00:31:13,459 --> 00:31:16,159
and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.

565
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:19,999
But if not, be it known unto thee, O king,

566
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:21,659
that we will not serve thy gods,

567
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:26,099
nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.

568
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:28,139
Our God is able.

569
00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:29,739
I'm thankful that our God is able

570
00:31:29,739 --> 00:31:31,499
to deliver us from anything.

571
00:31:31,499 --> 00:31:32,979
There are times, however, that he chooses

572
00:31:32,979 --> 00:31:36,979
not to deliver us from something, but through something,

573
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:39,879
as is the case here in Daniel chapter three.

574
00:31:39,879 --> 00:31:44,299
It could have been that God delivered these three

575
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:47,199
from ever having to go into the fiery furnace.

576
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:50,119
It could have been.

577
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,779
But you know, we wouldn't be talking about it tonight,

578
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:52,619
probably.

579
00:31:54,499 --> 00:31:56,499
We're talking about it tonight because God delivered them

580
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,379
through the fiery furnace.

581
00:31:59,379 --> 00:32:03,099
And I want you to see what the king of Babylon says.

582
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:05,379
Notice in verse 28, after the end of everything,

583
00:32:05,379 --> 00:32:07,519
and he's astonished, and he says, what's going on here?

584
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,859
We threw three guys in, bound, and now they're loose,

585
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:12,419
and walking around, and there's a fourth,

586
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:13,859
and what is going on?

587
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:18,219
And we find in verse 28, notice what Nebuchadnezzar says.

588
00:32:18,219 --> 00:32:20,219
Then Nebuchadnezzar spake and said,

589
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:25,179
blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,

590
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:29,339
who hath sent his angel and delivered his servants

591
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:33,339
that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word,

592
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:36,339
notice what it says, and yielded their bodies,

593
00:32:36,339 --> 00:32:38,779
that they might not serve nor worship any God

594
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:40,199
except their own God.

595
00:32:41,939 --> 00:32:44,499
In a very real way, they yielded themselves to God.

596
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:48,219
They said, we're not gonna bow.

597
00:32:48,219 --> 00:32:51,139
But you're gonna die, but we're not gonna bow.

598
00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:54,799
I may die, but I'm gonna die pleasing God.

599
00:32:55,859 --> 00:32:57,059
Amen?

600
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,539
I may die, but I'm gonna die pleasing God.

601
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:01,219
I read a book while I was away.

602
00:33:01,219 --> 00:33:02,819
I wrote a book while I was in Panama.

603
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:04,259
I read a book this past week,

604
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:05,979
and I actually finished it up today,

605
00:33:05,979 --> 00:33:07,659
and Patrick Hamilton is a man

606
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:09,299
that I was reading about in this book.

607
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:11,539
It wasn't a book about him specifically,

608
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:12,859
but he was referenced in this book,

609
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:15,119
and quite honestly, I didn't know anything about the man,

610
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,059
but he was burned at the stake in the year 1528

611
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:20,819
at the age of 24 years old.

612
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:23,039
He was in Scotland, and of course,

613
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,319
if you understand anything about the church history

614
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:28,559
at that time, there was much persecution

615
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,279
against any that would preach the gospel

616
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,499
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

617
00:33:32,499 --> 00:33:36,079
that salvation is by grace alone and Christ alone,

618
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:37,959
that the authority of the scriptures

619
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:40,519
and really the rebellion against the state church

620
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,119
and all of that stuff that was going on, of course,

621
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:46,519
in the very time in which you would read

622
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:50,279
of the Reformation taking place in Germany and what have you

623
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,359
but then in Scotland, there was a great stronghold,

624
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:54,439
a lot of persecution that took place,

625
00:33:54,439 --> 00:33:58,639
and this man, Patrick Hamilton at the age of 24 years old

626
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:01,319
was burned at the stake in the year 1528.

627
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:03,319
He actually, for a period of time,

628
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,799
after he got saved, he was preaching the gospel,

629
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,079
and I mean, there's all kinds of persecution issues,

630
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,719
he went to Germany for a period of time,

631
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:12,239
and probably if he had stayed in Germany,

632
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,919
he probably would not have been martyred,

633
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,479
but he believed that he had family back in Scotland

634
00:34:17,479 --> 00:34:19,799
that needed to hear the gospel,

635
00:34:19,799 --> 00:34:23,440
and he believed that that family back in Scotland,

636
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,479
that their only real hope of hearing the gospel

637
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:27,899
would be if he went back and preached the gospel,

638
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,119
but he knew that if he went back and preached the gospel,

639
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,819
that it would mean that he would probably die.

640
00:34:32,819 --> 00:34:34,160
Now think about that this evening.

641
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,279
These are things that we don't really have to consider

642
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:40,639
in America today, amen?

643
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,399
But he believed that that would be happening,

644
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:46,559
so he was given an invitation, according to what I read,

645
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:48,880
he was given an invitation from the university to come back

646
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,519
and to be able to preach the gospel.

647
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:53,380
That was a setup, all right?

648
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,679
Basically, what they wanted him to do

649
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,079
was come back and preach the gospel

650
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,359
so they would have public opportunity to say,

651
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:01,619
we've all heard you publicly,

652
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:03,039
now we're gonna kill you for this

653
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:06,880
because you're violating the state church.

654
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,559
So he knew it was a setup, but he came back anyway,

655
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:12,000
and for five weeks, he preached the gospel.

656
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,459
Many, many people got saved.

657
00:35:13,459 --> 00:35:15,639
In fact, he started sharing the gospel

658
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:17,720
with his family members and went through the whole community,

659
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,519
every family member that he could talk to,

660
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:22,319
other people as well, preached for five weeks.

661
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:23,799
Five weeks, that's it.

662
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:26,459
People got saved.

663
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:27,799
It was burned at the stake.

664
00:35:27,799 --> 00:35:29,839
And here, I'm gonna read to you an exact quote

665
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,099
of what was given, of what I was reading,

666
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:36,979
because when we yield ourselves to God,

667
00:35:36,979 --> 00:35:38,639
God is glorified.

668
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:41,799
Sometimes we don't see the immediate results.

669
00:35:41,799 --> 00:35:43,679
We see it in Daniel 3.

670
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:46,919
Nebuchadnezzar says, there's no God like this God.

671
00:35:46,919 --> 00:35:49,559
We find that here in this case of Patrick Hamilton,

672
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:53,799
there were some immediate results, or fruit, if you will.

673
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:57,259
And here's what the account says,

674
00:35:57,259 --> 00:36:00,839
that his burning, when he was burned at the stake in 1528,

675
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:03,199
had been particularly gruesome.

676
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:05,399
And here's why it was particularly gruesome,

677
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:07,319
because they had green wood,

678
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,199
and the wind was blowing the fire away from his body.

679
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:15,759
I can't even fully comprehend being tied to a stake,

680
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:16,959
being burned at the stake.

681
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:18,919
It's green wood, so it doesn't burn well.

682
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:22,039
And the wind is blowing the fire away from you.

683
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:27,039
So it was hours that he was there,

684
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:31,759
physically in torment, being burned alive

685
00:36:31,759 --> 00:36:33,380
for preaching the gospel.

686
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:36,039
But he yielded himself to Christ.

687
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,720
He yielded himself to Christ.

688
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:41,559
And it says that, as a result,

689
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:44,839
he burnt for six awful hours.

690
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:48,119
How many of you have ever burned yourself on the stove?

691
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,639
What do you do immediately?

692
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,160
I mean, do you hold it there and say,

693
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,079
one 1,000, two 1,000?

694
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,959
No, like you immediately, it's a reaction.

695
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:58,799
Is it not?

696
00:36:58,799 --> 00:36:59,859
Six hours.

697
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:04,239
The account goes on to say that people

698
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:07,119
who had previously heard him preach the gospel

699
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,759
saw in those hours the reality of his faith

700
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,440
and the grace of God.

701
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:19,799
The result was that so many people responded

702
00:37:19,799 --> 00:37:24,160
by trusting Christ that one of the adversaries

703
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,079
that actually called for this man to be burned at the stake,

704
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,639
here's what he said.

705
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:32,039
He said, we should do this no longer.

706
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:32,880
Why?

707
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,519
Because if we continue to burn people at the stake

708
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,679
and others that are onlooking see the grace of God

709
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:43,000
and respond by being saved, it's counterproductive.

710
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,199
We're not getting the results that we want.

711
00:37:46,759 --> 00:37:48,759
But you know what Patrick Hamilton did?

712
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:50,119
He yielded himself to God.

713
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:55,319
Tonight, I don't think any of us are being asked

714
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:57,679
to yield ourselves to God in that same fashion.

715
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:00,440
None of us.

716
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,079
But can I tell you, tomorrow, this evening,

717
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:07,440
there are gonna be things that come up in your life.

718
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:10,199
Are you gonna yield yourself to God?

719
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:15,880
Or are you gonna yield to self, the pressures of others,

720
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,199
whomever it may be that we yield to?

721
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,279
But we see in a real sense in Romans chapter six,

722
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:24,759
yield yourselves unto God.

723
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:30,519
And as we do, God will be glorified.

724
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:32,440
The series here on Wednesday night

725
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,119
is doing what we ought to do.

726
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,200
You do not see in Romans six the word ought.

727
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,760
It's not there.

728
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:44,159
But I think if you'd give me a little bit of liberty,

729
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:46,719
I could easily say this evening,

730
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:51,039
we ought to yield ourselves unto God.

731
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,839
I believe that it's good counsel

732
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,719
that God gives us, valuable counsel.

733
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:01,080
But every one of us, we have a choice.

734
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,919
And you're gonna have a choice tomorrow, multiple times.

735
00:39:03,919 --> 00:39:05,320
Are you gonna yield to God?

736
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,799
Yield to yourself?

737
00:39:06,799 --> 00:39:08,119
Yield to someone else?

738
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:14,080
Oh, that God would help us to yield ourselves to him

739
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,359
so that he would receive all the honor and the glory,

740
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:20,520
which is due unto his wonderful name.

741
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,959
Because we serve a great God and he's worthy of it.

742
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:23,799
He's worthy of it.

743
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:24,640
Let's pray.

744
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,440
Father, we love you.

745
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,679
We thank you for loving us.

746
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:31,159
Thank you for your word, the truth that's contained therein.

747
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:33,479
And I pray, Lord, that you'd help me.

748
00:39:33,479 --> 00:39:35,239
I pray that you'd help each of us, Lord,

749
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:38,719
to yield ourselves to you.

750
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:42,839
Lord, that we would set our affection on things above,

751
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,080
not on things of the earth.

752
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:49,479
God, we'd understand that we're dead to sin,

753
00:39:49,479 --> 00:39:51,279
but alive unto you.

754
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:53,039
Thank you for saving us.

755
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,159
We pray, God, that you'd use us,

756
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,520
that we might bring honor and glory to thy name.

757
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,440
Bless our time of prayer. We do thank you for the privilege. I pray that you'd be honored

758
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,640
and glorified for it's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
