00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.199
Bible, aren't you? And what a blessing to have the Word of God, to know the truth that God has provided us with in His Word and the

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:14.239
instruction that He's given to us. In Romans chapter number 6, we'll jump in here in just a moment, but I want you to understand the

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:22.440
Christian life is a journey. And how many of you have realized that? It's a journey walking with the Lord. Amen. In fact, in John 15, the

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:30.440
Lord Jesus Christ instructs His followers to abide in Him. We find in the book of Galatians that we, as the people of God, are

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:38.959
instructed to walk in the Spirit. We find that we are reminded in the same text of Scripture that the Spirit and the flesh are

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:47.759
contrary the one to the other. And I know that each of us, if you've been saved for any period of time, you have learned that the Spirit

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:55.560
and the flesh are at enmity one with the other. They are contrary one to the other. The Bible talks about, in Ephesians chapter number 2,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:05.199
about the lust of the flesh or the desires of the flesh. And the reality is that when you got saved, your flesh was not eradicated and there

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:13.959
are still desires of the flesh, but we are to walk in the Spirit, the Bible says, and we should not fulfill the desires of the flesh. And so

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:21.839
what a great promise that God gives us. We find in the book of Ephesians, as well as the book of Colossians, that we, as the people of God,

00:01:21.839 --> 00:01:32.400
are instructed to put on the new and to put off the old. And we find in our text this evening in Romans chapter number 6, we're going to look at

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:43.080
verses 1 through 19 this evening. And as we look at this text of Scripture, you're going to find the word yield used several times. And the word

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:52.400
yield is an important word. We could ask ourselves this question tonight, what does it mean to yield? How many of you drive on the roads around here

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:03.519
and you find very commonly that people do not know what the yield sign means? And you see that all the time, they don't understand what yield means.

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:11.520
And we find that sometimes we go through the Christian life, we look here in Romans chapter 6 and we see the use of this word, we may not fully

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:23.839
understand what it means to yield. Let me ask this question, is it a natural thing to yield? It's not natural. It's not natural. The word yield means to

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:34.520
submit, to give way, or to give place. That's what it means. Now we're instructed in the text of Scripture, I've titled the message this evening from

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:47.559
verse number 13, that we're to yield ourselves unto God. Yield yourselves unto God. I ask the question, is it natural to yield? And honestly this evening, the

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:55.520
subject, the thought of yielding, goes against the flesh. Not only does it go against the flesh, but it goes against the culture that we live in. We live in a

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:07.199
culture that feeds the desires of the flesh. We live in a culture, we live in a society that tells you, that tells me, that tells our young people, be what you want to be.

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:18.800
Do what you want to do. Do what feels good. If it pleases you, then do it. Is that not the society, the culture that we live in? And we find this evening that as the

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:32.639
people of God, as saved individuals, we come to Romans chapter number 6, and we find this truth that we are to yield ourselves unto God. That we're not to be the master of my own life.

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:44.880
My flesh, your flesh, wants to rule. Wants to sit on the throne of your heart, of your life. But we find that we have a Savior. We have a good Savior, a good master, a good Lord, and He

00:03:44.880 --> 00:04:00.240
deserves to have preeminence in our lives. He deserves to have that place of ownership, and that we would yield to Him. Notice in the text of Scripture, if you're taking notes, number 1 this evening, and it's going to be verses 1 through 14.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:12.000
I'm going to get through it kind of quickly this evening, but I want you to notice the counsel. Eventually we'll get through verse 19, but on this first thought this evening, I want you to notice the counsel that is given.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:22.239
And we see that in verses 1 through 14. Notice the way the Bible begins in verse number 1, what shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?

00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:35.359
Now he's referring back, remember the chapter divisions are added for the ease of our finding passages of Scripture. The chapter divisions, the verse divisions, they were not in the originals.

00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:45.760
It's not how they were given, but they were provided to us. Could you imagine tonight if we all tried to get to Romans chapter number 6 without having chapter and verse divisions? It'd be quite difficult.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:05:01.519
And so we're thankful for them, but we notice at the end of chapter 5, in verse number 20, notice what the Bible says, moreover the law entered that the offense might abound, but where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:14.079
Aren't you thankful for that truth? Someone said this, a songwriter said, I don't know what a sinner you are, but I know what a savior he is. And what a joy to know the amazing grace of our God.

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:24.079
It says in verse 21, that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:34.000
So then he's going to answer a question that he's given here in verse number 1 of chapter 6, what shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:48.559
God forbid, that's the answer in verse number 2. See, there are some that don't understand the grace of God. In fact, the false teachers that are creeping in according to the book of Jude, they turn the grace of God into lasciviousness.

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:58.079
And that word means unbridled lust. Do what you want, be what you want, because the grace of God allows for that. That's not what the grace of God allows for.

00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:10.640
According to Titus chapter number 2, the grace of God hath appeared to all men, teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust, we should live godly and soberly and righteously in this present world.

00:06:10.799 --> 00:06:17.600
And so that's what the grace of God teaches us, but we find that they turn the grace of God into lasciviousness.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:32.160
So Paul says, no, that's not the idea. Though we are rejoicing the fact that where sin did abound, that grace did abound much more, we rejoice in that, but we don't continue in sin that grace may abound.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.480
God forbid, notice verse 2, how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein?

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:48.239
Notice he's beginning to reveal to us and help us to understand our position in Christ and who we are and understanding that he says in verse 3,

00:06:48.239 --> 00:07:06.480
We are buried with him by baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:15.119
We use this verse of scripture every time I baptize someone I say, are you sure of heaven, have you trusted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:23.600
And if they say yes I have, and by the way I've already asked them before I get them into the water to make sure, I've already had that conversation, but I say,

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:33.839
based upon your profession of faith, I now baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, buried in the likeness of his death, raised to walk in newness of life.

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:39.359
The Bible says, if any man be in Christ, he's a new creature, old things are passed away, behold, all things are become new.

00:07:39.359 --> 00:07:46.640
And we find here that he's telling these believers about the truth of the new life in Christ in verse 5,

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:53.440
for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection, knowing this.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.600
Notice what he wants us to know in verse 6, this is something that is to be known.

00:07:57.679 --> 00:08:03.200
Remember, as we study the Bible, God does not want his people to be ignorant.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:17.200
He wants us to be informed, he wants us to know things, and he says, knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that's Christ, the picture there,

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:31.359
that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin, for he that is dead is freed from sin.

00:08:31.359 --> 00:08:40.880
Now, if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him, and so I'm to be dead to sin, but alive unto God.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:49.200
It's amazing as we look here, remember the apostle Paul said, I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I, right?

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:58.960
Galatians 2.20, he's giving that truth, he's really, in one verse of scripture in Galatians 2, he's summarizing all that he's giving here in Romans 6.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:05.359
And we find in verse number 8, now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him,

00:09:05.359 --> 00:09:13.039
knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him.

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:20.080
Aren't you thankful for that? He conquered sin, death, and the grave, and he is alive forevermore.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:27.679
Revelation says, I am he that was dead, but I'm alive forevermore. Hallelujah, we serve a risen savior.

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:33.599
Verse 10, for in that he died, he died unto sin, what does it say? Once.

00:09:33.599 --> 00:09:41.039
Remember what Hebrews 10 said? For this man after he offered one sacrifice for sin forever, he sat down.

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:46.799
Why? The work was finished, he said, it is done, it is finished, it's complete. Hallelujah.

00:09:46.799 --> 00:09:50.799
We find that it continues and says, but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:57.599
Now notice as we get into the council here, the apostle Paul in these first 10 verses is helping the believers,

00:09:57.599 --> 00:10:00.000
helping these that he's writing to, helping them.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.359
as we have the Bible preserved for us

00:10:03.359 --> 00:10:05.280
to understand our position.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.880
And the counsel is clear.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.600
He says this in verse 11,

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.359
likewise reckon ye also yourselves

00:10:12.359 --> 00:10:15.159
to be dead indeed unto sin,

00:10:15.159 --> 00:10:20.159
but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:24.239
Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body

00:10:24.239 --> 00:10:27.340
that you should obey it in the lust thereof.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.760
And here's the counsel, verse 13,

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.899
neither yield ye your members

00:10:31.899 --> 00:10:35.060
as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin,

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.979
but yield yourselves unto God

00:10:38.979 --> 00:10:41.159
as those that are alive from the dead

00:10:41.159 --> 00:10:44.720
and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God,

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.680
for sin shall not have dominion over you,

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.139
for you're not under the law, but under grace.

00:10:51.139 --> 00:10:53.720
These are some wonderful verses of scripture.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.599
God gives us this counsel in verse number 13

00:10:56.599 --> 00:10:59.520
that we're to yield ourselves unto God.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.619
He tells us in verse 14

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:04.339
that sin shall not have dominion over you.

00:11:04.339 --> 00:11:08.419
You know that when you were lost, you were bound by sin.

00:11:08.419 --> 00:11:10.300
You're bound by sin.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.639
But we find that when we trust that Christ is our savior,

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:17.819
not only were we delivered from the penalty of sin,

00:11:17.819 --> 00:11:18.980
which is death,

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.019
but we were delivered from the power of sin.

00:11:22.019 --> 00:11:25.779
He says here, for sin shall not have dominion over you.

00:11:25.779 --> 00:11:27.580
We were bound by sin.

00:11:27.839 --> 00:11:31.519
We were under the dominion of sin,

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:34.480
but in Christ, we are dead to sin.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.000
We're alive unto God.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.379
We find that we've been delivered from the penalty

00:11:39.379 --> 00:11:41.319
and from the power of sin.

00:11:41.319 --> 00:11:42.519
We find the truth, though,

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:45.519
that we've not yet been delivered from the presence of sin.

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:48.559
Sin is still here.

00:11:48.559 --> 00:11:49.720
You sin today.

00:11:52.319 --> 00:11:53.540
Amen?

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.379
We sin.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:00.279
But he says here that sin shall not have dominion over you.

00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:03.879
What a great promise that God has given to us,

00:12:03.879 --> 00:12:06.680
that he has given us the victory.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.959
But thanks be to God,

00:12:07.959 --> 00:12:11.440
which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.720
And so we find the counsel is given,

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.800
I believe this evening, that the counsel is clear.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.279
He tells us that as we would understand our position

00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:22.479
in Christ, that what we should do

00:12:22.479 --> 00:12:24.360
is yield ourselves unto God.

00:12:25.179 --> 00:12:26.000
Notice he says in verse 13,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.860
if you consider the entirety of the counsel,

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.699
neither yield ye your members

00:12:29.699 --> 00:12:32.419
as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin,

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:34.619
but yield yourselves unto God

00:12:34.619 --> 00:12:37.380
as those that are alive from the dead

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:41.580
and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.820
And so that's counsel, that's instruction,

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.740
that's what we are instructed to do.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.779
And so we find that we notice the counsel,

00:12:48.779 --> 00:12:51.179
but as we continue through the text of Scripture

00:12:51.179 --> 00:12:53.339
in verses 15 and 16, number two,

00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:55.559
I want you to notice the choice.

00:12:55.559 --> 00:12:57.039
Notice the choice.

00:12:57.039 --> 00:13:02.039
You know, God has given to his creation, humanity, free will.

00:13:04.199 --> 00:13:06.839
There's a lot of confusion about free will.

00:13:06.839 --> 00:13:08.639
And I do not believe,

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:10.639
in fact, I had a conversation with somebody today,

00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:14.520
I believe 100% in my mind,

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.679
it makes total sense that God is fully sovereign

00:13:18.679 --> 00:13:20.059
and he knows all things

00:13:20.059 --> 00:13:22.160
and he knows the end from the beginning

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.220
and he has foreknowledge, he has all knowledge,

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.740
he is supreme, he is sovereign, he is God.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.500
And at the same time, he gave man free will.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:36.020
I believe that those two things can be in perfect harmony.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:36.860
Why?

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.220
Because God made it so.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:43.860
And so God made it so and he gave us that free will.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.740
And you think about the way that he gives us free will,

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.059
he provides us, he provides you and me

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.440
and these that are originally receiving this letter

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.899
from Paul and every child of God

00:13:55.899 --> 00:13:57.880
that would read the book of Romans,

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:02.880
they, God gives to them, gives to us valuable counsel.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.220
But he doesn't make us do it.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.679
He gives you a choice.

00:14:09.679 --> 00:14:10.940
He gives me a choice.

00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:15.179
You know, someone, I've been asked the question many times

00:14:15.179 --> 00:14:18.700
over the years and not that I'm an expert,

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.459
I've only pastored now for a little over 13 years,

00:14:21.459 --> 00:14:23.359
it's not that long of a time,

00:14:23.359 --> 00:14:25.000
but oftentimes I will be asked,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.959
in fact, we're in Panama, I was asked the question

00:14:26.959 --> 00:14:29.000
by a couple of the young men.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.720
They said, what's the hardest thing about pastoring?

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.279
And there's a lot of hard things about pastoring.

00:14:34.279 --> 00:14:39.279
There's the list is various and so many different things,

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.079
but one of the hardest things

00:14:42.079 --> 00:14:44.500
is watching people make bad decisions.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.799
You know what a hard thing as a parent

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.380
is watching a child make a bad decision.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.179
It's hard as a parent.

00:14:52.179 --> 00:14:55.299
If you've had children that have made bad decisions

00:14:55.299 --> 00:14:59.179
and you gave them the counsel, you laid out for them,

00:14:59.179 --> 00:15:02.700
but you could not make the decision for them

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:06.660
and you watch them make a bad choice, a bad decision,

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.820
that's hard.

00:15:09.339 --> 00:15:12.739
And at some point, there's nothing you can do about it.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:17.140
There's absolutely nothing you can do about it.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.660
Listen, God gives us free will.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.119
As a pastor, I have the responsibility

00:15:22.119 --> 00:15:23.839
of preaching the whole counsel of God,

00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:25.380
giving the truth of God's word,

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.799
but I can't make anybody do anything.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:29.880
Amen?

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.880
It's a choice of the individual.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.380
And we find this evening

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.660
that as we look at this passage of Scripture,

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.839
that God provides us with this valuable counsel,

00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:42.760
but he does not force us to heed it.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.760
I want you to consider, hold your place here,

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.500
we'll be right back into the book of Romans,

00:15:46.839 --> 00:15:49.640
but look over at 2 Peter chapter one, just for a moment,

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.119
and as you're turning to 2 Peter chapter number one,

00:15:52.119 --> 00:15:54.359
I wanna read a verse of Scripture to you there,

00:15:54.359 --> 00:15:56.920
but I also, I don't want you to turn to Psalm 19,

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.000
if you want, you can if you're quick,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.760
but Psalm 19, I wanna read a couple of verses to you there

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.320
as we get back over to 2 Peter chapter one

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.600
here in just a moment,

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.559
but I want you to see that in Psalm 19,

00:16:09.559 --> 00:16:11.160
I don't have time to read all of it,

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.480
but it begins in verse seven,

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.779
speaking about the law of the Lord being perfect

00:16:14.799 --> 00:16:16.980
and gives all of these attributes

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.799
and various workings of God's word and how it's effective.

00:16:21.799 --> 00:16:23.339
In verse number 11, it says,

00:16:23.339 --> 00:16:27.339
"'Moreover, by them is thy servant warned,

00:16:28.179 --> 00:16:32.459
and in keeping of them, there is great reward.'"

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.980
You can warn people, but you can't force people.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.399
Do we agree with that tonight?

00:16:39.399 --> 00:16:42.739
You can warn them, but you can't force them.

00:16:42.739 --> 00:16:44.440
And notice in 2 Peter chapter one,

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.440
Peter's writing, and in this particular text of scripture,

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.799
beginning in verse 16, he's writing about

00:16:49.799 --> 00:16:52.040
being on the Mount of Transfiguration.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.140
I mean, what an amazing opportunity

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.640
that Peter, James, and John had

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.600
to be there on the Mount of Transfiguration.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.920
I can't even fully grasp how amazing that must have been,

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.119
but we find that he mentions that in verse 16,

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:07.399
and we see it at the end of the verse,

00:17:07.399 --> 00:17:09.959
he says, but we're eyewitnesses of his majesty,

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:11.380
and he goes through and he's talking about

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.579
the word of God that we have here,

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:17.019
that no prophecy came, not by the will of man,

00:17:17.019 --> 00:17:19.619
but holy men of God spake, in verse 21,

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:21.140
as they were moved by the Holy Ghost,

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.579
but I wanna draw your attention to verse 19.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:25.220
Notice what Peter says,

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.779
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:30.779
he says, we have also a more sure word of prophecy.

00:17:30.779 --> 00:17:35.100
Now, Peter, God, of course, is the author of scripture,

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.299
and God precedes the statement of us

00:17:38.299 --> 00:17:40.579
having a more sure word of prophecy

00:17:40.579 --> 00:17:44.959
by revealing that Peter heard the voice of God

00:17:44.959 --> 00:17:46.980
on the Mount of Transfiguration,

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.040
and then Peter says, but we have,

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.059
we have also a more sure word of prophecy,

00:17:52.059 --> 00:17:53.940
and then notice the center of this verse,

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:58.940
it says, whereunto ye do well, that ye take heed,

00:17:59.779 --> 00:18:01.619
and then notice how he illustrates

00:18:01.619 --> 00:18:03.179
what it means to take heed,

00:18:03.179 --> 00:18:06.459
as unto a light that shineth in a dark place

00:18:06.459 --> 00:18:11.179
until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts.

00:18:11.179 --> 00:18:13.779
You know, this evening, if we were to lose power,

00:18:13.779 --> 00:18:15.660
and if the emergency lights,

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.339
if we were in here for any length of time,

00:18:18.339 --> 00:18:22.019
and the battery backup of the emergency lights failed,

00:18:22.019 --> 00:18:24.100
and it was completely dark in here,

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:25.420
the shades were pulled down,

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.779
and it was stormy, and it was dark,

00:18:27.779 --> 00:18:32.580
and we did not have any bearing of our orientation,

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.840
I guarantee you this evening,

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.799
that if in the midst of that great darkness,

00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:39.719
if someone turned on a light,

00:18:39.719 --> 00:18:42.679
that your attention would go to the light.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.719
So it would happen.

00:18:44.719 --> 00:18:47.200
Without you thinking about it,

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.080
you immediately would look to the light,

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.119
and so Peter says that you do well,

00:18:51.119 --> 00:18:53.440
that you take heed thereunto.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.119
It is in our best interest,

00:18:55.119 --> 00:18:58.400
and so here, back in Romans chapter number six,

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.880
when we notice the choice that counsel is given,

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.940
it's valuable counsel,

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.900
but we find that there's a choice that has to be made,

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.419
and so then notice in verse 15,

00:19:07.419 --> 00:19:08.380
what then?

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.859
Shall we sin because we are not under the law,

00:19:10.859 --> 00:19:11.700
but under grace?

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.299
God forbid.

00:19:13.299 --> 00:19:14.340
Verse 16.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:18.619
Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants

00:19:18.619 --> 00:19:22.580
to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey,

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:23.940
whether of sin unto death,

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.219
or of obedience unto righteousness.

00:19:26.219 --> 00:19:28.500
So do you see the choice in verse 15?

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.619
In verse 13, he says neither yield ye,

00:19:31.619 --> 00:19:33.500
and then he says, but yield yourselves.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.739
He's giving them counsel.

00:19:34.739 --> 00:19:36.580
He's telling them what to do,

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.700
but in verse 16, he's saying,

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.979
know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants

00:19:41.979 --> 00:19:42.820
to obey.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.979
This is the choice that every believer has to make.

00:19:45.979 --> 00:19:48.059
Are we gonna yield ourselves to God?

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.219
By the way, let me say this.

00:19:51.219 --> 00:19:53.099
As we note in verse 15 and 16,

00:19:53.099 --> 00:19:55.219
and we consider the choice that is before

00:19:55.219 --> 00:19:56.900
every child of God,

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.820
the principle of yielding to God is a,

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.980
It's a recurring decision.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.880
You know, when you got saved,

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.320
it was a moment in time,

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.320
and you were born again.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.160
You're not being born again.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.500
Born again is not a process.

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.800
Salvation is the miracle of a moment.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.680
Sanctification, practical sanctification,

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.440
not positional sanctification,

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.200
but practical sanctification,

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.400
if I can make that distinction this evening,

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.580
the practical aspect of sanctification

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.700
is really the process of a lifetime.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.420
It's not the miracle of a moment,

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.180
it's the process of a lifetime.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:44.740
It's that we continually yield ourselves unto God,

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.260
moment by moment, day by day.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.460
In fact, I said that yielding to God

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.880
is a recurring decision,

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.020
but you understand that in your life and in my life,

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:55.960
that we might have to yield to God

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:59.280
multiple times in a single day.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.120
Why?

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.440
Because decisions are going to be put before us,

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.000
and there's going to be an opportunity

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.160
for you to yield to yourself

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.120
to what you want to do,

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.040
or to yield to God.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:17.520
And here the Bible says that there's a choice.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.560
I believe that it's clear the choice

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.060
that God would want his children to make.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.760
I believe that it's clear

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.840
that Paul made it abundantly clear

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.060
of the choice that he, as a spiritual leader,

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.640
would like for these readers,

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.640
these recipients of this letter,

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.700
the choice for them to make.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.200
But at the end of the day,

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.560
God's given us a free will,

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.120
and the choice is yours.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:49.400
You know what Moses, God,

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.260
says to the people in Moses writes?

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.160
He says, you're going to make a choice.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.440
Deuteronomy 11.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.040
I set before you a blessing and a curse.

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.280
Is that not what God said in Deuteronomy 11?

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.840
We read it, we see it, we understand it.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.920
What about Joshua, in Joshua chapter 24?

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.960
Choose you this day whom ye will serve.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.400
Is that not what it says?

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.780
But as for me and my house,

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.300
we will serve the Lord.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.860
See, Joshua said, I've made a choice,

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:21.520
but I can't make the choice for you.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:23.760
I'm going to make the choice,

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.440
and I'm going to lay out the reason

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.920
that you ought to make the same choice that I'm making,

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.600
and I believe if you read Joshua 24,

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.320
that's clear, that Joshua says,

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.300
look, let me help you understand

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.200
why you should make the same choice that I'm making.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.900
You know what all the people said?

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.160
We're going to serve God.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.240
You read it, that's what they say.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.480
We're going to serve God.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.440
And so we find this evening there's a choice,

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.920
but that choice is just, it's not a one and done.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.200
Like salvation, you write down the date

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.400
that you got saved, and man, you can rejoice

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.600
in your spiritual birthday,

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.240
and you can know that you're born again,

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.480
but with regard to yielding to Christ

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.600
multiple times in a day,

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.080
you may have to make that decision.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.000
Nope, I'm going to yield to God.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.680
I'm bought with a price.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.340
I belong to Him.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.080
Notice with me as we conclude

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.560
looking at verses 17 through 19,

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.400
we're going to look at a couple of other,

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.400
just one other passage quickly,

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.420
but notice the consequences of this choice.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.080
The consequences, we find that there's a choice to be made,

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.440
but the consequences are given to us.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.680
It says, but God be thanked.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.080
Notice what it says in verse 17,

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.600
that ye were the servants of sin,

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.960
but ye have obeyed from the heart

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.560
that form of doctrine which was delivered you.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.320
Isn't that exciting that we were,

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.360
but we are not any longer?

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.920
He says it in past tense.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.960
Ye were the servants of sin.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.960
I was, you were, I was, everyone.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.520
Listen, Ephesians chapter two makes it abundantly clear

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:01.100
that we all were in that same situation.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.640
It was not something that was unique to you

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.880
or to some other person.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.760
No, he says that we all had our conversation

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.440
in times past in the lust of our flesh,

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.980
fulfilling the desires of the flesh and the mind,

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.760
and were by nature the children of wrath even as others.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.040
That was our lot, that was our situation.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.800
Ephesians chapter two, and you look there in that passage

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.700
and you see the truth that is given to us

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:27.980
in verse number three.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:31.000
But God, verse number four, who is rich in mercy,

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.839
praise the Lord, for by grace are you saved through faith.

00:24:34.839 --> 00:24:36.920
Verse number eight, right?

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.100
What a joy to understand this truth of salvation,

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.720
but the choice that we make

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:46.360
that we would yield ourselves unto God.

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.480
He says that you were the servants of sin,

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.380
but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.500
which was delivered to you.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.320
Understand with me tonight that the truth of salvation

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.160
is so much more than just escaping hell.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.279
Did you catch that tonight?

00:25:02.279 --> 00:25:03.279
It's important.

00:25:03.279 --> 00:25:04.200
Why is it important?

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.679
Because some people have this idea that salvation,

00:25:08.679 --> 00:25:11.480
the only real reason anyone needs to be saved

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.119
is so they would escape like a fire, escape hell.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.080
Though that is true that we would,

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.779
if you're saved by the grace of God,

00:25:17.779 --> 00:25:21.020
you're not gonna go to the lake of fire, hallelujah.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.200
But he didn't save us so that we could live for ourselves.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.839
He didn't save us so that we could walk in sin

00:25:26.839 --> 00:25:30.679
and continue to fulfill the lust

00:25:30.679 --> 00:25:31.920
and the desires of the flesh.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.820
No, he saved us so that we might be like Christ.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.480
If you read Romans chapter eight in verse number 29,

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.000
he predestined us to be conformed

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.200
to the image of his dear son.

00:25:45.559 --> 00:25:48.300
Christ in me, the hope of glory.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.839
That's the idea.

00:25:50.839 --> 00:25:52.779
And so salvation is not just,

00:25:52.779 --> 00:25:55.119
I had a man tell me, this was before I even got saved.

00:25:55.119 --> 00:25:57.500
I was about 13 years old.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.800
My parents had gotten saved.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.240
We're at the church, Grace Baptist Church

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.880
in Jacksonville, North Carolina.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.240
And there was this young Marine,

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.700
actually a bunch of young Marines that were there.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.119
They were talking about being saved.

00:26:07.119 --> 00:26:11.080
And this one guy, he was talking about all kinds of sin

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.440
and wickedness, he was talking, he was just bad talking.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.520
He's at church, he's right out in the parking lot.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.820
I was like a 13 year old kid

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.160
and I was there standing there with him.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.080
And this guy was talking about all kinds of immorality.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:24.000
And thankfully there were some other young Marines

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.559
that were saved by the grace of God

00:26:25.559 --> 00:26:27.160
and called him out on it and said,

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.100
hey, hey, hey, why are you talking about that stuff?

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.600
Why are you doing that kind of stuff?

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.440
And you know what he said?

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.399
I remember it just like it was yesterday.

00:26:34.399 --> 00:26:36.920
He said, listen, as long as I'm going to heaven,

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.399
I don't really care, I'm just gonna do what I wanna do.

00:26:39.399 --> 00:26:40.240
You know what I'd say?

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.760
I'd question whether that man's really saved.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.279
You know why I'd question if he's really saved?

00:26:44.279 --> 00:26:45.119
Because the Bible says,

00:26:45.119 --> 00:26:47.559
if any man be in Christ, he's a new creature.

00:26:47.559 --> 00:26:48.540
All things are passed away,

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:49.679
behold, all things will become new.

00:26:49.679 --> 00:26:52.360
It doesn't mean that we don't have the desires of the flesh

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.000
but it means that the Holy Spirit of God is living in us.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.399
And it means that God said,

00:26:56.399 --> 00:26:59.800
for whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.160
Amen, is that what your Bible says?

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.839
Well, my Bible says he corrects us,

00:27:02.839 --> 00:27:05.559
he chastens us because he loves us.

00:27:05.559 --> 00:27:07.480
And so we're not what we used to be.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.480
Praise the Lord for that.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.520
Notice in verse 18, back in Romans six,

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.040
being then made free from sin,

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.200
you became the servants of righteousness.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.679
By the way, I'd rather be a servant of righteousness

00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:22.559
than a servant of sin, amen.

00:27:22.559 --> 00:27:25.080
You see that contrast between verse 17 and 18.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.000
I would much rather be a servant of righteousness

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.480
than a servant of sin.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.420
And verse 19 says this,

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.600
I speak after the manner of men

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.839
because of the infirmity of your flesh.

00:27:37.839 --> 00:27:40.640
For as you have yielded your member servants

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.119
to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity,

00:27:44.119 --> 00:27:48.559
even so now yield your member servants

00:27:48.559 --> 00:27:52.040
to righteousness unto holiness.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.880
I believe in verse 19, it really goes with the first point

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.760
this evening of the counsel that is given to us.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:01.160
And Paul is saying, listen, you have in the past,

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.399
before you got saved,

00:28:02.399 --> 00:28:05.440
you yielded your member servants of uncleanness

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.399
unto iniquity unto iniquity.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.480
But now that you're saved,

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.839
now yield your member servants

00:28:11.839 --> 00:28:15.160
to righteousness unto holiness.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.960
In verse 13, however, we do see that the Bible says,

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.160
neither yield ye your members

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.760
as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.240
So we still can yield to the wrong thing.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.800
It's not an automatic.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.820
You can still yield to yourself,

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.200
you can still yield to sin,

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.260
you can still yield to unrighteousness,

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:39.160
but the counsel, the compelling truth of Romans six

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.619
is yield yourselves unto God.

00:28:42.619 --> 00:28:46.160
And you know when we do that, God is glorified.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.000
God is glorified.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.380
That's the ultimate consequence is that God is glorified.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.220
Why?

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.700
Because we're yielding ourselves to him.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.739
What does it mean to yield?

00:28:53.739 --> 00:28:56.780
Again, the word means to submit, to give place

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:57.780
or to give way.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:01.700
And we're acknowledging that he is my Lord and my master,

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:05.380
that he is the one that is to be receiving the honor

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:07.979
and the glory and the praise, and it's all about him.

00:29:07.979 --> 00:29:10.520
And I'm yielding to him.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.940
My life, Lord, is yours to control.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:14.580
It's what the songwriter said.

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.580
And what a great song.

00:29:17.539 --> 00:29:19.739
Living for Jesus, we sing the hymn.

00:29:19.739 --> 00:29:21.020
What a great hymn.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.859
And we find this evening that here,

00:29:24.859 --> 00:29:26.220
when we come to the place

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.320
that we're yielding ourselves to God,

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.679
that we understand that God is going

00:29:30.679 --> 00:29:32.880
to receive the honor and the glory.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.239
We sang this evening, Dare to be a Daniel.

00:29:36.239 --> 00:29:37.479
Dare to be a Daniel.

00:29:37.479 --> 00:29:39.280
I want you to turn over to Daniel chapter three,

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.119
if you will.

00:29:40.119 --> 00:29:41.440
It's not really about Daniel.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:46.440
It's about his three friends in Daniel chapter number three.

00:29:46.679 --> 00:29:49.960
Daniel, of course, we find the great truth in Daniel six

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.679
of the prayer and what have you.

00:29:51.679 --> 00:29:52.760
But in Daniel chapter three,

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.919
we see that Nebuchadnezzar set up this great statue

00:29:54.919 --> 00:29:57.320
and he wanted the image and everyone's gonna bow

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.640
because he's gonna play the music

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.239
and all that's going to happen.

00:30:00.239 --> 00:30:02.319
and then I won't be able to take the time

00:30:02.319 --> 00:30:04.279
and go through all of Daniel chapter number three

00:30:04.279 --> 00:30:05.119
this evening.

00:30:05.119 --> 00:30:06.279
If you're not familiar with it,

00:30:06.279 --> 00:30:08.279
I would encourage you to go back and read it.

00:30:08.279 --> 00:30:10.919
But there are three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,

00:30:10.919 --> 00:30:14.159
and these men did not regard the command of the king.

00:30:15.539 --> 00:30:16.639
We're not gonna bow.

00:30:18.819 --> 00:30:21.039
But you're gonna go in a fiery furnace,

00:30:21.039 --> 00:30:22.999
but we're not gonna bow.

00:30:22.999 --> 00:30:24.039
Why?

00:30:24.039 --> 00:30:27.239
Because God gave us instruction

00:30:27.239 --> 00:30:30.199
that we're not to have any other gods before him.

00:30:30.199 --> 00:30:33.159
We're not to bow to any images or to any idols,

00:30:33.159 --> 00:30:34.799
and we're just not gonna bow.

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:38.279
But you know what the penalty is?

00:30:38.279 --> 00:30:40.679
You're aware of, I'm gonna actually play the music again,

00:30:40.679 --> 00:30:42.079
and we're gonna give you another opportunity,

00:30:42.079 --> 00:30:44.559
really is kinda what Nebuchadnezzar decides to do.

00:30:44.559 --> 00:30:48.279
And these three guys, they say, look, you can,

00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:50.439
I'm gonna paraphrase, it's not written this way,

00:30:50.439 --> 00:30:52.679
but basically they say, you can play the music all day,

00:30:52.679 --> 00:30:53.859
we're not gonna bow.

00:30:55.399 --> 00:30:57.079
And they say this.

00:30:57.079 --> 00:30:58.379
If you're gonna send us in there,

00:30:58.379 --> 00:31:00.379
I want you to know that our God whom we serve

00:31:00.379 --> 00:31:02.419
is able to deliver us.

00:31:02.419 --> 00:31:06.019
Man, what a great, powerful statement in verse 17.

00:31:06.019 --> 00:31:09.179
And then he says this in the same verse.

00:31:09.179 --> 00:31:11.059
Notice, if it be so, our God whom we serve

00:31:11.059 --> 00:31:13.459
is able to deliver us from the burning, fiery furnace,

00:31:13.459 --> 00:31:16.159
and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.

00:31:18.019 --> 00:31:19.999
But if not, be it known unto thee, O king,

00:31:19.999 --> 00:31:21.659
that we will not serve thy gods,

00:31:21.659 --> 00:31:26.099
nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.

00:31:26.099 --> 00:31:28.139
Our God is able.

00:31:28.899 --> 00:31:29.739
I'm thankful that our God is able

00:31:29.739 --> 00:31:31.499
to deliver us from anything.

00:31:31.499 --> 00:31:32.979
There are times, however, that he chooses

00:31:32.979 --> 00:31:36.979
not to deliver us from something, but through something,

00:31:36.979 --> 00:31:39.879
as is the case here in Daniel chapter three.

00:31:39.879 --> 00:31:44.299
It could have been that God delivered these three

00:31:44.299 --> 00:31:47.199
from ever having to go into the fiery furnace.

00:31:48.579 --> 00:31:50.119
It could have been.

00:31:50.119 --> 00:31:51.779
But you know, we wouldn't be talking about it tonight,

00:31:51.779 --> 00:31:52.619
probably.

00:31:54.499 --> 00:31:56.499
We're talking about it tonight because God delivered them

00:31:56.539 --> 00:31:59.379
through the fiery furnace.

00:31:59.379 --> 00:32:03.099
And I want you to see what the king of Babylon says.

00:32:03.099 --> 00:32:05.379
Notice in verse 28, after the end of everything,

00:32:05.379 --> 00:32:07.519
and he's astonished, and he says, what's going on here?

00:32:07.519 --> 00:32:10.859
We threw three guys in, bound, and now they're loose,

00:32:10.859 --> 00:32:12.419
and walking around, and there's a fourth,

00:32:12.419 --> 00:32:13.859
and what is going on?

00:32:13.859 --> 00:32:18.219
And we find in verse 28, notice what Nebuchadnezzar says.

00:32:18.219 --> 00:32:20.219
Then Nebuchadnezzar spake and said,

00:32:21.339 --> 00:32:25.179
blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,

00:32:25.179 --> 00:32:29.339
who hath sent his angel and delivered his servants

00:32:29.339 --> 00:32:33.339
that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word,

00:32:33.339 --> 00:32:36.339
notice what it says, and yielded their bodies,

00:32:36.339 --> 00:32:38.779
that they might not serve nor worship any God

00:32:38.779 --> 00:32:40.199
except their own God.

00:32:41.939 --> 00:32:44.499
In a very real way, they yielded themselves to God.

00:32:46.419 --> 00:32:48.219
They said, we're not gonna bow.

00:32:48.219 --> 00:32:51.139
But you're gonna die, but we're not gonna bow.

00:32:51.139 --> 00:32:54.799
I may die, but I'm gonna die pleasing God.

00:32:55.859 --> 00:32:57.059
Amen?

00:32:57.059 --> 00:32:59.539
I may die, but I'm gonna die pleasing God.

00:32:59.539 --> 00:33:01.219
I read a book while I was away.

00:33:01.219 --> 00:33:02.819
I wrote a book while I was in Panama.

00:33:02.819 --> 00:33:04.259
I read a book this past week,

00:33:04.259 --> 00:33:05.979
and I actually finished it up today,

00:33:05.979 --> 00:33:07.659
and Patrick Hamilton is a man

00:33:07.659 --> 00:33:09.299
that I was reading about in this book.

00:33:09.299 --> 00:33:11.539
It wasn't a book about him specifically,

00:33:11.539 --> 00:33:12.859
but he was referenced in this book,

00:33:12.859 --> 00:33:15.119
and quite honestly, I didn't know anything about the man,

00:33:15.119 --> 00:33:18.059
but he was burned at the stake in the year 1528

00:33:18.059 --> 00:33:20.819
at the age of 24 years old.

00:33:20.819 --> 00:33:23.039
He was in Scotland, and of course,

00:33:23.039 --> 00:33:25.319
if you understand anything about the church history

00:33:25.319 --> 00:33:28.559
at that time, there was much persecution

00:33:28.559 --> 00:33:31.279
against any that would preach the gospel

00:33:31.279 --> 00:33:32.499
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:33:32.499 --> 00:33:36.079
that salvation is by grace alone and Christ alone,

00:33:36.079 --> 00:33:37.959
that the authority of the scriptures

00:33:37.959 --> 00:33:40.519
and really the rebellion against the state church

00:33:40.519 --> 00:33:43.119
and all of that stuff that was going on, of course,

00:33:43.119 --> 00:33:46.519
in the very time in which you would read

00:33:46.519 --> 00:33:50.279
of the Reformation taking place in Germany and what have you

00:33:50.279 --> 00:33:52.359
but then in Scotland, there was a great stronghold,

00:33:52.359 --> 00:33:54.439
a lot of persecution that took place,

00:33:54.439 --> 00:33:58.639
and this man, Patrick Hamilton at the age of 24 years old

00:33:58.639 --> 00:34:01.319
was burned at the stake in the year 1528.

00:34:01.319 --> 00:34:03.319
He actually, for a period of time,

00:34:03.319 --> 00:34:04.799
after he got saved, he was preaching the gospel,

00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:07.079
and I mean, there's all kinds of persecution issues,

00:34:07.079 --> 00:34:09.719
he went to Germany for a period of time,

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:12.239
and probably if he had stayed in Germany,

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:14.919
he probably would not have been martyred,

00:34:14.919 --> 00:34:17.479
but he believed that he had family back in Scotland

00:34:17.479 --> 00:34:19.799
that needed to hear the gospel,

00:34:19.799 --> 00:34:23.440
and he believed that that family back in Scotland,

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.479
that their only real hope of hearing the gospel

00:34:25.479 --> 00:34:27.899
would be if he went back and preached the gospel,

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:30.119
but he knew that if he went back and preached the gospel,

00:34:30.119 --> 00:34:32.819
that it would mean that he would probably die.

00:34:32.819 --> 00:34:34.160
Now think about that this evening.

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.279
These are things that we don't really have to consider

00:34:36.279 --> 00:34:40.639
in America today, amen?

00:34:41.839 --> 00:34:43.399
But he believed that that would be happening,

00:34:43.399 --> 00:34:46.559
so he was given an invitation, according to what I read,

00:34:46.559 --> 00:34:48.880
he was given an invitation from the university to come back

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.519
and to be able to preach the gospel.

00:34:51.519 --> 00:34:53.380
That was a setup, all right?

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:54.679
Basically, what they wanted him to do

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:56.079
was come back and preach the gospel

00:34:56.079 --> 00:35:00.359
so they would have public opportunity to say,

00:35:00.359 --> 00:35:01.619
we've all heard you publicly,

00:35:01.619 --> 00:35:03.039
now we're gonna kill you for this

00:35:03.039 --> 00:35:06.880
because you're violating the state church.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.559
So he knew it was a setup, but he came back anyway,

00:35:09.559 --> 00:35:12.000
and for five weeks, he preached the gospel.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.459
Many, many people got saved.

00:35:13.459 --> 00:35:15.639
In fact, he started sharing the gospel

00:35:15.639 --> 00:35:17.720
with his family members and went through the whole community,

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.519
every family member that he could talk to,

00:35:19.519 --> 00:35:22.319
other people as well, preached for five weeks.

00:35:22.319 --> 00:35:23.799
Five weeks, that's it.

00:35:24.959 --> 00:35:26.459
People got saved.

00:35:26.459 --> 00:35:27.799
It was burned at the stake.

00:35:27.799 --> 00:35:29.839
And here, I'm gonna read to you an exact quote

00:35:29.839 --> 00:35:33.099
of what was given, of what I was reading,

00:35:33.099 --> 00:35:36.979
because when we yield ourselves to God,

00:35:36.979 --> 00:35:38.639
God is glorified.

00:35:38.639 --> 00:35:41.799
Sometimes we don't see the immediate results.

00:35:41.799 --> 00:35:43.679
We see it in Daniel 3.

00:35:43.679 --> 00:35:46.919
Nebuchadnezzar says, there's no God like this God.

00:35:46.919 --> 00:35:49.559
We find that here in this case of Patrick Hamilton,

00:35:49.559 --> 00:35:53.799
there were some immediate results, or fruit, if you will.

00:35:53.799 --> 00:35:57.259
And here's what the account says,

00:35:57.259 --> 00:36:00.839
that his burning, when he was burned at the stake in 1528,

00:36:00.839 --> 00:36:03.199
had been particularly gruesome.

00:36:03.199 --> 00:36:05.399
And here's why it was particularly gruesome,

00:36:05.399 --> 00:36:07.319
because they had green wood,

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:12.199
and the wind was blowing the fire away from his body.

00:36:12.199 --> 00:36:15.759
I can't even fully comprehend being tied to a stake,

00:36:15.759 --> 00:36:16.959
being burned at the stake.

00:36:16.959 --> 00:36:18.919
It's green wood, so it doesn't burn well.

00:36:18.919 --> 00:36:22.039
And the wind is blowing the fire away from you.

00:36:22.039 --> 00:36:27.039
So it was hours that he was there,

00:36:27.039 --> 00:36:31.759
physically in torment, being burned alive

00:36:31.759 --> 00:36:33.380
for preaching the gospel.

00:36:34.259 --> 00:36:36.039
But he yielded himself to Christ.

00:36:37.079 --> 00:36:38.720
He yielded himself to Christ.

00:36:39.559 --> 00:36:41.559
And it says that, as a result,

00:36:41.559 --> 00:36:44.839
he burnt for six awful hours.

00:36:44.839 --> 00:36:48.119
How many of you have ever burned yourself on the stove?

00:36:48.119 --> 00:36:49.639
What do you do immediately?

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.160
I mean, do you hold it there and say,

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.079
one 1,000, two 1,000?

00:36:54.079 --> 00:36:56.959
No, like you immediately, it's a reaction.

00:36:56.959 --> 00:36:58.799
Is it not?

00:36:58.799 --> 00:36:59.859
Six hours.

00:37:02.519 --> 00:37:04.239
The account goes on to say that people

00:37:04.239 --> 00:37:07.119
who had previously heard him preach the gospel

00:37:07.119 --> 00:37:11.759
saw in those hours the reality of his faith

00:37:13.079 --> 00:37:14.440
and the grace of God.

00:37:15.679 --> 00:37:19.799
The result was that so many people responded

00:37:19.799 --> 00:37:24.160
by trusting Christ that one of the adversaries

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:28.079
that actually called for this man to be burned at the stake,

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:29.639
here's what he said.

00:37:29.639 --> 00:37:32.039
He said, we should do this no longer.

00:37:32.039 --> 00:37:32.880
Why?

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.519
Because if we continue to burn people at the stake

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:38.679
and others that are onlooking see the grace of God

00:37:38.679 --> 00:37:43.000
and respond by being saved, it's counterproductive.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.199
We're not getting the results that we want.

00:37:46.759 --> 00:37:48.759
But you know what Patrick Hamilton did?

00:37:48.759 --> 00:37:50.119
He yielded himself to God.

00:37:51.959 --> 00:37:55.319
Tonight, I don't think any of us are being asked

00:37:55.319 --> 00:37:57.679
to yield ourselves to God in that same fashion.

00:37:59.599 --> 00:38:00.440
None of us.

00:38:01.599 --> 00:38:05.079
But can I tell you, tomorrow, this evening,

00:38:05.079 --> 00:38:07.440
there are gonna be things that come up in your life.

00:38:08.399 --> 00:38:10.199
Are you gonna yield yourself to God?

00:38:11.199 --> 00:38:15.880
Or are you gonna yield to self, the pressures of others,

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.199
whomever it may be that we yield to?

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:22.279
But we see in a real sense in Romans chapter six,

00:38:22.279 --> 00:38:24.759
yield yourselves unto God.

00:38:25.959 --> 00:38:30.519
And as we do, God will be glorified.

00:38:30.519 --> 00:38:32.440
The series here on Wednesday night

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.119
is doing what we ought to do.

00:38:35.119 --> 00:38:38.200
You do not see in Romans six the word ought.

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.760
It's not there.

00:38:40.279 --> 00:38:44.159
But I think if you'd give me a little bit of liberty,

00:38:44.159 --> 00:38:46.719
I could easily say this evening,

00:38:46.719 --> 00:38:51.039
we ought to yield ourselves unto God.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.839
I believe that it's good counsel

00:38:55.839 --> 00:38:58.719
that God gives us, valuable counsel.

00:38:58.719 --> 00:39:01.080
But every one of us, we have a choice.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.919
And you're gonna have a choice tomorrow, multiple times.

00:39:03.919 --> 00:39:05.320
Are you gonna yield to God?

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.799
Yield to yourself?

00:39:06.799 --> 00:39:08.119
Yield to someone else?

00:39:09.839 --> 00:39:14.080
Oh, that God would help us to yield ourselves to him

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:18.359
so that he would receive all the honor and the glory,

00:39:18.359 --> 00:39:20.520
which is due unto his wonderful name.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.959
Because we serve a great God and he's worthy of it.

00:39:22.959 --> 00:39:23.799
He's worthy of it.

00:39:23.799 --> 00:39:24.640
Let's pray.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.440
Father, we love you.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.679
We thank you for loving us.

00:39:27.679 --> 00:39:31.159
Thank you for your word, the truth that's contained therein.

00:39:31.159 --> 00:39:33.479
And I pray, Lord, that you'd help me.

00:39:33.479 --> 00:39:35.239
I pray that you'd help each of us, Lord,

00:39:35.239 --> 00:39:38.719
to yield ourselves to you.

00:39:38.719 --> 00:39:42.839
Lord, that we would set our affection on things above,

00:39:42.839 --> 00:39:45.080
not on things of the earth.

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:49.479
God, we'd understand that we're dead to sin,

00:39:49.479 --> 00:39:51.279
but alive unto you.

00:39:51.279 --> 00:39:53.039
Thank you for saving us.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.159
We pray, God, that you'd use us,

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.520
that we might bring honor and glory to thy name.

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:04.440
Bless our time of prayer. We do thank you for the privilege. I pray that you'd be honored

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:09.640
and glorified for it's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
