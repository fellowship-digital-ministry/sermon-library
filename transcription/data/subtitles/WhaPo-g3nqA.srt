1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Number three, back to the book of 1 John,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,320
the book that we've been studying.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,639
We've been away for a couple of months, actually.

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:08,520
And the book that we've been studying here

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,380
on Sunday morning is our theme.

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,539
Of course, the banners are back up.

7
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:14,359
We had our missions banners up the last two Sundays,

8
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:16,680
but walking in the light from 1 John 1

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,239
and verse number seven this morning

10
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:19,920
will be in chapter number three,

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,799
looking at verses four through 10.

12
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:24,620
But let me just remind you, since it's been a while

13
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,120
since our last lesson or message from this particular book,

14
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,159
let me remind you of how we started

15
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:32,040
1 John chapter number three.

16
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,639
And really, John reminds the readers, the recipients,

17
00:00:35,639 --> 00:00:39,060
he reminds us of our position in Christ.

18
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,759
And you look at the first verse

19
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:42,099
of 1 John chapter number three,

20
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:42,939
and the Bible says,

21
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:46,240
behold, what manner of love the Father

22
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,159
hath bestowed upon us.

23
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,639
Aren't you thankful for the love of God?

24
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:54,360
And what a blessing to know that God so loved the world

25
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,000
that he gave his only begotten son,

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,500
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,000
but have everlasting life.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And then we understand not only did he declare his love,

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,360
but he demonstrated his love.

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,839
For the Bible says that God commendeth his love toward us,

31
00:01:08,839 --> 00:01:10,680
and that while we were yet sinners,

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,160
Christ died for us in Romans five and verse number eight.

33
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,120
So right at the beginning of this third chapter

34
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,519
of the book of 1 John,

35
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,599
we're immediately confronted with the love of God.

36
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:23,160
Behold, what manner of love

37
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,800
the Father hath bestowed upon us.

38
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,120
Notice what he says,

39
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:31,120
that we should be called the sons of God.

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,680
Think about our position as his son, as his child.

41
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,199
And we find that, of course,

42
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,720
as we've mentioned many times

43
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,480
as we've studied this particular book,

44
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,800
the book of 1 John,

45
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,080
the book is written to those that have trust at Christ

46
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,680
as their personal savior,

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,220
those who have been born again.

48
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,519
In fact, we'll see that term used a couple of times

49
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,080
in our message this morning.

50
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,500
And we find here that when he says

51
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,760
that we should be called the sons of God,

52
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,000
if you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,059
as your personal savior this morning,

54
00:01:59,059 --> 00:02:01,639
if you know for sure that heaven is your home,

55
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:05,160
God tells us that we are adopted into his family

56
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,320
and we are his sons, his children,

57
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,000
and what an absolute blessing

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,759
to be reminded of our position.

59
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,720
He continues and he says,

60
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,199
therefore, the world knoweth us not.

61
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:20,240
Why? Because it knew him not.

62
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,240
Now, immediately after he reminds the believers

63
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,119
of the love that God has for us

64
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:26,960
and our position in Christ,

65
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,559
that we are the sons of God,

66
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:32,039
he then begins to deal with this subject matter

67
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,479
in verses two and three,

68
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,440
really with regard to the expectation of the believer.

69
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,160
Because I'm his child, because I'm his son,

70
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,199
because I belong to him,

71
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,399
we find that he says,

72
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:48,240
now, beloved, now are we the sons of God?

73
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,100
And it doth not yet appear what we shall be,

74
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,320
but we know that.

75
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,399
Remember, throughout this book,

76
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:56,839
we read this word know and how we have the knowledge

77
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:58,960
God does not want us to be ignorant.

78
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,720
It says, we know that when he shall appear,

79
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,720
we shall be like him.

80
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,720
For we shall see him as he is.

81
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,600
And every man that hath this hope in him

82
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,039
purifies himself even as he is pure.

83
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:17,520
And so he immediately addresses the expectation

84
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,199
of the believer that he shall appear.

85
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,839
And I'm so thankful, in fact,

86
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,039
that in the preceding chapter in chapter two,

87
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,119
in verse number 28,

88
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:28,520
he uses that term of when he shall appear as well.

89
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,399
And he says that we may have confidence

90
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:34,440
and not be ashamed before him at his coming.

91
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,080
And so we find the connection

92
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,440
between the end of chapter two,

93
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,080
the beginning of chapter number three,

94
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,919
where we come to that third verse

95
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,559
of 1 John chapter number three.

96
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:45,440
And he says, listen, because we are the sons of God,

97
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,880
because we have this expectation,

98
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,360
it should have an impact in our lives and our behavior.

99
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,559
He says, every man that hath this hope in him

100
00:03:57,559 --> 00:04:02,559
purifies himself even as he is pure.

101
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,039
As we go further into chapter number three

102
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,000
and looking at verses four through 10,

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,399
our text of scripture this morning,

104
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:13,320
we'll find that John is addressing

105
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,160
and really providing for us another litmus test.

106
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,279
And we'll get to that

107
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,200
as we go through the message this morning.

108
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,440
He's providing us with this contrast

109
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,959
in the text of scripture

110
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,160
between the one that doeth righteousness

111
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,600
and the one that committeth sin.

112
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,239
Now we understand as we've mentioned,

113
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:31,239
really, as you start the book of 1 John

114
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:33,079
in that first chapter,

115
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,839
that we still have the flesh

116
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:39,320
and we still have that old man, that sinful nature.

117
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,880
I am thankful that as we have been born again,

118
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,459
if you're saved this morning,

119
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:46,079
you've been delivered from the penalty of sin.

120
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,279
And according to the word of God,

121
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,079
you've been delivered from the power of sin.

122
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,279
But the reality is that we've not yet been delivered

123
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,720
from the presence of sin.

124
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,679
We know one day when we are with him,

125
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:59,500
that we will be delivered from the very presence of sin.

126
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,700
But as long as we're here upon this earth,

127
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,279
we deal with sin.

128
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,640
And we understand that the Bible does not teach,

129
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,000
and we'll go through this passage of scripture

130
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,239
this morning and deal with this.

131
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:12,519
He's not dealing with this idea

132
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:15,320
that some have given idea to

133
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,679
or thought to in the past

134
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:19,880
of reaching some place of sinless perfection.

135
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,200
Rather, he's dealing with the behavior

136
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,119
of a believer in the change

137
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:29,420
because of who we are and what our expectation is.

138
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,279
It's not possible that we're going to be sinless,

139
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:36,279
but the reality is that we should sin less and less

140
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:39,119
the closer we walk with the Lord.

141
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:41,540
And we find that for the believer,

142
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,720
that sin is not something that we can take joy in

143
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,540
and something that we delight in,

144
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,380
rather something that would cause us

145
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,000
to regret immediately after so doing.

146
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,160
As we look at this passage of scripture

147
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,480
and we consider the impact of a believer,

148
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,200
of the belief of a believer and how it impacts their life,

149
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,980
we see it in our behavior here.

150
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,339
Notice what he says at the beginning in verse number four.

151
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:08,179
It says this,

152
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:12,880
whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law.

153
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,880
For sin is the transgression of the law.

154
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,799
And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins

155
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:20,480
and in him is no sin.

156
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,200
Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not.

157
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,239
Whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.

158
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:30,239
Little children, let no man deceive you.

159
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:33,160
He that doeth righteousness is righteous

160
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,600
even as he is righteous.

161
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,559
He that committed sin is of the devil,

162
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:39,640
for the devil sinneth from the beginning.

163
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,119
For this purpose, the Son of God was manifested

164
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:44,720
that he might destroy the works of the devil.

165
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,239
Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin

166
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:49,239
for his seed remaineth in him

167
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:52,239
and he cannot sin because he is born of God.

168
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:55,480
In this, the children of God are manifest

169
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,440
and the children of the devil.

170
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,399
Whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God,

171
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,000
neither he that loveth not his brother.

172
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,079
You'll notice in the middle of verse number seven,

173
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,760
actually the end of verse number seven,

174
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,559
the Bible says he that doeth righteousness is righteous.

175
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,519
And I've used that for our text this evening,

176
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,799
or this morning for our title,

177
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:18,200
for this passage of scripture, our message this morning.

178
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,679
He that doeth righteousness is righteous.

179
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:24,880
Several weeks ago on Sunday evening,

180
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,320
I preached a message from the book of Romans.

181
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,200
And as I preached that message from the book of Romans,

182
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,760
I made this statement that they who have been declared

183
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,040
righteous are to live righteous lives.

184
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,079
And we understand that through salvation,

185
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,640
and as he's writing to believers here,

186
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,679
these that are called the sons of God,

187
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:44,500
that we have been declared righteous.

188
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,160
That's our position and what a joy to know

189
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,279
that we have the imputed righteousness

190
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,239
of the Lord Jesus Christ upon our account.

191
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:54,220
And as we've been declared righteous,

192
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,480
we are to live righteous lives.

193
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,959
Now it's interesting, perhaps you saw the warning

194
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,040
in verse number seven.

195
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,959
It's of great interest to me that in the midst

196
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,359
of this passage of scripture, that God gives us a warning.

197
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:08,799
Notice the warning right there in verse number seven.

198
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:13,799
John says, little children, let no man deceive you.

199
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,559
Let no man deceive you.

200
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:19,760
Now, unfortunately, as we would consider this thought

201
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,760
of deception and we consider the thought of false teaching,

202
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,880
we understand that all the way back here in the first century

203
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,119
as God is using John to write this short epistle,

204
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,760
that there were false teachers that were going about

205
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,039
seeking to deceive individuals.

206
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,919
And we find that still today there are false teachers

207
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,960
that are running around that are seeking

208
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,880
to deceive the masses.

209
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,119
And we find that specifically with regard to the context

210
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:47,280
of this passage of scripture this morning,

211
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,280
that we would find that the deception is with regard to sin.

212
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,559
There were many that would say, oh, don't worry about sin.

213
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,239
Sin doesn't really matter.

214
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,719
I beg to differ.

215
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:01,700
I beg to differ.

216
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:07,239
We find that yes, indeed, as we begin the third chapter

217
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:10,760
of the book of 1 John, God's love is in focus.

218
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,919
And I'm so thankful that God is love.

219
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,440
This book declares that.

220
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,359
But understand this morning that God never,

221
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:23,280
God never sacrifices His holiness on the altar of love.

222
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,559
Never.

223
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,479
I'm thankful that our God is gracious.

224
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:30,880
Indeed, His grace is amazing.

225
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:35,840
But the reality is that the grace of God

226
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,239
does not change the holiness of God.

227
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,280
And there are many today that are seeking to deceive

228
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,280
in the same manner in which these false teachers

229
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,520
were seeking to deceive during the writing

230
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,880
of the book of 1 John.

231
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,440
And that was to say, oh, God is love, and God is gracious,

232
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,880
and it doesn't really matter what you do.

233
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,440
Do you remember what Paul said?

234
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,000
As Paul was writing to the believers in Rome

235
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,479
in Romans chapter four,

236
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:04,759
chapter number 5, he mentions about the grace of God, and he says, but where sin

237
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:10,919
abounded, grace did much more abound. And then he really is going to give an

238
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:14,659
answer to a question that's not yet asked as he is writing under the

239
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:17,639
inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, and the Bible says in chapter number 6

240
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,359
of the book of Romans, what shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace

241
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:28,799
may abound? And the Bible says, God forbid. In the book of Jude, the Bible tells us

242
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:34,639
that they turned the grace of God into lasciviousness. That's not a word that

243
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:41,279
we use very often, but we understand that word means unbridled lust. They've turned

244
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:48,079
the grace of God into lasciviousness. And that form of false teaching continues to

245
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:54,039
be prevalent to this very day. There are people all around this globe that are

246
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:58,999
giving a false teaching with regard to the truth of this book. I am thankful

247
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:02,799
that God is love, but I've often mentioned, and we will mention as we

248
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,479
continue through the book of John and see many references to the love of God,

249
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:14,319
I have often mentioned that God's love can best be described as protective, not

250
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:21,959
as permissive. So many people today want to define the love of God as being

251
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:28,239
permissive. God loves you, do whatever you want to do. God's love is best described

252
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:33,599
as protective. Is there a parent among us this morning that would say that they love

253
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:40,479
their child? Of course. Are you going to let your child do whatever they want to do because

254
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:47,919
you love them? That would be foolish, right? So your love for your children is a protective

255
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:54,959
love, such is the case with God's love. I want you to remember what Peter said in

256
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,999
1 Peter 1, just a few pages over, and then we'll get right into the text of Scripture

257
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:07,959
this morning. See, God is concerned about the behavior of His children. Our behavior

258
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:14,199
matters to God. In 1 Peter 1, in verse 14, the Bible says,

259
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:20,439
As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust and your ignorance,

260
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:29,639
but as He which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation,

261
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:36,439
because it is written, Be holy, for I am holy. See, we must understand that there's a balance

262
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:42,039
within the Word of God, and His attributes, His character traits are always in perfect

263
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:49,399
harmony. And we find that it is a popular message still even to this day to preach and

264
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:54,079
to proclaim this God is love and do whatever you want to do, and you can get a great number

265
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:59,679
of people because everything's just wishy-washy, you do whatever you want. But when you begin

266
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:05,159
to preach and teach what the Word of God actually says and the truth of sanctification and the

267
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:12,159
truth of our behavior, all of a sudden, people don't like that message so much. Nevertheless,

268
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:17,359
it's true. And here we find as we look at the passage of Scripture, if you are taking

269
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:23,079
notes, notice with me first of all that John speaks about sin. He speaks about sin. In

270
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:32,399
verse number 4, notice what he says, Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law.

271
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:39,639
Notice what he says, For sin is the transgression of the law. It's a very simple statement that

272
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:44,719
we find here in 1 John 3 and verse number 4 with regard to the definition or the description

273
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:49,399
of sin. I would say this, as we look at verse number 4 and we understand that John speaks

274
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:54,759
about sin, that we'd understand this morning that sin is awful. It is stated as being a

275
00:13:54,759 --> 00:14:03,759
transgression of the law, and we find that that literally means lawlessness. Lawlessness.

276
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:09,679
And we find that here, as God is referring back to the truth of the Old Testament, we'd

277
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,259
be familiar with the law even as we've studied the Old Testament, and we find that He's giving

278
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:20,719
the clarity with regard to what is sin, and He speaks about sin. We understand this morning

279
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:27,239
that the law, it reveals sin. In fact, Paul says this, If it had not been for the law,

280
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:33,439
I would not have known sin, in Romans chapter number 7. But because the law says, and I

281
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:39,639
look at my behavior, I find out that I'm a transgressor of God's law. And we find here

282
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:45,139
this morning that sin is being spoken of. We know that sin has been dealt with earlier

283
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:50,559
in the chapters of the book of 1 John. Remember, the Bible said this in 1 John chapter number

284
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:56,879
1 with regard to sin. He says if we say in verse number 8 that we have no sin, we deceive

285
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:05,359
ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just

286
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:10,539
to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we've

287
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:15,199
not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us. And then remember this truth

288
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,859
of 1 John 2 in verse number 1, My little children, these things write I unto you that

289
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:29,659
you sin not. That's the goal. Amen? However, I am so thankful for the entirety of verse

290
00:15:29,659 --> 00:15:34,159
number 1 of 1 John 2 because the goal is that we sin not. But have you found it in your

291
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:43,439
life that you sin? The goal is to sin not. But the reality is that we sin. You may have

292
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:57,199
sinned this morning. We probably did. Amen? And it says this, and if any man sin, we have

293
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:08,319
an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. Perfect defense attorney. Amen?

294
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:15,679
Every time the accuser of the brethren brings up charges against us, our advocate, Jesus,

295
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:24,839
says, yes, He's guilty. He doesn't try to defend our innocence for we are guilty. But

296
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:34,199
He says, I paid for it. Isn't that awesome? Yes, He's guilty, but it's under the blood.

297
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:39,759
It's been paid for. We have an advocate with the Father. And we find here in 1 John chapter

298
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:46,439
number 3 that He's speaking about sin. It is the transgression of the law. It is lawlessness.

299
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:50,959
We find that the law reveals sin to us. Notice in the text of Scripture that the Bible teaches

300
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:57,639
us that Satan himself is the author of sin. God is not the author of sin. Satan is the

301
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:03,999
author of sin. Notice in verse number 8, He that committeth sin is of the devil. For the

302
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:12,599
devil sinneth from the beginning. He said, I will be like the Most High. He wanted to

303
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:18,879
be like God. He wanted to be God. We find that here the Scriptures tell us that Satan

304
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:23,759
is the author of sin, and he that committeth sin is of the devil. For the devil sinneth

305
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,879
from the beginning. You'll remember that Jesus said this during His earthly ministry as He's

306
00:17:28,879 --> 00:17:34,199
ministering there, and He mentions about those that, of course, the religious leaders

307
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:39,239
of the day, and He speaks to them about their father, the devil. And He speaks this in John

308
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:43,599
8 and verse number 44, the year of your father, the devil, and the lust of your father you

309
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:48,839
will do. He was a murderer from the beginning and a boat not in the truth. Why? Because

310
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:56,559
there is no truth in Him. When He speaketh a lie, He speaketh of His own, for He is a

311
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:04,399
liar and the father of it in John 8 and verse 44. So we see that John, He makes the statement,

312
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:09,039
He speaks of sin, but I want you to notice very quickly that not only He doesn't stay

313
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:15,799
there. He then speaks, number two, of our Savior. We have a wonderful Savior. And we

314
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,839
consider this morning as we look at the text of Scripture what was accomplished on that

315
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:25,399
cruel cross, what was accomplished at Calvary because of sin. We understand that it was

316
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:29,799
sin that sent our Savior there, but we notice as we look at this text of Scripture that

317
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:34,919
John quickly moves on and He begins to speak of our Savior, and we find in verse number

318
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:39,880
five He reveals to us as He's speaking of our Savior that He was manifest, that He came

319
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:46,959
for this purpose, notice, to take away our sins. Isn't that wonderful? Notice in verse

320
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:51,679
number five, and ye know. Now I'm thankful for that again as we note that He's writing

321
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,919
to believers, He's writing to these that have received the gospel, that have been saved,

322
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:03,959
and He says, ye know, you have this knowledge, you know that He, Jesus, was manifested to

323
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:18,559
take away our sins. And in Him is no sin. We understand that He is perfect. He is sinless.

324
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:24,919
The just for the unjust. We find here that in this text of Scripture that John is saying

325
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:30,320
that we had a perfect substitute. See, the reality is that I'm a sinful man and you are

326
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,279
sinful people. I cannot pay for your sins and you cannot pay for my sins. But God in

327
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:42,760
flesh, the Lord Jesus Christ, He was manifest, He came to the sin-cursed world, He left the

328
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:49,799
glory of heaven, He lived in this wicked world, and He walked perfectly. He never sinned.

329
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:56,679
And He went to that cruel cross and He bled and He died. Why? To take away our sins. He

330
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:00,479
was buried in a borrowed tomb and He rose conquering

331
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:06,559
death, sin, and the grave. He lives forevermore. He's coming again. We rejoice

332
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:12,199
because we serve a risen Savior, and we find this morning that John is reminding

333
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:18,679
his readers, he's reminding them that Jesus took away our sins, and we ought to

334
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:25,439
rejoice in that. What can wash away my sin, the songwriter said?

335
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:34,119
Nothing but the blood of Jesus. Amen? What can make me whole again? Nothing but

336
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:40,119
the blood of Jesus. Oh precious is that fount. Aren't you so thankful for the

337
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:47,679
blood of Christ that was shed to pay for the sin of mankind? You know, this morning

338
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:55,359
sin is a universal condition that mankind has. It's universal. There's not

339
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,599
a just man upon the face of the earth, for all have sinned and come short of

340
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:05,439
the glory of God. Right? It's what the Word of God says. So sin is a universal

341
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:10,919
condition. Every single human being that you see, that I see, has the same

342
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:20,759
condition that we have. Sin. What makes me different? Mine's been forgiven. I know

343
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:31,039
that He came. I have the knowledge. He came and He took away our sins. Wow, what

344
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:37,279
joy. 2 Corinthians 5 verse 21 says that He, God, hath made Him, Christ, to be sin

345
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:45,759
for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.

346
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:51,319
Man, what a transaction that took place. The songwriter said it's not in our

347
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:55,999
songbook. Many of you might be familiar with it. The old account was settled long

348
00:21:55,999 --> 00:22:04,079
ago. The old account was settled. The transaction was completed. Jesus said it

349
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:09,119
is finished. It was paid in full. He paid for our sins. I mentioned earlier, but

350
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,799
there in 1 Peter chapter 3 and verse number 18, the Bible says, for Christ also

351
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:19,359
hath once suffered for our sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to

352
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:27,399
God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit. Notice not only

353
00:22:27,399 --> 00:22:31,119
as He speaks of our Savior here in 1 John chapter number 3, does He remind

354
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:35,439
the recipients, does He remind us this morning that He took away our sins, that

355
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:39,239
was accomplished at the cross of Calvary, but I want you to notice as well that He

356
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:43,719
destroyed the works of the devil. Notice in verse number 8, the Bible says, He that

357
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:47,759
committeth sin is of the devil, for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this

358
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:55,359
purpose, the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the

359
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:02,239
devil. Satan did everything he could do throughout history to prevent Messiah

360
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:09,479
from coming and from going to that cruel cross. He did everything he could. You

361
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:12,999
read in the Old Testament, you read about the various plots against the nation of

362
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:18,399
Israel, you read against the attacks against the lineage, the line, you find

363
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:24,479
that it's all an attack upon Messiah. You read about Haman's wicked plan in the

364
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:31,119
book of Esther to annihilate the entirety of the Jewish race. Why? So that no Messiah

365
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:40,479
could come. He tried to kill Him multiple times during His earthly ministry. You can

366
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:47,119
read various portions in the Gospels where they tried to kill Him. Satan was behind it,

367
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:56,199
no doubt. But He declares in John 17, the hour has come. It was time. And He goes to

368
00:23:56,199 --> 00:24:01,399
that cross. And I can almost see in my mind's eye that Satan begins to triumph, thinking

369
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:08,239
he's won the victory. After he died and he was put in that borrowed tomb, they set

370
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:13,599
a seal. Remember, they kept watch and they made it as sure as they could. But there was

371
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:21,239
nothing that could keep them from rising and conquering sin, death, and the grave.

372
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:27,119
He destroyed the works of the devil. And we understand as we look at this verse of

373
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:32,839
Scripture and this truth that God is giving us with regard to the work that God did there

374
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:42,999
at Calvary, and He's rendered this truth of destroying, it's rendered powerless.

375
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:45,799
Notice what the Bible says, if you will, over in the book of Colossians in chapter

376
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:52,359
number 2 and verse number 15 with regard to this truth of Christ destroying the works

377
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:58,759
of the devil. In Colossians 2 and verse number 15, the Bible, I'll read verse 14 with it.

378
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:06,239
Notice what He says here in verse number 14 of Colossians chapter number 2. He says this,

379
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:11,259
blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to

380
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:17,979
us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His cross. And having spoiled principalities

381
00:25:17,979 --> 00:25:26,079
and powers, He made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it. And then the book

382
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:32,919
of Hebrews says this in Hebrews chapter number 2. Notice what the Word of God says there.

383
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:43,519
In Hebrews chapter number 2 and verse number 14, He says this, for as much then as the

384
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:48,559
children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the

385
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:56,999
same, that through death He might destroy him that had the power of death. In case you

386
00:25:56,999 --> 00:26:01,399
don't know who that is, that is the devil, He says at the end of the verse. That way

387
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:08,119
we'd have clarity and understanding. And so we find that Jesus, He came in the form

388
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:13,959
of sinful man. He Himself was not sinful, but He took upon Himself the form of a servant,

389
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:18,359
the form of man, came in the likeness of man, and He went, He humbled Himself, He went to

390
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:23,239
that cruel cross, and we find that He not only took away our sins, but He destroyed

391
00:26:23,239 --> 00:26:32,199
the works of the devil. Can I say it this way, back in 1 John chapter 3, as John speaks

392
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:39,919
of our Savior and what was accomplished there at Calvary, we find the truth of redemption.

393
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:48,879
Notice what He says in verse number 9. He says this, whosoever is born of God doth not

394
00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:56,439
commit sin, for his seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin because he is born of God.

395
00:26:56,439 --> 00:27:01,039
You see two references in verse number 9 to this thought of born of God. And when you

396
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:06,719
think about this truth of born of God, we have in view here the second birth, the truth

397
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:12,319
is Jesus said to Nicodemus, you must be born again. And we find that when we speak about

398
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:17,599
being born again, we'd understand that we've used this terminology before that we all have

399
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:22,519
a physical birth, but what's most important is whether we have a spiritual birth. To be

400
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:28,199
born once is to die twice, because you'll die a physical death and you die a spiritual

401
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:32,999
death, but to be born twice is to die just once, because you're born of the flesh and

402
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:38,759
you're born of the Spirit, and you'll just die once, a fleshly death.

403
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:44,479
The reality this morning is that as we understand the redemption that was made possible through

404
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:50,159
the work at Christ at Calvary, that which was accomplished for us to be born again,

405
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,239
he says here that we're born of God, but then notice this, for his seed remaineth in him,

406
00:27:55,239 --> 00:28:00,319
right in the middle of the verse in 1 John 3 and verse number 9, and it reminds us not

407
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:06,999
only when we think about this second birth, the new seed, the new nature. We find that

408
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:12,199
in 1 Peter chapter number 1, just a few pages over, I want you to remember what Peter said

409
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:20,159
with regard to our redemption. In 1 Peter 1, beginning in verse number 18, Peter says

410
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,319
this, for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver

411
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:32,839
and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers. Nope, no silver,

412
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:40,799
no gold could redeem mankind, but, verse 19, with the precious blood of Christ, as of a

413
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,599
lamb without blemish and without spot, who verily was foreordained before the foundation

414
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:55,159
of the world, but was manifest in these last times, notice that phrase, for you, for you,

415
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:01,760
who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your

416
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,399
faith and hope might be in God, seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth

417
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,079
through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that you love one another

418
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:15,519
with a pure heart fervently, notice this in verse 23, being born again not of corruptible

419
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:24,639
seed but of incorruptible, by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever. In 2

420
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:30,079
Peter 1 and verse number 4, notice what he says here with regard to this truth of redemption

421
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:35,779
and being born again. He says this in 2 Peter 1 and verse number 4, whereby are given unto

422
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:41,299
us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers, notice this,

423
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:50,299
of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And as

424
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:56,019
we've been born again, we see this seed that is mentioned in verse number 9 of 1 John 3

425
00:29:56,019 --> 00:30:00,459
because we're born of God, his seed remaineth in us.

426
00:30:00,459 --> 00:30:06,579
understand here that we have been born again. We have this new seed, this new nature, this

427
00:30:06,579 --> 00:30:14,819
second birth. And so John speaks of sin. He speaks of our Savior. When he speaks of our

428
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:19,299
Savior, he says, I want to remind you of what was accomplished at Calvary. I want to remind

429
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:24,699
you why He came. And you know this, but I want to remind you that He came first to take

430
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:31,619
away our sins. He came to destroy the works of the devil. He came to redeem mankind. The

431
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:38,179
Bible says that the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost. He's a seeking

432
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:42,899
Savior. Listen, if you don't know the Lord Jesus Christ is your personal Savior this

433
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:48,539
morning, He wants to save you. He wants to be your Savior. He wants to be your Redeemer.

434
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:55,339
He loves you. He loves you beyond what you could ever imagine. Not only does He love

435
00:30:55,339 --> 00:31:02,339
you, but He died for you. He took your place, the perfect substitute. The atonement was

436
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:08,939
made. You say, I'm going to try to figure it out myself. You could never pay the debt

437
00:31:08,939 --> 00:31:17,299
that you owe. It's absolutely impossible. We are not redeemed with silver and gold as

438
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:24,339
we read there in 1 Peter chapter 2. We understand in chapter 1, excuse me, in verse 18, we understand

439
00:31:24,939 --> 00:31:30,539
that it's not by works of righteousness which we have done. It's according to His mercy

440
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:35,859
that He hath begotten us. For by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves.

441
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:41,259
It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. And this morning the

442
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:48,019
plan of redemption that we so hold dear is being reminded to the believers here that

443
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:52,699
John is writing to and to us as well this morning. So He speaks of sin, He speaks of

444
00:31:52,699 --> 00:31:59,699
our Savior, He then speaks of our sanctification. Notice in the text of Scripture, we find that

445
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:06,299
John begins to address the subject of sanctification. It's once again necessary for us to point

446
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:12,179
out as we did, we saw this first in 1 John chapter 2 verses 3 through 6, and as we looked

447
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:16,819
at that passage of Scripture, I took some time to explain to you the verb tense in these

448
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:22,219
particular verses, and we see it again in our passage of Scripture before us this morning.

449
00:32:22,219 --> 00:32:26,539
Sometimes it's challenging to get the sense of the verb, but we find here that in this

450
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:32,099
passage of Scripture, just as it was in 1 John chapter 2 verses 3 through 6, that the

451
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:38,619
conjugation of the verb indicates an ongoing action. And it's important for us to understand

452
00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:44,659
that because He says here, whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not. So some would take and

453
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:50,259
say, okay, well that means you could never commit a sin. But it's talking about this

454
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:57,259
because of the conjugation of the verb, it indicates that ongoing action, that lifestyle,

455
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:04,299
that behavior that is prevalent. And so He says, as He begins to speak about our sanctification,

456
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:09,979
I want you to see first of all that He immediately deals with the subject of abiding in verse

457
00:33:09,979 --> 00:33:16,979
number 6. Whosoever abideth in Him. Now think about John writing these words. John the apostle,

458
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:25,699
he heard the Lord Jesus Christ speak in John 15 with regard to the truth of abide in me.

459
00:33:26,499 --> 00:33:33,499
And we find here that John immediately addresses the subject of abiding and he says this, that

460
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:39,619
whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not, whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him, neither known Him.

461
00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:43,979
Little children, let no man deceive you. He that doeth righteousness is righteous, even

462
00:33:43,979 --> 00:33:48,419
as He is righteous. He that committed sin is of the devil, for the devil sinneth from

463
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:52,459
the beginning. Skip down if you will to verse number 9. Whosoever is born of God doth not

464
00:33:52,459 --> 00:33:58,139
commit sin, for his seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin because he is born of God.

465
00:33:58,139 --> 00:34:02,299
In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. Whosoever doeth

466
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:07,179
not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. And really that's

467
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:12,259
a segue into the next text of scripture that we'll study next week with regard to loving

468
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:17,739
the brethren there at the end of verse number 10. But we find here this morning that both

469
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:25,979
salvation and sanctification are of Christ. It's of Christ. Sometimes what happens is

470
00:34:25,979 --> 00:34:32,419
we are saved, for by grace we are saved through faith. We understand that salvation is all

471
00:34:32,419 --> 00:34:38,179
of Christ. Right? There's nothing I can do. I can't save myself. But somehow we get to

472
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:45,419
the point that we think sanctification is about me. And I'm trying, trying, trying,

473
00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:52,019
this process of sanctification, and I'm really trying in my own flesh. Do you remember what

474
00:34:52,019 --> 00:34:58,259
Paul said in Romans chapter number 7? He said, the things that I would, I do not. The things

475
00:34:58,259 --> 00:35:05,419
that I would not, that I do. Right? Paul's saying, I got this struggle going on, and

476
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:09,979
I have this difficulty and all of this that's going on. And he says, who shall deliver me?

477
00:35:09,979 --> 00:35:15,379
And he says, I thank God through Christ Jesus. Listen, sanctification is about the work of

478
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:24,099
the Holy Spirit of God, the work of Christ in us. It's not me trying, it's me yielding.

479
00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:31,059
Right? And as I yield my members, as he says there in Romans 6, 7, and 8, and you read

480
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:36,359
those passages of Scripture and you see how Paul is really giving a great dissortation

481
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:40,479
on the subject of sanctification there in the middle of the book of Romans, here we

482
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:47,199
find that John is just simply talking about stating here quickly the subject of sanctification

483
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:53,399
and the work that Christ does in us. Noah Webster in his 1828 Webster's Dictionary defines

484
00:35:53,399 --> 00:36:02,719
sanctification this way, the act of God's grace by which the affections of men are purified

485
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:12,279
or alienated, it says this, from sin and the world and exalted to a supreme love to

486
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:19,819
God. That's a great definition. Let me read it one more time. The act of God's grace by

487
00:36:19,819 --> 00:36:28,359
which the affections of men are purified or alienated from sin and the world and exalted

488
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:36,279
to a supreme love to God. That helps us understand the passage of Scripture and what's being

489
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:42,839
dealt with here with the subject of sanctification and the work that Christ is doing in us. Note

490
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:48,519
that he, Noah Webster, in fact, when you look at that dictionary, you'll see so many references

491
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:55,579
to the Word of God. And you find here that he speaks about God's grace by which the affections

492
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:59,699
of men are purified. Remember what he said in verse number 3, and every man that hath

493
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:06,259
this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure. He says this, or alienate it from

494
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:11,259
sin and the world. We see the discussion of sin here in this text of Scripture. And we

495
00:37:11,259 --> 00:37:17,819
find that as we look here at this passage, and again, note a litmus test, if you will,

496
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:22,539
that John provides to his readers. We've seen this in previous texts of Scripture, and we

497
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:27,219
understand that these tests are really to be self-administered. We like to give the

498
00:37:27,219 --> 00:37:34,059
test to other people. As I said to someone, I'd rather evaluate your life and you'd rather

499
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:41,099
evaluate my life because the process of self-evaluation is not very pleasant. But the Scriptures say,

500
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:49,339
but let a man examine himself. Amen? And so we find here that here what is being contrasted

501
00:37:49,499 --> 00:37:55,019
is really the children of God versus the children of the devil. Look in verse number 10. It says,

502
00:37:55,019 --> 00:38:04,739
in this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil. So we see on one

503
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:07,899
side the children of God, on the other the children of the devil. He says that they're

504
00:38:07,899 --> 00:38:15,059
manifest. That means to be plainly recognized or known. In this, the children of God are manifest

505
00:38:15,179 --> 00:38:20,659
and the children of the devil. So here's the litmus test. Again, the verb tense is important

506
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:26,459
for us to understand because it carries with it the idea of a continual or habitual practice. It's

507
00:38:26,459 --> 00:38:33,499
not saying that a believer will never sin, but sin is not going to be the pattern in our lives. Why?

508
00:38:33,499 --> 00:38:39,859
Because the Holy Spirit of God lives within us. Listen, it's not saying that a sinning person

509
00:38:39,899 --> 00:38:46,179
isn't going to, excuse me, let me say it this way. It's not suggesting that a lost person is

510
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:55,099
never going to, by happenstance, fulfill something in the law. Right? How many times I've heard people

511
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:59,579
say, are you a sinner? I've never murdered anybody. Well, I mean, I'm glad you didn't

512
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:06,219
murder somebody. That doesn't mean that you're not a sinner. Right? And we find here that the

513
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:14,419
reality is that, listen, lost men occasionally are going to obey the law. So it's not saying by

514
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:20,259
their occasional obedience, their occasional righteousness, that that makes them a child of

515
00:39:20,259 --> 00:39:27,379
God. In like way, or in the same way, it does not mean that the believer, the child of God,

516
00:39:27,379 --> 00:39:37,379
that has the occasional sin is not saved. It's the process of sanctification. It's the truth that

517
00:39:37,379 --> 00:39:43,579
God has given to us. Really, Jesus said it this way, and we're familiar with this truth in Matthew

518
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:50,299
7 and verse number 20, when He said, wherefore, by their fruits ye shall know them. Ye shall know

519
00:39:50,299 --> 00:40:00,339
them. Listen, if you're a child of God this morning, if you've been born again, the Lord

520
00:40:00,339 --> 00:40:16,699
has put a desire in you to please Him. To have seen Him is to love Him. To love Him

521
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:26,459
is to want to please Him. And to please Him, there's no room for sin. Right? Again, I'm

522
00:40:26,459 --> 00:40:29,679
not saying, and neither is John, the Word of God is not saying that we're never going

523
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:33,759
to sin because we understand that we're going to sin. And if we do, we have an advocate

524
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:39,119
with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and

525
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,319
just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. And so He's not suggesting

526
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:47,479
that we're never going to sin. He's simply saying, it's not going to be a pattern in

527
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:53,939
your life. It's not going to be habitual, continual. It's not going to be that you're

528
00:40:53,939 --> 00:40:59,899
going to have this enjoying sin for all the days of your life. It's not this idea, as

529
00:40:59,899 --> 00:41:06,259
some have said, that, well, I got saved. I got my get out of the fire free kind of card

530
00:41:06,259 --> 00:41:15,619
and now I can live however I want to live. That's not real salvation. Because God does

531
00:41:15,619 --> 00:41:22,859
a work in us. We spoke about this in 1 John chapter number 2. We talked about this. Notice

532
00:41:22,899 --> 00:41:27,419
if you will, go back there just for a moment in verse number 5. But whoso keepeth his word

533
00:41:27,419 --> 00:41:34,099
in him verily is the love of God perfected. Hereby know we that we are in him. And we

534
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:39,539
looked at that verse of Scripture and we talked about the work that God is doing in us. Something

535
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:44,859
amazing happens when we get saved. The Holy Spirit of God lives within us. And it begins

536
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:52,059
to work in our hearts and our lives. All of a sudden, those things that we did, we have

537
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:58,019
less of a desire to do them. Why? Because the Holy Spirit of God begins to convict us.

538
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:04,799
The Holy Spirit of God begins to convict us that that behavior is not pleasing to God.

539
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:09,859
And as we yield to the Spirit of God in our lives, as we yield our lives to him as we

540
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:15,179
grow is this process of sanctification. I'm thankful for positional sanctification, but

541
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:20,379
the reality is that we're dealing with progressive sanctification. We're dealing with this walk

542
00:42:20,419 --> 00:42:26,139
with Christ all the days of our lives. And this continual growth, and the closer I get

543
00:42:26,139 --> 00:42:33,139
to him, the less I want to displease him. I don't want to do that which is displeasing

544
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:40,579
to my God. I don't want to be engaged in sinful behavior. So when he says, whosoever abideth

545
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:45,819
in him sinneth not, I want you to think about this in verse number 6. As you're abiding

546
00:42:45,819 --> 00:42:50,939
in him, as you're walking with him, as you're in daily fellowship with him, does that not

547
00:42:50,939 --> 00:42:57,939
have an impact on your behavior? Let me illustrate it simply by talking about a child this morning,

548
00:42:58,459 --> 00:43:03,459
a child that is in your presence. Parents, your children are there with you. They're

549
00:43:03,459 --> 00:43:09,419
in your presence. You're walking with them. How does your presence affect their behavior?

550
00:43:09,419 --> 00:43:16,419
Probably positively, right? Normally, listen, I never took a cookie from the cookie jar

551
00:43:16,659 --> 00:43:23,659
when my mom was watching me. That'd just be dumb. But when she wasn't watching, cookies

552
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:37,059
are available, right? Why? Because she wasn't present. I use Zachary as an example. I use

553
00:43:39,539 --> 00:43:42,939
Zachary as an illustration. He was eating a donut yesterday and he was trying to hide

554
00:43:42,939 --> 00:43:47,739
it. It was so cute. He was trying to hide eating his donut, but he had chocolate all

555
00:43:47,739 --> 00:43:53,259
over the side of his mouth. Right? Didn't he? I said, well, Zachary, if you're going

556
00:43:53,259 --> 00:43:58,339
to hide that donut, you better get rid of that chocolate. He wasn't hiding it from

557
00:43:58,339 --> 00:44:05,059
Pierre and Kimberly, just for the record. They knew he was eating it. But the reality

558
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:11,259
is that when we're abiding in him, it's going to impact our behavior. Why? Because we're

559
00:44:11,259 --> 00:44:17,939
living in his presence. I believe that's what we find the secret in the life of Joseph.

560
00:44:17,939 --> 00:44:22,219
When you go back to the book of Genesis and you read the life of Joseph, he's in a foreign

561
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:28,699
land, in a foreign place, a different culture, a different language. He's been sold. He's

562
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:35,619
been, I mean, it's a mess of what's happened. And day by day, Potiphar's wife comes and

563
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:41,979
says, lie with me. But I believe with all of my heart that Joseph lived in the presence

564
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:49,359
of God. Because when Potiphar's wife said, perfect opportunity, nobody's here. He said,

565
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:57,639
how can I sin and do this great wickedness against God? He lived in the presence of God.

566
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:03,299
From a New Testament perspective, we could say that he was abiding. And when we're abiding

567
00:45:03,299 --> 00:45:08,979
in him, when we're walking with Christ, when we're living in his presence, it's going to

568
00:45:08,979 --> 00:45:19,619
impact our behavior. Can I remind you this morning that Jesus is always with you? It

569
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:25,919
just needs to be a reminder for us that we're in his presence. We're abiding in him. How

570
00:45:25,919 --> 00:45:32,539
many times have we driven down the highway and people are just cruising along? I mean,

571
00:45:32,539 --> 00:45:38,559
just flying. I've said to the kids, Joseph just got his permit on Wednesday. I've said

572
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:42,899
to all of them as we've driven over the years, man, I'm going seven miles an hour over the

573
00:45:42,899 --> 00:45:47,619
speed limit and these people are just flying past me like I'm sitting still. Right? You

574
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:55,379
guys experienced that, right? But then all of a sudden they see one of those police cars.

575
00:45:55,379 --> 00:46:02,139
Have you seen it? What happens? Everyone wants to hit their brake and get over. Now

576
00:46:02,139 --> 00:46:07,919
my understanding is that they've already seen that you're speeding before you saw them.

577
00:46:07,919 --> 00:46:18,299
Is that right? That's right. Their LIDAR is better than your eyesight. But why do people

578
00:46:18,299 --> 00:46:26,279
behave that way? Because the presence of that law enforcement officer is a reminder

579
00:46:26,279 --> 00:46:33,839
that they're breaking the law and they need to correct their behavior. Right? We see it

580
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:42,599
in life. But spiritually speaking, we need to abide in him. And as we abide in him, as

581
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:48,519
we think about this truth of sanctification, we're going to, no, not be sinless, but we're

582
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:57,539
going to sin less and less. Why? Because I'm living in his presence. This morning, when

583
00:46:57,539 --> 00:47:04,179
you think of sin, that was the first thing that John spoke of. Remember that sin is awful.

584
00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:11,899
The second thing, when you think of our Savior, rejoice in what was accomplished. Taking our

585
00:47:11,899 --> 00:47:17,999
sins out of the way, destroying the works of the devil, providing redemption. And when

586
00:47:17,999 --> 00:47:26,679
you think of sanctification, remember this morning that it requires abiding. So often

587
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:33,599
we're trying to do it ourselves. We can't save ourselves. And we need God's grace in

588
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:40,359
this area of sanctification. Because the more I try, the more frustrated I become. And the

589
00:47:40,359 --> 00:47:45,639
more I echo the words of Paul, the things that I would, I do not. And the things that

590
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:50,559
I would not, that I do. Let's pray together. Father, we love you this morning. We thank

591
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:56,319
you for loving us. We thank you for the Word of God. We thank you for the passage of Scripture.

592
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:01,399
And God, I pray that you'd help us, those of us that are saved, that have been born

593
00:48:01,399 --> 00:48:09,159
again, declared righteous, that we would live righteous lives. I pray this morning that

594
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:12,959
if there's one that's not sure of heaven, God, I pray that today would be the day of

595
00:48:12,959 --> 00:48:22,739
their salvation, that they would understand that you loved them, that you died for them,

596
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:32,919
that you rose again conquering sin, death, and the grave. The only way to heaven is through

597
00:48:32,919 --> 00:48:39,079
the Lord Jesus Christ. Neither is there salvation in any other, for there's no other name given

598
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:45,319
among men whereby we must be saved. God, I pray that if there's one not sure of heaven,

599
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:52,359
they'd get that settled this morning. Father, for those of us that are your children, would

600
00:48:52,359 --> 00:48:59,399
you help us in this process, this process of sanctification? I'm thankful that salvation

601
00:48:59,399 --> 00:49:05,719
is the miracle of a moment, but as someone said, sanctification is the process of a lifetime.

602
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:12,959
God, would you help us to abide in you? Would you help us to yield ourselves to thee? God,

603
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:19,279
would you help us to walk daily in your presence so that we would sin less and less, that we

604
00:49:19,279 --> 00:49:25,599
would do righteousness, that we'd live and lead lives that are pleasing in thy sight?

605
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,159
Well, thank you for the work that you'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray.
