00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Number three, back to the book of 1 John,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.320
the book that we've been studying.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.639
We've been away for a couple of months, actually.

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:08.520
And the book that we've been studying here

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.380
on Sunday morning is our theme.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.539
Of course, the banners are back up.

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:14.359
We had our missions banners up the last two Sundays,

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:16.680
but walking in the light from 1 John 1

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.239
and verse number seven this morning

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:19.920
will be in chapter number three,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.799
looking at verses four through 10.

00:00:21.799 --> 00:00:24.620
But let me just remind you, since it's been a while

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.120
since our last lesson or message from this particular book,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.159
let me remind you of how we started

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:32.040
1 John chapter number three.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.639
And really, John reminds the readers, the recipients,

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:39.060
he reminds us of our position in Christ.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.759
And you look at the first verse

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:42.099
of 1 John chapter number three,

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.939
and the Bible says,

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:46.240
behold, what manner of love the Father

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.159
hath bestowed upon us.

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:50.639
Aren't you thankful for the love of God?

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:54.360
And what a blessing to know that God so loved the world

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.000
that he gave his only begotten son,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.500
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.000
but have everlasting life.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And then we understand not only did he declare his love,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.360
but he demonstrated his love.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.839
For the Bible says that God commendeth his love toward us,

00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:10.680
and that while we were yet sinners,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.160
Christ died for us in Romans five and verse number eight.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.120
So right at the beginning of this third chapter

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.519
of the book of 1 John,

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:20.599
we're immediately confronted with the love of God.

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:23.160
Behold, what manner of love

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.800
the Father hath bestowed upon us.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.120
Notice what he says,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.120
that we should be called the sons of God.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.680
Think about our position as his son, as his child.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.199
And we find that, of course,

00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:37.720
as we've mentioned many times

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.480
as we've studied this particular book,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.800
the book of 1 John,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.080
the book is written to those that have trust at Christ

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.680
as their personal savior,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.220
those who have been born again.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.519
In fact, we'll see that term used a couple of times

00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:51.080
in our message this morning.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.500
And we find here that when he says

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.760
that we should be called the sons of God,

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:57.000
if you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.059
as your personal savior this morning,

00:01:59.059 --> 00:02:01.639
if you know for sure that heaven is your home,

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:05.160
God tells us that we are adopted into his family

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.320
and we are his sons, his children,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.000
and what an absolute blessing

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.759
to be reminded of our position.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:15.720
He continues and he says,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.199
therefore, the world knoweth us not.

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:20.240
Why? Because it knew him not.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.240
Now, immediately after he reminds the believers

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.119
of the love that God has for us

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:26.960
and our position in Christ,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.559
that we are the sons of God,

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:32.039
he then begins to deal with this subject matter

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:33.479
in verses two and three,

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:37.440
really with regard to the expectation of the believer.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.160
Because I'm his child, because I'm his son,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.199
because I belong to him,

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:43.399
we find that he says,

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:48.240
now, beloved, now are we the sons of God?

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.100
And it doth not yet appear what we shall be,

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.320
but we know that.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.399
Remember, throughout this book,

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:56.839
we read this word know and how we have the knowledge

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:58.960
God does not want us to be ignorant.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.720
It says, we know that when he shall appear,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.720
we shall be like him.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.720
For we shall see him as he is.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.600
And every man that hath this hope in him

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.039
purifies himself even as he is pure.

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:17.520
And so he immediately addresses the expectation

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.199
of the believer that he shall appear.

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:21.839
And I'm so thankful, in fact,

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.039
that in the preceding chapter in chapter two,

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:25.119
in verse number 28,

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:28.520
he uses that term of when he shall appear as well.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.399
And he says that we may have confidence

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:34.440
and not be ashamed before him at his coming.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.080
And so we find the connection

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.440
between the end of chapter two,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.080
the beginning of chapter number three,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.919
where we come to that third verse

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.559
of 1 John chapter number three.

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:45.440
And he says, listen, because we are the sons of God,

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.880
because we have this expectation,

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.360
it should have an impact in our lives and our behavior.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.559
He says, every man that hath this hope in him

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:02.559
purifies himself even as he is pure.

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:06.039
As we go further into chapter number three

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:08.000
and looking at verses four through 10,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.399
our text of scripture this morning,

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:13.320
we'll find that John is addressing

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.160
and really providing for us another litmus test.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.279
And we'll get to that

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.200
as we go through the message this morning.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.440
He's providing us with this contrast

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.959
in the text of scripture

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:25.160
between the one that doeth righteousness

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.600
and the one that committeth sin.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.239
Now we understand as we've mentioned,

00:04:29.239 --> 00:04:31.239
really, as you start the book of 1 John

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:33.079
in that first chapter,

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:34.839
that we still have the flesh

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:39.320
and we still have that old man, that sinful nature.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.880
I am thankful that as we have been born again,

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.459
if you're saved this morning,

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:46.079
you've been delivered from the penalty of sin.

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.279
And according to the word of God,

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:50.079
you've been delivered from the power of sin.

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:52.279
But the reality is that we've not yet been delivered

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:53.720
from the presence of sin.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.679
We know one day when we are with him,

00:04:56.679 --> 00:04:59.500
that we will be delivered from the very presence of sin.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.700
But as long as we're here upon this earth,

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.279
we deal with sin.

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:06.640
And we understand that the Bible does not teach,

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.000
and we'll go through this passage of scripture

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.239
this morning and deal with this.

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:12.519
He's not dealing with this idea

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:15.320
that some have given idea to

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.679
or thought to in the past

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:19.880
of reaching some place of sinless perfection.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.200
Rather, he's dealing with the behavior

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.119
of a believer in the change

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:29.420
because of who we are and what our expectation is.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.279
It's not possible that we're going to be sinless,

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:36.279
but the reality is that we should sin less and less

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:39.119
the closer we walk with the Lord.

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:41.540
And we find that for the believer,

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.720
that sin is not something that we can take joy in

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.540
and something that we delight in,

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.380
rather something that would cause us

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.000
to regret immediately after so doing.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.160
As we look at this passage of scripture

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.480
and we consider the impact of a believer,

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.200
of the belief of a believer and how it impacts their life,

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.980
we see it in our behavior here.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.339
Notice what he says at the beginning in verse number four.

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:08.179
It says this,

00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:12.880
whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.880
For sin is the transgression of the law.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.799
And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins

00:06:18.799 --> 00:06:20.480
and in him is no sin.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.200
Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.239
Whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.

00:06:27.239 --> 00:06:30.239
Little children, let no man deceive you.

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:33.160
He that doeth righteousness is righteous

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.600
even as he is righteous.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.559
He that committed sin is of the devil,

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:39.640
for the devil sinneth from the beginning.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.119
For this purpose, the Son of God was manifested

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:44.720
that he might destroy the works of the devil.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.239
Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin

00:06:47.239 --> 00:06:49.239
for his seed remaineth in him

00:06:49.239 --> 00:06:52.239
and he cannot sin because he is born of God.

00:06:52.239 --> 00:06:55.480
In this, the children of God are manifest

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.440
and the children of the devil.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.399
Whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God,

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:04.000
neither he that loveth not his brother.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.079
You'll notice in the middle of verse number seven,

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:07.760
actually the end of verse number seven,

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.559
the Bible says he that doeth righteousness is righteous.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.519
And I've used that for our text this evening,

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:15.799
or this morning for our title,

00:07:15.799 --> 00:07:18.200
for this passage of scripture, our message this morning.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.679
He that doeth righteousness is righteous.

00:07:22.679 --> 00:07:24.880
Several weeks ago on Sunday evening,

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.320
I preached a message from the book of Romans.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.200
And as I preached that message from the book of Romans,

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.760
I made this statement that they who have been declared

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.040
righteous are to live righteous lives.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.079
And we understand that through salvation,

00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:39.640
and as he's writing to believers here,

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.679
these that are called the sons of God,

00:07:41.679 --> 00:07:44.500
that we have been declared righteous.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.160
That's our position and what a joy to know

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.279
that we have the imputed righteousness

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:52.239
of the Lord Jesus Christ upon our account.

00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:54.220
And as we've been declared righteous,

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.480
we are to live righteous lives.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.959
Now it's interesting, perhaps you saw the warning

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:01.040
in verse number seven.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.959
It's of great interest to me that in the midst

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:06.359
of this passage of scripture, that God gives us a warning.

00:08:06.359 --> 00:08:08.799
Notice the warning right there in verse number seven.

00:08:08.799 --> 00:08:13.799
John says, little children, let no man deceive you.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.559
Let no man deceive you.

00:08:16.559 --> 00:08:19.760
Now, unfortunately, as we would consider this thought

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.760
of deception and we consider the thought of false teaching,

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.880
we understand that all the way back here in the first century

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.119
as God is using John to write this short epistle,

00:08:30.119 --> 00:08:32.760
that there were false teachers that were going about

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.039
seeking to deceive individuals.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.919
And we find that still today there are false teachers

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:39.960
that are running around that are seeking

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.880
to deceive the masses.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.119
And we find that specifically with regard to the context

00:08:45.119 --> 00:08:47.280
of this passage of scripture this morning,

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:52.280
that we would find that the deception is with regard to sin.

00:08:52.559 --> 00:08:55.559
There were many that would say, oh, don't worry about sin.

00:08:55.559 --> 00:08:57.239
Sin doesn't really matter.

00:08:58.559 --> 00:08:59.719
I beg to differ.

00:09:00.619 --> 00:09:01.700
I beg to differ.

00:09:02.799 --> 00:09:07.239
We find that yes, indeed, as we begin the third chapter

00:09:07.239 --> 00:09:10.760
of the book of 1 John, God's love is in focus.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.919
And I'm so thankful that God is love.

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:14.440
This book declares that.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.359
But understand this morning that God never,

00:09:18.359 --> 00:09:23.280
God never sacrifices His holiness on the altar of love.

00:09:24.159 --> 00:09:25.559
Never.

00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:27.479
I'm thankful that our God is gracious.

00:09:27.479 --> 00:09:30.880
Indeed, His grace is amazing.

00:09:32.359 --> 00:09:35.840
But the reality is that the grace of God

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.239
does not change the holiness of God.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.280
And there are many today that are seeking to deceive

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.280
in the same manner in which these false teachers

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.520
were seeking to deceive during the writing

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.880
of the book of 1 John.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.440
And that was to say, oh, God is love, and God is gracious,

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.880
and it doesn't really matter what you do.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.440
Do you remember what Paul said?

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.000
As Paul was writing to the believers in Rome

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.479
in Romans chapter four,

00:10:00.479 --> 00:10:04.759
chapter number 5, he mentions about the grace of God, and he says, but where sin

00:10:04.759 --> 00:10:10.919
abounded, grace did much more abound. And then he really is going to give an

00:10:10.919 --> 00:10:14.659
answer to a question that's not yet asked as he is writing under the

00:10:14.659 --> 00:10:17.639
inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, and the Bible says in chapter number 6

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:21.359
of the book of Romans, what shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace

00:10:21.359 --> 00:10:28.799
may abound? And the Bible says, God forbid. In the book of Jude, the Bible tells us

00:10:28.799 --> 00:10:34.639
that they turned the grace of God into lasciviousness. That's not a word that

00:10:34.639 --> 00:10:41.279
we use very often, but we understand that word means unbridled lust. They've turned

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:48.079
the grace of God into lasciviousness. And that form of false teaching continues to

00:10:48.079 --> 00:10:54.039
be prevalent to this very day. There are people all around this globe that are

00:10:54.039 --> 00:10:58.999
giving a false teaching with regard to the truth of this book. I am thankful

00:10:58.999 --> 00:11:02.799
that God is love, but I've often mentioned, and we will mention as we

00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:06.479
continue through the book of John and see many references to the love of God,

00:11:06.479 --> 00:11:14.319
I have often mentioned that God's love can best be described as protective, not

00:11:14.319 --> 00:11:21.959
as permissive. So many people today want to define the love of God as being

00:11:21.959 --> 00:11:28.239
permissive. God loves you, do whatever you want to do. God's love is best described

00:11:28.239 --> 00:11:33.599
as protective. Is there a parent among us this morning that would say that they love

00:11:33.599 --> 00:11:40.479
their child? Of course. Are you going to let your child do whatever they want to do because

00:11:40.479 --> 00:11:47.919
you love them? That would be foolish, right? So your love for your children is a protective

00:11:47.919 --> 00:11:54.959
love, such is the case with God's love. I want you to remember what Peter said in

00:11:54.959 --> 00:12:00.999
1 Peter 1, just a few pages over, and then we'll get right into the text of Scripture

00:12:00.999 --> 00:12:07.959
this morning. See, God is concerned about the behavior of His children. Our behavior

00:12:07.959 --> 00:12:14.199
matters to God. In 1 Peter 1, in verse 14, the Bible says,

00:12:14.199 --> 00:12:20.439
As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust and your ignorance,

00:12:20.439 --> 00:12:29.639
but as He which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation,

00:12:29.639 --> 00:12:36.439
because it is written, Be holy, for I am holy. See, we must understand that there's a balance

00:12:36.439 --> 00:12:42.039
within the Word of God, and His attributes, His character traits are always in perfect

00:12:42.039 --> 00:12:49.399
harmony. And we find that it is a popular message still even to this day to preach and

00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:54.079
to proclaim this God is love and do whatever you want to do, and you can get a great number

00:12:54.079 --> 00:12:59.679
of people because everything's just wishy-washy, you do whatever you want. But when you begin

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:05.159
to preach and teach what the Word of God actually says and the truth of sanctification and the

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:12.159
truth of our behavior, all of a sudden, people don't like that message so much. Nevertheless,

00:13:12.159 --> 00:13:17.359
it's true. And here we find as we look at the passage of Scripture, if you are taking

00:13:17.359 --> 00:13:23.079
notes, notice with me first of all that John speaks about sin. He speaks about sin. In

00:13:23.079 --> 00:13:32.399
verse number 4, notice what he says, Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law.

00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:39.639
Notice what he says, For sin is the transgression of the law. It's a very simple statement that

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:44.719
we find here in 1 John 3 and verse number 4 with regard to the definition or the description

00:13:44.719 --> 00:13:49.399
of sin. I would say this, as we look at verse number 4 and we understand that John speaks

00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:54.759
about sin, that we'd understand this morning that sin is awful. It is stated as being a

00:13:54.759 --> 00:14:03.759
transgression of the law, and we find that that literally means lawlessness. Lawlessness.

00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:09.679
And we find that here, as God is referring back to the truth of the Old Testament, we'd

00:14:09.679 --> 00:14:14.259
be familiar with the law even as we've studied the Old Testament, and we find that He's giving

00:14:14.259 --> 00:14:20.719
the clarity with regard to what is sin, and He speaks about sin. We understand this morning

00:14:20.719 --> 00:14:27.239
that the law, it reveals sin. In fact, Paul says this, If it had not been for the law,

00:14:27.239 --> 00:14:33.439
I would not have known sin, in Romans chapter number 7. But because the law says, and I

00:14:33.439 --> 00:14:39.639
look at my behavior, I find out that I'm a transgressor of God's law. And we find here

00:14:39.639 --> 00:14:45.139
this morning that sin is being spoken of. We know that sin has been dealt with earlier

00:14:45.139 --> 00:14:50.559
in the chapters of the book of 1 John. Remember, the Bible said this in 1 John chapter number

00:14:50.559 --> 00:14:56.879
1 with regard to sin. He says if we say in verse number 8 that we have no sin, we deceive

00:14:56.879 --> 00:15:05.359
ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just

00:15:05.359 --> 00:15:10.539
to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we've

00:15:10.539 --> 00:15:15.199
not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us. And then remember this truth

00:15:15.199 --> 00:15:20.859
of 1 John 2 in verse number 1, My little children, these things write I unto you that

00:15:20.859 --> 00:15:29.659
you sin not. That's the goal. Amen? However, I am so thankful for the entirety of verse

00:15:29.659 --> 00:15:34.159
number 1 of 1 John 2 because the goal is that we sin not. But have you found it in your

00:15:34.159 --> 00:15:43.439
life that you sin? The goal is to sin not. But the reality is that we sin. You may have

00:15:43.439 --> 00:15:57.199
sinned this morning. We probably did. Amen? And it says this, and if any man sin, we have

00:15:57.199 --> 00:16:08.319
an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. Perfect defense attorney. Amen?

00:16:08.599 --> 00:16:15.679
Every time the accuser of the brethren brings up charges against us, our advocate, Jesus,

00:16:15.679 --> 00:16:24.839
says, yes, He's guilty. He doesn't try to defend our innocence for we are guilty. But

00:16:24.839 --> 00:16:34.199
He says, I paid for it. Isn't that awesome? Yes, He's guilty, but it's under the blood.

00:16:34.199 --> 00:16:39.759
It's been paid for. We have an advocate with the Father. And we find here in 1 John chapter

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:46.439
number 3 that He's speaking about sin. It is the transgression of the law. It is lawlessness.

00:16:46.439 --> 00:16:50.959
We find that the law reveals sin to us. Notice in the text of Scripture that the Bible teaches

00:16:50.959 --> 00:16:57.639
us that Satan himself is the author of sin. God is not the author of sin. Satan is the

00:16:57.639 --> 00:17:03.999
author of sin. Notice in verse number 8, He that committeth sin is of the devil. For the

00:17:03.999 --> 00:17:12.599
devil sinneth from the beginning. He said, I will be like the Most High. He wanted to

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:18.879
be like God. He wanted to be God. We find that here the Scriptures tell us that Satan

00:17:18.879 --> 00:17:23.759
is the author of sin, and he that committeth sin is of the devil. For the devil sinneth

00:17:23.759 --> 00:17:28.879
from the beginning. You'll remember that Jesus said this during His earthly ministry as He's

00:17:28.879 --> 00:17:34.199
ministering there, and He mentions about those that, of course, the religious leaders

00:17:34.199 --> 00:17:39.239
of the day, and He speaks to them about their father, the devil. And He speaks this in John

00:17:39.239 --> 00:17:43.599
8 and verse number 44, the year of your father, the devil, and the lust of your father you

00:17:43.599 --> 00:17:48.839
will do. He was a murderer from the beginning and a boat not in the truth. Why? Because

00:17:48.839 --> 00:17:56.559
there is no truth in Him. When He speaketh a lie, He speaketh of His own, for He is a

00:17:56.559 --> 00:18:04.399
liar and the father of it in John 8 and verse 44. So we see that John, He makes the statement,

00:18:04.399 --> 00:18:09.039
He speaks of sin, but I want you to notice very quickly that not only He doesn't stay

00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:15.799
there. He then speaks, number two, of our Savior. We have a wonderful Savior. And we

00:18:15.799 --> 00:18:19.839
consider this morning as we look at the text of Scripture what was accomplished on that

00:18:19.839 --> 00:18:25.399
cruel cross, what was accomplished at Calvary because of sin. We understand that it was

00:18:25.399 --> 00:18:29.799
sin that sent our Savior there, but we notice as we look at this text of Scripture that

00:18:29.799 --> 00:18:34.919
John quickly moves on and He begins to speak of our Savior, and we find in verse number

00:18:34.919 --> 00:18:39.880
five He reveals to us as He's speaking of our Savior that He was manifest, that He came

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:46.959
for this purpose, notice, to take away our sins. Isn't that wonderful? Notice in verse

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:51.679
number five, and ye know. Now I'm thankful for that again as we note that He's writing

00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:56.919
to believers, He's writing to these that have received the gospel, that have been saved,

00:18:56.919 --> 00:19:03.959
and He says, ye know, you have this knowledge, you know that He, Jesus, was manifested to

00:19:03.959 --> 00:19:18.559
take away our sins. And in Him is no sin. We understand that He is perfect. He is sinless.

00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:24.919
The just for the unjust. We find here that in this text of Scripture that John is saying

00:19:24.919 --> 00:19:30.320
that we had a perfect substitute. See, the reality is that I'm a sinful man and you are

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:36.279
sinful people. I cannot pay for your sins and you cannot pay for my sins. But God in

00:19:36.279 --> 00:19:42.760
flesh, the Lord Jesus Christ, He was manifest, He came to the sin-cursed world, He left the

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:49.799
glory of heaven, He lived in this wicked world, and He walked perfectly. He never sinned.

00:19:49.799 --> 00:19:56.679
And He went to that cruel cross and He bled and He died. Why? To take away our sins. He

00:19:56.679 --> 00:20:00.479
was buried in a borrowed tomb and He rose conquering

00:20:00.479 --> 00:20:06.559
death, sin, and the grave. He lives forevermore. He's coming again. We rejoice

00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:12.199
because we serve a risen Savior, and we find this morning that John is reminding

00:20:12.199 --> 00:20:18.679
his readers, he's reminding them that Jesus took away our sins, and we ought to

00:20:18.679 --> 00:20:25.439
rejoice in that. What can wash away my sin, the songwriter said?

00:20:25.439 --> 00:20:34.119
Nothing but the blood of Jesus. Amen? What can make me whole again? Nothing but

00:20:34.119 --> 00:20:40.119
the blood of Jesus. Oh precious is that fount. Aren't you so thankful for the

00:20:40.119 --> 00:20:47.679
blood of Christ that was shed to pay for the sin of mankind? You know, this morning

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:55.359
sin is a universal condition that mankind has. It's universal. There's not

00:20:55.359 --> 00:20:59.599
a just man upon the face of the earth, for all have sinned and come short of

00:20:59.599 --> 00:21:05.439
the glory of God. Right? It's what the Word of God says. So sin is a universal

00:21:05.439 --> 00:21:10.919
condition. Every single human being that you see, that I see, has the same

00:21:10.919 --> 00:21:20.759
condition that we have. Sin. What makes me different? Mine's been forgiven. I know

00:21:20.759 --> 00:21:31.039
that He came. I have the knowledge. He came and He took away our sins. Wow, what

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:37.279
joy. 2 Corinthians 5 verse 21 says that He, God, hath made Him, Christ, to be sin

00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:45.759
for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.

00:21:45.759 --> 00:21:51.319
Man, what a transaction that took place. The songwriter said it's not in our

00:21:51.319 --> 00:21:55.999
songbook. Many of you might be familiar with it. The old account was settled long

00:21:55.999 --> 00:22:04.079
ago. The old account was settled. The transaction was completed. Jesus said it

00:22:04.079 --> 00:22:09.119
is finished. It was paid in full. He paid for our sins. I mentioned earlier, but

00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:12.799
there in 1 Peter chapter 3 and verse number 18, the Bible says, for Christ also

00:22:12.799 --> 00:22:19.359
hath once suffered for our sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to

00:22:19.359 --> 00:22:27.399
God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit. Notice not only

00:22:27.399 --> 00:22:31.119
as He speaks of our Savior here in 1 John chapter number 3, does He remind

00:22:31.719 --> 00:22:35.439
the recipients, does He remind us this morning that He took away our sins, that

00:22:35.439 --> 00:22:39.239
was accomplished at the cross of Calvary, but I want you to notice as well that He

00:22:39.239 --> 00:22:43.719
destroyed the works of the devil. Notice in verse number 8, the Bible says, He that

00:22:43.719 --> 00:22:47.759
committeth sin is of the devil, for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this

00:22:47.759 --> 00:22:55.359
purpose, the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the

00:22:55.359 --> 00:23:02.239
devil. Satan did everything he could do throughout history to prevent Messiah

00:23:02.239 --> 00:23:09.479
from coming and from going to that cruel cross. He did everything he could. You

00:23:09.479 --> 00:23:12.999
read in the Old Testament, you read about the various plots against the nation of

00:23:12.999 --> 00:23:18.399
Israel, you read against the attacks against the lineage, the line, you find

00:23:18.399 --> 00:23:24.479
that it's all an attack upon Messiah. You read about Haman's wicked plan in the

00:23:24.479 --> 00:23:31.119
book of Esther to annihilate the entirety of the Jewish race. Why? So that no Messiah

00:23:31.119 --> 00:23:40.479
could come. He tried to kill Him multiple times during His earthly ministry. You can

00:23:40.479 --> 00:23:47.119
read various portions in the Gospels where they tried to kill Him. Satan was behind it,

00:23:47.119 --> 00:23:56.199
no doubt. But He declares in John 17, the hour has come. It was time. And He goes to

00:23:56.199 --> 00:24:01.399
that cross. And I can almost see in my mind's eye that Satan begins to triumph, thinking

00:24:01.399 --> 00:24:08.239
he's won the victory. After he died and he was put in that borrowed tomb, they set

00:24:08.239 --> 00:24:13.599
a seal. Remember, they kept watch and they made it as sure as they could. But there was

00:24:13.599 --> 00:24:21.239
nothing that could keep them from rising and conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:24:21.239 --> 00:24:27.119
He destroyed the works of the devil. And we understand as we look at this verse of

00:24:27.119 --> 00:24:32.839
Scripture and this truth that God is giving us with regard to the work that God did there

00:24:32.839 --> 00:24:42.999
at Calvary, and He's rendered this truth of destroying, it's rendered powerless.

00:24:42.999 --> 00:24:45.799
Notice what the Bible says, if you will, over in the book of Colossians in chapter

00:24:45.799 --> 00:24:52.359
number 2 and verse number 15 with regard to this truth of Christ destroying the works

00:24:52.359 --> 00:24:58.759
of the devil. In Colossians 2 and verse number 15, the Bible, I'll read verse 14 with it.

00:24:58.759 --> 00:25:06.239
Notice what He says here in verse number 14 of Colossians chapter number 2. He says this,

00:25:06.239 --> 00:25:11.259
blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to

00:25:11.259 --> 00:25:17.979
us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His cross. And having spoiled principalities

00:25:17.979 --> 00:25:26.079
and powers, He made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it. And then the book

00:25:26.079 --> 00:25:32.919
of Hebrews says this in Hebrews chapter number 2. Notice what the Word of God says there.

00:25:32.919 --> 00:25:43.519
In Hebrews chapter number 2 and verse number 14, He says this, for as much then as the

00:25:43.519 --> 00:25:48.559
children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the

00:25:48.559 --> 00:25:56.999
same, that through death He might destroy him that had the power of death. In case you

00:25:56.999 --> 00:26:01.399
don't know who that is, that is the devil, He says at the end of the verse. That way

00:26:01.399 --> 00:26:08.119
we'd have clarity and understanding. And so we find that Jesus, He came in the form

00:26:08.119 --> 00:26:13.959
of sinful man. He Himself was not sinful, but He took upon Himself the form of a servant,

00:26:13.959 --> 00:26:18.359
the form of man, came in the likeness of man, and He went, He humbled Himself, He went to

00:26:18.359 --> 00:26:23.239
that cruel cross, and we find that He not only took away our sins, but He destroyed

00:26:23.239 --> 00:26:32.199
the works of the devil. Can I say it this way, back in 1 John chapter 3, as John speaks

00:26:32.199 --> 00:26:39.919
of our Savior and what was accomplished there at Calvary, we find the truth of redemption.

00:26:39.919 --> 00:26:48.879
Notice what He says in verse number 9. He says this, whosoever is born of God doth not

00:26:48.999 --> 00:26:56.439
commit sin, for his seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin because he is born of God.

00:26:56.439 --> 00:27:01.039
You see two references in verse number 9 to this thought of born of God. And when you

00:27:01.039 --> 00:27:06.719
think about this truth of born of God, we have in view here the second birth, the truth

00:27:06.719 --> 00:27:12.319
is Jesus said to Nicodemus, you must be born again. And we find that when we speak about

00:27:12.319 --> 00:27:17.599
being born again, we'd understand that we've used this terminology before that we all have

00:27:17.599 --> 00:27:22.519
a physical birth, but what's most important is whether we have a spiritual birth. To be

00:27:22.519 --> 00:27:28.199
born once is to die twice, because you'll die a physical death and you die a spiritual

00:27:28.199 --> 00:27:32.999
death, but to be born twice is to die just once, because you're born of the flesh and

00:27:32.999 --> 00:27:38.759
you're born of the Spirit, and you'll just die once, a fleshly death.

00:27:38.759 --> 00:27:44.479
The reality this morning is that as we understand the redemption that was made possible through

00:27:44.479 --> 00:27:50.159
the work at Christ at Calvary, that which was accomplished for us to be born again,

00:27:50.159 --> 00:27:55.239
he says here that we're born of God, but then notice this, for his seed remaineth in him,

00:27:55.239 --> 00:28:00.319
right in the middle of the verse in 1 John 3 and verse number 9, and it reminds us not

00:28:00.319 --> 00:28:06.999
only when we think about this second birth, the new seed, the new nature. We find that

00:28:06.999 --> 00:28:12.199
in 1 Peter chapter number 1, just a few pages over, I want you to remember what Peter said

00:28:12.199 --> 00:28:20.159
with regard to our redemption. In 1 Peter 1, beginning in verse number 18, Peter says

00:28:20.159 --> 00:28:25.319
this, for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver

00:28:25.319 --> 00:28:32.839
and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers. Nope, no silver,

00:28:32.839 --> 00:28:40.799
no gold could redeem mankind, but, verse 19, with the precious blood of Christ, as of a

00:28:40.799 --> 00:28:45.599
lamb without blemish and without spot, who verily was foreordained before the foundation

00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:55.159
of the world, but was manifest in these last times, notice that phrase, for you, for you,

00:28:55.159 --> 00:29:01.760
who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:06.399
faith and hope might be in God, seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth

00:29:06.399 --> 00:29:10.079
through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that you love one another

00:29:10.079 --> 00:29:15.519
with a pure heart fervently, notice this in verse 23, being born again not of corruptible

00:29:15.519 --> 00:29:24.639
seed but of incorruptible, by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever. In 2

00:29:24.639 --> 00:29:30.079
Peter 1 and verse number 4, notice what he says here with regard to this truth of redemption

00:29:30.079 --> 00:29:35.779
and being born again. He says this in 2 Peter 1 and verse number 4, whereby are given unto

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:41.299
us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers, notice this,

00:29:41.299 --> 00:29:50.299
of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And as

00:29:50.299 --> 00:29:56.019
we've been born again, we see this seed that is mentioned in verse number 9 of 1 John 3

00:29:56.019 --> 00:30:00.459
because we're born of God, his seed remaineth in us.

00:30:00.459 --> 00:30:06.579
understand here that we have been born again. We have this new seed, this new nature, this

00:30:06.579 --> 00:30:14.819
second birth. And so John speaks of sin. He speaks of our Savior. When he speaks of our

00:30:14.819 --> 00:30:19.299
Savior, he says, I want to remind you of what was accomplished at Calvary. I want to remind

00:30:19.299 --> 00:30:24.699
you why He came. And you know this, but I want to remind you that He came first to take

00:30:24.699 --> 00:30:31.619
away our sins. He came to destroy the works of the devil. He came to redeem mankind. The

00:30:31.619 --> 00:30:38.179
Bible says that the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost. He's a seeking

00:30:38.179 --> 00:30:42.899
Savior. Listen, if you don't know the Lord Jesus Christ is your personal Savior this

00:30:42.899 --> 00:30:48.539
morning, He wants to save you. He wants to be your Savior. He wants to be your Redeemer.

00:30:48.539 --> 00:30:55.339
He loves you. He loves you beyond what you could ever imagine. Not only does He love

00:30:55.339 --> 00:31:02.339
you, but He died for you. He took your place, the perfect substitute. The atonement was

00:31:02.339 --> 00:31:08.939
made. You say, I'm going to try to figure it out myself. You could never pay the debt

00:31:08.939 --> 00:31:17.299
that you owe. It's absolutely impossible. We are not redeemed with silver and gold as

00:31:17.339 --> 00:31:24.339
we read there in 1 Peter chapter 2. We understand in chapter 1, excuse me, in verse 18, we understand

00:31:24.939 --> 00:31:30.539
that it's not by works of righteousness which we have done. It's according to His mercy

00:31:30.539 --> 00:31:35.859
that He hath begotten us. For by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves.

00:31:35.859 --> 00:31:41.259
It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. And this morning the

00:31:41.259 --> 00:31:48.019
plan of redemption that we so hold dear is being reminded to the believers here that

00:31:48.019 --> 00:31:52.699
John is writing to and to us as well this morning. So He speaks of sin, He speaks of

00:31:52.699 --> 00:31:59.699
our Savior, He then speaks of our sanctification. Notice in the text of Scripture, we find that

00:32:00.699 --> 00:32:06.299
John begins to address the subject of sanctification. It's once again necessary for us to point

00:32:06.299 --> 00:32:12.179
out as we did, we saw this first in 1 John chapter 2 verses 3 through 6, and as we looked

00:32:12.179 --> 00:32:16.819
at that passage of Scripture, I took some time to explain to you the verb tense in these

00:32:16.819 --> 00:32:22.219
particular verses, and we see it again in our passage of Scripture before us this morning.

00:32:22.219 --> 00:32:26.539
Sometimes it's challenging to get the sense of the verb, but we find here that in this

00:32:26.539 --> 00:32:32.099
passage of Scripture, just as it was in 1 John chapter 2 verses 3 through 6, that the

00:32:32.099 --> 00:32:38.619
conjugation of the verb indicates an ongoing action. And it's important for us to understand

00:32:38.619 --> 00:32:44.659
that because He says here, whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not. So some would take and

00:32:44.659 --> 00:32:50.259
say, okay, well that means you could never commit a sin. But it's talking about this

00:32:50.259 --> 00:32:57.259
because of the conjugation of the verb, it indicates that ongoing action, that lifestyle,

00:32:57.419 --> 00:33:04.299
that behavior that is prevalent. And so He says, as He begins to speak about our sanctification,

00:33:04.299 --> 00:33:09.979
I want you to see first of all that He immediately deals with the subject of abiding in verse

00:33:09.979 --> 00:33:16.979
number 6. Whosoever abideth in Him. Now think about John writing these words. John the apostle,

00:33:19.259 --> 00:33:25.699
he heard the Lord Jesus Christ speak in John 15 with regard to the truth of abide in me.

00:33:26.499 --> 00:33:33.499
And we find here that John immediately addresses the subject of abiding and he says this, that

00:33:33.539 --> 00:33:39.619
whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not, whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him, neither known Him.

00:33:39.619 --> 00:33:43.979
Little children, let no man deceive you. He that doeth righteousness is righteous, even

00:33:43.979 --> 00:33:48.419
as He is righteous. He that committed sin is of the devil, for the devil sinneth from

00:33:48.419 --> 00:33:52.459
the beginning. Skip down if you will to verse number 9. Whosoever is born of God doth not

00:33:52.459 --> 00:33:58.139
commit sin, for his seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin because he is born of God.

00:33:58.139 --> 00:34:02.299
In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. Whosoever doeth

00:34:02.299 --> 00:34:07.179
not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. And really that's

00:34:07.179 --> 00:34:12.259
a segue into the next text of scripture that we'll study next week with regard to loving

00:34:12.259 --> 00:34:17.739
the brethren there at the end of verse number 10. But we find here this morning that both

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:25.979
salvation and sanctification are of Christ. It's of Christ. Sometimes what happens is

00:34:25.979 --> 00:34:32.419
we are saved, for by grace we are saved through faith. We understand that salvation is all

00:34:32.419 --> 00:34:38.179
of Christ. Right? There's nothing I can do. I can't save myself. But somehow we get to

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:45.419
the point that we think sanctification is about me. And I'm trying, trying, trying,

00:34:45.819 --> 00:34:52.019
this process of sanctification, and I'm really trying in my own flesh. Do you remember what

00:34:52.019 --> 00:34:58.259
Paul said in Romans chapter number 7? He said, the things that I would, I do not. The things

00:34:58.259 --> 00:35:05.419
that I would not, that I do. Right? Paul's saying, I got this struggle going on, and

00:35:05.419 --> 00:35:09.979
I have this difficulty and all of this that's going on. And he says, who shall deliver me?

00:35:09.979 --> 00:35:15.379
And he says, I thank God through Christ Jesus. Listen, sanctification is about the work of

00:35:15.379 --> 00:35:24.099
the Holy Spirit of God, the work of Christ in us. It's not me trying, it's me yielding.

00:35:24.099 --> 00:35:31.059
Right? And as I yield my members, as he says there in Romans 6, 7, and 8, and you read

00:35:31.059 --> 00:35:36.359
those passages of Scripture and you see how Paul is really giving a great dissortation

00:35:36.359 --> 00:35:40.479
on the subject of sanctification there in the middle of the book of Romans, here we

00:35:40.479 --> 00:35:47.199
find that John is just simply talking about stating here quickly the subject of sanctification

00:35:47.199 --> 00:35:53.399
and the work that Christ does in us. Noah Webster in his 1828 Webster's Dictionary defines

00:35:53.399 --> 00:36:02.719
sanctification this way, the act of God's grace by which the affections of men are purified

00:36:02.719 --> 00:36:12.279
or alienated, it says this, from sin and the world and exalted to a supreme love to

00:36:12.279 --> 00:36:19.819
God. That's a great definition. Let me read it one more time. The act of God's grace by

00:36:19.819 --> 00:36:28.359
which the affections of men are purified or alienated from sin and the world and exalted

00:36:28.359 --> 00:36:36.279
to a supreme love to God. That helps us understand the passage of Scripture and what's being

00:36:36.279 --> 00:36:42.839
dealt with here with the subject of sanctification and the work that Christ is doing in us. Note

00:36:42.839 --> 00:36:48.519
that he, Noah Webster, in fact, when you look at that dictionary, you'll see so many references

00:36:48.519 --> 00:36:55.579
to the Word of God. And you find here that he speaks about God's grace by which the affections

00:36:55.579 --> 00:36:59.699
of men are purified. Remember what he said in verse number 3, and every man that hath

00:36:59.699 --> 00:37:06.259
this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure. He says this, or alienate it from

00:37:06.259 --> 00:37:11.259
sin and the world. We see the discussion of sin here in this text of Scripture. And we

00:37:11.259 --> 00:37:17.819
find that as we look here at this passage, and again, note a litmus test, if you will,

00:37:17.819 --> 00:37:22.539
that John provides to his readers. We've seen this in previous texts of Scripture, and we

00:37:22.539 --> 00:37:27.219
understand that these tests are really to be self-administered. We like to give the

00:37:27.219 --> 00:37:34.059
test to other people. As I said to someone, I'd rather evaluate your life and you'd rather

00:37:34.059 --> 00:37:41.099
evaluate my life because the process of self-evaluation is not very pleasant. But the Scriptures say,

00:37:41.099 --> 00:37:49.339
but let a man examine himself. Amen? And so we find here that here what is being contrasted

00:37:49.499 --> 00:37:55.019
is really the children of God versus the children of the devil. Look in verse number 10. It says,

00:37:55.019 --> 00:38:04.739
in this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil. So we see on one

00:38:04.739 --> 00:38:07.899
side the children of God, on the other the children of the devil. He says that they're

00:38:07.899 --> 00:38:15.059
manifest. That means to be plainly recognized or known. In this, the children of God are manifest

00:38:15.179 --> 00:38:20.659
and the children of the devil. So here's the litmus test. Again, the verb tense is important

00:38:20.659 --> 00:38:26.459
for us to understand because it carries with it the idea of a continual or habitual practice. It's

00:38:26.459 --> 00:38:33.499
not saying that a believer will never sin, but sin is not going to be the pattern in our lives. Why?

00:38:33.499 --> 00:38:39.859
Because the Holy Spirit of God lives within us. Listen, it's not saying that a sinning person

00:38:39.899 --> 00:38:46.179
isn't going to, excuse me, let me say it this way. It's not suggesting that a lost person is

00:38:46.179 --> 00:38:55.099
never going to, by happenstance, fulfill something in the law. Right? How many times I've heard people

00:38:55.099 --> 00:38:59.579
say, are you a sinner? I've never murdered anybody. Well, I mean, I'm glad you didn't

00:38:59.579 --> 00:39:06.219
murder somebody. That doesn't mean that you're not a sinner. Right? And we find here that the

00:39:06.219 --> 00:39:14.419
reality is that, listen, lost men occasionally are going to obey the law. So it's not saying by

00:39:14.419 --> 00:39:20.259
their occasional obedience, their occasional righteousness, that that makes them a child of

00:39:20.259 --> 00:39:27.379
God. In like way, or in the same way, it does not mean that the believer, the child of God,

00:39:27.379 --> 00:39:37.379
that has the occasional sin is not saved. It's the process of sanctification. It's the truth that

00:39:37.379 --> 00:39:43.579
God has given to us. Really, Jesus said it this way, and we're familiar with this truth in Matthew

00:39:43.579 --> 00:39:50.299
7 and verse number 20, when He said, wherefore, by their fruits ye shall know them. Ye shall know

00:39:50.299 --> 00:40:00.339
them. Listen, if you're a child of God this morning, if you've been born again, the Lord

00:40:00.339 --> 00:40:16.699
has put a desire in you to please Him. To have seen Him is to love Him. To love Him

00:40:16.699 --> 00:40:26.459
is to want to please Him. And to please Him, there's no room for sin. Right? Again, I'm

00:40:26.459 --> 00:40:29.679
not saying, and neither is John, the Word of God is not saying that we're never going

00:40:29.679 --> 00:40:33.759
to sin because we understand that we're going to sin. And if we do, we have an advocate

00:40:33.759 --> 00:40:39.119
with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and

00:40:39.119 --> 00:40:43.319
just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. And so He's not suggesting

00:40:43.319 --> 00:40:47.479
that we're never going to sin. He's simply saying, it's not going to be a pattern in

00:40:47.479 --> 00:40:53.939
your life. It's not going to be habitual, continual. It's not going to be that you're

00:40:53.939 --> 00:40:59.899
going to have this enjoying sin for all the days of your life. It's not this idea, as

00:40:59.899 --> 00:41:06.259
some have said, that, well, I got saved. I got my get out of the fire free kind of card

00:41:06.259 --> 00:41:15.619
and now I can live however I want to live. That's not real salvation. Because God does

00:41:15.619 --> 00:41:22.859
a work in us. We spoke about this in 1 John chapter number 2. We talked about this. Notice

00:41:22.899 --> 00:41:27.419
if you will, go back there just for a moment in verse number 5. But whoso keepeth his word

00:41:27.419 --> 00:41:34.099
in him verily is the love of God perfected. Hereby know we that we are in him. And we

00:41:34.099 --> 00:41:39.539
looked at that verse of Scripture and we talked about the work that God is doing in us. Something

00:41:39.539 --> 00:41:44.859
amazing happens when we get saved. The Holy Spirit of God lives within us. And it begins

00:41:44.859 --> 00:41:52.059
to work in our hearts and our lives. All of a sudden, those things that we did, we have

00:41:52.059 --> 00:41:58.019
less of a desire to do them. Why? Because the Holy Spirit of God begins to convict us.

00:41:58.019 --> 00:42:04.799
The Holy Spirit of God begins to convict us that that behavior is not pleasing to God.

00:42:04.799 --> 00:42:09.859
And as we yield to the Spirit of God in our lives, as we yield our lives to him as we

00:42:09.859 --> 00:42:15.179
grow is this process of sanctification. I'm thankful for positional sanctification, but

00:42:15.179 --> 00:42:20.379
the reality is that we're dealing with progressive sanctification. We're dealing with this walk

00:42:20.419 --> 00:42:26.139
with Christ all the days of our lives. And this continual growth, and the closer I get

00:42:26.139 --> 00:42:33.139
to him, the less I want to displease him. I don't want to do that which is displeasing

00:42:33.579 --> 00:42:40.579
to my God. I don't want to be engaged in sinful behavior. So when he says, whosoever abideth

00:42:40.859 --> 00:42:45.819
in him sinneth not, I want you to think about this in verse number 6. As you're abiding

00:42:45.819 --> 00:42:50.939
in him, as you're walking with him, as you're in daily fellowship with him, does that not

00:42:50.939 --> 00:42:57.939
have an impact on your behavior? Let me illustrate it simply by talking about a child this morning,

00:42:58.459 --> 00:43:03.459
a child that is in your presence. Parents, your children are there with you. They're

00:43:03.459 --> 00:43:09.419
in your presence. You're walking with them. How does your presence affect their behavior?

00:43:09.419 --> 00:43:16.419
Probably positively, right? Normally, listen, I never took a cookie from the cookie jar

00:43:16.659 --> 00:43:23.659
when my mom was watching me. That'd just be dumb. But when she wasn't watching, cookies

00:43:30.059 --> 00:43:37.059
are available, right? Why? Because she wasn't present. I use Zachary as an example. I use

00:43:39.539 --> 00:43:42.939
Zachary as an illustration. He was eating a donut yesterday and he was trying to hide

00:43:42.939 --> 00:43:47.739
it. It was so cute. He was trying to hide eating his donut, but he had chocolate all

00:43:47.739 --> 00:43:53.259
over the side of his mouth. Right? Didn't he? I said, well, Zachary, if you're going

00:43:53.259 --> 00:43:58.339
to hide that donut, you better get rid of that chocolate. He wasn't hiding it from

00:43:58.339 --> 00:44:05.059
Pierre and Kimberly, just for the record. They knew he was eating it. But the reality

00:44:05.059 --> 00:44:11.259
is that when we're abiding in him, it's going to impact our behavior. Why? Because we're

00:44:11.259 --> 00:44:17.939
living in his presence. I believe that's what we find the secret in the life of Joseph.

00:44:17.939 --> 00:44:22.219
When you go back to the book of Genesis and you read the life of Joseph, he's in a foreign

00:44:22.219 --> 00:44:28.699
land, in a foreign place, a different culture, a different language. He's been sold. He's

00:44:28.699 --> 00:44:35.619
been, I mean, it's a mess of what's happened. And day by day, Potiphar's wife comes and

00:44:35.619 --> 00:44:41.979
says, lie with me. But I believe with all of my heart that Joseph lived in the presence

00:44:41.979 --> 00:44:49.359
of God. Because when Potiphar's wife said, perfect opportunity, nobody's here. He said,

00:44:49.359 --> 00:44:57.639
how can I sin and do this great wickedness against God? He lived in the presence of God.

00:44:57.639 --> 00:45:03.299
From a New Testament perspective, we could say that he was abiding. And when we're abiding

00:45:03.299 --> 00:45:08.979
in him, when we're walking with Christ, when we're living in his presence, it's going to

00:45:08.979 --> 00:45:19.619
impact our behavior. Can I remind you this morning that Jesus is always with you? It

00:45:19.619 --> 00:45:25.919
just needs to be a reminder for us that we're in his presence. We're abiding in him. How

00:45:25.919 --> 00:45:32.539
many times have we driven down the highway and people are just cruising along? I mean,

00:45:32.539 --> 00:45:38.559
just flying. I've said to the kids, Joseph just got his permit on Wednesday. I've said

00:45:38.559 --> 00:45:42.899
to all of them as we've driven over the years, man, I'm going seven miles an hour over the

00:45:42.899 --> 00:45:47.619
speed limit and these people are just flying past me like I'm sitting still. Right? You

00:45:47.619 --> 00:45:55.379
guys experienced that, right? But then all of a sudden they see one of those police cars.

00:45:55.379 --> 00:46:02.139
Have you seen it? What happens? Everyone wants to hit their brake and get over. Now

00:46:02.139 --> 00:46:07.919
my understanding is that they've already seen that you're speeding before you saw them.

00:46:07.919 --> 00:46:18.299
Is that right? That's right. Their LIDAR is better than your eyesight. But why do people

00:46:18.299 --> 00:46:26.279
behave that way? Because the presence of that law enforcement officer is a reminder

00:46:26.279 --> 00:46:33.839
that they're breaking the law and they need to correct their behavior. Right? We see it

00:46:33.839 --> 00:46:42.599
in life. But spiritually speaking, we need to abide in him. And as we abide in him, as

00:46:42.599 --> 00:46:48.519
we think about this truth of sanctification, we're going to, no, not be sinless, but we're

00:46:48.519 --> 00:46:57.539
going to sin less and less. Why? Because I'm living in his presence. This morning, when

00:46:57.539 --> 00:47:04.179
you think of sin, that was the first thing that John spoke of. Remember that sin is awful.

00:47:04.179 --> 00:47:11.899
The second thing, when you think of our Savior, rejoice in what was accomplished. Taking our

00:47:11.899 --> 00:47:17.999
sins out of the way, destroying the works of the devil, providing redemption. And when

00:47:17.999 --> 00:47:26.679
you think of sanctification, remember this morning that it requires abiding. So often

00:47:26.679 --> 00:47:33.599
we're trying to do it ourselves. We can't save ourselves. And we need God's grace in

00:47:33.599 --> 00:47:40.359
this area of sanctification. Because the more I try, the more frustrated I become. And the

00:47:40.359 --> 00:47:45.639
more I echo the words of Paul, the things that I would, I do not. And the things that

00:47:45.639 --> 00:47:50.559
I would not, that I do. Let's pray together. Father, we love you this morning. We thank

00:47:50.559 --> 00:47:56.319
you for loving us. We thank you for the Word of God. We thank you for the passage of Scripture.

00:47:56.319 --> 00:48:01.399
And God, I pray that you'd help us, those of us that are saved, that have been born

00:48:01.399 --> 00:48:09.159
again, declared righteous, that we would live righteous lives. I pray this morning that

00:48:09.159 --> 00:48:12.959
if there's one that's not sure of heaven, God, I pray that today would be the day of

00:48:12.959 --> 00:48:22.739
their salvation, that they would understand that you loved them, that you died for them,

00:48:22.739 --> 00:48:32.919
that you rose again conquering sin, death, and the grave. The only way to heaven is through

00:48:32.919 --> 00:48:39.079
the Lord Jesus Christ. Neither is there salvation in any other, for there's no other name given

00:48:39.079 --> 00:48:45.319
among men whereby we must be saved. God, I pray that if there's one not sure of heaven,

00:48:45.319 --> 00:48:52.359
they'd get that settled this morning. Father, for those of us that are your children, would

00:48:52.359 --> 00:48:59.399
you help us in this process, this process of sanctification? I'm thankful that salvation

00:48:59.399 --> 00:49:05.719
is the miracle of a moment, but as someone said, sanctification is the process of a lifetime.

00:49:06.679 --> 00:49:12.959
God, would you help us to abide in you? Would you help us to yield ourselves to thee? God,

00:49:12.959 --> 00:49:19.279
would you help us to walk daily in your presence so that we would sin less and less, that we

00:49:19.279 --> 00:49:25.599
would do righteousness, that we'd live and lead lives that are pleasing in thy sight?

00:49:25.599 --> 00:49:29.159
Well, thank you for the work that you'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray.
