WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
36 this evening, the book of Genesis. We're back to this

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.359
study through the book of Genesis and Genesis chapter 36. We'll look at the

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:09.560
entire chapter

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.079
and this is lesson number 77. If you keep track of what lesson number they

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.399
are in the book of Genesis, this is lesson number 77

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:23.159
and it's been a long study. Next time we will begin the life of

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:24.079
Joseph

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:28.200
in Genesis chapter 37. I am so thrilled about that

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.760
and of course chapter 38, if you're familiar with the book of

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.520
Genesis, does not deal with the life of Joseph, Judah and Tamar,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.599
and then in chapter 39 we get back to the life of Joseph.

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:42.479
I mentioned to my children, actually all of them this week, I think to Holly as

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:44.240
well and to even a couple other folks,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.159
that Genesis chapter 36 I think might be the hardest chapter in the book of

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:49.520
Genesis to preach through.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.840
And if you came here this evening to hear me say all the names in Genesis

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.599
chapter 36, you are going to be disappointed

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.000
because I am not going to read all of Genesis chapter 36.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.400
If you want to record yourself reading all of those names

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.319
and listen to it, that would be perfectly fine, but I'm not going to take the time

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:07.080
this evening

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.400
nor am I going to struggle through saying all of these names. I have read

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.720
it.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.720
I've read it to myself many times and I've tried to pronounce the names as

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.839
best as possible,

00:01:16.839 --> 00:01:19.959
but I will tell you there's some tongue twisters in there

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:23.559
and not only that, but you start saying all these names that are

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:26.519
just different and you're saying one after the other, after the other, after the

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:27.599
other. It's challenging.

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:31.080
So we'll just look at the first nine verses, but we'll deal with the entirety of the

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.360
chapter. I hope that it will be a blessing to you this evening.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.519
I believe that this chapter provides us, obviously,

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:40.559
we know that the chapter provides us with a record of Esau's family tree.

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:44.080
When I think about Esau's family tree, I believe that God gave us this record. You

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.160
understand that all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.160
There's a purpose in every portion of scripture that God has given us.

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.720
I know that there are times in which people will jokingly say,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.279
and I believe that they're primarily joking, unfortunately at times I think

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:00.319
there's some measure of seriousness to it,

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.959
where people say, well, you know, I really kind of skipped through the book of

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:04.239
Leviticus. Don't.

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:07.559
There's good stuff in the book of Leviticus for us today.

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:10.880
I understand that we're New Testament believers and I'm so thankful

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.320
to be a New Testament believer, not under the law, but man, when you understand

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.720
what was going on in the book of Leviticus,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.759
it's helpful for us to understand that God preserved it for us for a purpose.

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:24.160
Sometimes people get to the first book of Chronicles and they start looking at

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.119
those first several chapters and say, man, I can't even get through that.

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:29.399
I just, I've heard people say this to me many times.

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.440
I just skip over the first several chapters of the book of First Chronicles.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.160
Don't. God gave it to us for a purpose, for a reason.

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:38.520
I understand that genealogies can be challenging.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.639
I understand that they're difficult. We can get into a rut.

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:41.679
We're just reading names,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.080
but really ask the spirit of God to teach you and to help you understand.

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:47.720
You can read in some of the other chapters of God's word.

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:51.199
Ezra and Nehemiah provide long list of names of people.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.720
Listen, I'm thankful when you read through Ezra and Nehemiah.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.360
Listen, God made it a point to write down

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:57.759
the names of the people that left Babylon and went back.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.320
Praise God.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.639
And we get to read about them and get to understand some of what took place.

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.639
When we look at Genesis 36 and we say, why did God give us this record?

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:09.240
I believe that as we study Genesis chapter 36,

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.039
it really enables us to connect some dots.

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:15.479
That's the phraseology that I'll use this evening.

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:17.240
We think about the life of Esau and think

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.800
about all that God gives us throughout his word.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.320
This chapter helps us to be able to connect some dots biblically.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.399
In verse number one of Genesis 36,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.399
the Bible says, now these are the generations of Esau who is Edom.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.440
Esau took his wives and the daughters of Canaan, Ada,

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.600
the daughter of Elon, the Hittite, and Aholobama, the daughter of Anna,

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.080
the daughter of Zibion, the Hittite, and Bashamath, Ishmael's daughter,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.679
the sister of Nebojah, and Ada bared to Esau Eliphaz and Bashamath

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.080
bared Rehul and Aholobama bared Jeush and Jalem and Korah.

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:51.880
These are the sons of Esau,

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.440
which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.160
And Esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters and all the persons

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.160
of his house and his cattle and all his beast and all his substance,

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.119
which he had got in the land of Canaan and went into the country

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:05.679
from the face of his brother Jacob.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.679
Verse number seven,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.839
for their riches were more than that they might dwell together in the land

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:15.399
wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.279
Thus dwelt Esau in Mount Seir.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.079
Esau is Edom.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:25.799
These are the generations of Esau, the father of the Edomites in Mount Seir.

00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:28.040
And so we see in verse number one again in verse number eight,

00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:32.079
where the Bible says Esau is Edom, Esau who is Edom.

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:34.519
And we find they dwell in Mount Seir

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.920
and that he is the father of the Edomites.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.359
I believe this evening,

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:42.679
even as we get into the passage of Scripture, that it's important

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.559
that we remember some important things that took place

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.200
previous in the life of Esau and the first one that I want to remind you of.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.720
And really, just by way of introduction,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.160
some reminders before we dive into this passage of Scripture.

00:04:56.359 --> 00:04:59.600
I want you to be reminded of the struggle within the womb,

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:01.119
the struggle within the womb.

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:03.320
If you go back to Genesis chapter number twenty five

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:06.320
and we'll just look at a couple of verses, we'll quickly go over these.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.160
But the reality is that some of these messages from Genesis twenty five,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.839
for instance, I preach that message about 18 months ago.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.200
This was a long time ago.

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:17.440
And so when we look at Genesis chapter twenty five,

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.359
some of you weren't here 18 months ago.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.160
Some of us have a hard time remembering what happened 18 minutes ago.

00:05:22.359 --> 00:05:26.519
And so we look here and we find that the Bible tells us in Genesis chapter twenty

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.000
five and verse number twenty one, it says,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.880
And Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife because she was barren.

00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:34.279
And the Lord was entreated of him.

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:37.799
And Rebecca, his wife, conceived and the children struggled together within her.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.279
And she said, if it be so, why am I thus?

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.079
And she went to inquire the Lord.

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:44.799
There was a struggle within the womb and she didn't understand what was going on.

00:05:44.799 --> 00:05:46.079
And so she inquired of the Lord.

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:49.000
Notice in verse twenty three, the Bible tells us that the

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.880
the Lord said unto her, two nations are in thy womb

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:55.880
and two matter of people shall be separated from thy vows.

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:57.480
And the one people shall be stronger

00:05:57.679 --> 00:06:01.239
than the other people and the elder shall serve the younger.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.200
So we are reminded about the struggle

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.799
in the womb and we understand that God gave us this truth in Genesis chapter

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.600
twenty five with regard to the struggle that's in the womb.

00:06:09.799 --> 00:06:12.279
Contextually, it's two nations.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.239
We find that it says that in verse number twenty three, two nations are in thy womb.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.559
We understand those two nations, the two children are Esau and Jacob.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.239
And we understand that Esau becomes the father.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.279
He's he's Edom.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.880
He's the father of the Edomites.

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:29.839
And then, of course, Jacob, the Israelites.

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:31.920
And so we see here in Genesis chapter

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:35.600
twenty five when we're reminded of the struggle in the womb, the two nations.

00:06:35.799 --> 00:06:39.239
Contextually, you have the Edomites and the Israelites.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.959
But by application or with symbolism, if you will,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.640
you see not only two nations, but you see two natures.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.959
And I dealt with this when we preached

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.519
to this chapter in Genesis twenty five again about 18 months ago.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.079
But when you think about the symbolism

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:59.359
or the application of the two natures, we see the the contextual truth is

00:06:59.359 --> 00:07:02.119
that there are two nations we think about the two natures.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.359
You think about the old man and the new man.

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:06.320
And the reality is that if you've been

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.480
born again, you have an old man and you have a new man.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.799
You have the old nature and you have the new nature.

00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:12.760
And I'm so thankful to be born again.

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:16.239
I'm thankful to have the truth that I've been quickened.

00:07:16.239 --> 00:07:17.359
I've been made alive.

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:20.040
But the reality is that we still have that old nature.

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:23.160
The old man still is around the flesh.

00:07:23.359 --> 00:07:28.040
And we think about the two natures that are represented here throughout the

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.920
struggle in the womb, and we find this old man versus new man,

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:33.799
the flesh versus the spirit.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.239
We find that the Bible says, and it's true even of the nations

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.600
contextually, but it's true of the natures by way of application

00:07:41.799 --> 00:07:45.320
that the elder shall serve the younger after we are saved.

00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:48.679
Listen, our new man is younger than our old man.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.239
You got your old man the day that you were born physically.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.799
The new man is younger than the old man,

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.600
but the old man is to serve the younger.

00:07:59.799 --> 00:08:01.760
The old man is to be mortified.

00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:05.200
The old man is to be crucified.

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:07.720
And so we find that there's the symbolism

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.600
that's here in Genesis chapter twenty five and keeping that with our within our

00:08:11.799 --> 00:08:16.000
minds as our first reminder, as we get into Genesis chapter thirty six,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.279
we must remember the struggle within the womb.

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:19.200
I would say this.

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:22.720
We must remember that Esau sold his birthright.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.720
And the same chapter in Genesis twenty five,

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.119
the end of the chapter records for us how that Esau sold his birthright.

00:08:29.119 --> 00:08:30.359
The Bible says in verse number thirty,

00:08:30.559 --> 00:08:33.400
picking it up there and Esau in Genesis twenty five.

00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:36.000
And Esau said to Jacob, feed me,

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.760
I pray thee with that same red pottage for I am faint.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.679
Therefore was his name called Edom.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.080
And Jacob said, sell me this day thy birthright.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.679
And Esau said, behold, I'm at the point to die.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.039
And what profit shall this birthright do to me?

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:51.919
And Jacob said, swear to me this day.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.200
And he swore to him and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.280
Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils.

00:08:58.479 --> 00:09:01.000
And he did eat and drink and rose up and went his way.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.359
Notice the Bible says thus Esau despised his birthright.

00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:08.960
The word despised means to hold in low regard.

00:09:09.159 --> 00:09:13.080
And you think about this truth where he sold his birthright.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.039
Again, it's something that we need to be

00:09:15.039 --> 00:09:18.039
mindful of as we enter into Genesis chapter thirty six.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.359
And then I would say the third thing

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:21.520
that we're reminded of, we see the struggle within the room.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.799
We see the the selling of the birthright.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.320
But we also see the subtlety of Jacob.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.960
And we dealt with this in Genesis chapter twenty seven.

00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:32.080
As you look at Genesis chapter twenty seven,

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.479
we read about the subtlety of Jacob.

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:36.520
This is with regard to the blessing.

00:09:36.719 --> 00:09:38.119
Remember that

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.799
the process has come and Isaac is going to give a blessing.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
And we see what's taking place.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.520
And the instruction is given to Esau.

00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:48.679
Isaac was old. He was dim in his eyes.

00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:49.640
He could not see well.

00:09:49.799 --> 00:09:50.960
He calls for Esau.

00:09:51.159 --> 00:09:54.679
But when he Esau heard or received the instruction,

00:09:54.679 --> 00:09:57.039
we understand that Rebecca overheard what was going on.

00:09:57.239 --> 00:10:00.080
And Rebecca gave instruction to Jacob.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.980
to go and to prepare and so on and so forth and she was gonna help. I'm gonna

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:10.580
drop down just for sake of time to verse number 35. Notice what the Bible says and

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.940
he said, this is Isaac speaking to Esau, and he said, thy brother, that would be

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:26.940
Jacob, came with subtlety and hath taken away thy blessing. And he said, is not he

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.220
rightly named Jacob, this is Esau speaking, for he hath supplanted me these

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:34.020
two times, he took away my birthright, and behold now he hath taken away my

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:40.620
blessing. And he said, hast thou not reserved a blessing for me? And Isaac

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.020
answered and said unto Esau, behold I have made him thy Lord, and all his

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.780
brethren have I given to him for servants, and with corn and wine have I

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:52.780
sustained him, and what shall I do now unto thee my son? And we find that Esau

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:58.180
responds in verse 38, he says unto his father, hast thou but one blessing, my

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:05.700
father. Bless me, even me also, my father. And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:11.020
Esau was never concerned about spiritual things. He was only ever concerned about

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.860
temporal things. And we see that here in Genesis chapter number 27. What is he

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:21.260
pleading for? What is he desiring? He's really desiring a temporal blessing. He

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.900
wants to be increased with goods, he wants to benefit with these things, and

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.980
he's calling out, he's desiring this blessing, and we find that it's not

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.180
going to be given because of the fact that the subtlety of Jacob and the

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:38.820
blessing had been given to Jacob. And we find that the response of Esau is one

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.500
of just anger and hatred, and he makes the decision, I'm gonna kill my brother.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.900
Of course that leads to Jacob fleeing to Laban and all that we've

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.820
studied over the past several chapters of the book of Genesis. And so we see

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:55.100
that as we look at these passages of Scripture, we're reminded of these three

00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:00.100
important events in the life of Esau. And then we come to Genesis chapter number

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:08.260
36. And in Genesis chapter number 36, God is really providing for us the record, as

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:12.860
I said by way of introduction a moment ago, of Esau's family tree. And he's

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:17.780
providing us with this record, and it helps us to understand not only some of

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:22.100
what we just dealt with by way of review from those events in Genesis

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:27.780
chapter number 25 and chapter number 27, but we also see that it will help us

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:33.380
again connect some dots with regard to future events that will take place as we

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:38.260
read through the Old Testament, and we begin to connect all these dots and see

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.620
these interactions between these groups of people. So as we get into Genesis

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:46.340
chapter 36, I want you to, if you're taking notes, number one this evening, I

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.980
want you to consider with me the decisions of Esau. The decisions of Esau.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.900
We find, first of all, the decision with regard to his wives, and we find in

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:58.940
verses 2 and 3 of Genesis chapter number 36 that the Bible tells us about his

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:03.140
wives that he took. Now, it's very possible, in fact, there's a lot of debate

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:08.300
that goes on with regard to the wives of Esau. There's some discrepancy with

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:12.820
regard to names in a previous chapter with regard to the names of Esau's wife,

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.780
and there are a number of theories that exist out there with regard to whether

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:22.340
or not some of the names were adapted in order to not be offensive to Isaac and

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:26.380
what have you. There's also the fact that in this chapter, in Genesis chapter

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.740
number 36, it's giving us a picture of the family tree, not necessarily all the

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:36.300
names of his wives. It is very possible they had more than three wives, but it

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.020
might be that it's only these three wives that are listed here that gave him

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:46.580
male children, sons, and thus the family tree that is provided. Listen, don't get

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:52.460
mixed up, don't get sideways when someone tries to take something that seems to be

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:56.060
an apparent contradiction and comes to you and says, look, there's a

00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:02.140
contradiction here. Listen, God is wiser than us. All Scripture is given by

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:06.720
inspiration of God. A preacher of yesteryear said, and I've had it, I want

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:12.640
to say, just ingrained in my brain, and I try to always be reminded myself of this

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.640
when people come to me with apparent contradictions, that listen, if you think

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:25.200
there's a mistake, you are mistaken. What do you do? You dig in, you dig deeper, you

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:32.000
try to get along with God. Who gave us the Bible? God. The Holy Spirit is the

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.660
author of Scripture, and He lives within you, He lives within me, He is the divine

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:40.060
teacher, and so we seek the face of God. I do not believe there's an apparent

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.220
contradiction, or I do not believe there's a contradiction here at all, even though

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.540
at surface level somebody could say, look, the names are different and what's going

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:51.820
on, that here God is providing us with the record of the family tree. But I want

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:54.980
you to think about the decisions. We think about his wives that are listed here in

00:14:54.980 --> 00:15:00.340
verses 2 and 3 of Genesis chapter number 36, and those names are given to us. I ask

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.820
this question when I consider the decisions of Esau. I say this, why did Esau

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:10.460
choose the wives that he did? What was the process in which Esau went through in

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:15.820
order to determine who he would marry? By the way, we of course are not in favor of

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:20.300
polygamy, as we'd see here with multiple wives, but we understand that marriage is

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.820
of God, that God saw Adam. He said he's not good that man is left alone. For whoso

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:28.180
findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and obtain the favor of the Lord. And we find

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:32.020
that God is the one that instituted and designed marriage. Marriage is not man's

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:39.180
idea, it's God's idea. But listen, aside from salvation, who you marry is the most

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:45.300
important decision you're ever going to make in your life. It really is. I married

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:52.260
the wrong person. No, sorry, you got married. It's a tough deal. So how did he

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:56.940
make the decision? Go back with me, Genesis chapter 26. By the way, thanks for asking

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:06.460
the question. Genesis 26, look at verses 34 and 35. We did not touch on Genesis 26

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:11.620
by way of introduction. We looked at chapter 25 and 27, but I want you to notice the Bible

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:16.100
says in verse 34, Esau was 40 years old when he took to wife Judith, the daughter of Barai,

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.780
the Hittite, and Beshemoth, the daughter of Elam, the Hittite. Notice what the Bible says

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:30.100
in verse 35, which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah. Huh. Verse 35 is interesting

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:34.300
to me when I think about the decisions of Esau, the decision with regard to who he would

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:40.180
marry. He did not seek the counsel of his parents. You know, the counsel, the Bible

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:44.980
tells us that there's safety in a multitude of counselors, the Bible tells us. And I believe

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:50.740
this evening that we think about the subject of marriage. There's great wisdom in an individual

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:56.460
seeking the counsel of their parents. I've said to our children many times, listen, I

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:05.860
might not be the best dad, but I'm the dad that God gave you. And I want my kids to understand,

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:09.060
I've tried to teach them this over the years, that I'm not perfect. I'm not going to give

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:14.100
perfect counsel, but I'm going to seek God's face and I'm going to pray. And listen, sometimes

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:18.100
as a parent, God sometimes just gives you an uneasiness about something that you might

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:24.420
not even be able to verbalize. God just doesn't give you a piece about it. And we find here

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:28.940
that there's no, as we look at the passage of Scripture, it seems like there's no interest

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:33.460
whatsoever on the part of Esau. Again, remember, he was never concerned about spiritual things,

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:37.300
only concerned about temporal things, that which would please him temporarily. And the

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.220
Bible tells us that this was a grief of mind unto Isaac and Rebekah. But there's further

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:46.500
insight that is given to us in chapter 28. Notice, if you will, over in chapter 28, this

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:52.380
is after the blessing is given in Genesis 27. And now, because Esau's ready to kill

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:57.140
Jacob because of the subtlety of Jacob and all that's taken place, now Isaac is going

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:02.480
to send Jacob away, his flight to Paddan Aram, as we mentioned earlier, when he go to Laban.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.980
And we find that Jacob is called into the presence of Isaac. And the Bible tells us

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:12.020
in verse number one that Isaac is going to bless and charge Jacob. And notice what he

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:19.380
says in verse number one. At the end of the verse, thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:27.580
of Canaan. Now, is that hard to understand? Very clear. Elementary education level of

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:32.179
comprehension, basic truth. But I want you to see what the Bible says in verse number

00:18:32.179 --> 00:18:39.540
eight. And Esau, seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac, his father. How

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:46.420
did he see that? Well, really, he heard the charge that was given from Isaac to Jacob.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:52.420
Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. So we see that Jacob is receiving

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:58.380
this instruction from his father, Isaac. And Esau, because he has no care, no concern about

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:02.780
what his mom or dad would think. The Bible says that he sees that the daughters of Canaan

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:08.880
pleased not Isaac, his father. Then went Esau unto Ishmael and took unto him a wife, which

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:14.780
he had, Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebojah, to be

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:20.540
his wife. And we see that he has made these decisions. If you look in chapter number 26,

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:27.340
it speaks about the daughters of Canaan. Specifically, it says that he was 40 years old and he took

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:31.260
the daughter of Bere the Hittite and the Beshemoth, the daughter of Elon the Hittite.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:37.980
And he takes these wives. We see here that Esau, again, he's making these decisions that

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:45.059
are decisions that are really based on fleshly motives. Not concerned about the spiritual,

00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:50.140
not concerned about the eternal, but concerned for the temporal. We find that not only when

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:54.540
we consider with us this evening the decision with regard to his wives, but then we think

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:59.420
about the decision with regard to his dwelling place. And back in Genesis chapter 36, the

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.140
Bible tells us...

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:05.460
us in verse 6 and 7. By the way, it's quite interesting as you read verse 6 and 7 with

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:14.860
regard to the expression of Esau in Genesis chapter 27 when he's pleading for a blessing.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:21.820
You know, God did bless Esau. God blessed Esau. And we find that we were reminded of

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:27.900
that truth when we saw the reunion between Jacob and Esau. Remember, he said, I have

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:33.220
enough. But in verse number 6, the Bible says, And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.020
his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all the beasts,

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:39.700
and all the substance which he had got in the land of Canaan, and went into the country

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:43.620
from the face of his brother Jacob. For their riches were more than that they might dwell

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:48.340
together in the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:53.220
Do you remember another time in Scripture in the book of Genesis when this situation

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:59.580
happened? Yeah. Abraham and Lot, right? And what happened? What was Lot's process for

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:04.940
picking the place where he'd go? It's all his sight. He saw that it was a land that

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.500
was pleasing. It was a place that was well watered. A place that would be appropriate

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:13.420
and good for him. And the Bible tells us if you trace the steps of Lot, that initially

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:21.180
he simply pitched his tent towards Sodom. He didn't move into Sodom on day one. He

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:27.060
just pitched his tent towards Sodom. But before long, we see that he's in a place

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:35.620
of leadership within the wicked city of Sodom. You see that progression, right? And Abraham,

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:42.500
listen, Abraham gave him the choice. You pick. And he picked. And then we see Esau, he goes

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:47.240
and he leaves and we see this decision that he makes with regard to his wives, the daughters

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:52.040
of Canaan, as it's mentioned in verse number two of Genesis 36. And then we see the place

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:58.080
where he goes. The place is Mount Seir. And we see that here. It's the south part of the

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:05.160
Dead Sea area there. A place that was well fortified. A place that was extremely complicated

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:09.740
for someone to come in and conquer because of just the land. The way that the land was

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:16.360
set up and all of the caves and all of the structure and what have you. And we find that

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:22.760
with the mountainous region there and that part of the landscape of Israel down there

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:28.880
in Mount Seir, the southern part of the Dead Sea, it was a place that was just natural

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:34.680
protection. And that's where he chooses to go. When we begin to think about these decisions

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:40.560
of Esau, I ask myself this evening and I ask you tonight to consider how is it that we

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:47.680
make decisions? See the reality is that we all make decisions. We make decisions every

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:53.200
single day of our lives. Some decisions that we make are decisions that we don't even really

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:58.520
think about. We just make the decision. We just go through the process and we just made

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.420
decisions and we didn't even realize we were making decisions because we're just going

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:05.280
through life and we're doing the things that we're doing. How many of you have ever had

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:11.120
a situation where you said to your spouse, where would you like to go out to eat? And

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:16.360
then there's like this process of time. So I told my family, I'm going to name a restaurant,

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:20.860
I'm going to open a restaurant and I'm going to name it, I don't care. And if everyone

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:25.480
truly goes to the restaurant that they say I don't care to their spouse, I will have

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:31.120
a lot of business. Right? How many times is it a holly? Hey, let's go out to dinner. Where

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.760
do you want to go? I don't care. And if I open a second restaurant, it's going to be

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:40.680
called this. It doesn't matter. How many of you get that response? Come on. I know

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.240
that somebody more than me gets that response. Right? And here's what I say to my family.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:51.440
Listen, I make decisions all day long. I don't care where we eat. Can somebody just make

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:56.360
the decision? I say that all the time. I make decisions that are much more complicated than

00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:02.720
what I'm going to eat for dinner. It is important. I'm not going to salad works. Amen. And I

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.440
don't even think that place exists anymore. But the reality is that we look at this and

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:11.960
we say how is it that we make decisions? What's the process that we go through? Do we seek

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:18.960
the face of God? Do we prayerfully consider that which is before us? Let me ask this.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:25.320
What are the consequences of your decisions? You know, in a real way, there are decisions

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:30.160
that you make and that I make that we do not know what the consequences of that decision

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:39.400
are going to be. We don't know. We make the decision. How many people make decisions without

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:45.280
even considering the consequences? Maybe we say to somebody when they make a poor decision,

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.600
we say what were you thinking? You ever had that thought? You ever had somebody maybe

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.760
ask you that? Maybe you've asked yourself that. You made a decision and said that was

00:24:52.760 --> 00:25:01.400
not very smart. Self, what were you thinking when you made that decision? Right? We don't

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.860
know the consequences. But can I tell you, can I say this this evening that you can rest

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:11.480
assured there will be consequences to your decisions? There will be consequences to your

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:20.720
decisions. Let me ask this. Who is impacted by your decisions? You know, we live in a

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:26.600
midst of a people that are so self-focused that they think they make their decisions

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:32.760
in a vacuum and their decisions only affect them. But those of us that have lived long

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:39.400
enough and have been exposed to enough truth, we know that's just not true. Many people

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:44.320
are affected by the decisions that we make. We make decisions every day. People say this

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.800
is my life, I can do what I want to do. No, you're going to make decisions that are going

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:53.240
to affect other people. Sometimes innocent people that don't even know who you are.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:58.680
But you've affected them. And I would submit to you this evening that the decisions that

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:03.760
are made by Esau, specifically with regard to the wives, when we think about the process

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.960
there and how he chose his wives and what he'd seen and what he'd understood, and we

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.780
think about what's going on and we say, how are we making the decisions that we're making?

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:16.860
Are we seeking godly counsel? Are we seeking the face of God? I referenced already the

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:25.980
proverb that says there's safety in a multitude of counselors. I heard a preacher say recently,

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:31.860
never make a major ministry decision on Monday, because Sunday might have been a rough day.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:35.940
And it was kind of comical to hear them say that, but they were being serious. They were

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:41.420
trying to give some advice. And the reality is that when we make the decisions that we

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:45.820
make, listen, sometimes we have some major, major decisions to make in life. And how do

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:51.420
we make them? What are the consequences going to be? Sometimes we can't know all that those

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.740
consequences are going to be, but we can rest assured those decisions are going to have

00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:00.380
consequences. And we can know this evening that there are people that are going to be

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:07.460
impacted by the decisions that we make. I would say this, as we're reminded of that

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:17.620
struggle within the womb, in Genesis chapter 25, the two natures, the flesh minds fleshly

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:23.820
things. And if we're making decisions, we better make sure that we're not making them

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:35.660
based on fleshly things. It's important that we understand that Esau, Edom, the Edomites,

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:40.940
he was never concerned about spiritual things, temporal, fleshly things. So we notice the

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:46.460
decisions of Esau. I want you to notice with me number two, the descendants of Esau. In

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:50.700
verses four and five, we've read the verses already. In verses four and five, the Bible

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:55.460
gives the record of his sons. It notes here that there are five sons that were born to

00:27:55.460 --> 00:28:03.540
Esau, Eliphaz, Reho, Jeus, Jalem, and Korah. His first two wives, according to the text

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:07.020
of scripture, each had one son. The third had three sons, according to verse number

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:12.220
five. We're going to think about these descendants of Esau. We find that in verses 11 through

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:16.220
43, it records for us, again, the portion of scripture that I'm not going to read publicly

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:20.740
this evening for sake of time and all the names that are there, but it records for us

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:27.220
future generations, grandchildren, et cetera. It is of note that we make mention this evening

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:32.140
that verse number 12, notice there in that text of scripture, the Bible says, and Timnah

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:40.140
was concubine to Eliphaz, Esau's son, and she bared to Eliphaz Amalek. Does that name

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:46.340
ring a bell to you? Does that name connect some dots for you? These were the sons of

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:55.660
Adah, Esau's wife. So, Amalek is the grandson of Esau. As we look here in the text of scripture,

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:59.540
again, begin to trace some of these steps and connect some of the dots that are going

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:03.859
on. We read of the descendants, a number of the names within the text of scripture.

00:29:03.859 --> 00:29:09.100
We really don't know anything much about them. We don't know of their descendants and all

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.359
of those sorts of things. I made mention of this as we've studied through the book of

00:29:12.359 --> 00:29:19.059
Genesis, that you find that God takes the lens of scripture and he's taking the lens

00:29:19.059 --> 00:29:24.460
of human history. And we start with Adam and Eve there in Genesis and looking at the creation

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:28.420
and what have you. And then we begin to look at all the children that are born and the

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:33.980
generations and so on and so forth. And then the lens gets smaller and smaller as eventually

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:39.380
it focuses down onto Abraham. And then we see that it focuses onto Isaac. And then we

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:45.500
see that it focuses onto Jacob and to his descendants. And so, though the record is

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:49.900
provided for us and it helps us with identifying some of the peoples that are mentioned and

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:55.980
some of their descendants and what have you, you know that the specifics with regard to

00:29:55.980 --> 00:30:00.140
all of these descendants and all that they did are not provided to us within scripture.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.960
because the lens of Scripture is focusing on

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.660
the Hebrew race, the Hebrew people,

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:09.780
with regard to the, of course, Messianic line,

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:11.840
and that's where Scripture goes.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.720
And so we find, however, that as we look

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.960
at this passage of Scripture,

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.320
we see the decisions, we see the descendants,

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.440
but then I want you to think of this

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.280
as we try to connect some dots this evening, number three.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.560
I want you to note with me the disputes with Edom,

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.040
the disputes with Edom.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.680
So begin to think about what's taking place

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.240
and try to connect dots with Scripture

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.520
and understand here what God is giving us.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.680
I want you to turn to the book of Numbers, if you will,

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.720
and I'm gonna provide with you,

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.080
it's not an exhaustive list,

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.440
it's just a number of examples of disputes

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.320
that they have between the children of Israel

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:46.240
and the children of Esau, the Edomites and the Israelites.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.320
Now remember, that struggle within the womb,

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.920
there are two nations, right?

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.840
It's what the Bible says.

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.800
The Bible says the elder shall serve the younger.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.840
We find that God is connecting these dots for us

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.360
and helping us to see what's taking place

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.520
and we find, yes, the selling of the birthright,

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:09.280
we see the subtlety of Jacob with the blessing.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.040
By the way, I mentioned this when I taught

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.400
through that passage of Scripture in Genesis 27,

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.720
there was no reason for Jacob to have to scheme.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.840
God had already promised in Genesis chapter number 25

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.800
that the elder shall serve the younger.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.600
There's no reason for you in your life

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.940
or in my life to scheme, we just trust God.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.300
But here in Numbers chapter number 20,

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.400
we find this dispute that is listed here

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.640
with the Edomites or the people of Edom,

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.840
the descendants of Esau.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.120
Notice, first of all, in Numbers chapter 20,

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.520
in the wilderness.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.980
Notice, as the children of Israel had left Egypt,

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:46.200
they've crossed the Red Sea, they're now in the wilderness.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.520
They've already disobeyed God,

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.400
according to the evil report

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.480
that was brought in Numbers chapter 14

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.360
and they said they weren't able,

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.360
but we find in verse number 14, here in Numbers 20,

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.600
the Bible says that Moses sent messengers from Cadiz

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.600
unto the king of Edom.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.160
Thus saith thy brother Israel,

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:07.360
thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us,

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.160
how our fathers went down into Egypt

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.840
and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time,

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.920
and the Egyptians vexed us and our fathers.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.240
And when we cried unto the Lord,

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.960
he heard our voice and sent an angel

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.600
and hath brought us forth out of Egypt.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.080
And behold, we are in Cadiz,

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.860
a city in the outermost of thy border.

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.260
Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:27.260
We will not pass through the fields or through the vineyards

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.620
neither will we drink of the water of the wells.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:32.720
We will only go by the king's highway.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.100
We will not turn to the right hand nor to the left

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.360
until we have passed thy borders.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.020
Now does the request of verse number 17

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.520
sound like a difficult thing?

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.500
Were they really causing any trouble

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.700
to Edom or the Edomites?

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.780
And they just said, can we pass through?

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:49.420
We're not gonna go through your fields,

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:50.700
we're not gonna go through your vineyards,

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:54.060
we're not gonna drink of your water or of your wells.

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:55.100
We're gonna go the king's highway,

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.500
we're not gonna turn to the right or to the left.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.620
I mean, we're just gonna pass through your borders.

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.220
The Bible says that Edom said unto him,

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.340
thou shalt not pass by me

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.800
lest I come out against thee with the sword.

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:12.420
It's an interesting response to a simple request, right?

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.220
It seems like, damn it,

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.860
if you guys wanna pass through, go ahead.

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.380
The neighbor back here called and said,

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.380
I got some tree work that I have to have done.

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:22.380
It'd be really easy if the tree guys

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:24.540
could come through your property to access my property

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:25.660
because there's really no way for them

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:28.240
to get to where they need to get to through my front yard.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.080
Is it okay?

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.300
Sure, they can go through there, not a problem.

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:34.340
I don't think, it's just easy, right?

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.600
I don't know if it's a different situation,

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.900
but what I'm saying is the response seems odd to the request

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:40.820
but again, when you understand and start connecting

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.200
the dots and see what's going on,

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.040
the Bible says in verse 19,

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.380
and the children of Israel said unto him,

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:46.940
we'll go by the highway,

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.220
and if I and my cattle drink of thy water,

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.020
then I will pay for it.

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.160
I will only, without doing anything else,

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.780
go through on my feet.

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:57.900
He said, thou shalt not go through.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.240
And Edom came out against him with much people

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.980
and with a strong hand.

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:05.420
Thus, Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.860
wherefore Israel turned away from him.

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:09.580
The children of Israel, even the whole congregation,

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.960
journeyed from Kadesh and came unto Mount Hor.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.460
We see this as a first dispute that we really see

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:16.420
of what's going on.

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.020
We see that the Bible records for us,

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.260
I'm not gonna be able to take the time

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.640
to go through all of them,

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:22.760
but the Bible records for us in the times,

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.620
the days of King Saul.

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.280
There's battle that takes place

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:30.500
with not only the Amalekites,

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.900
we saw the grandson, Amalek, of Esau,

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.760
but also with the Edomites.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.560
You can read that in 1 Samuel 14.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.420
You can read that in the days of David.

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.540
Now, remember with me the history of Israel.

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:42.940
In fact, it tells us,

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:44.960
it's a very interesting statement that is given to us,

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.860
you don't need to turn back there,

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.900
but in Genesis 36 and verse number 31,

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.020
it says, and these are the kings

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.220
that reigned in the land of Edom

00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:54.460
before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.500
And you read about all those dukes and those chiefs

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.180
and what have you there with the Edomites,

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.860
and even before the kings of Israel,

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:04.280
they had what was going on there in that land in Seir

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.120
with the Edomites,

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.060
but then as you begin to think about Israel's history

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:08.700
and Saul being the first king,

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.140
well, in the time of Saul,

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.620
there's a battle with the Edomites.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.140
There are disputes that takes place

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:15.740
and battles that are recorded.

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:19.060
In the days of David, he's the next king of Israel.

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:22.180
And we find that during his reign in the times of David,

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.220
there's disputes that take place.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:26.300
In fact, the Bible tells us in 2 Samuel 8

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:28.660
and verse number 14, that during his reign,

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:32.220
because David was mighty, the Lord was with him

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.340
and the Lord gave him favor,

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:36.280
the Lord preserved him withersoever he went,

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.120
the Bible tells us,

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.820
but it tells us in 2 Kings 8 and verse 14,

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:43.300
that Edom, that David put garrisons in Edom

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.740
and all they of Edom became David's servants.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.820
And again, we see these interactions that are taking place

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:51.460
and all of a sudden we begin to connect these dots

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.900
of what's going on in the days of Solomon.

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.020
It's a sad thing, but the Bible tells us of Solomon,

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.540
we know that he had many wives.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:00.080
You know, he had some wives that were

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:03.340
the descendants of Edom, Edomites, Moabites,

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.500
I mean, others, but Edomites were one of them

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.300
that are specifically listed

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.900
in 1 Kings 11 and verse number one.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.500
We find that in that text of scripture,

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.480
it says, but King Solomon loved many strange women

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.900
together with the daughter of Pharaoh,

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:17.540
women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites,

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.860
Zidaneans and Hittites.

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:23.740
Again, we see the Edomites referenced.

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.660
It's interesting that God tells us

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:29.060
in this same chapter in 1 Kings 11,

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.380
it tells us how that God was angry with Solomon, why?

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:36.380
Because of his evil, where he built these places of worship

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.260
for these false gods of these wives that he married

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.940
and all that was taking place.

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:46.060
And we find that he also was burning incense

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:47.660
and sacrificed one of their gods.

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:51.460
And the Bible then tells us in verse 14 of 1 Kings 11,

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:53.980
and the Lord stirred up an adversary unto Solomon,

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:57.380
hey, dad, the Edomite.

00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.340
Hey, dad, the Edomite.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:02.520
He was the king's seed in Edom.

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.300
The days of Amaziah, king of Judah,

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:08.820
there's conflict, there are disputes with the Edomites.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:09.940
But I want you to think about

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.180
the judgment upon the Edomites.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.220
I won't take time to look at any of the references.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.700
We're near the end this evening.

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:17.900
But turn to the book of Jeremiah, if you will.

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.100
Read two verses from the book of Jeremiah and Ezekiel

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:23.980
and I encourage you to read the small book of Obadiah.

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:27.680
And the book of Obadiah completely deals with Edom,

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.060
the sons of Esau.

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:33.220
Specifically goes back to Numbers 20.

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:35.900
To the event that we read of in Numbers 20

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:37.820
where they said we're gonna pass through.

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.500
He said, no, you're not.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.260
If you read the book of Obadiah, just a short book,

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.380
you'll see that indictment against the Edomites

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.620
that God gives through that prophet Obadiah.

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.320
But notice in Jeremiah 49,

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.260
and then we'll also notice over

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:54.040
in the book of Ezekiel very quickly,

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.920
but notice in Jeremiah 49,

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:03.740
really beginning in verse number seven,

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:08.180
it says concerning Edom, thus saith the Lord of hosts.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.380
I'm not gonna read all of it for sake of time.

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:13.180
But we find that these are prophecies

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:14.580
that are given against Edom.

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:16.940
And we see specifically throughout this portion

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:17.780
of the book of Jeremiah,

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:18.800
the number of different places

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.300
that are receiving these prophecies

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:23.900
concerning against these particular people groups.

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:26.260
And so concerning Edom, thus saith the Lord of hosts.

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.820
And then skip down, if you will, in verse number 17,

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.940
the Bible says also Edom shall be a desolation.

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.140
Everyone that goeth by it shall be astonished

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:37.739
and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.420
The Bible says very similarly in the book of Ezekiel,

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:43.700
look over, if you will, Ezekiel 25.

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.260
In Ezekiel 25, in verses 12 through 14,

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.739
we read this judgment that is given again

00:38:50.739 --> 00:38:52.859
in this portion of the book of Ezekiel,

00:38:52.859 --> 00:38:55.980
a number of different nations are being prophesied against.

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:58.580
And in this particular text, it's against Edom.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.220
Beginning in verse number 12,

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.340
the Bible says, thus saith the Lord God,

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.760
because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.500
by taking vengeance and hath greatly offended

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.380
and revenged himself upon them.

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:11.900
Therefore, thus saith the Lord God,

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.660
I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom,

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:16.540
will cut off man and beast from it,

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.780
and I will make it desolate from Timan,

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.179
and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.

00:39:21.179 --> 00:39:23.220
And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.820
by the hand of my people Israel,

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.580
and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:28.900
and according to my fury,

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.980
and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord God.

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:36.059
Those are pretty powerful judgments

00:39:36.059 --> 00:39:37.859
that are given by Jeremiah and Ezekiel.

00:39:37.859 --> 00:39:40.340
Again, you can read the book of Obadiah.

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:43.220
What I wanna think about the application for us this evening

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.260
in closing, as we think about this portion of Scripture

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:47.980
and we read about some decisions

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:50.380
and we read about the descendants,

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.100
we read about the disputes.

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.340
As we think about that, again, that symbolism,

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.660
we talked about that struggle within the...

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:10.620
womb, two nations. The elder shall serve the younger. We see that in scripture. We've just

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:16.220
looked at a number of passages of disputes and all that's going on. You find that the

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:23.060
Bible tells us, as I've made application, that not only is it two nations, but by application

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:29.120
we'd see the two natures, the old man and the new man. And we need to think about the

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:33.080
disputes that are recorded for us as we connect the dots historically and look at what's going

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:42.160
on and begin to think about the dispute that we have between the old man and the new man.

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.000
We think about trying to walk in the spirit. Turn to the book of Galatians, if you will.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:53.540
I want you to think about the struggle that we can face as we consider with this evening

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:58.200
in this portion of scripture and think about the struggle that's there even within the

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:02.620
womb in Genesis 25 and then as God provides us with this record. And we come to Galatians

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:07.140
chapter number six and we seek to make this application and we find that the Bible tells

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:12.500
us as we understand being saved, being born again, having the new man, the new nature,

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:17.660
that the old man, the old man is not eradicated. In fact, in the book of Ephesians and the

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:23.300
book of Colossians as well, both of those books go through a portion and Ephesians four

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:30.080
specifically lays out at the whole end of that chapter, put off, put on. The book of

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:33.480
Colossians deals with it the same way. We're to put off the old man and put on the new

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:38.880
and here's what we're to do as we're to walk in this newness of life. But notice in Galatians

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:45.760
five and verse 16, this I say then. It's a wonderful promise of God's word. Walk in the

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:53.780
spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. How many of you know that your

00:41:53.780 --> 00:42:03.580
flesh still has lusts? Your flesh still has lusts. But the Bible says that if I walk in

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:07.480
the spirit, I shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. It doesn't say that I'm not going

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:11.860
to have a lust of the flesh, so I'm going to be able to have victory. I'm not going

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:17.600
to fulfill the lust of the flesh. Notice in verse 17, for the flesh lusteth against

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:26.800
the spirit and the spirit against the flesh. Notice this, and these are contrary, the one

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:33.480
to the other, so that you cannot do the things that you would. In verses 19 through 21, the

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:37.560
Bible gives us the works of the flesh. In verse 22 and verse 23, the Bible gives us

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:41.800
the fruit of the spirit. If you do a comparison between those two portions of scripture, the

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:46.700
fruit of the spirit is far superior than the works of the flesh. And we ought to have

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:52.780
a spiritually, or we ought to be spiritually minded people, not like Esau having that fleshly,

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:57.660
that carnal, that temporary perspective of life, but that we'd have that perspective

00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:02.580
that is seeking to please God. I shared with those that came for the workers meeting tonight

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:08.040
for vacation Bible school a verse of scripture that we're familiar with, but I was reading

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.760
it just this past week and God just impressed upon my heart again, this wonderful truth

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:22.640
where Jesus says, for I do always those things that please him in John 8 and verse 29. Esau

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:26.120
wasn't concerned about doing things that please God. He wasn't concerned about doing things

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:33.200
that would please his own father. And this evening, when we understand this struggle

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:38.980
that we face, this two natures that's by way of application, the symbolism of those

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:44.240
two nations that we read of with Jacob and Esau, we find this evening that the struggle,

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:51.240
that they're at enmity one with the other. They're contrary one to the other. So this

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:58.080
evening, what do we do? Well, notice what the Bible says over the book of Colossians.

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:06.240
In Colossians chapter number three, familiar verses of scripture. I hope it will help

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:15.760
us this evening to understand the importance of walking in the spirit and seeking to please

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:25.840
God. The Bible says this, if ye then be risen with Christ. Are we risen with Christ? Spiritually

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:30.720
speaking, if you've been saved, if you've been born again, you're risen with Christ.

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:39.120
Notice what it says, seek those things which are above. Where Christ sitteth on the right

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:49.280
hand of God. Notice what it says, set your affection on things above, not on things of

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:58.080
the earth. Why? For you're dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ,

00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:04.400
who is our life, praise the Lord for that little statement, who is our life, shall appear,

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:09.480
then shall ye also appear with him in glory. Mortify therefore your members which are upon

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:13.200
the earth. And he goes through, and this is the section of the book of Colossians that

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:19.640
deals with that put off and put on portion of scripture. We make decisions in life, and

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:24.760
it's the first point that we dealt with this evening. How do we make the decisions? Just

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:27.720
go along with something because it's what somebody else is doing, it's something that's

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:32.680
popular, it's something that's accepted. Or we sit back and say, you know, is this going

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:40.760
to please God? What's the impact of this decision? What are the consequences of this decision?

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.080
Is this decision that is before me really a decision that's going to be able to be made

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:51.120
in a vacuum that's only going to affect me, that's only going to impact me? So as we look

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:59.600
at the genealogy, really the descendants, the generations of Esau, in Genesis chapter

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:06.040
36, God helps us to connect some dots in scripture. God helps us to be able to see some of the

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:11.580
historical content of preceding events in the life of Esau and then future interactions

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:19.000
between the Edomites and the Israelites, the Amalekites. But this evening as we think about

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.920
our own lives and try to make spiritual application, I'm going to focus on those few first thoughts

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:29.760
with regard to our decisions. I hope this evening that we seek counsel, godly counsel.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:36.040
I hope this evening that we seek the face of God in the decisions that we're making.

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:43.120
You say, well, listen, I'm older, it's not really that big of a deal. No, it is. It is.

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:48.360
There are people watching you, your children, your grandchildren, if God has given them

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:52.960
to you. If not, children in our church, those that were to be an example to you. Think about

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:57.280
the admonition that's given in God's Word to those that are referred to as being the

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:04.480
aged women and the aged men in church. Listen, there is a real biblical role that God gives

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:10.160
in the epistles for aged women and aged men in a church to be able to influence and impact

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:16.440
a future generation. And by the way, it's a role that is very rarely spoken about today,

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:23.400
but it's so vital and it's so important. This evening, you have decisions, I have decisions.

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:30.880
Are we trying to please ourselves like Esau did? What works best for me? We're going to

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.600
take a piece of paper, we're going to lay it out and say, well, here's all the pros

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:40.240
and here's all the cons. How many of you have heard somebody say that about making a decision?

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:47.800
You know, that's not how we as Bible believers make decisions. Why? Because if God said to

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:53.120
do something, it doesn't matter how many pros or cons there are. We do what God says. It

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:56.760
doesn't matter how many people understand it. It doesn't matter how popular it might

00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:01.160
be. It doesn't matter what anyone else is doing. We say God has led and God has made

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:08.160
it clear and this is the decision I have to make. Decisions have consequences. You can,

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:15.360
in a certain sense, control your decisions, but not your consequences. How many times

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:26.240
we face the consequences and we don't like them? We say, man, I wish I could have. The

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:32.640
consequences are already in motion. It's already taken place. This evening, we see the generations

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:39.640
of Esau. We can see the biblical, historical understanding of God giving us all of that

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:44.640
information. Tonight, I hope that we can make a spiritual application. Say, God, help me

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:50.920
to not be concerned about the temporal things, the fleshly things. Help me to be spiritually

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:57.320
minded. Help me to please you with my life. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:04.080
you for loving us. We thank you for your word, the truth that's contained therein. God, I

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:07.760
pray that as we've looked at this portion of Scripture and a number of other verses

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:14.960
this evening, you help us to make application in our lives. Help us, Lord, to please you.

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:21.960
Understand that we have decisions in our lives. Some decisions that are much more significant

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:29.960
than other decisions, decisions that will have consequences that will impact others.

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:37.640
Lord, I pray that you would help us to seek your face, would seek godly counsel, that

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:48.040
we would walk in the Spirit, that our aim and desire would be most important to please

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:55.040
you. I pray that as we have opportunity to respond this evening, have a moment of invitation,

00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:02.040
I pray that you'd move and work, guide us, and direct us, Lord. Help us to move and work.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:06.480
to be doers of the Word and not hearers only. Maybe somebody has some major decisions in

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:13.200
front of them. God, would you give them wisdom? Would you give them leadership? Would you

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:18.640
help them to seek your face? Would you help them to please you? I pray that you have your

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.520
will and way, for it's in Christ's name we pray.
