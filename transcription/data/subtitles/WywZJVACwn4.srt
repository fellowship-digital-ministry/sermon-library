1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
borrowed tomb, we're here today because he rose,

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,159
conquering sin, death, and the grave,

3
00:00:06,159 --> 00:00:09,199
and only through that sacrifice

4
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:10,819
can your account be settled.

5
00:00:10,819 --> 00:00:13,399
Only through that sacrifice can my account be settled,

6
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:16,559
can anyone's account be settled.

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,879
And I'm thankful that song said I settled it long ago,

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,639
it was on August 31st, 1997, for me,

9
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:24,239
that I recognized I was a sinner and I was guilty

10
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,639
and I was on my way to a Christless eternity

11
00:00:27,639 --> 00:00:30,079
in a place called hell or the lake of fire,

12
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,319
and I understood that Jesus, he was the only savior,

13
00:00:33,319 --> 00:00:35,360
and he loved me so much that he died for me,

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,959
he took my place, and he was willing to offer me

15
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:41,599
a free gift, that gift of eternal life,

16
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:45,680
through his precious blood, and I repented of my sin,

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,639
I confessed that Jesus is Lord,

18
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:51,720
and I asked him to be the savior of my life,

19
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,180
and on that day, something amazing happened,

20
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,959
the old account was settled.

21
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:59,119
It was settled long ago, it's under the blood, amen?

22
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:01,240
It doesn't mean that I've never sinned since then,

23
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,599
oh, no, no, no, it doesn't mean that,

24
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:07,760
it just simply means I'm forgiven, and I'm heaven-bound,

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,040
God is my father, I'm his child,

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,440
what a wonderful, wonderful truth.

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,199
Listen, if your account this morning,

28
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:15,040
you said, I didn't even know I had an account

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,519
when I got here this morning, well, you do,

30
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,419
and if you're not sure that your account's been settled,

31
00:01:20,419 --> 00:01:23,199
you can have it settled today,

32
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:25,519
and that's a wonderful truth of God's word,

33
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,480
and in fact, Paul said to the believers in Corinth,

34
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,680
today is the day of salvation, don't put it off,

35
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,959
no man knoweth what might be on tomorrow, life is short.

36
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,760
I said to someone yesterday, we're out knocking some doors,

37
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,599
and I was talking to someone,

38
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,680
and I shared with them the truth of eternity,

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,120
and they said they weren't sure of heaven,

40
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,959
but they knew that death was certain,

41
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:48,279
and we actually referenced that catastrophe

42
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:50,540
that took place just a few days ago,

43
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,959
that bridge up in Baltimore, and I said,

44
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,639
you know, those people, they didn't think

45
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:57,000
they were gonna die that day, there's a lot of people,

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,839
they don't know, listen, you know not when you're gonna die,

47
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:03,319
our life is but a vapor, it appears for a little time,

48
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:08,119
and then, it's gone, it's gone, no man knoweth the hour

49
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:10,240
that we're going to die, no man knoweth the hour

50
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,419
that Jesus is coming again, but I tell you today

51
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:15,979
that if you're under the sound of my voice,

52
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:18,899
you can be saved today, if you're already saved,

53
00:02:18,899 --> 00:02:20,559
I hope you're rejoicing in it,

54
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:22,399
and knowing that I'm heaven-bound,

55
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:24,759
and man, what a wonderful truth that is,

56
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,360
Matthew chapter 28, this morning,

57
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,940
that was all for free, amen,

58
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,279
no part of my sermon whatsoever, it was just free,

59
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:33,360
I was sitting there listening to that song this morning,

60
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,199
and God was just working in my heart,

61
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,259
and encouraging me, and I hope he encouraged you as well,

62
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:41,360
Matthew chapter 28, near the beginning

63
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,240
of the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ,

64
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,559
Jesus made this declaration,

65
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:51,720
destroy this temple, and in three days, I will raise it up,

66
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,679
you can read that in John chapter two, in verse number 19,

67
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:59,839
the context makes it abundantly clear

68
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:03,000
that Jesus is speaking about his body,

69
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,039
his body is the temple, he's speaking about his death,

70
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,960
and his glorious resurrection,

71
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,679
in fact, the gospel of John references back

72
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:17,000
all the way to chapter two, at the end,

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,919
after the resurrection, remembering what Christ said,

74
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,880
in fact, as we'll note here,

75
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,520
even in the passage of scripture

76
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,119
that we'll be studying this morning,

77
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:28,600
that even those that were against Christ,

78
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,520
they heard those words, and they understood

79
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,520
what he meant with regard to a resurrection,

80
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,380
we find that on three occasions here

81
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,160
in the gospel of Matthew,

82
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,160
that Jesus told his disciples that he would be put to death,

83
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:47,199
but then told them this,

84
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,679
on the third day, he would rise again,

85
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,720
we find in Matthew 28 is where our text is,

86
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,720
but I want you to quickly look at those three proclamations,

87
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,000
in Matthew chapter 16 is the first one

88
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,199
that we find in the gospel of Matthew,

89
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,559
again, three occasions here,

90
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,800
leading up to the death of Christ,

91
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,679
and in Matthew 16, and verse number 21,

92
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:09,440
we find it's in this text of scripture

93
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,960
that Jesus had asked the question,

94
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,479
whom do men say that I am?

95
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,880
Someone told Holly and Lena

96
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,279
when they're knocking doors yesterday,

97
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,959
they were a different world religion,

98
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,760
and they said, oh, we believe everything the same,

99
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,119
we believe everything the same,

100
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:27,239
we just don't believe what you think about Jesus,

101
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:30,559
well, that makes a world of difference, amen,

102
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:34,000
because Jesus said that he is God in flesh,

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,640
and that only through him, I, Jesus said,

104
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,239
in the way, the truth, and the life,

105
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:43,480
no man cometh unto the Father but by me,

106
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,040
and what a great declaration,

107
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,839
and so Jesus says, whom do men say that I am?

108
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:50,000
Some say that you're John the Baptist,

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,600
some say that you're one of the prophets,

110
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,640
and so on and so forth,

111
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,839
and Jesus then looks at his disciples,

112
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,239
and he says, whom say ye that I am?

113
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,640
Peter, I love Peter, we can relate with Peter,

114
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,839
in fact, Peter's the one that the one record

115
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,880
in the gospels, I think it's Mark's record,

116
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,160
says go and tell the disciples, and Peter, I love it,

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,959
because Peter was the one that denied the Lord,

118
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:15,000
and God still loved him, and God was still gonna use him,

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,679
and he did, he used him greatly,

120
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:20,920
but Peter stands up, and he says, thou art the Christ,

121
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,079
the son of the living God,

122
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:26,000
we find that great declaration that is made,

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,040
and Jesus, after giving some further instruction

124
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,760
in verse 21, it says, from that time forth began Jesus

125
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,000
to show unto his disciples how that he must go

126
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,040
unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders,

127
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,279
and chief priests, and scribes, notice, and be killed,

128
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:49,200
but notice, and be raised again the third day.

129
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,279
In Matthew chapter 17, in verse number 23,

130
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:55,000
we note the second reference here,

131
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,760
in verse 22, we'll read it, it says,

132
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,839
and while they abode in Galilee,

133
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:02,119
Jesus said unto them, the son of man shall be betrayed

134
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:05,440
into the hands of men, and they shall kill him,

135
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,679
and the third day he shall be raised again,

136
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:10,079
and they were exceeding sorry.

137
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,519
In chapter 20, and we notice this third record here,

138
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:17,640
I want you to begin reading with me in verse 17,

139
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,160
in Matthew 20, it says, and Jesus going up to Jerusalem

140
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,559
took the 12 disciples apart in the way,

141
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:25,720
and said unto them, behold, we go up to Jerusalem,

142
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,279
and the son of man shall be betrayed

143
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,679
unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes,

144
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:32,160
and they shall condemn him to death,

145
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,959
and shall deliver him to the Gentiles

146
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,920
to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him,

147
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,920
and the third day he shall rise again.

148
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,040
As we come to our text of scripture in Matthew 28,

149
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,640
we're mindful of the resurrection morning.

150
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,040
Of course, every Sunday we gather

151
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,959
because we serve a risen Savior.

152
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,200
The reason that we meet on Sunday

153
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,640
is because it's the first day,

154
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,440
and it's the resurrection day.

155
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,600
Every Sunday we meet because we serve a risen Savior,

156
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,779
and what a blessing to understand that.

157
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:05,940
Not only did he rise, conquering sin, death, and the grave,

158
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,000
but he promised that he would come again.

159
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,940
We mentioned that a little bit

160
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,739
during the 7 a.m. service this morning,

161
00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:14,980
and the promise of his soon return

162
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,459
is as sure as the promise of his resurrection.

163
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:21,019
We find that he made these statements

164
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:22,619
as we just looked at those three occasions

165
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:23,899
in the gospel of Matthew,

166
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:26,640
and then we come to resurrection morning, and guess what?

167
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,859
The tomb is empty.

168
00:07:27,859 --> 00:07:28,700
Why?

169
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,500
Because he always does what he says he's gonna do,

170
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,540
and he said on the third day he would rise again,

171
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,000
and he says to us as New Testament believers

172
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,339
that we also understand that he will come again,

173
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:44,579
and I'm looking forward with great anticipation

174
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:46,019
to his imminent return.

175
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:48,859
Maranatha, they would say, in the New Testament.

176
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:51,019
We read it in 1 Corinthians 16.

177
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:53,260
The Lord cometh, amen?

178
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,739
The Lord cometh, and we see that to be the case.

179
00:07:55,739 --> 00:07:56,940
The title for the message this morning,

180
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,179
the grave could not hold him.

181
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,459
The grave could not hold him.

182
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:02,299
I just wanna read verses five and six

183
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:04,739
in Matthew's gospel, the 28th chapter,

184
00:08:04,739 --> 00:08:07,179
and then we're gonna consider three things this morning

185
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:10,220
about this wonderful resurrection of our Savior.

186
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,100
Notice in verse five,

187
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,540
and the angel answered and said unto the women,

188
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,059
fear not ye, for I know that you seek Jesus,

189
00:08:17,059 --> 00:08:18,579
which was crucified.

190
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:20,059
Notice verse six.

191
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:22,679
He is not here, for he is risen,

192
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:26,179
and you see those three words, as he said.

193
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:30,260
See the place where the Lord lay.

194
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:34,780
He is not here, for he is risen from the dead.

195
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,979
And behold, he goeth before you into Galilee there.

196
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:39,940
Shall you see him, lo, I have told you.

197
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,159
We find that here on resurrection morning,

198
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,700
the ladies assemble and they go.

199
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,700
They have their spices for the preparation of the body,

200
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,979
and we find that they arrive,

201
00:08:47,979 --> 00:08:49,739
and we didn't read the entirety of the text.

202
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:51,200
We'll go through it as we get

203
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,460
through the message this morning.

204
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,820
But we find that they arrive,

205
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,400
and the stone is rolled away, the tomb is empty,

206
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,840
and the angel announced the resurrection of our Savior.

207
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,039
It says, why seek ye the living among the dead?

208
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:04,880
In Luke's gospel,

209
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,880
we looked at that at seven o'clock this morning,

210
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,200
and we find this wonderful proclamation.

211
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,640
He is not here, for he is risen, as he said.

212
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,159
See, look at the invitation.

213
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:19,359
See the place where the Lord lay, and then go quickly.

214
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,239
Not only was an invitation to come and see,

215
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:24,739
but then there was an instruction of go and tell.

216
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,299
And we're living in that era of go and tell.

217
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:30,820
Go tell people that you serve a risen Savior,

218
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,599
and what a wonderful truth it is.

219
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:34,859
Let's consider three thoughts this morning

220
00:09:34,859 --> 00:09:38,739
as we consider the burial and resurrection

221
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:42,739
of this glorious event of our wonderful Savior.

222
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:44,359
Number one, if you're taking notes this morning,

223
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:47,700
consider the sealed tomb.

224
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,940
Consider the sealed tomb.

225
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,479
In Matthew 27, I want you to begin reading with me

226
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:52,500
in verse 57.

227
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,380
We don't last week in Matthew 27, verse 27 through 50,

228
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,619
and we looked at the death of Christ,

229
00:09:58,619 --> 00:10:00,520
and we said that the death of Christ.

230
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:07,760
was a violent death. We said that it was a vicarious death, but it was also a voluntary

231
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,180
death and a victorious death. We looked at that last week, and this morning as we look

232
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:18,440
at verse 57, we begin looking at the burial that is recorded for us in Matthew 27. The

233
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,560
Bible says when the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathea named Joseph, who

234
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:30,880
also himself was Jesus' disciple. He went to Pilate, and he begged the body of Jesus.

235
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,680
Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. When Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped

236
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,360
it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in

237
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,080
the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulcher and departed. And there

238
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:53,100
was Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sitting over against the sepulcher. Now the next day

239
00:10:53,100 --> 00:11:00,580
that followed, the day of the preparation, the chief priest and the Pharisees came together

240
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,580
unto Pilate.

241
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,460
Now let me pause here just for a moment. These ladies, they saw what took place, the tomb,

242
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:12,220
the place where Jesus was laid. They understood what Joseph of Arimathea did in putting that

243
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,980
linen cloth in verse 59 upon the body, and then putting that stone there. And the Bible

244
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,300
tells us that on the next day, the religious leaders, it says the Pharisees and the chief

245
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:29,860
priest, and understand this morning that religion never saves anyone. These people were religious,

246
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,940
the chief priest and the Pharisees. I mean, they knew the Old Testament. At least they

247
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,140
knew some of the Old Testament. They didn't understand because Jesus says, search the

248
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:44,700
Scriptures, for they are they which testify of me. And we find that Jesus, in Luke's gospel,

249
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:50,180
in the chapter 24, he begins with Moses and all the prophets, and tells those men, or

250
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:56,420
excuse me, those disciples on the road to Emmaus, all things concerning himself. These

251
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:03,620
religious leaders, they were lost. Religion never saved anyone. Their account was not

252
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:08,260
settled. They were trusting in their religion. You know, the same is true today. Many people

253
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:13,120
are trusting in a religion. Many people are disgusted with religion. You talk to people

254
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,020
today all around, listen, I'm glad I don't have religion. I have a relationship with

255
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:23,380
the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen? It's not religion. It's a relationship. And I'm so thankful for

256
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:28,520
that. These religious leaders, they come to Pilate. Notice what they say in verse 63.

257
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:34,180
It's almost hard to read it, to be honest with you, how they refer to my Savior and

258
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:40,500
my God. It says, saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet

259
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:47,540
alive after three days, I will rise again. I'm thankful this morning that our God cannot

260
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:52,820
lie. He's not a deceiver. Amen? That's how they refer to him. But it's interesting that

261
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:58,060
they refer to him as a deceiver, but yet they reference what they, what he said, what they

262
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:03,900
heard him say, and it brought great concern to them. Now, they call him a deceiver, but

263
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,940
they really think that what he said was going to come true. Isn't that interesting? It says

264
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:15,820
that they say to Pilate, command therefore, in verse 64, that the sepulcher be made sure

265
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:22,980
until the third day. Lest his disciples come by night and steal him away, and say unto

266
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:30,220
the people, he is risen from the dead. So the last error shall be worse than the first.

267
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,420
I know that they explain it this way, and this is the record that we've been given.

268
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,460
This is what they said to Pilate. But I think down deep, they really knew that it didn't

269
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,780
require the disciples to come steal him away. They could have just dealt with the disciples

270
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:49,180
if they chose, or thought that was the only concern. We find that Pilate says to them

271
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:57,260
in verse 65, ye have a watch. Go your way. Notice these words, make it. What's it? Well,

272
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:05,380
the sepulcher. Make it as sure as ye can. We're talking about here, considering the

273
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:12,460
sealed tomb. So they went, after they hear that response from Pilate, and they made the

274
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:23,580
sepulcher sure, sealing the stone and setting a watch. They did everything they could in

275
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:29,340
their power. But the grave, the grave could not keep him. It could not hold him. We sang

276
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:34,660
that last song. It's a wonderful song. I love the third verse. He tore the bars away.

277
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:41,580
Man, isn't that wonderful? Up from the grave he arose with a mighty triumph for his foes.

278
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:47,100
What a savior we have. And we find that when we consider the sealed tomb, and we see the

279
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:53,460
efforts of the religious leaders, and we see the fact that Pilate authorized them. He said,

280
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:59,660
you have a watch. Make it as sure as you can. And they did. They did everything in their

281
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:08,260
power to seal that tomb and to set a watch. But it was all in vain. It was all in vain.

282
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:16,020
Because we find, if we read into the 28th chapter, of course, that he rose. We'll deal

283
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,820
with that in just a moment. But we see the sealed tomb. I want you to consider not only

284
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:26,340
the sealed tomb, but I want you to consider number two, the saddened disciples. There's

285
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:33,580
a sealed tomb, but there are some sad disciples. I want you to consider, just for a moment,

286
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:40,020
all of the emotions that have taken place in these preceding days. I want you to understand,

287
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:46,180
as each gospel record gives us much information, really, with regard to the last week of the

288
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:52,220
life of Jesus Christ on earth, his earthly ministry. And we find, as the gospels provide

289
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:58,100
for us the record, and we come to those last moments of his physical life here on earth

290
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,460
before he would go to the cross of Calvary, that the suffering that he dealt with and

291
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:09,140
all that took place. And he said that they would be scattered. And guess what? They were.

292
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:15,460
We find that Peter was the one that was watching from afar. He was the one that denied during

293
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,380
the trials and all that was taking place. And we find that there were some saddened

294
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:27,220
disciples. These events that took place were impactful. You know, God's made us as emotional

295
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:34,220
people. There are times that we deal with various circumstances in life and there are

296
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:40,940
times that we deal with our emotions. And we might be sad with regard to a certain circumstance

297
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,220
that we're dealing with. And I notice that there's some saddened disciples. Look over

298
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:56,540
at Mark's gospel, if you will. Look at Mark 16. We find in Mark 16, again, verses 1-8

299
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:05,820
would record for us the record of the resurrection that morning when they went to the tomb. It's

300
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:12,500
in verse 7 where we see it says, go your way, tell his disciples and Peter. I referenced

301
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,900
that a moment ago. But I want you to look at verse number 9 with me. Now when Jesus

302
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:22,220
was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of

303
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:29,500
whom he had cast seven devils. And she went and told them that had been with him, notice

304
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:38,540
what it says, as they mourned and wept. There's some saddened disciples with regard to what

305
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:44,580
had transpired. They were there and they watched the trials, the mockings and all that

306
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:50,980
Christ suffered. They were there when he suffered on that cross at Calvary. They understood,

307
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:57,580
the Bible tells us, of those that watched as the tomb in which Jesus was placed. And

308
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:02,660
the Bible says that Mary Magdalene comes and it tells them, those that were there, and

309
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:08,820
they mourned and wept. They were sad. Luke chapter 24, the Bible tells us this, look

310
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:15,620
over in that passage if you will. We'll be in Luke 24 a couple of times here this morning

311
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:21,220
but I just want to look at the beginning and then we'll get to the end of Luke 24 as we

312
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,820
go through the message this morning. As we look at the beginning of this portion of scripture

313
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:33,340
after the resurrection is described for us in verses 1-12, we come to verse 13 and the

314
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:39,980
Bible says, behold two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was

315
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:45,860
from Jerusalem about three score furlongs. It's almost 7 miles, 6.8 miles. It says that

316
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:51,460
they talked together of all these things which had happened. All these things, that's these

317
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:56,340
last few days and the death and the burial and all of those things. And it says in verse

318
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:02,500
15, and it came to pass that while they communed together in reason, notice this, Jesus himself

319
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:10,420
drew near and went with them. But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.

320
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:15,820
Verse 17, it says this, that he, Jesus, said unto them, these two that are walking, what

321
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:27,100
manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad?

322
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,660
Notice what they say. Notice their response. And the one of them whose name was Cleopas

323
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:39,540
answering said unto him, art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and hast not known the things

324
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:45,739
which are come to pass there in these days? And he, Jesus, said unto them, what things?

325
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:53,580
Isn't that wonderful? I love it. And they said unto him, concerning Jesus of Nazareth,

326
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,900
which was a prophet mighty indeed and word before God and all the people and how the

327
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,500
chief priest and our rulers delivered him to be

328
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,980
condemned to death and have crucified him.

329
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,780
But we trusted that it had been he

330
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,380
which should have redeemed Israel.

331
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,260
Beside all this, today is the third day

332
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,979
since these things were done.

333
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,899
Yea, and certain women also of our company

334
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:18,940
made us astonished, which were early at the sepulcher.

335
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,100
And when they found not his body,

336
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,500
they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels

337
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,819
which said he was alive.

338
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:33,299
We find that the Bible tells us in verse 13

339
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,299
that it was that same day.

340
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:40,299
So they hear the announcement, but they walk back to Emmaus.

341
00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:44,060
As they're walking back to Emmaus, they're sad.

342
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,659
They're talking, they're having these communications

343
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:48,779
and Jesus joins them.

344
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:50,779
They don't know that it's Jesus.

345
00:20:51,939 --> 00:20:53,979
And he says what things and they explain it.

346
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:56,479
And see, you understand even as they said

347
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:58,740
that they had thought, they trusted

348
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,299
that it had been he, Jesus,

349
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,139
which should have redeemed Israel.

350
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:03,819
See, many of the Jewish people,

351
00:21:03,819 --> 00:21:07,940
they were looking for deliverance from Rome.

352
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,260
They were looking for a kingdom

353
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,699
to be established at that time.

354
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:16,540
But see, they didn't recognize

355
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,919
that what they first needed to be redeemed from,

356
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:23,339
their greatest need of deliverance was not from Rome,

357
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:26,620
but was redemption from their sin.

358
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,099
And Jesus, through his death, burial and resurrection,

359
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:36,099
he was providing redemption for their greatest need.

360
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,260
They believe that their greatest need

361
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,819
was deliverance from Rome.

362
00:21:40,819 --> 00:21:42,540
But in fact, their greatest need

363
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,019
was deliverance from their sin.

364
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:46,220
Today, the same is true.

365
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,900
There are many people that have ideas

366
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,059
of what they really need.

367
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,739
If I could just get this, or if I could just get that,

368
00:21:51,739 --> 00:21:54,180
if I could have, if I could so on and so forth,

369
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,300
this is my greatest need.

370
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,300
Can I tell you, the greatest need of every human being

371
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,000
is to be delivered from their sin.

372
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,019
That's the greatest need.

373
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:03,220
And I tell you this morning

374
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,739
that if you're saved by the blood of Christ,

375
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:06,620
if you've been saved, you've been redeemed,

376
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:10,940
you have your need met in Jesus.

377
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,899
That's the only way to have that need met,

378
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,500
is through the Lord Jesus Christ.

379
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,500
And here we find that they had trusted,

380
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,300
they had a belief, but Jesus is walking.

381
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,619
We're gonna come back to Luke 24 here

382
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:25,660
in just a few moments.

383
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,020
But I want you to consider,

384
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,500
as we think about the emotional time for these disciples,

385
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,020
and I love the fact that even in the midst

386
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,399
of these emotional, sad times,

387
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,860
that Jesus comes along them, alongside them.

388
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:45,860
See, God knows everything that we deal with.

389
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,139
There are times in life,

390
00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:50,059
see, these two are talking amongst themselves,

391
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:51,460
and they're sad.

392
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:55,500
Sometimes we talk amongst ourselves and we're sad, right?

393
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,020
We have problems, we have issues,

394
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,940
we have circumstances, trials, and so on and so forth.

395
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,179
And we can find somebody to talk to,

396
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:04,740
to confide in, whatever word we wanna use,

397
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,979
and we can have those communications amongst ourselves.

398
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:10,740
But I'm thankful that Jesus can come along

399
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,259
and he can help us.

400
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:15,220
See, we need to learn to tell it to Jesus.

401
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,600
Tell it to Jesus.

402
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:21,220
We have the privilege of going to God in prayer.

403
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:24,580
We have the privilege of going to God in prayer.

404
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,740
And we can do that at any moment for anything,

405
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,020
knowing that he hears us and that he'll help us

406
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,380
and he sustains us.

407
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,139
And Jesus comes alongside them and he's walking

408
00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:36,339
and he's talking with them.

409
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:39,539
And we'll see some more of what this conversation holds

410
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:40,899
in just a few moments.

411
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:44,580
But I want you to consider, there's a sealed tomb.

412
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,619
There are some saddened disciples.

413
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:49,820
But I want you to understand this morning, number three,

414
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,460
I'm so thankful this morning to serve a risen Savior.

415
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,539
I know many have said it.

416
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:54,940
We've been singing about it.

417
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,619
We mentioned it during the 7 a.m. service.

418
00:23:56,619 --> 00:23:59,279
We had some testimonies and several testified

419
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,800
of just what a blessing it is to know

420
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,660
that we serve a risen Savior.

421
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,020
And certainly it is.

422
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,339
You ask me how I know he lives?

423
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:08,539
Oh man, we could tell you on and on and on.

424
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:11,339
He is a very present help in the time of trouble.

425
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:13,139
Listen, he's a friend that's to get closer

426
00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:13,979
than any brother.

427
00:24:13,979 --> 00:24:15,979
He is my advocate, my intercessor.

428
00:24:15,979 --> 00:24:17,500
He's my friend, my guide.

429
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,700
He is my shepherd.

430
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,140
I mean, he takes care of me.

431
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,459
He provides for me.

432
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,399
I pray to him.

433
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:23,239
I commune with him.

434
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:25,339
Man, he is alive.

435
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:29,779
He says in Revelation that he is the one that was dead,

436
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:33,700
but now is alive, and he is alive forevermore.

437
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,899
And we can rejoice and be glad in that truth this morning.

438
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:41,720
And we find as we consider his spectacular resurrection,

439
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,500
as we find that each gospel record records this for us.

440
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,179
We'll go back to Matthew chapter 28

441
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:51,220
and read those verses that lead up to the text

442
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,700
that I read to begin our message this morning.

443
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,220
But notice in verse number one of Matthew 28,

444
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,239
the Bible says this.

445
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,899
In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn

446
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:05,380
toward the first day of the week,

447
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,140
came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary

448
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,739
to see the sepulcher.

449
00:25:08,739 --> 00:25:11,619
And behold, there was a great earthquake,

450
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:13,540
for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven

451
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:16,980
and came and rolled back the stone from the door

452
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,420
and sat upon it.

453
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,140
His countenance was like lightning,

454
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,660
and his raiment white as snow.

455
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,380
And for fear of him, the keepers.

456
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,899
What were those keepers doing there?

457
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:30,459
Well, remember, that's the sealed tomb, remember?

458
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:32,220
Those are the ones that said,

459
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,500
the chief priests and the Pharisees,

460
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,619
hey, Pilate, we need to make this as sure as we can.

461
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,220
He said, you have a watch.

462
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,619
Make it as sure as you can.

463
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:41,420
And the Bible tells us that they sealed the stone

464
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,299
and then they set a watch,

465
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:44,899
but it tells us in verse number four,

466
00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:46,739
for fear of him, the keepers did shake

467
00:25:46,739 --> 00:25:49,660
and became as dead men.

468
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,859
The angel answered and said unto the women,

469
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:55,700
fear not ye, for I know that ye seek Jesus,

470
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,660
which was crucified.

471
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,899
He is not here, for he is risen, as he said.

472
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:02,000
Come, see the place where the Lord lay.

473
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:04,859
Go quickly and tell his disciples

474
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:06,380
that he is risen from the dead.

475
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,239
And behold, he goeth before you into Galilee.

476
00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:09,660
There shall you see him.

477
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,579
Lo, I have told you.

478
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:12,859
And they departed quickly from the sepulcher.

479
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,100
Notice this, with fear and great joy.

480
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,700
There's some mixed emotions.

481
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,059
And did run to bring his disciples word.

482
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,700
As they went to tell his disciples,

483
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,660
behold, Jesus met them saying, all hail.

484
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,179
They came and held him by the feet and worshiped him.

485
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:30,619
Then said Jesus unto them, be not afraid.

486
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:32,899
Go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee

487
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:36,140
and there shall they see me.

488
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,100
We find that as we consider the spectacular resurrection

489
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,299
of our wonderful Savior,

490
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:41,980
that not only did he rise,

491
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,619
conquering sin, death, and the grave,

492
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:46,100
but we find that he appeared to many.

493
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,140
Acts says it this way, that many infallible proofs.

494
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,100
We read 1 Corinthians 15 this morning

495
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,500
in the 7 a.m. service.

496
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,179
And we mentioned in that text of scripture

497
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:58,019
of all of those that were eyewitnesses

498
00:26:58,019 --> 00:26:59,299
of the resurrected Christ.

499
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:03,500
And Paul adds in there, and above 500 at once.

500
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,660
Many of whom were still alive

501
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,579
at the time of the writing of 1 Corinthians.

502
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:12,500
Some had died, but many were still alive.

503
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,779
But I wanna focus just for a few moments here

504
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:16,859
as we finish our message this morning

505
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:21,859
on three personal times in which Jesus appeared

506
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,100
to an individual, to a group of people.

507
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,260
And I want you to look at these,

508
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,779
and I want you to see how Christ ministers to his people.

509
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:33,779
The first one, we look in John chapter 20.

510
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:37,739
And I want you to see as Jesus had risen from the dead,

511
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,260
how he appeared to Mary.

512
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,299
To Mary.

513
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,459
In John chapter number 20, again,

514
00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:46,579
the record of the resurrection is given to us

515
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:47,700
in verses one through nine.

516
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,500
But beginning in verse number 10,

517
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,779
we begin to see this text with regard to Mary

518
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:54,380
being there in the garden.

519
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,940
And the Bible says in verse number 10,

520
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,380
and the disciples went,

521
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:01,059
then the disciples went away unto their own home.

522
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:04,940
But Mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping.

523
00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:07,579
And as she wept, she stooped down

524
00:28:07,579 --> 00:28:09,100
and looked into the sepulcher,

525
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,260
and seeth two angels in white sitting,

526
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,779
the one at the head and the other at the feet,

527
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:16,140
where the body of Jesus had lain, past tense,

528
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,619
because he rose.

529
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:22,380
They said unto her, woman, why weepest thou?

530
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,899
She saith unto them, because they have taken away my Lord,

531
00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:27,100
and I know not where they have laid him.

532
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,220
When she had thus said, she turned herself back

533
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,459
and saw Jesus standing.

534
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:33,780
But notice what the Bible says,

535
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:37,260
and knew not that it was Jesus.

536
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,700
Jesus saith unto her, woman, why weepest thou?

537
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,260
Whom seekest thou?

538
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:51,140
She, Mary, supposing him to be the gardener,

539
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,500
saith unto him, sir, if thou have borne him,

540
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,580
hence tell me where thou hast laid him,

541
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,780
and I will take him away.

542
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:05,260
And then Jesus says her name, Mary, Mary.

543
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,419
You see it in verse number 16.

544
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:09,900
Isn't it wonderful, he knows our name,

545
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,739
and he speaks her name.

546
00:29:11,739 --> 00:29:14,059
And the Bible says that she turned herself

547
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:18,059
and saith unto him, Rabboni, which is to say, master.

548
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,219
Jesus saith unto her, touch me not,

549
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:22,979
for I am not yet ascended to my father,

550
00:29:22,979 --> 00:29:24,739
but go to my brethren and say unto them,

551
00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:26,580
I ascend unto my father and your father,

552
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,859
and to my God and your God.

553
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:30,059
Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples

554
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,260
that she had seen the Lord

555
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:36,739
and that he had spoken these things unto her.

556
00:29:36,739 --> 00:29:38,020
Isn't that wonderful?

557
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,739
Mary was sitting in the garden there.

558
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:44,179
She's weeping and she's distraught.

559
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,299
She doesn't know, she can't make sense

560
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:48,619
of all of the circumstances,

561
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:50,539
all of the things that have happened.

562
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,659
And we find, as we've mentioned already,

563
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:54,820
as we looked in several of the gospels,

564
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,659
we mentioned this at seven o'clock service this morning

565
00:29:56,659 --> 00:30:00,419
in Luke's gospel, remember that Jesus said this.

566
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:03,859
then they remembered his sayings."

567
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:08,019
All of those emotions that were taking place, listen, sometimes in the time of your greatest

568
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:12,859
difficulty, you are prone to forget the wonderful promises that God has given you.

569
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:14,979
You're prone to forget.

570
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:18,259
He said, remember.

571
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:23,459
We find that she's there and she's weeping and she's stooped down and she's looking in

572
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:30,079
and yes, there's some interaction and she explains, but then she sees who she thinks

573
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,479
might be a gardener and she asked this question, just tell me where you put them and I'll take

574
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:37,519
them away and then he speaks her name.

575
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:39,559
You know, Jesus knew what Mary was going through.

576
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:44,079
He knew where she was and he came to her.

577
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,079
Isn't that awesome?

578
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:47,439
And he spoke her name.

579
00:30:47,439 --> 00:30:54,399
Listen, we have a God who is personal, who knows our very needs.

580
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,719
He knows your heart this morning.

581
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:57,119
He knows what you're dealing with.

582
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:58,839
He knows the heartaches that we have.

583
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,239
We don't have to get so consumed with those things.

584
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:06,639
No, we need to get consumed with our Savior.

585
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:09,279
And all of a sudden we get more consumed with our Savior.

586
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:14,399
The things of this world, even the problems and the trials, I don't pretend that they

587
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,039
go away, but they're not as significant.

588
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,919
They're not as big.

589
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:19,999
Why?

590
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:21,139
Because my God's in control.

591
00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:22,139
My God has a plan.

592
00:31:22,139 --> 00:31:26,839
My God knows where I am and he knows what I'm dealing with and he comes alongside and

593
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:27,839
he ministers.

594
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:30,779
What a blessing.

595
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:36,359
In Luke 24, we've mentioned already as we've read through part of this passage, but I want

596
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:42,559
you to notice the ministry of Christ to these two disciples on the road to Emmaus.

597
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,439
They had explained to him what they had anticipated.

598
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:51,799
Cleopas is speaking and we find that the Bible will pick up the text in verse 25 as Jesus

599
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:56,119
is now going to respond to them.

600
00:31:56,119 --> 00:32:01,639
He says, O fools in slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken.

601
00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:06,439
Ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory?

602
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:12,359
And then the Bible tells us in verse 27, beginning at Moses, and all the prophets, he, Christ,

603
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:18,839
expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.

604
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:23,719
You know, sometimes when we think about the difficulties that we deal with, being sad

605
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:27,399
as we mention these, Jesus comes alongside them, but you know what he does?

606
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:29,399
He uses his word.

607
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:32,679
He uses his word.

608
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:35,679
You know what we need in the time of difficulty?

609
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,999
We don't necessarily need to pick up the phone and just start calling whoever and talking

610
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:42,479
and trying to, no, no, we need to get into the word.

611
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:45,319
Let God minister to us.

612
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:49,999
He started in Moses and the prophets and he's going to expound to them all things concerning

613
00:32:49,999 --> 00:32:50,999
himself.

614
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:54,759
Ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory?

615
00:32:54,759 --> 00:33:00,559
Listen, you're sad because of these events, but these events were foretold.

616
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:06,039
It was known that Christ was going to suffer and bleed and die, but he was going to rise

617
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:07,039
again.

618
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:12,519
It had been told to them, not only in the Old Testament, but Jesus himself had spoken

619
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:16,279
these words to the disciples.

620
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:21,239
The Bible says in verse 28, and they drew nigh unto the village whither they went, and

621
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:23,239
he made as though he would have gone further.

622
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:26,719
Jesus was going to keep on going, but they constrained him.

623
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:30,079
Listen, there's a message there.

624
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:32,159
You have to invite Jesus in.

625
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,639
You have to desire, listen, he doesn't force himself upon anyone.

626
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:40,839
The Bible talks about the disciples in one of the miracles when they're toiling and rowing.

627
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:44,759
They're in the midst of a storm and they're toiling and rowing and Jesus is going to walk

628
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:46,839
by.

629
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,199
But they invited him into the ship.

630
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:52,079
It made all the difference when they invited him into the ship.

631
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:57,999
Listen, the Bible says that he would have kept on going, but they constrained him.

632
00:33:57,999 --> 00:34:01,959
I'm so thankful that, listen, he's given us a free will.

633
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:05,879
And even as his children, you know, you can be saved here this morning, but it doesn't

634
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:09,319
mean, he don't make you read your Bible.

635
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:10,559
He didn't make you come to church today.

636
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:13,239
You came to church because you wanted to be here, amen?

637
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:16,239
If you read your Bible today, if you plan to read your Bible later today, you're only

638
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,239
going to read it because you want to.

639
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,639
He's not going to make you.

640
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,319
I will say this, there are times in which God will allow circumstances into your life

641
00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:28,479
to bring you to a place of dependence on him, amen?

642
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:29,959
He'll bring you to the end of yourself.

643
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:33,479
He'll bring you to the place where you recognize, listen, I've gone away from God.

644
00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:34,879
I've gotten far away from God.

645
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:35,879
I've neglected him.

646
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:37,159
I've neglected church.

647
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,279
I've neglected the Bible.

648
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:39,559
I've neglected prayer.

649
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:41,639
And then you look at your life and say, man, it's a mess.

650
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,639
It's a wreck.

651
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:48,239
And God will allow those things in your life to bring you back to him, amen?

652
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:53,439
There's some people that have testimonies of their salvation and some things that happened

653
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:57,759
that led up to how God brought them to the end of themselves.

654
00:34:57,759 --> 00:35:05,039
But it says that they constrained him saying, abide with us for it is toward evening and

655
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:06,279
the day is far spent.

656
00:35:06,279 --> 00:35:11,719
Notice this, and he went in to tarry with them.

657
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:16,839
I don't know how long he was there, but can I tell you that when you invite Jesus in,

658
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:18,839
he's not in a hurry to leave.

659
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:21,279
Isn't that good?

660
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:24,559
I mean, honestly, you can just spend time with the Lord.

661
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:26,639
You don't have to be in a hurry.

662
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:29,159
He's not in a hurry.

663
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:35,919
It says that he went in to tarry with them, to tarry with them.

664
00:35:35,919 --> 00:35:38,519
You ever feel like you're somewhere and it's kind of rushed?

665
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:39,519
Doctors?

666
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:46,879
You say, man, I got two and a half seconds with the doctor.

667
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:48,679
It works that way sometimes.

668
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,959
But it says that he went in to tarry with them.

669
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:56,679
Listen, I'm thankful this morning that we can spend time with God as much time as we

670
00:35:56,679 --> 00:36:00,399
want, as much time as we want.

671
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:02,399
What a blessing.

672
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:07,759
In his presence is fullness of joy.

673
00:36:07,759 --> 00:36:11,579
Sometimes we just need...we've missed something in 2024.

674
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:14,319
It's really been a lot of decades that we've missed it.

675
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:21,079
We've missed the ability to be still and know that I'm God, and just spend some time in

676
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:24,839
the presence of God.

677
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,919
Not being in a hurry.

678
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:27,919
Not when is this going to end?

679
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:29,719
I got this, that, blah, blah, blah.

680
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:33,039
Just spending time with God.

681
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:37,399
It says in verse number 30, and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them.

682
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:41,359
You understand they didn't have crock pots back then that it was like already simmering

683
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,959
and ready, and they just kind of came in.

684
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:44,599
No, no, no, no, no, no.

685
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:46,519
It didn't work like that back then.

686
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:47,759
They were seven miles away.

687
00:36:47,759 --> 00:36:51,599
They had been in Jerusalem for all the things that happened, and then they come, and they're

688
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,199
going to have a meal.

689
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:54,759
There was some time that was spent there.

690
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:58,079
I don't know how long, but there was some time that was spent there, and it says that

691
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:05,999
as they sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and break, and gave to them.

692
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:11,719
Their eyes were opened, and they knew him.

693
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:14,799
Then it says he vanished out of their sight.

694
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,999
See he came, and he ministered.

695
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:21,639
He did for them what they needed.

696
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:26,559
It says that when he took that bread, and he blessed it, and they break, and he gave

697
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:31,999
it to them, how their eyes were opened, and then notice what they said after their eyes

698
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:32,999
were opened.

699
00:37:32,999 --> 00:37:33,999
He vanished.

700
00:37:33,999 --> 00:37:34,999
It says that they said one to another in verse 32.

701
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:42,999
Did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened

702
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:44,959
to us the scriptures?

703
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:48,639
That's a good kind of heartburn, amen?

704
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:50,279
They were full of joy.

705
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:54,319
They said as Jesus were walking, and now they know that it was him, he vanished out of their

706
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:55,319
sight.

707
00:37:55,319 --> 00:38:01,079
It says, did not our heart burn within us when he walked with us by the way, and he

708
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,679
opened the scriptures?

709
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:04,679
So what do they do?

710
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:10,639
Well, after walking 6.8 miles to where the village was where they dwell, they turned

711
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:16,879
around and walked 6.8 miles back to Jerusalem to announce to the others that Jesus is risen

712
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:20,159
indeed, hallelujah.

713
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,599
Now they'd be able to minister to others.

714
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,679
Let me share with you one final account of Jesus appearing.

715
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,079
It's in John chapter 20.

716
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:34,119
We dropped off with Mary in verse number 16 and following, we really read all the way

717
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,119
down to verse 18.

718
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:42,039
We're going to pick up in verse 19 and look at the disciples that were gathered together.

719
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:46,159
The Bible tells us in verse number 19 that they're gathered together on the night, the

720
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,399
same night of the resurrection.

721
00:38:48,399 --> 00:38:53,159
It was evening and the first day of the week, and they're gathered there together.

722
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:58,880
The Bible says then the same day at evening in verse 19 of John 20, being the first day

723
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,399
of the week when the doors were shut, where the disciples were assembled for fear of the

724
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:11,880
Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them, peace be unto you.

725
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,959
Isn't that awesome?

726
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:16,200
He comes and he appears to them.

727
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,519
They're assembled.

728
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:22,359
The Bible told us as we look back in Mark's gospel that they mourned and wept.

729
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:24,959
We find here that they're in this place.

730
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:28,839
The doors are shut and they're trying to be secure.

731
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:29,839
Why?

732
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,159
For fear of the Jews it tells us in verse 19.

733
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:35,200
Remember, there's a lot of stirring that's going on because of the resurrection, that

734
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,639
tomb that was set and sealed and all of that.

735
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:39,760
And so there's all kinds of things going on.

736
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,320
And so they're there and Jesus appears and says, peace be unto you.

737
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:52,820
And when he had so said, he showed unto them his hands and his side.

738
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:57,880
Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord.

739
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,279
Then said Jesus to them again, peace be unto you.

740
00:40:00,279 --> 00:40:09,079
unto you, as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you."

741
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:15,079
What a great message of instruction that Jesus gave to the disciples.

742
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:19,959
We find that in Galilee, as you study the Gospel of Matthew, that Jesus will give the

743
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:27,519
Great Commission there, and we note that he says, as the Father hath sent me, even so

744
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:30,279
send I you.

745
00:40:30,279 --> 00:40:33,799
Verse 22, and when he had said thus, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive the

746
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:38,059
Holy Ghost, and whosoever sins you remit, they are remitted unto them, and whosoever

747
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:40,679
sins you retain, they are retained.

748
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:45,599
That wasn't that they had the ability to forgive sin, but they would preach the Gospel message

749
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,319
that is the power to forgive sin, amen, that's what he's telling them.

750
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:56,819
But Thomas, notice verse 24, one of the 12, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus

751
00:40:56,819 --> 00:40:57,819
came.

752
00:40:57,819 --> 00:41:00,539
I always feel bad for Thomas.

753
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:04,179
I don't mean to be unkind, but don't miss church, you never know what God's going to

754
00:41:04,179 --> 00:41:08,519
do, amen, they're assembled together.

755
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:16,339
I've often heard it said, I've thought it myself, you know, you miss what God has for

756
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:21,859
you, God has something for you, Thomas wasn't there.

757
00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:27,579
So the other disciples of verse 25, they said unto him, We have seen the Lord, but

758
00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:31,659
notice what Thomas says, Thomas gets that doubting Thomas, right, we refer to him that

759
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:34,939
way, because here's what he says in verse 25, but he said unto them, Except I shall

760
00:41:34,939 --> 00:41:39,299
see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails,

761
00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:45,779
and thrust my hand into his side, notice, I will not believe.

762
00:41:45,779 --> 00:41:46,779
I will not believe.

763
00:41:47,779 --> 00:41:52,059
You know, there's some people today that still have this kind of attitude of Thomas,

764
00:41:52,059 --> 00:42:01,219
they want God to, I just want God to speak to me, hello, he's giving us a Bible, I just

765
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:03,339
want God to appear to me.

766
00:42:03,339 --> 00:42:10,259
You know, in Luke 16, that rich man that died, he said, Lazarus, Abraham, let Lazarus go

767
00:42:10,259 --> 00:42:12,019
and tell my brothers, why?

768
00:42:12,019 --> 00:42:16,219
Because he's in hell and he didn't want his brothers to come there, he had five brethren.

769
00:42:16,219 --> 00:42:19,019
He knew that hell was a real place.

770
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:20,019
He was there, he was in torment.

771
00:42:20,019 --> 00:42:22,739
He said, I don't want them to come.

772
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:27,139
And listen, if one come back from the dead, then they'll believe.

773
00:42:27,139 --> 00:42:29,979
You know what the Bible says?

774
00:42:29,979 --> 00:42:32,179
They have Moses, the prophets.

775
00:42:32,179 --> 00:42:33,179
You know what they mean by that?

776
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:35,939
Moses and the law, the prophets, what does he mean by that?

777
00:42:35,939 --> 00:42:38,399
They have the word of God.

778
00:42:38,399 --> 00:42:44,419
If they won't believe that, they won't believe yet one rose from the dead.

779
00:42:44,419 --> 00:42:45,419
That's Bible.

780
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:48,259
See, Thomas says, I will not believe.

781
00:42:48,259 --> 00:42:50,419
Notice God is so gracious.

782
00:42:50,419 --> 00:42:51,419
He really is.

783
00:42:51,419 --> 00:42:56,219
He's more gracious than I would be, and He's more gracious than you would be, because we're

784
00:42:56,219 --> 00:42:58,219
just human beings.

785
00:42:58,219 --> 00:42:59,619
Amen?

786
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:02,439
Have you experienced the grace of God in your life?

787
00:43:02,439 --> 00:43:05,979
Would you acknowledge this morning that God's more gracious than you are?

788
00:43:05,979 --> 00:43:07,859
He's more faithful than you are?

789
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:12,979
I'm thankful that His grace to me is not dependent on my grace and that His faithfulness to me

790
00:43:12,979 --> 00:43:14,499
isn't dependent on my faith.

791
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:16,219
So, God is gracious.

792
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:17,219
He's merciful.

793
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,339
I've experienced it, and I'm thankful for it.

794
00:43:19,339 --> 00:43:23,539
And here, the Bible says, after eight days again, the disciples were within.

795
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:28,019
And notice these words, and Thomas was with them.

796
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:30,459
I guess so.

797
00:43:30,459 --> 00:43:33,339
After he missed it, he was with them.

798
00:43:33,339 --> 00:43:39,419
The Bible says, then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said,

799
00:43:39,419 --> 00:43:42,339
Peace be unto you.

800
00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:44,219
And notice this in verse 27.

801
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:49,219
Just like in Mark's gospel, when it says, tell the disciples, and Peter, again, our

802
00:43:49,219 --> 00:43:51,499
God's an individual God.

803
00:43:51,499 --> 00:43:52,999
He's the God of the universe.

804
00:43:52,999 --> 00:43:54,779
He loves all people.

805
00:43:54,779 --> 00:43:58,819
He wants all people to be saved, but He's an individual God.

806
00:43:58,819 --> 00:44:00,179
He cares about you as an individual.

807
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,899
He knows you as an individual.

808
00:44:01,899 --> 00:44:08,659
And it says that He came, notice, He saith to Thomas, then saith He to Thomas.

809
00:44:08,659 --> 00:44:12,659
Thomas was the one that said, unless I see, unless I put my finger, unless I, I will

810
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:13,659
not believe.

811
00:44:13,659 --> 00:44:19,819
And so Jesus says to Thomas, notice what He says, reach hither thy finger, and behold

812
00:44:19,819 --> 00:44:22,259
my hands.

813
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:32,099
Reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side, and be not faithless, but believing.

814
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:37,339
Thomas answered and said unto Him, My Lord and my God.

815
00:44:37,339 --> 00:44:41,499
Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed.

816
00:44:41,499 --> 00:44:48,099
Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.

817
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:52,259
Many other signs truly to Jesus in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in

818
00:44:52,259 --> 00:44:53,259
this book.

819
00:44:53,259 --> 00:44:57,659
Notice these things are written that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son

820
00:44:57,659 --> 00:45:04,539
of God, and that believing you might have life through His name.

821
00:45:04,539 --> 00:45:09,339
As we consider the spectacular resurrection, we rejoice in the truth that Jesus rose conquering

822
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:13,539
sin, death, and the grave, but then He appeared to many.

823
00:45:13,539 --> 00:45:16,579
We didn't look at all those that He appeared to.

824
00:45:16,579 --> 00:45:21,019
We don't even have record of all of the appearances that He made, but we notice in these three

825
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:28,019
records in John, Luke, and again in John, we find that Jesus graciously comes alongside

826
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:30,379
and He ministers to His people.

827
00:45:31,219 --> 00:45:36,339
If you're saved this morning, if you've trusted Christ as your Savior, He wants to minister

828
00:45:36,339 --> 00:45:37,339
to your needs.

829
00:45:37,339 --> 00:45:41,099
He has a very present help at the time of trouble.

830
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:45,099
He said that He would never leave you nor forsake you.

831
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:49,539
We understand that as we get into His presence, as we abide in Him, that He abides in us,

832
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:56,499
that as we draw nigh to God, that He draws nigh to us, that He is a God who is seeking.

833
00:45:56,499 --> 00:45:59,579
He doesn't force Himself, however.

834
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:04,219
He doesn't make you spend time with Him.

835
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:10,059
He desires that you spend time with Him, and He's always available, but He wants to minister

836
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,499
to you.

837
00:46:11,499 --> 00:46:16,739
And I'm so thankful that we serve a risen Savior that knows our needs, and He comes

838
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:18,659
alongside and He ministers.

839
00:46:18,659 --> 00:46:22,299
If you're not saved this morning, you say, I don't even know, you've talked about being

840
00:46:22,299 --> 00:46:26,419
saved many times, I don't even know what it means, I don't understand it.

841
00:46:26,419 --> 00:46:34,499
Let me put it this way, if you're not sure with 100% confidence that heaven is your home,

842
00:46:34,499 --> 00:46:35,499
then today you need to be saved.

843
00:46:35,499 --> 00:46:38,659
It was a glorious Easter morning.

844
00:46:38,659 --> 00:46:42,179
What a great day to be saved if you're not saved this morning.

845
00:46:42,179 --> 00:46:46,219
If you don't know, listen, I was baptized, that's not being saved.

846
00:46:46,219 --> 00:46:49,059
I went to church when I was, that's not being saved.

847
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:50,779
I did, it's not being saved.

848
00:46:50,779 --> 00:46:52,499
There's only one way to be saved.

849
00:46:52,499 --> 00:46:57,579
Here's what Peter said, there's no other name under heaven given among men whereby

850
00:46:57,579 --> 00:47:01,219
we must be saved.

851
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:05,859
Acts 4 and verse number 12, he's preaching that before the religious leaders actually

852
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:07,659
that are interrogating him.

853
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:12,899
As he preaches that message, he gives us the truth that salvation is only through Christ

854
00:47:12,899 --> 00:47:13,899
Jesus.

855
00:47:13,899 --> 00:47:14,899
You say, why do I need salvation?

856
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:19,659
Because you have an account, you have a sin account.

857
00:47:19,659 --> 00:47:28,779
And honestly, until you get saved, that account is growing day by day, and you stand guilty

858
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,659
before a holy God.

859
00:47:30,659 --> 00:47:34,819
The Bible tells us there's a sad scene in Revelation 20, but the Bible teaches us about

860
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:36,339
a great white throne judgment.

861
00:47:36,339 --> 00:47:41,059
So we talk about the resurrection, everyone's going to rise.

862
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:44,959
Some to eternal life, some to eternal damnation, some, listen, I'm thankful that the second

863
00:47:44,959 --> 00:47:48,859
death has no power over me because I've been saved by the blood of Christ, and I'm not

864
00:47:48,859 --> 00:47:53,219
going to be at the great white throne judgment as a subject of that judgment.

865
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:56,979
I will stand before Christ, and so will you if you're saved this morning at the bema seat

866
00:47:56,979 --> 00:47:59,099
of Christ, the judgment seat of Christ.

867
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:03,299
But at the great white throne, the Bible says the dead are raised, and the Bible says they

868
00:48:03,299 --> 00:48:09,219
stand before God, great, small, and great, all men that have not trusted Christ as their

869
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,219
Savior.

870
00:48:10,219 --> 00:48:13,059
And the Bible says the books are open, and they're judged out of those books, and it

871
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:18,519
says, whosoever is not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

872
00:48:19,179 --> 00:48:20,179
This is the second death.

873
00:48:20,179 --> 00:48:24,359
But can I tell you this morning, Jesus loved you so much, and He died for you, and He rose

874
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:29,639
again so that you do not have to suffer that second death.

875
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:31,959
You don't have to spend eternity in the lake of fire.

876
00:48:31,959 --> 00:48:34,999
You can be saved by the grace of God.

877
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:36,959
This morning, that message is for you.

878
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:39,119
If you're not saved this morning, it's for you.

879
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,559
Today is the day of salvation.

880
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:44,479
We're going to have an invitation in just a moment, and when we do, we never want to

881
00:48:44,479 --> 00:48:46,359
embarrass anybody, but we'd love to have you come.

882
00:48:46,359 --> 00:48:50,919
We'd take a Bible and show you how to be saved, to know for sure.

883
00:48:50,919 --> 00:48:54,039
If you're a man, we'll have a man talk to you, if you're a lady, we'll have a lady talk

884
00:48:54,039 --> 00:48:55,039
with you.

885
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:59,159
But then I think about the Christians that are here this morning, I wonder how often

886
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:05,879
do we live with the mindset that we serve a risen Savior.

887
00:49:05,879 --> 00:49:12,159
It's not just on Easter Sunday, it's not just on any Sunday, but every day of our lives

888
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:14,679
that we remember that we serve a risen Savior.

889
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:19,279
The power of the resurrection, we're to live in that power.

890
00:49:19,279 --> 00:49:25,399
We're to go, as the disciples were instructed, to go and tell, let it be known.

891
00:49:25,399 --> 00:49:28,119
He is risen indeed.

892
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:29,119
Let's pray together.

893
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:30,119
Father, we love you.

894
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:31,119
We thank you for loving us.

895
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:36,039
We thank you, God, for the opportunity that you've given us to gather today.

896
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:40,759
We thank you for the early service, and we thank you, God, for the breakfast, and now

897
00:49:40,759 --> 00:49:41,759
for this service.

898
00:49:41,879 --> 00:49:47,159
We thank you for the opportunity to look at so many passages of Scripture this morning.

899
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:51,359
Thank you that the grave could not hold you, Lord.

900
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:58,319
Lord, as we consider this morning that sealed tomb and the saddened disciples, how we focus

901
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:00,319
and rejoice in the speculation.

902
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:08,119
spectacular resurrection. God, I pray that you would help each of us to live with resurrection

903
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:14,759
power. Lord, that we live each day knowing that you love us and that you come to minister

904
00:50:14,759 --> 00:50:20,239
to us. Lord, if one's not saved this morning, God, I don't know everyone here. I don't know

905
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:26,519
the hearts, but God, you do. God, I know based on the authority of your word that you love

906
00:50:26,519 --> 00:50:32,439
every single person, that you died for them and you rose again for them, and you offer

907
00:50:32,439 --> 00:50:37,119
to them eternal life. God, if they're not saved, I pray they'd come today and get it

908
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:42,079
settled. That even as those young men sang that song, the old account was settled, they

909
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:48,999
said long ago, to be settled today. For Christians this morning, those that have been saved,

910
00:50:48,999 --> 00:50:56,399
those that could say the old account was settled long ago, God, would you help us to live in

911
00:50:56,399 --> 00:51:01,279
such a way that you'd be pleased, honored, and glorified with our lives. Lord, help us

912
00:51:01,279 --> 00:51:06,119
to be your representatives, good representatives, ambassadors, Lord, representing the King of

913
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:10,599
Kings and Lord of Lords. We look forward to your soon return. I pray that you'd help us

914
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:15,439
to be found faithful. We pray that you'd work in these moments of invitation, that you have

915
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:19,479
your will and way, that you'd do what only you could do, and we'll thank you for it in

916
00:51:19,479 --> 00:51:23,879
Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? I mentioned that we'd have a time of invitation.

917
00:51:23,879 --> 00:51:28,599
There it is. What do we do this for? Well, we want to give you an opportunity to respond.

918
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:33,719
You've listened so well, and now you have an opportunity to respond. Maybe you just

919
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:38,719
want to come and thank God that He saved you and that He lives and that He's got a plan.

920
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:42,119
Maybe you're not sure of heaven. We'll all take a Bible, show you how you could know

921
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:46,119
for sure that you would not leave this place without knowing for sure that heaven's your

922
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:50,559
home. Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano, and as she does, the altar is open.
