1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,859
This morning, the book of 2 Timothy,

2
00:00:02,859 --> 00:00:05,199
the book of 2 Timothy, it'll be a theme verse

3
00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:07,800
or a theme really message this morning,

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,640
kind of overviewing the entire thought for the new year.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,319
And I'm thankful for the opportunity

6
00:00:13,319 --> 00:00:17,920
to be looking forward to what God has in store for us.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,280
In many ways, I believe that you would probably

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,440
echo the statement, it's hard to believe

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,979
that today is the last day of 2023.

10
00:00:25,979 --> 00:00:30,459
And for many of us, as we flip the calendar tomorrow, 2024,

11
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:32,419
we think about just our lives

12
00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:34,419
and we think about all that has happened

13
00:00:34,419 --> 00:00:36,299
and see where we are.

14
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:39,159
And we certainly rejoice in the goodness of God,

15
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:41,740
the opportunity and privilege that he has given us

16
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,459
to serve him yet for another day.

17
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:46,939
And we look forward to what God will do.

18
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:49,860
Of course, we expect that God will continue

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,700
to do great things.

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,500
We look forward to a soon return,

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,340
and it could be that we never even flip

22
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,560
the calendar to tomorrow.

23
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,560
It could be that the Lord returns still today

24
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,439
and that'd be okay with me, amen.

25
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:01,599
And we certainly look forward to the imminent,

26
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:03,840
the soon return of the Lord Jesus Christ.

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,980
But each year, somewhere around September, October,

28
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,400
I begin to fervently seek the Lord

29
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,379
with regard to a theme for the next year.

30
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:13,839
And I've done that every year

31
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:15,360
that God's given me the opportunity

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,720
to pastor here at Fellowship Baptist Church.

33
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,220
And I have thanked the Lord for his guidance

34
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,680
and for his direction.

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,519
And I desire that God will provide us

36
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,120
with an annual church theme that will help us

37
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,360
to be encouraged and challenged throughout the entire year.

38
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,959
And very quickly, if you think back,

39
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,139
those some of you have been here

40
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:38,040
since the beginning of me being here.

41
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,500
And in 2012, I got here in August of 2011.

42
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,480
So the first full calendar year was 2012.

43
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,959
And our theme that year was Standing on His Promises.

44
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,319
And I'm so thankful for the promises of God.

45
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,400
And we were reminded each week of various promises

46
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,199
that God has given to us.

47
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,800
And we find that Peter said they're exceeding great

48
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,879
and precious promises.

49
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,279
And we can thank God for the promises

50
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:02,199
that he's given us.

51
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:05,599
In 2013, we turned to the book of Esther

52
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,959
and throughout the year preached from the book of Esther

53
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:11,619
dealing with the theme of for such a time as this.

54
00:02:11,619 --> 00:02:15,080
And God no doubt has put us here for such a time

55
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,520
even as he did Esther.

56
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,759
And what an opportunity that God has given us

57
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:21,759
to serve him even as he did Esther.

58
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,600
In 2014, the book of John, he must increase.

59
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,440
What a great challenging statement

60
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,399
as John the Baptist is standing there in John three

61
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,160
and the discussion that takes place.

62
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,320
And he looks to Jesus and he says of Jesus,

63
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,679
he must increase, but I must decrease.

64
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:39,119
And really it's all about the Lord Jesus Christ.

65
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:41,639
And we studied through the book of John in 2014.

66
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:44,440
In 2015 and 2016, we looked at the book of Acts.

67
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,639
In the first part of the series in 2015,

68
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,600
we dealt with Acts one through 12.

69
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:53,160
And we dealt with the thought of boldness

70
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,039
to speak thy word and oh, how we need that boldness.

71
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,919
God's promised to be with us.

72
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,880
And we find that throughout the scriptures

73
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,759
that the disciples and Paul himself prayed for boldness

74
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:09,339
and how we ought to pray for boldness.

75
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:12,399
The latter part of the book of Acts in 2016,

76
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:14,080
we looked at Acts 13 through 28.

77
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,320
We dealt with the subject of I believe God.

78
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,039
I hope that you still believe God, amen.

79
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,679
God is trustworthy.

80
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:24,080
He's always done what he said he would do.

81
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,360
He's always going to do what he said he will do.

82
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,000
And he is a trustworthy God.

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,279
And Paul stands up at the end of the book of Acts

84
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:36,039
in the 27th chapter and he says, I believe God.

85
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,559
And oh, how we need some of God's people today

86
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:41,520
to have that same level of faith and confidence

87
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,880
in what God has said.

88
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,000
In 2017, increase our faith.

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,199
And we dealt with a number of things

90
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,199
throughout the calendar year that God would use

91
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,080
in our lives to increase our faith.

92
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,360
The Bible says, so then faith cometh by hearing

93
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,440
and hearing by the word of God.

94
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,880
And God will use his word to increase our faith.

95
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,559
And we desire, even as the disciples said,

96
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:02,880
Lord, teach us to pray, but then they said,

97
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,800
Lord, increase our faith.

98
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,240
And oh, that God would help us to believe him

99
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,080
and to trust him.

100
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,339
In 2018, count your blessings.

101
00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:14,199
And in that particular calendar year,

102
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:19,200
we said that we desired to have a number of reasons

103
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,059
every week of the year, a new reason that we can rejoice.

104
00:04:24,059 --> 00:04:25,339
Count your blessings.

105
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:27,519
The songwriter said, name them one by one

106
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,799
and it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.

107
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:32,980
And so often we think about the blessings,

108
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,079
even as we talked about, I mentioned it already

109
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:38,959
this morning, the Lord, he daily loadeth us with benefits

110
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,359
and he's been so good to us.

111
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:42,880
If we're not careful, we can focus on some challenges

112
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,359
and some difficulties and the obstacles.

113
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:47,279
But God says that we're to fix our attention

114
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,760
on the blessings and thank God for what he's done.

115
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,600
In 2019, we turn to the book of Ephesians,

116
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,040
be strong in the Lord and the power of his might.

117
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,880
Listen, we're engaged in spiritual warfare

118
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,320
and we need to understand that the battles

119
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,600
in which we're facing, the battles in which we're engaged in

120
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,559
as Tozer said, the Christian life can best be described

121
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:10,480
not as a playground, but as a battleground.

122
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,239
We are engaged in spiritual warfare

123
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:19,239
and the truth is that we must be strong in the Lord.

124
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:21,559
2020, looking unto Jesus.

125
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:23,959
Oh, 2020 was what a year that was.

126
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:28,959
And God gave me that theme about October 5th or so of 2019.

127
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,480
I had no idea of all that we would deal with in 2020,

128
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,760
but how encouraged I was personally

129
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,640
that as we develop that theme,

130
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,619
that we're to keep our eyes on Jesus.

131
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:42,820
He knows all things, he do with all things well,

132
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,140
and we're to keep our eyes on him.

133
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,019
2021, complete in Christ from the book of Colossians.

134
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:51,540
And I'm thankful that my identity first and foremost

135
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,059
is in Christ and I am complete in him.

136
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:57,500
And what a blessing to know the Lord Jesus Christ

137
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,019
as your personal savior.

138
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:02,420
I hope this morning that as we've gathered together,

139
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,820
that you know the Lord as your personal savior.

140
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,100
Last week, Ryan trusted Christ as his savior

141
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,579
right after the morning service.

142
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:11,179
And what a blessing.

143
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:13,100
He came in here not knowing the Lord,

144
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,779
but left here knowing the Lord

145
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:17,980
and being confident that heaven was his home

146
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,779
and his identity is in Christ.

147
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:23,260
And I'm so thankful to be complete in Christ.

148
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,119
2022, we went to the book of 1 John, walking in the light.

149
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:30,859
Aren't you thankful that we can have fellowship with God?

150
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:32,380
We can have fellowship with God.

151
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,100
And we walk in the light as he is in the light.

152
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,739
And what a blessing to know the Lord

153
00:06:37,739 --> 00:06:39,339
and to walk with him daily,

154
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:44,339
to develop our personal relationship with him

155
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:46,179
and certainly a blessing.

156
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:49,500
Last year or this year, still 2023, great is the Lord.

157
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,779
And throughout the calendar year of 2023,

158
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:55,779
we dealt with examining, discovering, if you will,

159
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:57,059
why God is great.

160
00:06:57,059 --> 00:06:59,820
Why do we say, why does the scripture declare

161
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,779
that God is great?

162
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:02,459
Why would the psalmist stand up and say,

163
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:05,019
great is the Lord and greatly to be praised?

164
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:07,660
Well, God has revealed, he's declared to us in his word,

165
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:11,179
his greatness and we study for a large portion

166
00:07:11,179 --> 00:07:15,540
of this calendar year, reasons that God is great.

167
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,339
And then we said this, as we continue to look at the idea

168
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,739
of discovering his greatness,

169
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:23,140
then we're to declare his greatness

170
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,579
because not everyone knows how great our God is.

171
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,459
A lot of people in our world that have no idea

172
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:30,260
how great our savior is.

173
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,619
And what a blessing that God has given us

174
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,140
the opportunity to know him and then to declare

175
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,899
his greatness and then we finished up the calendar year

176
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:43,339
by dealing with the impact that his greatness will have

177
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,540
in our lives daily.

178
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,619
When I truly understand how great God is,

179
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:53,619
my belief, God is great, will impact my behavior.

180
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:57,179
How I behave reveals what I believe.

181
00:07:57,179 --> 00:07:59,980
The way that we pray is going to be impacted

182
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,500
by how great we believe God is.

183
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,059
And we dealt with a number of things.

184
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:06,940
And so this year in 2024,

185
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,700
as we flip the calendar tomorrow,

186
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,940
as we have our vision Sunday today

187
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,380
and introduce the theme, the idea of continue.

188
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,859
And again, I mentioned 2 Timothy 3, 14,

189
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:18,779
you probably, some of you can read it from where you are.

190
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:21,019
Some of you say it's just blurry to me

191
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:23,540
because of the size of the font there.

192
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,299
But 2 Timothy 3 and verse number 14,

193
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:27,859
Paul gives this charge to Timothy and he says this,

194
00:08:27,859 --> 00:08:31,940
but continue thou in the things which now has learned

195
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,619
and has been assured of,

196
00:08:33,619 --> 00:08:37,260
knowing of whom thou has learned them.

197
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,659
The word continue means to persevere.

198
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:43,059
It means to be steadfast or constant in any course.

199
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:46,419
It carries this idea not to depart.

200
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:49,140
The idea of continue in Acts chapter 14 and verse 22,

201
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,419
you don't need to turn there.

202
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:51,739
But in that portion of scripture,

203
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,820
Paul has the opportunity to follow up

204
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,340
with those that had been saved

205
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,859
during the first missionary journey,

206
00:08:57,859 --> 00:08:59,340
those that were reached with the gospel

207
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,859
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

208
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:03,099
And the Bible tells us in Acts 14 and verse 22

209
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:06,059
that when Paul followed up with those believers,

210
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:08,500
that he gave them this exhortation

211
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,500
that they would continue in the faith.

212
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,580
We find that each letter of this first and second Timothy,

213
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,260
these letters that we'll be studying this year in 2024,

214
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,299
we find that God would use the apostle Paul

215
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,900
to write to Timothy.

216
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,140
And we find that in each of these books,

217
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,020
there's a charge to continue.

218
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,500
We find that there are some that are in the scriptures.

219
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,619
In fact, some that are mentioned by name

220
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:35,219
throughout the scriptures,

221
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:38,140
who unfortunately they failed to continue.

222
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,099
They gave up, they went back and they did not continue.

223
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:44,859
And we find that as believers,

224
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:47,140
we understand this morning that we have an enemy.

225
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,940
I mentioned from a previous year in 2019,

226
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,780
when we spoke about be strong in the Lord,

227
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,219
that we are engaged in spiritual warfare

228
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,299
and spiritual battle.

229
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,099
And we have an enemy.

230
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,059
The ultimate goal of Satan.

231
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:03,099
is to devour you, to devour us.

232
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:05,859
The Bible says that he's walking about seeking

233
00:10:05,859 --> 00:10:09,139
whom he may devour.

234
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:11,179
We understand that's in 1 Peter 5,

235
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:13,099
a book that's written to believers.

236
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:15,439
We understand that his work amongst lost people,

237
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:18,379
those that have not yet trusted Christ as their savior,

238
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:21,759
is to keep them blinded to the truth of the gospel.

239
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,699
The Bible tells us in 2 Corinthians 4,

240
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:25,979
in whom the God of this world

241
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:28,579
hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,

242
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:30,259
lest the light of the glorious gospel

243
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:31,859
should shine in unto them.

244
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:36,019
And we find that Satan is actively working along the way

245
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:39,419
with his ultimate goal of devouring you and devouring me.

246
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:43,699
He seeks to discourage and derail God's people.

247
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:45,219
He seeks to discourage you.

248
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:47,019
He'll use a variety of means.

249
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:49,099
In fact, as you study throughout the scriptures,

250
00:10:49,099 --> 00:10:52,619
as you begin to look at life and even your own experiences,

251
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,019
the means that he uses are varied.

252
00:10:55,019 --> 00:11:00,019
And unfortunately, he's been successful.

253
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:03,059
He's been successful far more often

254
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:06,180
than any of us would really like to acknowledge.

255
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,459
There are people that we can read of in the scriptures

256
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,779
that did not continue.

257
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,500
They gave up, they went back.

258
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,540
There are people that you know, that I know,

259
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,199
that did not continue.

260
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:19,579
They've given up, they've turned back.

261
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,000
And that's unfortunate.

262
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,139
But we understand this morning that we have an enemy.

263
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:26,019
And he uses a variety of means

264
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,739
in order to try to discourage the people of God

265
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:30,500
and to derail the people of God.

266
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,339
But I'm thankful that the Bible tells us

267
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:33,860
that greater is he that is in you

268
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,379
than he that is in the world.

269
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:38,619
I'm thankful this morning that God has given us a Bible

270
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:41,540
and he loves us as his people, as his children.

271
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,979
We spoke last week about the miracle of Christmas

272
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:48,099
and how that because of what he did and how he did it,

273
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:49,540
what has accomplished that we,

274
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,899
if we've trusted Christ as our savior,

275
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:53,860
that we are his sons.

276
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,739
His children.

277
00:11:55,739 --> 00:11:57,500
And he loves us.

278
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,979
And in so loving us, he's given us a Bible

279
00:12:00,979 --> 00:12:03,739
and he's revealed himself to us through his word.

280
00:12:03,739 --> 00:12:07,579
But not only has he revealed himself through his word,

281
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:10,559
we find that he has exposed the enemy.

282
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,559
We are not ignorant of his devices.

283
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,979
We understand the tactics of the enemy,

284
00:12:15,979 --> 00:12:18,259
but we also understand that in the Bible,

285
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:22,619
God has instructed each and every one of us

286
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:25,459
throughout this calendar year 2024,

287
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:27,580
it is my goal with the help of God

288
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,739
and by the grace of God

289
00:12:28,739 --> 00:12:31,000
that we would have the opportunity to study

290
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,940
through 1 Timothy and 2 Timothy.

291
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,459
And as we do, that we would be challenged to continue.

292
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:38,539
To continue.

293
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:39,979
To not turn back.

294
00:12:39,979 --> 00:12:41,300
Not give up.

295
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,919
In the midst of opposition, in the midst of difficulty,

296
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,759
in the midst of all the craziness,

297
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,139
that we would not throw in the towel,

298
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:49,699
that we would not turn back,

299
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:51,539
that we would not slow down,

300
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:54,339
but know we would continue,

301
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:56,139
that we would persevere,

302
00:12:56,139 --> 00:13:01,139
that we would be steadfast or constant in this course,

303
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:03,919
the course of the Christian life.

304
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,679
See, one day, and we believe soon, Jesus is coming back.

305
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:11,979
The reality is that for me as a believer

306
00:13:11,979 --> 00:13:13,539
and for you as a believer this morning,

307
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:16,459
the thought, the truth of his soon return is encouraging.

308
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:17,800
It's exciting.

309
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,380
The reality is that we, as David said,

310
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,059
there's but a step between me and death.

311
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:25,059
Not only do we have the promise of Christ's soon return,

312
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:28,559
but we have the awareness of the brevity of life.

313
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,819
David said there's but a step between me and death,

314
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:33,619
and James says that our life is but a vapor

315
00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:36,539
that appears for a little time and then vanisheth away.

316
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:39,580
And we understand this morning that we have this opportunity

317
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,380
and as long as God would give us life and breath,

318
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,899
then our goal would be that we continue.

319
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,380
That we continue.

320
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,940
Notice as we look in 2 Timothy chapter number three

321
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,739
this morning, if you're taking notes,

322
00:13:51,739 --> 00:13:53,259
a couple of thoughts for you this morning

323
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:57,739
as an introductory message to our theme for 2024,

324
00:13:57,739 --> 00:14:01,080
number one, notice the explanation.

325
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,660
Paul begins in chapter number three in verse number one

326
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,300
and says this, this know also.

327
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,739
I think about those three words and I understand

328
00:14:09,739 --> 00:14:12,779
that as we study the Bible that God wants his people

329
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:15,300
to be informed of some things.

330
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,859
He does not want us to be ignorant.

331
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:18,859
He does not want us to be in the dark.

332
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,380
He wants us to be aware of what's taking place

333
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,940
and we find that God has said through the Apostle Paul

334
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,260
as he's writing to Timothy, this know also.

335
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,059
He wants us to be aware of.

336
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:33,459
He wants us to be assured of.

337
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:36,700
He wants us to have a knowledge of something.

338
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,779
And what is that something?

339
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:42,779
He says that in the last days, perilous times shall come.

340
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:45,779
Brethren, I believe this morning

341
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,899
that we are in the last days.

342
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,700
I believe that we're living really if we'd be honest

343
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,299
and we look at the prophetic calendar of the Lord

344
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:55,660
and we look at the scriptures that are provided to us,

345
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,679
we'd find that I believe that we're living

346
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,540
in the very end of the last days.

347
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,980
And no, I'm not seeking to set a date.

348
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,700
No man knoweth the hour.

349
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,380
I would never seek to do that.

350
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,820
But what I'm saying this morning

351
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,760
is that we're living in the last days.

352
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,600
We're there.

353
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,540
And God says through Paul as he's writing to Timothy

354
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,179
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

355
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:18,980
preserved by God for us this morning

356
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,660
and for believers throughout the history of the church,

357
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,339
he says this know also that in the last days,

358
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:27,019
perilous times shall come.

359
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:29,459
That word, that phrase perilous times,

360
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:32,660
it means harsh, it means fierce, it means dangerous,

361
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,859
it means troublesome.

362
00:15:34,859 --> 00:15:38,859
Have you found this morning that we live in perilous times?

363
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:40,260
Have you found this morning

364
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,299
that we're engaged in spiritual warfare?

365
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:44,440
Have you found this morning that we live in a time,

366
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,119
in a society, in a culture,

367
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:48,919
in which they call evil good and good evil,

368
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:51,639
that we live in a time when they're anti-God,

369
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,799
anti-Christian, anti-Jesus Christ?

370
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,600
That's the time in which we live in.

371
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,079
And Paul says to Timothy, I want you to know this,

372
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,880
I want you to be aware of this.

373
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,339
God wants us to know the times in which we're living.

374
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:11,760
We see this explanation that Paul is providing to Timothy

375
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,160
and for us this morning, we continue to see it.

376
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,919
This morning, we'll just do a quick overview

377
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,480
of these next few verses in a later message

378
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,919
at the end of the year.

379
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:24,600
We'll begin to deal with each of these

380
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,919
particular characteristics, if you will, of the last days,

381
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:30,880
these perilous times that are provided for us.

382
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,399
But this morning, we'll just quickly go through

383
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:38,399
and read what God says with regard to the characteristics

384
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,799
of these last days, these perilous times.

385
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,399
Notice verse number two,

386
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,739
for men shall be lovers of their own selves.

387
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,639
You don't have to look real far to see that happening.

388
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,639
Notice covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,

389
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:03,899
disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy.

390
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,279
I think about that disobedient to parents.

391
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,959
How many times you've been in a public place

392
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,519
and you've seen the behavior of some children,

393
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:13,639
you've thought this thought, man,

394
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:17,000
if that was me when I was a kid, I'd have got a whooping.

395
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,459
You say, well, that's not really appropriate

396
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:19,399
to say that this morning.

397
00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:22,720
Well, you understand, there's a lot of disobedience.

398
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,399
The disobedience is a result

399
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:27,720
of a lack of respect for authority.

400
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,320
We see unthankful.

401
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,200
How many people today, we live in this era,

402
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,679
if you will, of entitled individuals,

403
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,720
and it leads to a lack of thankfulness,

404
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,959
a lack of appreciation.

405
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:41,000
We find that the Bible says unholy.

406
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,079
Notice verse number three, without natural affection,

407
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,600
truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent,

408
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,239
fierce, despisers of those that are good.

409
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:54,799
Verse four, traitors, heady, high-minded,

410
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,660
lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.

411
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,760
Having a form of godliness,

412
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,760
but denying the power thereof from such, turn away.

413
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,200
And we find that in these few verses of Scripture

414
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,000
to begin the third chapter of the book of 2 Timothy,

415
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,679
that Paul is providing this explanation to Timothy

416
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,480
with regard to the days in which he would be living

417
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,799
and the perilous times that should come.

418
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,000
And listen, you understand that Paul is writing

419
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,639
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

420
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,720
and he says this, they shall come.

421
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,239
He didn't say they might come.

422
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:32,119
He said they're going to come,

423
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:35,599
and he said here's how those days are to be characterized.

424
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,719
Here's what you're gonna find happening.

425
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:40,239
You find that in verse number 12, the Bible says this,

426
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:43,320
yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus,

427
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,840
notice what the Bible says, shall suffer persecution.

428
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,320
So we find in verse number one that he says this,

429
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,080
know also then in the last days,

430
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,760
perilous times shall come.

431
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,840
He says in verse number 12 that all those

432
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,239
that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

433
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:03,919
And so we find that as Paul is writing here,

434
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,000
he's wanting Timothy to understand,

435
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
he's wanting him to be aware of what he would face

436
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,039
and what he would deal with,

437
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,279
and that idea of persecution is to be harassed

438
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,719
or to be troubled, it really carries with it

439
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:20,599
the idea of to make one run or flee.

440
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:23,440
Now consider that within the context of our theme

441
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,719
for this year, the way that the enemy will use persecutions

442
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:30,760
in order to cause the people of God to turn back,

443
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,760
to flee, to not continue.

444
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,919
We find that as Paul is writing to his own son of the faith,

445
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,919
Timothy, Paul knows, in fact, in chapter four,

446
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:45,640
he will share the truth that he understands

447
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,719
that the time of his departure's at hand,

448
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,679
he understands that he will soon take

449
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:54,520
and he'll leave this earth, he'll die a physical death,

450
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,640
he understood that he would appear before the Lord

451
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,880
to be absent from the bodies, to be present with the Lord,

452
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,520
but he knew that when he.

453
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:06,360
would die that Timothy would continue to have the responsibility to live for God.

454
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,300
It's almost the idea as we read 1st and 2nd Timothy and we think about the

455
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:15,160
leadership roles and we think about Paul investing in and instructing Timothy, you

456
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,320
think about a relay race in which one runner finishes their leg of the race

457
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,480
and they have that baton in their hand and as they would take that baton and

458
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,000
they would pass it to the next runner, their teammate, who would run the next

459
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,640
leg of their race. And Paul understood that his race, his course, he was near the

460
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,480
end. He would put off his earthly tabernacle, the time of his departure's

461
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,960
at hand, but he wants to give this charge to Timothy, his son in the faith, and he

462
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,920
wants him to understand some things with regard to what he'll deal with. Honestly,

463
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,680
as you look at the explanation that Paul provides Timothy with and you see the

464
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,640
characteristics of these last days that shall come, when you understand the

465
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,600
persecution that will come for those that live godly in Christ Jesus, you

466
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:09,000
could understand why the next word in verse number 14 is continue. Continue. Why?

467
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,360
Because really the idea is, man, I'm gonna give up. I mean, why would I want to deal

468
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,600
with all of that? Why would I want all that hardship and difficulty? And Paul

469
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:27,120
says, listen, be aware, know what you're going to face, but continue. But continue.

470
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,560
We see, number one, the explanation, but now we see, number two, the exhortation.

471
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,320
The exhortation. The idea of an exhortation is an address or

472
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:43,400
communication that's emphatically urging someone to do something. We find that this

473
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:50,520
exhortation is given in verse number 14, and the Bible says, but continue thou in

474
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,200
the faith, in the things which thou hast learned and has been assured of, knowing

475
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,760
of whom thou hast learned them. He said to the believers there in Acts 14, 22,

476
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,960
continue in the faith, and here he says, continue thou in the things which thou

477
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,120
hast learned and has been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them.

478
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:16,480
Begin to think about this particular charge, this exhortation, this communication that

479
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:23,960
Paul is giving to Timothy, emphatically urging him to continue. I understand, Timothy, that

480
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,680
the pressures are going to be great. I understand that the opposition is going to mount. I understand

481
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:35,160
you're going to deal with some really difficult things, but continue. Don't give up. Don't

482
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:44,560
give up. Don't turn back. Continue. Continue. So often, people will ask the question when

483
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:49,800
you deal with times of difficulty and great adversity as we've dealt with in our nation

484
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,280
in recent years, and they begin to consider, what is it that we should do? How is it that

485
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,240
we should respond? What should we do with regard to the current environment and the

486
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:07,040
current circumstances in one word? Continue. Continue. And really, as believers this morning,

487
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,400
we could say, what other option is there? Listen, I don't want to give up. I'm not a

488
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,840
quitter. I don't want to go back. I don't want to give up or go back. No, I want to

489
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,160
continue. Is it going to be easy to continue? No, it's not going to be easy to continue.

490
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:26,320
Are there going to be obstacles to continuing? Sure, there will be obstacles, but our God

491
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:35,080
is with us. And we find that this exhortation is given, the idea of keep on keeping on.

492
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,020
You've heard somebody use that phrase, no doubt. I want you to think about some other

493
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,800
things that Paul says. Turn back to 1 Timothy chapter 4, if you will, and I want you to

494
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:47,480
notice what Paul says here in this portion of Scripture as he's dealing with the idea

495
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:54,400
of what's taking place with regard to the ideas of difficulty and all that he would

496
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,920
deal with. And he says to Timothy in 1 Timothy chapter 4, in verse number 1, notice he says,

497
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,640
now the Spirit speaketh expressly, then in the latter times, notice what he says, some

498
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:12,240
shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils,

499
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,400
speaking lies and hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with a hot iron, forbidding

500
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,160
to marry and commanding to abstain from meats which God hath created to be received with

501
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,600
thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. And so Paul, again, in 1 Timothy

502
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,360
chapter 4, is telling Timothy, listen, here's what's going to happen in the last days and

503
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:41,880
there will be some, notice in verse 1, some shall depart from the faith. Some shall depart.

504
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:47,880
But what's the exhortation to Timothy? Continue. What's the exhortation for us this morning?

505
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,360
I don't want to be part of the some that shall depart. In fact, if you look at the end of

506
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,640
2 Timothy in the 4th chapter, you find that Paul mentions about Demas, hath forsaken me,

507
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:05,120
having loved this present world, in 2 Timothy 4 in verse number 10. And we find that here

508
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:11,680
as we look to the truth of God's Word and we see that God has provided us with an explanation

509
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,200
of what we'll deal with, but the exhortation remains the same. He tells him this in the

510
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,480
beginning of 1 Timothy 4, but then skip down, if you will, to the very last verse of 1 Timothy

511
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,480
chapter 4 in verse number 16. He says this, take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine.

512
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:34,120
Notice what he says, continue in them. Continue in them. For in doing this thou shalt both

513
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:40,920
save thyself and them that hear thee. And so we find that Paul continues to give this

514
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:47,240
exhortation. He's consistent in the message that he delivers to Timothy, both in 1 Timothy

515
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:54,480
and again in 2 Timothy, this message of continue. The pressures are great. The opposition is

516
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,800
great. But continue. Persevere. Continue to march forward, to be steadfast, to be constant.

517
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:06,720
I think about that word steadfast. Look at 1 Corinthians chapter 15. In 1 Corinthians

518
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,480
chapter 15 we see, as we're reminded of the great chapter of 1 Corinthians 15, that we

519
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,040
serve a risen Savior. The chapter that we would go to to speak about the resurrection

520
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:24,000
and to look at all the teaching here in 1 Corinthians 15, that we serve a risen Savior.

521
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,440
And what a great truth to know that He lives and that He lives and He reigns and He rules.

522
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:36,140
And here, at the end of the chapter, Paul is giving this exhortation, this admonition

523
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:41,580
to the church in Corinth and he says in verse 57, but thanks be to God which giveth us the

524
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:48,180
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, notice what he says,

525
00:26:48,180 --> 00:27:00,700
be ye steadfast. To continue is to be steadfast. And so he says, be steadfast, unmovable, always

526
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:05,260
abounding in the work of the Lord. And then notice this great promise, for as much as

527
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:13,460
you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. Our labor is not in vain in the

528
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:18,300
Lord. God has given us promises. There are some that would look at the current environment

529
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:23,780
in which we're living and even looking at the Christendom, if you will, broadly speaking,

530
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:30,660
and looking even closer in if you would narrow down that scope and look at some evangelical

531
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:36,460
churches and even narrowing it down and looking at some Baptist churches and saying, why are

532
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,260
there less people coming in this generation than in the previous generation? Why are we

533
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,940
not seeing as many results and why are we not seeing all these things? Listen, don't

534
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:48,980
be discouraged by those things. Don't give up because of that. No, continue because God

535
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:56,380
said that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. God had said through Paul to the believers

536
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:02,340
in Corinth earlier in this book, some water or some plant, some water, but God gives the

537
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:09,220
increase. And there are times in our lives where we may be on that process of being those

538
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:14,420
that are picking fruit, so to speak, that we're seeing the results of the harvest and

539
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:19,660
we're seeing the fruit of the labor. But there are other times in which we're simply out

540
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:26,020
sowing the seed, sowing the seed. When you're sowing the seed, it takes time for that seed

541
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:32,020
to germinate, to produce. But we can understand that God said that His Word would not return

542
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:36,580
void. God said that His Word is powerful, that His Word is profitable. And we go forth

543
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:42,580
and we sow the Word of God, the seed of God's Word, and we try to be faithful. We seek to

544
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:47,340
please the Lord in what He's called us to do. And we understand that with all the oppositions

545
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:52,660
and all the difficulties and all that's taking place, that the one word for us is continue.

546
00:28:52,660 --> 00:29:01,820
Continue. Continue. Continue what? Continue what? I'm going to give you 12 thoughts this

547
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:08,100
morning. Just two points and then 12 thoughts, amen? I'm going to give you 12 thoughts this

548
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:13,380
morning of in what areas we can continue. But here's my challenge for you. It's not

549
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:18,739
an exhaustive list. There may be some things that you're able to add to this list, maybe

550
00:29:18,739 --> 00:29:22,860
immediately. There's some thoughts that you have and some areas in which you can continue

551
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:30,500
that you should continue, that we should continue. Maybe throughout this year as you are reminded

552
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:36,700
of our theme as we study through these books, 1 and 2 Timothy, as we are meditating on this

553
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:42,660
thought of continue that God would help us add to this list. Of in what areas should

554
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:50,980
we continue? Number one, we better continue praying. Continue praying. Never stop praying.

555
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:58,179
God hears and answers prayer. Prayer is a unique privilege for every child of God. What

556
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:00,500
a great truth.

557
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:05,219
God has given us direct access to the throne of God. He says that we can come boldly unto

558
00:30:05,219 --> 00:30:11,920
the throne of grace. We can go to Him at any moment for any reason. Never stop praying.

559
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:19,639
Continue praying. Why? Because when we pray we get to see what God can do. Now unto Him

560
00:30:19,639 --> 00:30:27,100
that is able to do exceeding, abundantly, above all that we ask or think. And ultimately

561
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:32,340
what's the purpose? That He would receive the glory. That He would receive the honor.

562
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:37,860
That it would be obvious to us and to those around us that God did it, that God worked,

563
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:44,540
that God answered the prayers of His people. God hears prayer and He answers prayer. His

564
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:53,619
answer may not always be immediate. But we must continue to pray. Praying is difficult.

565
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:58,619
Praying is challenging. Praying is battle. There's a great spiritual battle that takes

566
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:04,459
place when you and I enter into our prayer closet. Why? Because the enemy hates prayer.

567
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:10,419
Because the enemy knows that God has chosen to use prayer to move the hand of God, to

568
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:18,940
change the circumstances. We must continue to pray. Number two, we must continue rejoicing.

569
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:25,580
You know how easy it is to complain? You know how easy it is to murmur and to complain

570
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:29,860
about the circumstances and the issues? No, no, no. We must continue rejoicing. You know

571
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:34,940
God is pleased to hear the praise of His people. The Bible says that He inhabits the praise

572
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:40,940
of His people. We find that it is well pleasing in His sight when we lift our voices in praise

573
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:45,180
unto His name. We find that it's lovely, that it's comely, that it's appropriate for God's

574
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:50,379
people to exalt and praise His name. David says, come and let us exalt the name of the

575
00:31:50,379 --> 00:31:55,660
Lord. Let us praise our God. We must continue rejoicing. You say, but pastor, do you see

576
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:01,300
the news? Do you see the things that are happening? Listen, continue rejoicing. Why? Because my

577
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:07,459
God is on the throne. My God rules and my God reigns. And listen, my God is victorious.

578
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:12,300
Your God is victorious. Thanks be to God which giveth us the victory. We too are victorious.

579
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:18,080
We sing the song victory in Jesus. I've read the back of the book, amen? If you read the

580
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,979
scriptures through in a calendar year, I typically read the Bible more than once a year, so it's

581
00:32:21,979 --> 00:32:26,020
been a little while since I read the book of Revelation. I didn't finish it up this

582
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:33,580
morning as maybe some of you did on a calendar reading. Guess what? We win. We win. We're

583
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:41,699
victorious forever. I will be with my God. We have so many reasons to rejoice. Don't

584
00:32:41,699 --> 00:32:48,979
allow the circumstances. Don't allow the perilous times. Don't allow the persecution

585
00:32:48,979 --> 00:32:54,259
to keep you from rejoicing. No, we got to continue rejoicing. Number three, continue

586
00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:58,820
reading your Bible. Continue reading your Bible. You say, well, I read it last year.

587
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:04,179
Read it again. I read it the year before. Read it again. You know what I do? I just

588
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:07,979
said this to Holly last night. In fact, the last several months I've been reading from

589
00:33:07,979 --> 00:33:12,699
a different Bible, still King James Version. I don't have any other version of a Bible,

590
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,860
but from a different Bible because this is my preaching Bible. I've read through this

591
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:20,460
Bible I don't know how many times, and so I started reading probably four or five months

592
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,740
ago from a different Bible. Why? Because it doesn't have all my notes in it. It doesn't

593
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:28,300
have the underlines and things. Now it's starting to get marks in it, but I want to go fresh

594
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:32,460
and I want to look at it. Why? Because I want the Spirit of God to speak to me. The Bible

595
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:37,100
says of itself that his word is quick. That word doesn't mean that it's fast in the sense

596
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:43,979
of somebody winning a race. No, it's alive. God's word is alive. And God will use his

597
00:33:43,979 --> 00:33:49,300
word in your life and in my life on the day in which we need what we need from God and

598
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,820
he'll speak to us. And what a blessing to be able to read and reread and reread. And

599
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:59,460
listen, as many times, I don't know, I've lost count. I wish I would have kept track,

600
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:05,179
but I never did. I don't know how many times I've read through the Bible. But can I tell

601
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:12,220
you? It never gets old. It just doesn't get old because God will teach you something new.

602
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:18,700
God will minister to you in a new way, in a fresh way. There's 1189 chapters in this

603
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:25,299
book. You don't know all of it, neither do I. You know how many times I preach through

604
00:34:25,299 --> 00:34:29,339
a passage of Scripture and then a few weeks later I read through that passage of Scripture

605
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:32,940
in my daily devotions and I say something like this, I wish I would have thought about

606
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:41,019
that when I preached that message. Why? Because it's a living book. We sing the song with

607
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:50,220
the kids, read your Bible, pray every day. And you'll, Lydia, grow, grow, grow. Right?

608
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:57,339
Don't read your Bible, forget to pray. And you'll shrink, shrink, shrink. This is a little

609
00:34:57,339 --> 00:35:02,459
song for the Sunday school kids, but what a great truth. We're going to be students

610
00:35:02,459 --> 00:35:09,220
of the Word of God. Continue reading your Bible. Continue, number four, memorizing Scripture.

611
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:14,899
Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way, by taking heed thereto according to thy

612
00:35:14,899 --> 00:35:21,540
word. Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. Bible memorization

613
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:31,059
is something that has almost, in our churches today, it's almost been reserved for children.

614
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:38,100
We need to be memorizing Scripture. Memorizing Scripture. I've read accounts of people in

615
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:44,739
foreign nations that have had various people groups come in and occupy and try to destroy

616
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:51,380
and one thing that has been consistent, they take a Bible away from people. I wonder the

617
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:57,859
morning, if somebody took your Bible away, how much do you know? How much have you memorized?

618
00:35:57,859 --> 00:36:03,420
How much can we rehearse? I remember when I was in Bible college one night, we had an

619
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:08,179
old-fashioned tent revival meeting and we're in that tent revival and there's all the sound

620
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:12,540
equipment out there so they had some of us college guys sleeping in the tent that night

621
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,540
so that, you know, nothing would happen to the materials and what have you. And we're

622
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,859
supposed to be out there for some security purposes and we're laying there trying to

623
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:24,179
get to sleep and we just began, the group of us that were there, just how many verses

624
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:30,019
can we memorize? How many verses can we quote? We just began quoting verses and each one

625
00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:33,140
of us take a turn and quote a verse, quote a verse, quote a verse, quote a verse, quote

626
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:39,179
a verse, just keep going around. Man, it was encouraging. We need to continue memorizing

627
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:43,980
Scripture. Number five, we need to continue attending church. Listen, there's no place

628
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,220
like church. I'm thankful for church. Understand this morning that church is not the place,

629
00:36:49,299 --> 00:36:54,700
it's not the building, it's the people. Understand this morning that we're the body of Christ.

630
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,420
Understand this morning that the church is not man's idea, the church is God's idea.

631
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:02,579
For Jesus Christ said, I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against

632
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:08,339
it. I'm thankful for a local church. I'm thankful for the opportunity to have, obviously, pastor

633
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:12,140
a local church, but I'm thankful that God gave me the opportunity to get plugged into

634
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:19,339
a local church right after I got saved. The local church means so much to me. The local

635
00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:25,500
church. Continue attending church. Continue, number six, sharing the gospel. Continue sharing

636
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:32,500
the gospel. You say, no one wants to hear. You just keep continuing sharing the gospel.

637
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,140
The Lord told the disciples about going into a city and if they don't receive you just

638
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:41,760
shake the dust off and go on. Continue. He didn't say come up and give up or come back

639
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,799
and give up. No, he said just continue, just go on. And this morning I understand there's

640
00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:49,239
a lot of people that aren't interested in hearing the gospel, but we must understand

641
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:54,399
this morning that we must continue to share the gospel. The gospel is the power of God

642
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:59,540
unto salvation to everyone that believe it, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. Listen,

643
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:05,679
we have, if we stop preaching the gospel we have no reason to really even be here. We've

644
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:10,040
been given, we've been entrusted to share the gospel. We've been given the gospel. We

645
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:19,399
must continue. Number seven, we must continue investing in eternity. Investing in eternity.

646
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:23,040
You say, pastor, the economy. You know how many people I've heard tell me things about

647
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,920
the economy in the last six months? I mean, this is going to happen and that's going to

648
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:34,799
happen and this is going to happen. It makes my mind go crazy. But we're going to invest

649
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:45,679
in eternity. We don't give because the economy's good. We give because it's Biblical. Amen?

650
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:53,400
Amen? We give because it's Biblical. We don't give because we get a tax break. We give because

651
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,880
it's Biblical. You know there's some countries, some nations in which they don't have the

652
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,159
kind of tax system that we have. They don't have the kind of economy that we have. But

653
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:06,599
you know what believers do each and every week? They worship the Lord through giving.

654
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:14,400
Some people they give grains because that's what they have. God's blessed us abundantly.

655
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,119
We must continue to invest in eternity. The greatest investment that we could ever make

656
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,200
is to invest in eternity. The Bible says, as we would look at the book of Philippians

657
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:29,159
in the fourth chapter, that my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory

658
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:34,239
through Christ Jesus. This offering that's mentioned in Philippians chapter 4 was really

659
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:38,280
missions giving as they would give to Paul as he would have the opportunity to go and

660
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,919
share the gospel as a missionary. And we find that there was an investment and Paul says

661
00:39:42,919 --> 00:39:48,479
it's not that I desired a gift but fruit that would abound to your account. Wow! God's economy

662
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:53,880
is different than our economy. And I understand there's a lot of concern amongst a lot of

663
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:59,479
people with regard to what economic crisis we must face or we might face. But the reality

664
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:00,520
is that my God is still...

665
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,460
on the throne, and my God's still good.

666
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:08,620
One day, according to the, during the Tribulation, according to the book of Revelation, at some

667
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:13,860
point a day's wages are going to be necessary to buy a daily portion of food.

668
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,860
We're not there.

669
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,440
Thankfully, I'll never be there, I'm not going to live through the Tribulation.

670
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,940
But the reality this morning is that God's been so good to us.

671
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:28,580
So often we hear of people, and I don't seek to criticize anyone, I believe it's an important

672
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:38,700
aspect to be wise and to be prudent and to do some retirement planning, but not at the

673
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:44,980
expense of investment eternity planning.

674
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:50,540
Retirement is not a guarantee for any one of us.

675
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:54,860
The person that owned that property before they sold it to have two houses built there,

676
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:58,700
her plan was to move there and retire and build a house.

677
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,860
She bought that property in 1978.

678
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,940
You know why she's not building a house?

679
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,220
She never made it to retirement.

680
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,220
It's sad.

681
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,220
That was her plan.

682
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:13,860
There's a lot of people that don't ever make it to retirement, but can I tell you this

683
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,840
morning, we're going to make it to eternity.

684
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,420
We must be investing in eternity.

685
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,580
Number eight, continue obeying the Lord.

686
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,980
Just continue to obey.

687
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,780
Lord, I will obey.

688
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:31,900
Just simple obedience.

689
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:36,100
Simple obedience to what thus saith the Lord.

690
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:43,180
John chapter number two, Mary says to those servants, whatsoever he saith unto you, do

691
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,540
it.

692
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,060
Do it.

693
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,760
Just obey.

694
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,780
Number nine, continue serving the Lord.

695
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,660
Now is not the time to quit serving God.

696
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,500
It's time to continue serving the Lord.

697
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,180
It's time to serve Him more than we have in the past.

698
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,180
Why?

699
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,180
For we see the day approaching.

700
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,180
We know that we're living these last signs.

701
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,420
We know that Jesus is coming.

702
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:10,020
We know that we soon will put off our earthly tabernacle as Peter and Paul speak of, and

703
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:15,820
so we must continue to serve the Lord.

704
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,820
Continue singing.

705
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:17,820
I love to sing.

706
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,820
I don't always sing on tune.

707
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,820
Peter can tell you all about that.

708
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,820
But I love to sing.

709
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,820
I hope God's given you a song.

710
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,820
Just continue to sing.

711
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:35,980
You know, singing is something that's, it's amazing the impact that it can have on your

712
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,980
life.

713
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:41,460
You go through some difficulties, you go through some trials, you have some of these perilous

714
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,460
times.

715
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,140
Just begin to sing.

716
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,500
Sing songs that are biblical songs.

717
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,380
Sing songs that exalt the Lord.

718
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:53,980
Sing songs that help you to understand how great God is.

719
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:58,740
All of a sudden as you begin to sing those wonderful songs, those songs of Zion, if you

720
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:02,940
will, those hymns of the faith, how it will help you spiritually.

721
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,780
By the way, the Bible would tell us in the book of Ephesians in the fifth chapter about

722
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:12,500
being filled with the Spirit of God, and as we're filled with the Spirit of God, the evidence

723
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,980
of being filled with the Spirit of God is that we're speaking to ourselves in psalms

724
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:23,580
and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.

725
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:26,980
That's an evidence of being filled with the Spirit of God.

726
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,260
Continue singing.

727
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,260
I love the old hymns.

728
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,860
We sang those songs this morning.

729
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,980
Man, I was encouraged.

730
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,500
I sing the mighty power of God.

731
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,500
Wow.

732
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:45,660
My Savior's love, oh, how marvelous, oh, how wonderful.

733
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:49,540
Man, it just does something for you.

734
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,540
Continue singing.

735
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,540
Number 11, continue loving people.

736
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,620
Continue to love people.

737
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,540
You say, but they don't love me.

738
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,540
They're not lovable.

739
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,060
Continue to love people.

740
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,860
We're filled with the Spirit of God.

741
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:08,940
He allows us to spread abroad the love of God.

742
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,900
Continue to love people.

743
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:15,420
I've said this before, I believe that it's biblical when you look at the book of 1 Thessalonians

744
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:21,140
in particular, a number of other areas you could look to.

745
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:24,780
We find in the book of 1 Thessalonians specifically that as Paul ministered to the believers in

746
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:30,660
Thessalonica, that those believers, they knew that he loved them, and then he was able to

747
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,660
minister to them.

748
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:36,500
He was able to teach them and even correct them and help them.

749
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,900
I've said this, you've heard it in various contexts, no doubt, people don't care how

750
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,500
much you know until they know how much you care.

751
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,500
Love people.

752
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,500
Love people.

753
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,500
Love them to Jesus.

754
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:51,420
You know, I'm thankful that Jesus loved them unto the end.

755
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,780
His love is a perfect love.

756
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:57,340
John 13 verse 1 speaks about, He loved them unto the end.

757
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,220
This is a perfect love.

758
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:07,340
But as His children, not only would they love one another, but we're to love our enemies.

759
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,940
Love our enemies.

760
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,540
Number 12, continue trusting the Lord.

761
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:17,100
Look at a variety of things that are taking place, say, well, I can't see, I don't know

762
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,420
what's going on, just continue to trust the Lord.

763
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,980
He's trustworthy.

764
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,460
Great is thy faithfulness.

765
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,860
We sing the song and how encouraging that song is, but I want you to understand that

766
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:33,060
He's never failed you and He never will.

767
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,060
Continue to trust the Lord.

768
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:37,660
Again, that list is not exhaustive.

769
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:41,420
Things that you could immediately, no doubt, add to the list.

770
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:45,740
Things that the Lord will help you in the days and weeks and months ahead to add to

771
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:46,740
that list.

772
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,740
Where is it?

773
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,500
How is it that I need to continue?

774
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:58,220
Listen, there's a great danger in giving up, going back, throwing in the towel.

775
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:05,780
The midst of all of the circumstances in which we face, the difficulties, the perilous times,

776
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:16,620
the persecutions, the single word that Paul would exhort Timothy with, continue, continue.

777
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,420
I'm so thankful that God's given us the truth.

778
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,260
I'm thankful to have a Bible.

779
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:25,180
I'm thankful to know the Lord, and this morning, I want to encourage you, and throughout this

780
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:32,060
next calendar year, 2024, I want to be encouraged every single week to continue.

781
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:36,780
As we look at 1 and 2 Timothy, and we go verse by verse through these wonderful books, how

782
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:44,980
we'll see Paul using his own life as an example of one that continued in the midst of great

783
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:47,220
opposition.

784
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:51,660
He left an example, and then he says to Timothy, continue.

785
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:56,260
For each of us this morning, we've been admonished to continue.

786
00:46:56,260 --> 00:47:00,500
The exhortation is plain, it's clear, continue.

787
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,980
This morning, I hope that you have a level of excitement as we look at this new calendar

788
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:11,580
year, 2024, to study these books afresh, to be challenged, to be encouraged, to be helped

789
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,060
in our walk with God.

790
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,060
Know that you have an enemy.

791
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:17,020
Oh, he's going to try to discourage you and derail you.

792
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:20,020
In fact, he may try even this afternoon.

793
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:21,940
It's just the way he works.

794
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,820
Have you found it to be so?

795
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:29,180
Just keep your eyes on Jesus, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith,

796
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:33,060
and by God's grace and with God's help, we will continue.

797
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,060
We will persevere.

798
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,860
We will be steadfast in the work that God has called us to do.

799
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,900
We will not depart.

800
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,380
We will, there's no turning back, no turning back, no giving up.

801
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,380
We continue.

802
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:46,500
Father, we love you.

803
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,660
We thank you for loving us.

804
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:52,220
We thank you for the privilege, the opportunity that you've given us to gather together this

805
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:53,220
morning.

806
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:57,320
God, we thank you for the many blessings in which you've bestowed upon us.

807
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:02,100
We thank you for your Word, and Lord, we thank you for this text of Scripture, these two

808
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:07,420
books that we'll have the opportunity and privilege to study through here in 2024.

809
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:15,980
And God, I pray that you would help us to be aware, have the knowledge.

810
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:21,180
As Paul explained to Timothy the things that he would face, the things that shall come,

811
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:24,740
Lord, that we'd have that understanding.

812
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:30,900
And Lord, I pray that you'd help us to receive and respond to the exhortation to continue.

813
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:37,179
Lord, I pray that not one amongst us would turn back or give up.

814
00:48:37,179 --> 00:48:43,540
Help us to, by your grace and with your help, help us to continue.

815
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:48,739
God, I pray that if there's one here this morning, one that's tuned in via live stream

816
00:48:48,739 --> 00:48:53,380
this morning that's not sure of heaven, they've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their

817
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,380
personal Savior.

818
00:48:54,380 --> 00:49:00,700
In fact, they came here this morning, and the truth be told, they do not know for sure

819
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,780
if they were to die that they'd go to heaven.

820
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:08,580
God, I pray that the Holy Spirit of God would work in their hearts and lives, help them

821
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:13,300
to understand the truth of your Word, the power of the gospel.

822
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:22,380
I pray they'd understand that they're sinners and the consequence for sin, and understand

823
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,020
that you loved them and you died for them.

824
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:26,700
You rose conquering sin, death, and the grave.

825
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,340
You offer to them a gift.

826
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,179
The gift is eternal life.

827
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:35,020
And God, I pray that today they would not leave this place without knowing for sure

828
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:39,340
that heaven is their home, that they would receive the gift of God, which is eternal

829
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,340
life.

830
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:45,300
I pray for every child of God, Lord, I pray that you'd help us.

831
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:50,220
No doubt, we've experienced the attack of the enemy.

832
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,600
His methods are varied.

833
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:58,420
Maybe we're in the midst of a serious spiritual battle even at the moment.

834
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,540
Maybe the thoughts have crossed our minds.

835
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:12,140
of giving up or turning back. Maybe, Lord, we have contemplated that idea. I pray that

836
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:18,100
you'd help us this morning to be encouraged. Help us, Lord, to be determined that by your

837
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:23,180
grace and with your help that we will continue. We'll continue to serve you and to live for

838
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:28,340
you. God, I pray that you'd move and work in the midst of this invitation as only you

839
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:33,540
can. I pray that decisions would be made that would please thee. Well, thank you for the

840
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:37,180
work that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads

841
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:41,300
are bowed, eyes are closed. At the end of our services, we have a moment of invitation

842
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,380
where we give an opportunity for folks to respond.
