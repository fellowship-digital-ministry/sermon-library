00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.859
This morning, the book of 2 Timothy,

00:00:02.859 --> 00:00:05.199
the book of 2 Timothy, it'll be a theme verse

00:00:05.199 --> 00:00:07.800
or a theme really message this morning,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.640
kind of overviewing the entire thought for the new year.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.319
And I'm thankful for the opportunity

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:17.920
to be looking forward to what God has in store for us.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.280
In many ways, I believe that you would probably

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.440
echo the statement, it's hard to believe

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.979
that today is the last day of 2023.

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:30.459
And for many of us, as we flip the calendar tomorrow, 2024,

00:00:30.459 --> 00:00:32.419
we think about just our lives

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.419
and we think about all that has happened

00:00:34.419 --> 00:00:36.299
and see where we are.

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:39.159
And we certainly rejoice in the goodness of God,

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:41.740
the opportunity and privilege that he has given us

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.459
to serve him yet for another day.

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:46.939
And we look forward to what God will do.

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:49.860
Of course, we expect that God will continue

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.700
to do great things.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.500
We look forward to a soon return,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.340
and it could be that we never even flip

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.560
the calendar to tomorrow.

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:57.560
It could be that the Lord returns still today

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.439
and that'd be okay with me, amen.

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:01.599
And we certainly look forward to the imminent,

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:03.840
the soon return of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.980
But each year, somewhere around September, October,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.400
I begin to fervently seek the Lord

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.379
with regard to a theme for the next year.

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:13.839
And I've done that every year

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:15.360
that God's given me the opportunity

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.720
to pastor here at Fellowship Baptist Church.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.220
And I have thanked the Lord for his guidance

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.680
and for his direction.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.519
And I desire that God will provide us

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:28.120
with an annual church theme that will help us

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.360
to be encouraged and challenged throughout the entire year.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.959
And very quickly, if you think back,

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:36.139
those some of you have been here

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:38.040
since the beginning of me being here.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.500
And in 2012, I got here in August of 2011.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.480
So the first full calendar year was 2012.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.959
And our theme that year was Standing on His Promises.

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:49.319
And I'm so thankful for the promises of God.

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.400
And we were reminded each week of various promises

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.199
that God has given to us.

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:56.800
And we find that Peter said they're exceeding great

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.879
and precious promises.

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:01.279
And we can thank God for the promises

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:02.199
that he's given us.

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:05.599
In 2013, we turned to the book of Esther

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:07.959
and throughout the year preached from the book of Esther

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.619
dealing with the theme of for such a time as this.

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:15.080
And God no doubt has put us here for such a time

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.520
even as he did Esther.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.759
And what an opportunity that God has given us

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:21.759
to serve him even as he did Esther.

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:24.600
In 2014, the book of John, he must increase.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.440
What a great challenging statement

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.399
as John the Baptist is standing there in John three

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:31.160
and the discussion that takes place.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.320
And he looks to Jesus and he says of Jesus,

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.679
he must increase, but I must decrease.

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.119
And really it's all about the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:41.639
And we studied through the book of John in 2014.

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.440
In 2015 and 2016, we looked at the book of Acts.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.639
In the first part of the series in 2015,

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.600
we dealt with Acts one through 12.

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:53.160
And we dealt with the thought of boldness

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.039
to speak thy word and oh, how we need that boldness.

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:59.919
God's promised to be with us.

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.880
And we find that throughout the scriptures

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.759
that the disciples and Paul himself prayed for boldness

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:09.339
and how we ought to pray for boldness.

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:12.399
The latter part of the book of Acts in 2016,

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:14.080
we looked at Acts 13 through 28.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.320
We dealt with the subject of I believe God.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.039
I hope that you still believe God, amen.

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:21.679
God is trustworthy.

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:24.080
He's always done what he said he would do.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.360
He's always going to do what he said he will do.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.000
And he is a trustworthy God.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.279
And Paul stands up at the end of the book of Acts

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:36.039
in the 27th chapter and he says, I believe God.

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:38.559
And oh, how we need some of God's people today

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:41.520
to have that same level of faith and confidence

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.880
in what God has said.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.000
In 2017, increase our faith.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.199
And we dealt with a number of things

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:48.199
throughout the calendar year that God would use

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.080
in our lives to increase our faith.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.360
The Bible says, so then faith cometh by hearing

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.440
and hearing by the word of God.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.880
And God will use his word to increase our faith.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.559
And we desire, even as the disciples said,

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:02.880
Lord, teach us to pray, but then they said,

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.800
Lord, increase our faith.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.240
And oh, that God would help us to believe him

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.080
and to trust him.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.339
In 2018, count your blessings.

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:14.199
And in that particular calendar year,

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:19.200
we said that we desired to have a number of reasons

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.059
every week of the year, a new reason that we can rejoice.

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:25.339
Count your blessings.

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:27.519
The songwriter said, name them one by one

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:30.799
and it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.

00:04:30.799 --> 00:04:32.980
And so often we think about the blessings,

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.079
even as we talked about, I mentioned it already

00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:38.959
this morning, the Lord, he daily loadeth us with benefits

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:40.359
and he's been so good to us.

00:04:40.359 --> 00:04:42.880
If we're not careful, we can focus on some challenges

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.359
and some difficulties and the obstacles.

00:04:45.359 --> 00:04:47.279
But God says that we're to fix our attention

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:49.760
on the blessings and thank God for what he's done.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.600
In 2019, we turn to the book of Ephesians,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.040
be strong in the Lord and the power of his might.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.880
Listen, we're engaged in spiritual warfare

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.320
and we need to understand that the battles

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.600
in which we're facing, the battles in which we're engaged in

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.559
as Tozer said, the Christian life can best be described

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:10.480
not as a playground, but as a battleground.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.239
We are engaged in spiritual warfare

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:19.239
and the truth is that we must be strong in the Lord.

00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:21.559
2020, looking unto Jesus.

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:23.959
Oh, 2020 was what a year that was.

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:28.959
And God gave me that theme about October 5th or so of 2019.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.480
I had no idea of all that we would deal with in 2020,

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.760
but how encouraged I was personally

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.640
that as we develop that theme,

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.619
that we're to keep our eyes on Jesus.

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:42.820
He knows all things, he do with all things well,

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.140
and we're to keep our eyes on him.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.019
2021, complete in Christ from the book of Colossians.

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:51.540
And I'm thankful that my identity first and foremost

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.059
is in Christ and I am complete in him.

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:57.500
And what a blessing to know the Lord Jesus Christ

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.019
as your personal savior.

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:02.420
I hope this morning that as we've gathered together,

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.820
that you know the Lord as your personal savior.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.100
Last week, Ryan trusted Christ as his savior

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.579
right after the morning service.

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:11.179
And what a blessing.

00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:13.100
He came in here not knowing the Lord,

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.779
but left here knowing the Lord

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:17.980
and being confident that heaven was his home

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.779
and his identity is in Christ.

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:23.260
And I'm so thankful to be complete in Christ.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:28.119
2022, we went to the book of 1 John, walking in the light.

00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:30.859
Aren't you thankful that we can have fellowship with God?

00:06:30.859 --> 00:06:32.380
We can have fellowship with God.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.100
And we walk in the light as he is in the light.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.739
And what a blessing to know the Lord

00:06:37.739 --> 00:06:39.339
and to walk with him daily,

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:44.339
to develop our personal relationship with him

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:46.179
and certainly a blessing.

00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:49.500
Last year or this year, still 2023, great is the Lord.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.779
And throughout the calendar year of 2023,

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:55.779
we dealt with examining, discovering, if you will,

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:57.059
why God is great.

00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:59.820
Why do we say, why does the scripture declare

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.779
that God is great?

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:02.459
Why would the psalmist stand up and say,

00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:05.019
great is the Lord and greatly to be praised?

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:07.660
Well, God has revealed, he's declared to us in his word,

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:11.179
his greatness and we study for a large portion

00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:15.540
of this calendar year, reasons that God is great.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.339
And then we said this, as we continue to look at the idea

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:20.739
of discovering his greatness,

00:07:20.739 --> 00:07:23.140
then we're to declare his greatness

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.579
because not everyone knows how great our God is.

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:28.459
A lot of people in our world that have no idea

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:30.260
how great our savior is.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.619
And what a blessing that God has given us

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:36.140
the opportunity to know him and then to declare

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.899
his greatness and then we finished up the calendar year

00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:43.339
by dealing with the impact that his greatness will have

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:45.540
in our lives daily.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.619
When I truly understand how great God is,

00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:53.619
my belief, God is great, will impact my behavior.

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:57.179
How I behave reveals what I believe.

00:07:57.179 --> 00:07:59.980
The way that we pray is going to be impacted

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.500
by how great we believe God is.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.059
And we dealt with a number of things.

00:08:04.059 --> 00:08:06.940
And so this year in 2024,

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.700
as we flip the calendar tomorrow,

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.940
as we have our vision Sunday today

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.380
and introduce the theme, the idea of continue.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.859
And again, I mentioned 2 Timothy 3, 14,

00:08:16.859 --> 00:08:18.779
you probably, some of you can read it from where you are.

00:08:18.779 --> 00:08:21.019
Some of you say it's just blurry to me

00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:23.540
because of the size of the font there.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.299
But 2 Timothy 3 and verse number 14,

00:08:25.299 --> 00:08:27.859
Paul gives this charge to Timothy and he says this,

00:08:27.859 --> 00:08:31.940
but continue thou in the things which now has learned

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.619
and has been assured of,

00:08:33.619 --> 00:08:37.260
knowing of whom thou has learned them.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.659
The word continue means to persevere.

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:43.059
It means to be steadfast or constant in any course.

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:46.419
It carries this idea not to depart.

00:08:46.419 --> 00:08:49.140
The idea of continue in Acts chapter 14 and verse 22,

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.419
you don't need to turn there.

00:08:50.419 --> 00:08:51.739
But in that portion of scripture,

00:08:51.739 --> 00:08:54.820
Paul has the opportunity to follow up

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.340
with those that had been saved

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.859
during the first missionary journey,

00:08:57.859 --> 00:08:59.340
those that were reached with the gospel

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.859
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:09:00.859 --> 00:09:03.099
And the Bible tells us in Acts 14 and verse 22

00:09:03.099 --> 00:09:06.059
that when Paul followed up with those believers,

00:09:06.059 --> 00:09:08.500
that he gave them this exhortation

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.500
that they would continue in the faith.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.580
We find that each letter of this first and second Timothy,

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.260
these letters that we'll be studying this year in 2024,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.299
we find that God would use the apostle Paul

00:09:21.299 --> 00:09:22.900
to write to Timothy.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.140
And we find that in each of these books,

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.020
there's a charge to continue.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.500
We find that there are some that are in the scriptures.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.619
In fact, some that are mentioned by name

00:09:33.619 --> 00:09:35.219
throughout the scriptures,

00:09:35.219 --> 00:09:38.140
who unfortunately they failed to continue.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.099
They gave up, they went back and they did not continue.

00:09:42.099 --> 00:09:44.859
And we find that as believers,

00:09:44.859 --> 00:09:47.140
we understand this morning that we have an enemy.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.940
I mentioned from a previous year in 2019,

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.780
when we spoke about be strong in the Lord,

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.219
that we are engaged in spiritual warfare

00:09:55.219 --> 00:09:56.299
and spiritual battle.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.099
And we have an enemy.

00:09:58.099 --> 00:10:00.059
The ultimate goal of Satan.

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:03.099
is to devour you, to devour us.

00:10:03.099 --> 00:10:05.859
The Bible says that he's walking about seeking

00:10:05.859 --> 00:10:09.139
whom he may devour.

00:10:09.139 --> 00:10:11.179
We understand that's in 1 Peter 5,

00:10:11.179 --> 00:10:13.099
a book that's written to believers.

00:10:13.099 --> 00:10:15.439
We understand that his work amongst lost people,

00:10:15.439 --> 00:10:18.379
those that have not yet trusted Christ as their savior,

00:10:18.379 --> 00:10:21.759
is to keep them blinded to the truth of the gospel.

00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:24.699
The Bible tells us in 2 Corinthians 4,

00:10:24.699 --> 00:10:25.979
in whom the God of this world

00:10:25.979 --> 00:10:28.579
hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,

00:10:28.579 --> 00:10:30.259
lest the light of the glorious gospel

00:10:30.259 --> 00:10:31.859
should shine in unto them.

00:10:31.859 --> 00:10:36.019
And we find that Satan is actively working along the way

00:10:36.019 --> 00:10:39.419
with his ultimate goal of devouring you and devouring me.

00:10:39.419 --> 00:10:43.699
He seeks to discourage and derail God's people.

00:10:43.699 --> 00:10:45.219
He seeks to discourage you.

00:10:45.219 --> 00:10:47.019
He'll use a variety of means.

00:10:47.019 --> 00:10:49.099
In fact, as you study throughout the scriptures,

00:10:49.099 --> 00:10:52.619
as you begin to look at life and even your own experiences,

00:10:52.619 --> 00:10:55.019
the means that he uses are varied.

00:10:55.019 --> 00:11:00.019
And unfortunately, he's been successful.

00:11:01.219 --> 00:11:03.059
He's been successful far more often

00:11:03.059 --> 00:11:06.180
than any of us would really like to acknowledge.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.459
There are people that we can read of in the scriptures

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:09.779
that did not continue.

00:11:09.779 --> 00:11:11.500
They gave up, they went back.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.540
There are people that you know, that I know,

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.199
that did not continue.

00:11:17.199 --> 00:11:19.579
They've given up, they've turned back.

00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:21.000
And that's unfortunate.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.139
But we understand this morning that we have an enemy.

00:11:24.139 --> 00:11:26.019
And he uses a variety of means

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:28.739
in order to try to discourage the people of God

00:11:28.739 --> 00:11:30.500
and to derail the people of God.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.339
But I'm thankful that the Bible tells us

00:11:32.339 --> 00:11:33.860
that greater is he that is in you

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.379
than he that is in the world.

00:11:35.379 --> 00:11:38.619
I'm thankful this morning that God has given us a Bible

00:11:38.619 --> 00:11:41.540
and he loves us as his people, as his children.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.979
We spoke last week about the miracle of Christmas

00:11:43.979 --> 00:11:48.099
and how that because of what he did and how he did it,

00:11:48.099 --> 00:11:49.540
what has accomplished that we,

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.899
if we've trusted Christ as our savior,

00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:53.860
that we are his sons.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.739
His children.

00:11:55.739 --> 00:11:57.500
And he loves us.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.979
And in so loving us, he's given us a Bible

00:12:00.979 --> 00:12:03.739
and he's revealed himself to us through his word.

00:12:03.739 --> 00:12:07.579
But not only has he revealed himself through his word,

00:12:07.579 --> 00:12:10.559
we find that he has exposed the enemy.

00:12:10.559 --> 00:12:12.559
We are not ignorant of his devices.

00:12:12.559 --> 00:12:15.979
We understand the tactics of the enemy,

00:12:15.979 --> 00:12:18.259
but we also understand that in the Bible,

00:12:18.259 --> 00:12:22.619
God has instructed each and every one of us

00:12:22.619 --> 00:12:25.459
throughout this calendar year 2024,

00:12:25.459 --> 00:12:27.580
it is my goal with the help of God

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.739
and by the grace of God

00:12:28.739 --> 00:12:31.000
that we would have the opportunity to study

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.940
through 1 Timothy and 2 Timothy.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:37.459
And as we do, that we would be challenged to continue.

00:12:37.459 --> 00:12:38.539
To continue.

00:12:38.539 --> 00:12:39.979
To not turn back.

00:12:39.979 --> 00:12:41.300
Not give up.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.919
In the midst of opposition, in the midst of difficulty,

00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:45.759
in the midst of all the craziness,

00:12:45.759 --> 00:12:48.139
that we would not throw in the towel,

00:12:48.139 --> 00:12:49.699
that we would not turn back,

00:12:49.699 --> 00:12:51.539
that we would not slow down,

00:12:51.539 --> 00:12:54.339
but know we would continue,

00:12:54.339 --> 00:12:56.139
that we would persevere,

00:12:56.139 --> 00:13:01.139
that we would be steadfast or constant in this course,

00:13:01.419 --> 00:13:03.919
the course of the Christian life.

00:13:03.919 --> 00:13:08.679
See, one day, and we believe soon, Jesus is coming back.

00:13:08.679 --> 00:13:11.979
The reality is that for me as a believer

00:13:11.979 --> 00:13:13.539
and for you as a believer this morning,

00:13:13.539 --> 00:13:16.459
the thought, the truth of his soon return is encouraging.

00:13:16.459 --> 00:13:17.800
It's exciting.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.380
The reality is that we, as David said,

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.059
there's but a step between me and death.

00:13:22.059 --> 00:13:25.059
Not only do we have the promise of Christ's soon return,

00:13:25.059 --> 00:13:28.559
but we have the awareness of the brevity of life.

00:13:28.559 --> 00:13:30.819
David said there's but a step between me and death,

00:13:30.819 --> 00:13:33.619
and James says that our life is but a vapor

00:13:33.619 --> 00:13:36.539
that appears for a little time and then vanisheth away.

00:13:36.539 --> 00:13:39.580
And we understand this morning that we have this opportunity

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.380
and as long as God would give us life and breath,

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.899
then our goal would be that we continue.

00:13:45.899 --> 00:13:47.380
That we continue.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.940
Notice as we look in 2 Timothy chapter number three

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.739
this morning, if you're taking notes,

00:13:51.739 --> 00:13:53.259
a couple of thoughts for you this morning

00:13:53.259 --> 00:13:57.739
as an introductory message to our theme for 2024,

00:13:57.739 --> 00:14:01.080
number one, notice the explanation.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.660
Paul begins in chapter number three in verse number one

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.300
and says this, this know also.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.739
I think about those three words and I understand

00:14:09.739 --> 00:14:12.779
that as we study the Bible that God wants his people

00:14:12.779 --> 00:14:15.300
to be informed of some things.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.859
He does not want us to be ignorant.

00:14:16.859 --> 00:14:18.859
He does not want us to be in the dark.

00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:21.380
He wants us to be aware of what's taking place

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.940
and we find that God has said through the Apostle Paul

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:29.260
as he's writing to Timothy, this know also.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.059
He wants us to be aware of.

00:14:32.059 --> 00:14:33.459
He wants us to be assured of.

00:14:33.459 --> 00:14:36.700
He wants us to have a knowledge of something.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.779
And what is that something?

00:14:37.779 --> 00:14:42.779
He says that in the last days, perilous times shall come.

00:14:44.299 --> 00:14:45.779
Brethren, I believe this morning

00:14:45.779 --> 00:14:47.899
that we are in the last days.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.700
I believe that we're living really if we'd be honest

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.299
and we look at the prophetic calendar of the Lord

00:14:53.299 --> 00:14:55.660
and we look at the scriptures that are provided to us,

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.679
we'd find that I believe that we're living

00:14:57.679 --> 00:15:00.540
in the very end of the last days.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.980
And no, I'm not seeking to set a date.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.700
No man knoweth the hour.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.380
I would never seek to do that.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.820
But what I'm saying this morning

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.760
is that we're living in the last days.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.600
We're there.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.540
And God says through Paul as he's writing to Timothy

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.179
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:15:16.179 --> 00:15:18.980
preserved by God for us this morning

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.660
and for believers throughout the history of the church,

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.339
he says this know also that in the last days,

00:15:24.339 --> 00:15:27.019
perilous times shall come.

00:15:27.019 --> 00:15:29.459
That word, that phrase perilous times,

00:15:29.459 --> 00:15:32.660
it means harsh, it means fierce, it means dangerous,

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.859
it means troublesome.

00:15:34.859 --> 00:15:38.859
Have you found this morning that we live in perilous times?

00:15:38.859 --> 00:15:40.260
Have you found this morning

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.299
that we're engaged in spiritual warfare?

00:15:42.299 --> 00:15:44.440
Have you found this morning that we live in a time,

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.119
in a society, in a culture,

00:15:46.119 --> 00:15:48.919
in which they call evil good and good evil,

00:15:48.919 --> 00:15:51.639
that we live in a time when they're anti-God,

00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:55.799
anti-Christian, anti-Jesus Christ?

00:15:55.799 --> 00:15:57.600
That's the time in which we live in.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.079
And Paul says to Timothy, I want you to know this,

00:16:01.079 --> 00:16:02.880
I want you to be aware of this.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.339
God wants us to know the times in which we're living.

00:16:07.339 --> 00:16:11.760
We see this explanation that Paul is providing to Timothy

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.160
and for us this morning, we continue to see it.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.919
This morning, we'll just do a quick overview

00:16:17.919 --> 00:16:20.480
of these next few verses in a later message

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.919
at the end of the year.

00:16:21.919 --> 00:16:24.600
We'll begin to deal with each of these

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.919
particular characteristics, if you will, of the last days,

00:16:27.919 --> 00:16:30.880
these perilous times that are provided for us.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.399
But this morning, we'll just quickly go through

00:16:33.399 --> 00:16:38.399
and read what God says with regard to the characteristics

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.799
of these last days, these perilous times.

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:42.399
Notice verse number two,

00:16:42.399 --> 00:16:46.739
for men shall be lovers of their own selves.

00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:50.639
You don't have to look real far to see that happening.

00:16:50.639 --> 00:16:55.639
Notice covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,

00:16:58.899 --> 00:17:03.899
disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy.

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:08.279
I think about that disobedient to parents.

00:17:08.279 --> 00:17:09.959
How many times you've been in a public place

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:12.519
and you've seen the behavior of some children,

00:17:12.519 --> 00:17:13.639
you've thought this thought, man,

00:17:13.639 --> 00:17:17.000
if that was me when I was a kid, I'd have got a whooping.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.459
You say, well, that's not really appropriate

00:17:18.459 --> 00:17:19.399
to say that this morning.

00:17:19.399 --> 00:17:22.720
Well, you understand, there's a lot of disobedience.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.399
The disobedience is a result

00:17:24.399 --> 00:17:27.720
of a lack of respect for authority.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.320
We see unthankful.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.200
How many people today, we live in this era,

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.679
if you will, of entitled individuals,

00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:37.720
and it leads to a lack of thankfulness,

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.959
a lack of appreciation.

00:17:38.959 --> 00:17:41.000
We find that the Bible says unholy.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.079
Notice verse number three, without natural affection,

00:17:44.079 --> 00:17:47.600
truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent,

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.239
fierce, despisers of those that are good.

00:17:51.239 --> 00:17:54.799
Verse four, traitors, heady, high-minded,

00:17:54.799 --> 00:17:58.660
lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.760
Having a form of godliness,

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:05.760
but denying the power thereof from such, turn away.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.200
And we find that in these few verses of Scripture

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.000
to begin the third chapter of the book of 2 Timothy,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.679
that Paul is providing this explanation to Timothy

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:18.480
with regard to the days in which he would be living

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.799
and the perilous times that should come.

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:23.000
And listen, you understand that Paul is writing

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.639
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:18:26.639 --> 00:18:28.720
and he says this, they shall come.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.239
He didn't say they might come.

00:18:30.239 --> 00:18:32.119
He said they're going to come,

00:18:32.119 --> 00:18:35.599
and he said here's how those days are to be characterized.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.719
Here's what you're gonna find happening.

00:18:37.719 --> 00:18:40.239
You find that in verse number 12, the Bible says this,

00:18:40.239 --> 00:18:43.320
yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus,

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.840
notice what the Bible says, shall suffer persecution.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.320
So we find in verse number one that he says this,

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.080
know also then in the last days,

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.760
perilous times shall come.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.840
He says in verse number 12 that all those

00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:01.239
that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

00:19:01.239 --> 00:19:03.919
And so we find that as Paul is writing here,

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.000
he's wanting Timothy to understand,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
he's wanting him to be aware of what he would face

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.039
and what he would deal with,

00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:14.279
and that idea of persecution is to be harassed

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:16.719
or to be troubled, it really carries with it

00:19:16.719 --> 00:19:20.599
the idea of to make one run or flee.

00:19:20.599 --> 00:19:23.440
Now consider that within the context of our theme

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.719
for this year, the way that the enemy will use persecutions

00:19:27.719 --> 00:19:30.760
in order to cause the people of God to turn back,

00:19:30.799 --> 00:19:33.760
to flee, to not continue.

00:19:34.919 --> 00:19:39.919
We find that as Paul is writing to his own son of the faith,

00:19:39.919 --> 00:19:42.919
Timothy, Paul knows, in fact, in chapter four,

00:19:42.919 --> 00:19:45.640
he will share the truth that he understands

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.719
that the time of his departure's at hand,

00:19:47.719 --> 00:19:50.679
he understands that he will soon take

00:19:50.679 --> 00:19:54.520
and he'll leave this earth, he'll die a physical death,

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.640
he understood that he would appear before the Lord

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.880
to be absent from the bodies, to be present with the Lord,

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.520
but he knew that when he.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:06.360
would die that Timothy would continue to have the responsibility to live for God.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:10.300
It's almost the idea as we read 1st and 2nd Timothy and we think about the

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:15.160
leadership roles and we think about Paul investing in and instructing Timothy, you

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.320
think about a relay race in which one runner finishes their leg of the race

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.480
and they have that baton in their hand and as they would take that baton and

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:28.000
they would pass it to the next runner, their teammate, who would run the next

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.640
leg of their race. And Paul understood that his race, his course, he was near the

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:38.480
end. He would put off his earthly tabernacle, the time of his departure's

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:43.960
at hand, but he wants to give this charge to Timothy, his son in the faith, and he

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:49.920
wants him to understand some things with regard to what he'll deal with. Honestly,

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:54.680
as you look at the explanation that Paul provides Timothy with and you see the

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:58.640
characteristics of these last days that shall come, when you understand the

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.600
persecution that will come for those that live godly in Christ Jesus, you

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:09.000
could understand why the next word in verse number 14 is continue. Continue. Why?

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.360
Because really the idea is, man, I'm gonna give up. I mean, why would I want to deal

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.600
with all of that? Why would I want all that hardship and difficulty? And Paul

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:27.120
says, listen, be aware, know what you're going to face, but continue. But continue.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:31.560
We see, number one, the explanation, but now we see, number two, the exhortation.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:36.320
The exhortation. The idea of an exhortation is an address or

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:43.400
communication that's emphatically urging someone to do something. We find that this

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:50.520
exhortation is given in verse number 14, and the Bible says, but continue thou in

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:55.200
the faith, in the things which thou hast learned and has been assured of, knowing

00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:00.760
of whom thou hast learned them. He said to the believers there in Acts 14, 22,

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.960
continue in the faith, and here he says, continue thou in the things which thou

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:10.120
hast learned and has been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:16.480
Begin to think about this particular charge, this exhortation, this communication that

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:23.960
Paul is giving to Timothy, emphatically urging him to continue. I understand, Timothy, that

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:28.680
the pressures are going to be great. I understand that the opposition is going to mount. I understand

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:35.160
you're going to deal with some really difficult things, but continue. Don't give up. Don't

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:44.560
give up. Don't turn back. Continue. Continue. So often, people will ask the question when

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:49.800
you deal with times of difficulty and great adversity as we've dealt with in our nation

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:54.280
in recent years, and they begin to consider, what is it that we should do? How is it that

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:59.240
we should respond? What should we do with regard to the current environment and the

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:07.040
current circumstances in one word? Continue. Continue. And really, as believers this morning,

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:11.400
we could say, what other option is there? Listen, I don't want to give up. I'm not a

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:16.840
quitter. I don't want to go back. I don't want to give up or go back. No, I want to

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:21.160
continue. Is it going to be easy to continue? No, it's not going to be easy to continue.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:26.320
Are there going to be obstacles to continuing? Sure, there will be obstacles, but our God

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:35.080
is with us. And we find that this exhortation is given, the idea of keep on keeping on.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.020
You've heard somebody use that phrase, no doubt. I want you to think about some other

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:41.800
things that Paul says. Turn back to 1 Timothy chapter 4, if you will, and I want you to

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:47.480
notice what Paul says here in this portion of Scripture as he's dealing with the idea

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:54.400
of what's taking place with regard to the ideas of difficulty and all that he would

00:23:54.400 --> 00:24:00.920
deal with. And he says to Timothy in 1 Timothy chapter 4, in verse number 1, notice he says,

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:05.640
now the Spirit speaketh expressly, then in the latter times, notice what he says, some

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:12.240
shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils,

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.400
speaking lies and hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with a hot iron, forbidding

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:22.160
to marry and commanding to abstain from meats which God hath created to be received with

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.600
thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. And so Paul, again, in 1 Timothy

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:33.360
chapter 4, is telling Timothy, listen, here's what's going to happen in the last days and

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:41.880
there will be some, notice in verse 1, some shall depart from the faith. Some shall depart.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:47.880
But what's the exhortation to Timothy? Continue. What's the exhortation for us this morning?

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:54.360
I don't want to be part of the some that shall depart. In fact, if you look at the end of

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:59.640
2 Timothy in the 4th chapter, you find that Paul mentions about Demas, hath forsaken me,

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:05.120
having loved this present world, in 2 Timothy 4 in verse number 10. And we find that here

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:11.680
as we look to the truth of God's Word and we see that God has provided us with an explanation

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:16.200
of what we'll deal with, but the exhortation remains the same. He tells him this in the

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:21.480
beginning of 1 Timothy 4, but then skip down, if you will, to the very last verse of 1 Timothy

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:27.480
chapter 4 in verse number 16. He says this, take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:34.120
Notice what he says, continue in them. Continue in them. For in doing this thou shalt both

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:40.920
save thyself and them that hear thee. And so we find that Paul continues to give this

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:47.240
exhortation. He's consistent in the message that he delivers to Timothy, both in 1 Timothy

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:54.480
and again in 2 Timothy, this message of continue. The pressures are great. The opposition is

00:25:54.480 --> 00:26:00.800
great. But continue. Persevere. Continue to march forward, to be steadfast, to be constant.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:06.720
I think about that word steadfast. Look at 1 Corinthians chapter 15. In 1 Corinthians

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:12.480
chapter 15 we see, as we're reminded of the great chapter of 1 Corinthians 15, that we

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:18.040
serve a risen Savior. The chapter that we would go to to speak about the resurrection

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:24.000
and to look at all the teaching here in 1 Corinthians 15, that we serve a risen Savior.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.440
And what a great truth to know that He lives and that He lives and He reigns and He rules.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:36.140
And here, at the end of the chapter, Paul is giving this exhortation, this admonition

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:41.580
to the church in Corinth and he says in verse 57, but thanks be to God which giveth us the

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:48.180
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, notice what he says,

00:26:48.180 --> 00:27:00.700
be ye steadfast. To continue is to be steadfast. And so he says, be steadfast, unmovable, always

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:05.260
abounding in the work of the Lord. And then notice this great promise, for as much as

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:13.460
you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. Our labor is not in vain in the

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:18.300
Lord. God has given us promises. There are some that would look at the current environment

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:23.780
in which we're living and even looking at the Christendom, if you will, broadly speaking,

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:30.660
and looking even closer in if you would narrow down that scope and look at some evangelical

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:36.460
churches and even narrowing it down and looking at some Baptist churches and saying, why are

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:40.260
there less people coming in this generation than in the previous generation? Why are we

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.940
not seeing as many results and why are we not seeing all these things? Listen, don't

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:48.980
be discouraged by those things. Don't give up because of that. No, continue because God

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:56.380
said that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. God had said through Paul to the believers

00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:02.340
in Corinth earlier in this book, some water or some plant, some water, but God gives the

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:09.220
increase. And there are times in our lives where we may be on that process of being those

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:14.420
that are picking fruit, so to speak, that we're seeing the results of the harvest and

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:19.660
we're seeing the fruit of the labor. But there are other times in which we're simply out

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:26.020
sowing the seed, sowing the seed. When you're sowing the seed, it takes time for that seed

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:32.020
to germinate, to produce. But we can understand that God said that His Word would not return

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:36.580
void. God said that His Word is powerful, that His Word is profitable. And we go forth

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:42.580
and we sow the Word of God, the seed of God's Word, and we try to be faithful. We seek to

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:47.340
please the Lord in what He's called us to do. And we understand that with all the oppositions

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:52.660
and all the difficulties and all that's taking place, that the one word for us is continue.

00:28:52.660 --> 00:29:01.820
Continue. Continue. Continue what? Continue what? I'm going to give you 12 thoughts this

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:08.100
morning. Just two points and then 12 thoughts, amen? I'm going to give you 12 thoughts this

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:13.380
morning of in what areas we can continue. But here's my challenge for you. It's not

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:18.739
an exhaustive list. There may be some things that you're able to add to this list, maybe

00:29:18.739 --> 00:29:22.860
immediately. There's some thoughts that you have and some areas in which you can continue

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:30.500
that you should continue, that we should continue. Maybe throughout this year as you are reminded

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:36.700
of our theme as we study through these books, 1 and 2 Timothy, as we are meditating on this

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:42.660
thought of continue that God would help us add to this list. Of in what areas should

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:50.980
we continue? Number one, we better continue praying. Continue praying. Never stop praying.

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:58.179
God hears and answers prayer. Prayer is a unique privilege for every child of God. What

00:29:58.179 --> 00:30:00.500
a great truth.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:05.219
God has given us direct access to the throne of God. He says that we can come boldly unto

00:30:05.219 --> 00:30:11.920
the throne of grace. We can go to Him at any moment for any reason. Never stop praying.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:19.639
Continue praying. Why? Because when we pray we get to see what God can do. Now unto Him

00:30:19.639 --> 00:30:27.100
that is able to do exceeding, abundantly, above all that we ask or think. And ultimately

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:32.340
what's the purpose? That He would receive the glory. That He would receive the honor.

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:37.860
That it would be obvious to us and to those around us that God did it, that God worked,

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:44.540
that God answered the prayers of His people. God hears prayer and He answers prayer. His

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:53.619
answer may not always be immediate. But we must continue to pray. Praying is difficult.

00:30:53.619 --> 00:30:58.619
Praying is challenging. Praying is battle. There's a great spiritual battle that takes

00:30:58.619 --> 00:31:04.459
place when you and I enter into our prayer closet. Why? Because the enemy hates prayer.

00:31:04.459 --> 00:31:10.419
Because the enemy knows that God has chosen to use prayer to move the hand of God, to

00:31:10.419 --> 00:31:18.940
change the circumstances. We must continue to pray. Number two, we must continue rejoicing.

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:25.580
You know how easy it is to complain? You know how easy it is to murmur and to complain

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.860
about the circumstances and the issues? No, no, no. We must continue rejoicing. You know

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:34.940
God is pleased to hear the praise of His people. The Bible says that He inhabits the praise

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:40.940
of His people. We find that it is well pleasing in His sight when we lift our voices in praise

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:45.180
unto His name. We find that it's lovely, that it's comely, that it's appropriate for God's

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:50.379
people to exalt and praise His name. David says, come and let us exalt the name of the

00:31:50.379 --> 00:31:55.660
Lord. Let us praise our God. We must continue rejoicing. You say, but pastor, do you see

00:31:55.660 --> 00:32:01.300
the news? Do you see the things that are happening? Listen, continue rejoicing. Why? Because my

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:07.459
God is on the throne. My God rules and my God reigns. And listen, my God is victorious.

00:32:07.459 --> 00:32:12.300
Your God is victorious. Thanks be to God which giveth us the victory. We too are victorious.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:18.080
We sing the song victory in Jesus. I've read the back of the book, amen? If you read the

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.979
scriptures through in a calendar year, I typically read the Bible more than once a year, so it's

00:32:21.979 --> 00:32:26.020
been a little while since I read the book of Revelation. I didn't finish it up this

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:33.580
morning as maybe some of you did on a calendar reading. Guess what? We win. We win. We're

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:41.699
victorious forever. I will be with my God. We have so many reasons to rejoice. Don't

00:32:41.699 --> 00:32:48.979
allow the circumstances. Don't allow the perilous times. Don't allow the persecution

00:32:48.979 --> 00:32:54.259
to keep you from rejoicing. No, we got to continue rejoicing. Number three, continue

00:32:54.259 --> 00:32:58.820
reading your Bible. Continue reading your Bible. You say, well, I read it last year.

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:04.179
Read it again. I read it the year before. Read it again. You know what I do? I just

00:33:04.179 --> 00:33:07.979
said this to Holly last night. In fact, the last several months I've been reading from

00:33:07.979 --> 00:33:12.699
a different Bible, still King James Version. I don't have any other version of a Bible,

00:33:12.699 --> 00:33:15.860
but from a different Bible because this is my preaching Bible. I've read through this

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:20.460
Bible I don't know how many times, and so I started reading probably four or five months

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:23.740
ago from a different Bible. Why? Because it doesn't have all my notes in it. It doesn't

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:28.300
have the underlines and things. Now it's starting to get marks in it, but I want to go fresh

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:32.460
and I want to look at it. Why? Because I want the Spirit of God to speak to me. The Bible

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:37.100
says of itself that his word is quick. That word doesn't mean that it's fast in the sense

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:43.979
of somebody winning a race. No, it's alive. God's word is alive. And God will use his

00:33:43.979 --> 00:33:49.300
word in your life and in my life on the day in which we need what we need from God and

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:54.820
he'll speak to us. And what a blessing to be able to read and reread and reread. And

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:59.460
listen, as many times, I don't know, I've lost count. I wish I would have kept track,

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:05.179
but I never did. I don't know how many times I've read through the Bible. But can I tell

00:34:05.179 --> 00:34:12.220
you? It never gets old. It just doesn't get old because God will teach you something new.

00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:18.700
God will minister to you in a new way, in a fresh way. There's 1189 chapters in this

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:25.299
book. You don't know all of it, neither do I. You know how many times I preach through

00:34:25.299 --> 00:34:29.339
a passage of Scripture and then a few weeks later I read through that passage of Scripture

00:34:29.339 --> 00:34:32.940
in my daily devotions and I say something like this, I wish I would have thought about

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:41.019
that when I preached that message. Why? Because it's a living book. We sing the song with

00:34:41.019 --> 00:34:50.220
the kids, read your Bible, pray every day. And you'll, Lydia, grow, grow, grow. Right?

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:57.339
Don't read your Bible, forget to pray. And you'll shrink, shrink, shrink. This is a little

00:34:57.339 --> 00:35:02.459
song for the Sunday school kids, but what a great truth. We're going to be students

00:35:02.459 --> 00:35:09.220
of the Word of God. Continue reading your Bible. Continue, number four, memorizing Scripture.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:14.899
Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way, by taking heed thereto according to thy

00:35:14.899 --> 00:35:21.540
word. Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. Bible memorization

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:31.059
is something that has almost, in our churches today, it's almost been reserved for children.

00:35:31.059 --> 00:35:38.100
We need to be memorizing Scripture. Memorizing Scripture. I've read accounts of people in

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:44.739
foreign nations that have had various people groups come in and occupy and try to destroy

00:35:44.739 --> 00:35:51.380
and one thing that has been consistent, they take a Bible away from people. I wonder the

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:57.859
morning, if somebody took your Bible away, how much do you know? How much have you memorized?

00:35:57.859 --> 00:36:03.420
How much can we rehearse? I remember when I was in Bible college one night, we had an

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:08.179
old-fashioned tent revival meeting and we're in that tent revival and there's all the sound

00:36:08.179 --> 00:36:12.540
equipment out there so they had some of us college guys sleeping in the tent that night

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:16.540
so that, you know, nothing would happen to the materials and what have you. And we're

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:19.859
supposed to be out there for some security purposes and we're laying there trying to

00:36:19.859 --> 00:36:24.179
get to sleep and we just began, the group of us that were there, just how many verses

00:36:24.179 --> 00:36:30.019
can we memorize? How many verses can we quote? We just began quoting verses and each one

00:36:30.019 --> 00:36:33.140
of us take a turn and quote a verse, quote a verse, quote a verse, quote a verse, quote

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:39.179
a verse, just keep going around. Man, it was encouraging. We need to continue memorizing

00:36:39.179 --> 00:36:43.980
Scripture. Number five, we need to continue attending church. Listen, there's no place

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:49.220
like church. I'm thankful for church. Understand this morning that church is not the place,

00:36:49.299 --> 00:36:54.700
it's not the building, it's the people. Understand this morning that we're the body of Christ.

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:58.420
Understand this morning that the church is not man's idea, the church is God's idea.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:02.579
For Jesus Christ said, I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against

00:37:02.579 --> 00:37:08.339
it. I'm thankful for a local church. I'm thankful for the opportunity to have, obviously, pastor

00:37:08.339 --> 00:37:12.140
a local church, but I'm thankful that God gave me the opportunity to get plugged into

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:19.339
a local church right after I got saved. The local church means so much to me. The local

00:37:19.339 --> 00:37:25.500
church. Continue attending church. Continue, number six, sharing the gospel. Continue sharing

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:32.500
the gospel. You say, no one wants to hear. You just keep continuing sharing the gospel.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:36.140
The Lord told the disciples about going into a city and if they don't receive you just

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:41.760
shake the dust off and go on. Continue. He didn't say come up and give up or come back

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:45.799
and give up. No, he said just continue, just go on. And this morning I understand there's

00:37:45.799 --> 00:37:49.239
a lot of people that aren't interested in hearing the gospel, but we must understand

00:37:49.239 --> 00:37:54.399
this morning that we must continue to share the gospel. The gospel is the power of God

00:37:54.399 --> 00:37:59.540
unto salvation to everyone that believe it, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. Listen,

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:05.679
we have, if we stop preaching the gospel we have no reason to really even be here. We've

00:38:05.679 --> 00:38:10.040
been given, we've been entrusted to share the gospel. We've been given the gospel. We

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:19.399
must continue. Number seven, we must continue investing in eternity. Investing in eternity.

00:38:19.399 --> 00:38:23.040
You say, pastor, the economy. You know how many people I've heard tell me things about

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.920
the economy in the last six months? I mean, this is going to happen and that's going to

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:34.799
happen and this is going to happen. It makes my mind go crazy. But we're going to invest

00:38:34.799 --> 00:38:45.679
in eternity. We don't give because the economy's good. We give because it's Biblical. Amen?

00:38:45.679 --> 00:38:53.400
Amen? We give because it's Biblical. We don't give because we get a tax break. We give because

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.880
it's Biblical. You know there's some countries, some nations in which they don't have the

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:01.159
kind of tax system that we have. They don't have the kind of economy that we have. But

00:39:01.159 --> 00:39:06.599
you know what believers do each and every week? They worship the Lord through giving.

00:39:06.599 --> 00:39:14.400
Some people they give grains because that's what they have. God's blessed us abundantly.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:19.119
We must continue to invest in eternity. The greatest investment that we could ever make

00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:24.200
is to invest in eternity. The Bible says, as we would look at the book of Philippians

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:29.159
in the fourth chapter, that my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory

00:39:29.159 --> 00:39:34.239
through Christ Jesus. This offering that's mentioned in Philippians chapter 4 was really

00:39:34.239 --> 00:39:38.280
missions giving as they would give to Paul as he would have the opportunity to go and

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:42.919
share the gospel as a missionary. And we find that there was an investment and Paul says

00:39:42.919 --> 00:39:48.479
it's not that I desired a gift but fruit that would abound to your account. Wow! God's economy

00:39:48.479 --> 00:39:53.880
is different than our economy. And I understand there's a lot of concern amongst a lot of

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:59.479
people with regard to what economic crisis we must face or we might face. But the reality

00:39:59.479 --> 00:40:00.520
is that my God is still...

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:04.460
on the throne, and my God's still good.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:08.620
One day, according to the, during the Tribulation, according to the book of Revelation, at some

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:13.860
point a day's wages are going to be necessary to buy a daily portion of food.

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:14.860
We're not there.

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:18.440
Thankfully, I'll never be there, I'm not going to live through the Tribulation.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.940
But the reality this morning is that God's been so good to us.

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:28.580
So often we hear of people, and I don't seek to criticize anyone, I believe it's an important

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:38.700
aspect to be wise and to be prudent and to do some retirement planning, but not at the

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:44.980
expense of investment eternity planning.

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:50.540
Retirement is not a guarantee for any one of us.

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:54.860
The person that owned that property before they sold it to have two houses built there,

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:58.700
her plan was to move there and retire and build a house.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.860
She bought that property in 1978.

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:03.940
You know why she's not building a house?

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.220
She never made it to retirement.

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:07.220
It's sad.

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:08.220
That was her plan.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:13.860
There's a lot of people that don't ever make it to retirement, but can I tell you this

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:16.840
morning, we're going to make it to eternity.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.420
We must be investing in eternity.

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:21.580
Number eight, continue obeying the Lord.

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:22.980
Just continue to obey.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.780
Lord, I will obey.

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:31.900
Just simple obedience.

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:36.100
Simple obedience to what thus saith the Lord.

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:43.180
John chapter number two, Mary says to those servants, whatsoever he saith unto you, do

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:44.540
it.

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.060
Do it.

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:47.760
Just obey.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.780
Number nine, continue serving the Lord.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.660
Now is not the time to quit serving God.

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:56.500
It's time to continue serving the Lord.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:00.180
It's time to serve Him more than we have in the past.

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:01.180
Why?

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.180
For we see the day approaching.

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:03.180
We know that we're living these last signs.

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:04.420
We know that Jesus is coming.

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:10.020
We know that we soon will put off our earthly tabernacle as Peter and Paul speak of, and

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:15.820
so we must continue to serve the Lord.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:16.820
Continue singing.

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:17.820
I love to sing.

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:18.820
I don't always sing on tune.

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:19.820
Peter can tell you all about that.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:20.820
But I love to sing.

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:21.820
I hope God's given you a song.

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:22.820
Just continue to sing.

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:35.980
You know, singing is something that's, it's amazing the impact that it can have on your

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:36.980
life.

00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:41.460
You go through some difficulties, you go through some trials, you have some of these perilous

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:42.460
times.

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:45.140
Just begin to sing.

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.500
Sing songs that are biblical songs.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.380
Sing songs that exalt the Lord.

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:53.980
Sing songs that help you to understand how great God is.

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:58.740
All of a sudden as you begin to sing those wonderful songs, those songs of Zion, if you

00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:02.940
will, those hymns of the faith, how it will help you spiritually.

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:06.780
By the way, the Bible would tell us in the book of Ephesians in the fifth chapter about

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:12.500
being filled with the Spirit of God, and as we're filled with the Spirit of God, the evidence

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.980
of being filled with the Spirit of God is that we're speaking to ourselves in psalms

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:23.580
and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:26.980
That's an evidence of being filled with the Spirit of God.

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.260
Continue singing.

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:31.260
I love the old hymns.

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:32.860
We sang those songs this morning.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:35.980
Man, I was encouraged.

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:39.500
I sing the mighty power of God.

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:40.500
Wow.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:45.660
My Savior's love, oh, how marvelous, oh, how wonderful.

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:49.540
Man, it just does something for you.

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:50.540
Continue singing.

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:53.540
Number 11, continue loving people.

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.620
Continue to love people.

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:58.540
You say, but they don't love me.

00:43:58.540 --> 00:43:59.540
They're not lovable.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:01.060
Continue to love people.

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:02.860
We're filled with the Spirit of God.

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:08.940
He allows us to spread abroad the love of God.

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:10.900
Continue to love people.

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:15.420
I've said this before, I believe that it's biblical when you look at the book of 1 Thessalonians

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:21.140
in particular, a number of other areas you could look to.

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:24.780
We find in the book of 1 Thessalonians specifically that as Paul ministered to the believers in

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:30.660
Thessalonica, that those believers, they knew that he loved them, and then he was able to

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:31.660
minister to them.

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:36.500
He was able to teach them and even correct them and help them.

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:40.900
I've said this, you've heard it in various contexts, no doubt, people don't care how

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:44.500
much you know until they know how much you care.

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:45.500
Love people.

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:46.500
Love people.

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:47.500
Love them to Jesus.

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:51.420
You know, I'm thankful that Jesus loved them unto the end.

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:52.780
His love is a perfect love.

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:57.340
John 13 verse 1 speaks about, He loved them unto the end.

00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:59.220
This is a perfect love.

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:07.340
But as His children, not only would they love one another, but we're to love our enemies.

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:09.940
Love our enemies.

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:13.540
Number 12, continue trusting the Lord.

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:17.100
Look at a variety of things that are taking place, say, well, I can't see, I don't know

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:20.420
what's going on, just continue to trust the Lord.

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:21.980
He's trustworthy.

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:23.460
Great is thy faithfulness.

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:27.860
We sing the song and how encouraging that song is, but I want you to understand that

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:33.060
He's never failed you and He never will.

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.060
Continue to trust the Lord.

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:37.660
Again, that list is not exhaustive.

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:41.420
Things that you could immediately, no doubt, add to the list.

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:45.740
Things that the Lord will help you in the days and weeks and months ahead to add to

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:46.740
that list.

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:47.740
Where is it?

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:49.500
How is it that I need to continue?

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:58.220
Listen, there's a great danger in giving up, going back, throwing in the towel.

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:05.780
The midst of all of the circumstances in which we face, the difficulties, the perilous times,

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:16.620
the persecutions, the single word that Paul would exhort Timothy with, continue, continue.

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:19.420
I'm so thankful that God's given us the truth.

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:21.260
I'm thankful to have a Bible.

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:25.180
I'm thankful to know the Lord, and this morning, I want to encourage you, and throughout this

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:32.060
next calendar year, 2024, I want to be encouraged every single week to continue.

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:36.780
As we look at 1 and 2 Timothy, and we go verse by verse through these wonderful books, how

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:44.980
we'll see Paul using his own life as an example of one that continued in the midst of great

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:47.220
opposition.

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:51.660
He left an example, and then he says to Timothy, continue.

00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:56.260
For each of us this morning, we've been admonished to continue.

00:46:56.260 --> 00:47:00.500
The exhortation is plain, it's clear, continue.

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:04.980
This morning, I hope that you have a level of excitement as we look at this new calendar

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:11.580
year, 2024, to study these books afresh, to be challenged, to be encouraged, to be helped

00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:13.060
in our walk with God.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:14.060
Know that you have an enemy.

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:17.020
Oh, he's going to try to discourage you and derail you.

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:20.020
In fact, he may try even this afternoon.

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:21.940
It's just the way he works.

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:23.820
Have you found it to be so?

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:29.180
Just keep your eyes on Jesus, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith,

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:33.060
and by God's grace and with God's help, we will continue.

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:34.060
We will persevere.

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:37.860
We will be steadfast in the work that God has called us to do.

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:39.900
We will not depart.

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:44.380
We will, there's no turning back, no turning back, no giving up.

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:45.380
We continue.

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:46.500
Father, we love you.

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:47.660
We thank you for loving us.

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:52.220
We thank you for the privilege, the opportunity that you've given us to gather together this

00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:53.220
morning.

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:57.320
God, we thank you for the many blessings in which you've bestowed upon us.

00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:02.100
We thank you for your Word, and Lord, we thank you for this text of Scripture, these two

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:07.420
books that we'll have the opportunity and privilege to study through here in 2024.

00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:15.980
And God, I pray that you would help us to be aware, have the knowledge.

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:21.180
As Paul explained to Timothy the things that he would face, the things that shall come,

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:24.740
Lord, that we'd have that understanding.

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:30.900
And Lord, I pray that you'd help us to receive and respond to the exhortation to continue.

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:37.179
Lord, I pray that not one amongst us would turn back or give up.

00:48:37.179 --> 00:48:43.540
Help us to, by your grace and with your help, help us to continue.

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:48.739
God, I pray that if there's one here this morning, one that's tuned in via live stream

00:48:48.739 --> 00:48:53.380
this morning that's not sure of heaven, they've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:54.380
personal Savior.

00:48:54.380 --> 00:49:00.700
In fact, they came here this morning, and the truth be told, they do not know for sure

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:02.780
if they were to die that they'd go to heaven.

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:08.580
God, I pray that the Holy Spirit of God would work in their hearts and lives, help them

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:13.300
to understand the truth of your Word, the power of the gospel.

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:22.380
I pray they'd understand that they're sinners and the consequence for sin, and understand

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:24.020
that you loved them and you died for them.

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:26.700
You rose conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.340
You offer to them a gift.

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.179
The gift is eternal life.

00:49:30.179 --> 00:49:35.020
And God, I pray that today they would not leave this place without knowing for sure

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:39.340
that heaven is their home, that they would receive the gift of God, which is eternal

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:40.340
life.

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:45.300
I pray for every child of God, Lord, I pray that you'd help us.

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:50.220
No doubt, we've experienced the attack of the enemy.

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:52.600
His methods are varied.

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:58.420
Maybe we're in the midst of a serious spiritual battle even at the moment.

00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:00.540
Maybe the thoughts have crossed our minds.

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:12.140
of giving up or turning back. Maybe, Lord, we have contemplated that idea. I pray that

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:18.100
you'd help us this morning to be encouraged. Help us, Lord, to be determined that by your

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:23.180
grace and with your help that we will continue. We'll continue to serve you and to live for

00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:28.340
you. God, I pray that you'd move and work in the midst of this invitation as only you

00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:33.540
can. I pray that decisions would be made that would please thee. Well, thank you for the

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:37.180
work that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:41.300
are bowed, eyes are closed. At the end of our services, we have a moment of invitation

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:43.380
where we give an opportunity for folks to respond.
