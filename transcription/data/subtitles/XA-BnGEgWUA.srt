1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,799
worthy, and he is worthy of our praise,

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:03,920
and we ought to thank him for it.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,239
What a wonderful song,

4
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:07,400
and glad to have some folks visiting with us this morning.

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,600
We do trust the service to be a blessing to you,

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,399
and certainly thank you for being here,

7
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:12,560
some for the very first time,

8
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,000
some who have been here before,

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,640
and we thank you for coming again.

10
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,719
Galatians chapter number four this morning,

11
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:20,000
Galatians chapter number four,

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,979
and I'll be looking at a couple of verses of scripture

13
00:00:21,979 --> 00:00:23,600
here from the book of Galatians this morning.

14
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,559
We'll look at a number of other portions

15
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,920
as we get through the message this morning,

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,959
but we've been dealing with all year our great God,

17
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:34,919
great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised,

18
00:00:34,919 --> 00:00:37,360
and we started the very first Sunday of the year

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,880
with this statement that God is great,

20
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,919
and why is God great,

21
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:47,200
and how is it that we would describe the greatness of God,

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,400
and it's one thing for us to stand and say

23
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,880
we serve a great God,

24
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,799
but then when we begin to put some meat on that statement,

25
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:57,520
God is great because of,

26
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,880
and we have some biblical truth

27
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,400
as to what makes our God so great,

28
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,680
and I'm thankful that he's declared to us

29
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,699
that he's a great God,

30
00:01:08,699 --> 00:01:10,720
and we can discover his greatness

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,660
as we study the pages of scripture.

32
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,400
We find that God has given us,

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
just as he's done to so many others

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,599
throughout the centuries,

35
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,519
the revelation of his greatness.

36
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,239
Over the past couple of weeks,

37
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,599
we've dealt with the truth that God is great

38
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:28,720
because of his great care for us,

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,000
and I'm so thankful to be a child of the Lord

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and to know that he cares about me.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,599
He knows everything about me,

42
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,120
and he still cares about me,

43
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,160
and he cares about you.

44
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,720
He cares about all of us collectively and corporately,

45
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,879
and what a great God that we serve.

46
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,720
Over the next few messages,

47
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,400
I'm gonna deal with the subject matter

48
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,819
that God is great because of his plan,

49
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:51,980
and you say, what do you mean because of his plan?

50
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,500
Well, God has a great plan,

51
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,139
and today, we're gonna deal

52
00:01:57,139 --> 00:01:59,739
with his great plan of redemption,

53
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:01,260
but we find that we'll go through,

54
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,220
and the last message that we'll deal with

55
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,419
with the subject matter of God's plan

56
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:07,500
is his plan for the ages,

57
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,619
and I'm so thankful that God has a great plan.

58
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,860
Maybe you say, how is it that God's plan

59
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,440
reveals God's greatness?

60
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,740
Well, no doubt in my mind,

61
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,979
you, like myself, have made plans before,

62
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:23,339
and there are times in which we've made plans,

63
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:26,259
and we thought they were just the best plan

64
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:29,179
that's ever been ever been made,

65
00:02:29,179 --> 00:02:30,660
and it's failed.

66
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,820
That ever happen to you?

67
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,020
You plan something, it just doesn't come to pass.

68
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,460
There are extenuating circumstances.

69
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,020
There are obstacles.

70
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,259
There are hindrances that come up

71
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:44,380
that prevent your plan from being executed,

72
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,020
and you say, man, that was a great plan,

73
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,440
but it's not executed,

74
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,380
and I look at the scriptures.

75
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,740
I look at God's precious word,

76
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,339
and I find that God developed a plan,

77
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:58,619
specifically with the plan of redemption

78
00:02:58,619 --> 00:02:59,979
that we'll look at this morning.

79
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,500
He developed a plan,

80
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,139
and though that plan had been opposed

81
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:07,119
by the devil and his angels,

82
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:11,119
we find that the plan of redemption was completed.

83
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:12,580
It was finished,

84
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,740
and what a blessing to understand

85
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,259
that God has a plan for you.

86
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:17,419
He has a plan for me.

87
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:19,940
God has a plan for the ages,

88
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,979
and though the world might stand in opposition to God,

89
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:27,199
and though the devil and all of his angels

90
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,460
might try to oppose the plan that God has for the ages,

91
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,300
we can be confident in knowing this morning

92
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,759
that God's plan will come to pass.

93
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,940
It's a great plan with regard to the content of the plan,

94
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,080
but it reveals the greatness of God

95
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,619
because he's able to bring it to fulfillment,

96
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,619
and what a blessing to consider that this morning.

97
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:54,539
We look at this portion of scripture,

98
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:57,779
and I'm reminded of what William Scroggie said years ago

99
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,419
in a book that he wrote,

100
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:00,779
and he summarized the Bible,

101
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:02,380
the totality of the Bible.

102
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,460
He summarized it this way,

103
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,740
that God's word is the unfolding drama of redemption.

104
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,360
It was a single statement that he made

105
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,619
in summarizing the content of this great book.

106
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:17,019
I happen to like the summary statement.

107
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,320
I'm thankful for all that God has contained

108
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:20,859
within his word,

109
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:23,799
but if you were to draw one precious truth

110
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:24,839
from God's word,

111
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,720
I'm thankful that it's God's word

112
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,160
that contains within it the plan of redemption,

113
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,239
and what a blessing to know that we can be redeemed.

114
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:36,959
We didn't sing the song this morning,

115
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,359
but often we sing the song about being redeemed,

116
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:42,859
and we're familiar with the song Redeemed,

117
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:44,359
how I love to proclaim it.

118
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:46,359
Redeemed how?

119
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:47,760
By the blood of the lamb.

120
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,279
That's the only way to be redeemed,

121
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:52,079
and the songwriter said in another song,

122
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,160
I stand redeemed by the blood of the lamb,

123
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,200
and what a blessing to understand

124
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,720
God's great plan of redemption.

125
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,299
The word redemption from a theological perspective

126
00:05:04,299 --> 00:05:06,540
is the purchase of God's favor

127
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,299
by the death and suffering of Christ.

128
00:05:09,299 --> 00:05:13,279
It's the ransom or the deliverance of sinners

129
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,579
from the bondage of sin,

130
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:18,380
and the penalties of God's violated law

131
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,299
by the atonement of Christ.

132
00:05:21,299 --> 00:05:23,019
As we begin to think about this truth

133
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:24,660
of God's great plan of redemption,

134
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,820
I wanna draw your attention here to Galatians 4,

135
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,359
and verses four and five,

136
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:30,480
actually look at verse number three,

137
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,739
the Bible says this,

138
00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:33,940
even so we when we were children

139
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,339
were in bondage from the elements of the world,

140
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:40,940
but when the fullness of the time was come,

141
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,579
God sent forth his son,

142
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:46,179
made of a woman, made under the law.

143
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,260
Why?

144
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,619
To redeem them that were under the law

145
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:54,619
that we might receive the adoption of sons.

146
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,579
We're gonna deal with this great plan

147
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:57,839
of redemption this morning.

148
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,779
I would ask this question with our first point

149
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:03,940
is why this great plan was required?

150
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,859
Why was this great plan required?

151
00:06:05,859 --> 00:06:07,779
Well, we see in verse number five,

152
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:09,019
the answer to the question

153
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:11,279
as to why God sent forth his son,

154
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,540
it is to redeem them that were under the law.

155
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:19,140
The reason that this great plan of redemption was required

156
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,579
is because we are lost in sin.

157
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:25,779
We find that the Bible tells us that we are sinners,

158
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:28,540
and we understand that God has developed

159
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,619
this wonderful plan of redemption,

160
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:33,059
and it's important for us to recognize this morning

161
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,459
that this plan of redemption

162
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:38,579
was developed in eternity past.

163
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:42,380
In eternity past, God who is eternal,

164
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,940
who has no beginning and no ending,

165
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,739
God developed this great plan of redemption.

166
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:49,579
Why?

167
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:52,859
Because he knew that there would be sin

168
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:55,260
that would enter the world through Adam and Eve.

169
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,500
And though he created Adam and Eve

170
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,779
in a perfect environment without sin,

171
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:02,940
we know that the Bible records for us

172
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,859
in Genesis chapter number three,

173
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:08,899
the events leading to the entrance of sin into the world.

174
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:13,540
And we find that God in his knowledge,

175
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,660
his infinite wisdom,

176
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,660
his all-knowing transcending time from eternity past,

177
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,500
he knew that would take place,

178
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,420
and therefore he created,

179
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,839
he developed this plan of redemption.

180
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,700
It was required because of sin.

181
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,540
It's interesting, some have said to me over the years,

182
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:38,540
I remember one individual that was just in great opposition

183
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,500
and very angry over the fact that

184
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,140
because of the transgression of Adam,

185
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,980
because of the sin of Adam,

186
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,140
then I have to pay a consequence

187
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,700
because of something he did,

188
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,700
and just so angry over that.

189
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,380
And the fact of the matter is that this morning,

190
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,700
you understand that God,

191
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,220
before Adam and Eve ever sinned in the garden,

192
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,720
God developed this plan.

193
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:05,779
If you were in the garden,

194
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:06,739
guess what you would have done?

195
00:08:06,739 --> 00:08:07,779
You would have sinned.

196
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,220
And by the way, we're not guilty because of Adam's sin,

197
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,380
we inherit a sin nature because of Adam's sin,

198
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,059
and we are guilty on our own.

199
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:22,720
There's not one amongst us that could stand and say,

200
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,880
I'm without sin.

201
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,440
We're all guilty.

202
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,779
It's not hard this morning.

203
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:34,179
Typically, it's not challenging to speak to someone

204
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,140
and to get them to agree to the truth that they've sinned.

205
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,179
Now, the degree of their sin,

206
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:43,460
the understanding of the consequence of their sin,

207
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,179
that's a different story,

208
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:47,640
but there are times I've spoken with people.

209
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,659
In fact, just on Thursday, I said to someone,

210
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:51,059
I said, listen, have you ever sinned?

211
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:52,700
They just kind of chuckled and said, of course,

212
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,539
everyone has.

213
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:55,059
That was their response.

214
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:59,659
Now, they didn't think they were that bad of a sinner

215
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:02,659
because they didn't do that many really bad things.

216
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:04,659
They acknowledged that they were a sinner.

217
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:09,059
The problem was they had a difficulty acknowledging

218
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:10,460
the penalty for their sin,

219
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:14,739
understanding the payment that was made for their sin.

220
00:09:14,739 --> 00:09:17,859
But as we begin to think about this truth of God's plan

221
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:20,179
of redemption and the requirement,

222
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:22,520
why this was required, look over the book of Ephesians,

223
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,140
if you will, in the first chapter,

224
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,820
and I want you to see what God says here

225
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,299
in Ephesians chapter number one.

226
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:29,719
With regard to the plan of God,

227
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:33,000
this plan of redemption being developed by God

228
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,539
in eternity past.

229
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:36,299
The Bible says in the book of Ephesians,

230
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:39,159
just a few chapters over a few pages from where you were

231
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,359
there in the book of Galatians,

232
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:43,419
we find the Bible says this in beginning in verse number four

233
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:45,440
of Ephesians one,

234
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,000
according as he has chosen us in him,

235
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,059
notice what the Bible says before the foundation

236
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:52,059
of the world,

237
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,979
that we should be holy without blame before him in love,

238
00:09:54,979 --> 00:09:58,520
having predestinated us under the adoption of children,

239
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,520
Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His

240
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,120
will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, wherein

241
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,820
He hath made us accepted in the Beloved, in whom we have

242
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,620
redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins,

243
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,720
according to the riches of His grace. We just sang about

244
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,720
God's amazing grace just a few moments ago, and we see

245
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,420
here that the Bible talks about the riches of His grace

246
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,020
in Ephesians 1 and verse number 7, and we find that in

247
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,320
eternity past, before the foundation of the world, before

248
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,920
sin ever entered into the world, that God developed a

249
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,120
plan for man to be redeemed. And that plan required that

250
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,720
Jesus Christ, God in flesh, go to a cruel cross, be

251
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,820
crucified for you and for me, be buried and rise again.

252
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:56,220
And we find that that would be the only way for man to

253
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,720
be redeemed. That's the plan that God developed. It was

254
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,620
required because man was separated from God because of

255
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,820
our sin, and God in His grace and His mercy, He comes and

256
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,320
He says, I'm going to provide a way so that you can be

257
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,520
redeemed, so you can be reconciled to God. See, because

258
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,320
we were at enmity with Him, the Bible says that all are

259
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,220
sinners, and because of that, we are separated from God

260
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,620
and we're in need of redemption. We're in that

261
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,920
bondage to sin. I said this when we were teaching

262
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,420
Vacation Bible School just several weeks ago to the

263
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,220
class that I was teaching. I said to those young people,

264
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,620
I said, listen, you don't become a sinner because you

265
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:44,320
sin. You sin because you're a sinner. It's our sin

266
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,820
nature. And this morning, we find that this truth is

267
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:54,120
universal, that all are born sinners. And therefore,

268
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,420
this great plan of redemption was required because man

269
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:03,220
was separated from God. We find that this plan includes

270
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,620
the very way in which man would be redeemed. There's

271
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,920
only one way. Jesus said this, I am the way. He didn't

272
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:15,420
say I am a way. If He said He was a way, then certainly

273
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,020
it would be open for us to say, well, there are many

274
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,320
ways by which we can reach God. But we find this

275
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,120
morning that the Bible tells us that Jesus boldly

276
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:32,220
declared, I am the way. The one and only way. One way,

277
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,720
God said to get to heaven. Jesus is the only way. But

278
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,520
I'm a pretty good person, but I've done this and I've

279
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,920
done that and I'm working to do this and so on and so

280
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,920
forth. Jesus said, I am the way. For by grace are you

281
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,120
saved through faith, and that not of yourselves. It is

282
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,520
the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should

283
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,620
boast. No doubt today there are many people in our

284
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,620
world that are sincere in what they believe. They're

285
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,620
sincere in believing that they could be a good person

286
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:10,920
and somehow they could attain salvation. But the

287
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,820
reality is that we cannot attain salvation. We simply

288
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,320
obtain it. And we are given the gift of God, which is

289
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,020
eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. We can't

290
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:26,720
work for it. We can't earn it. And those that hold to

291
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,020
that belief, though they might be sincere, I would say

292
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,920
with great compassion, but with certain conviction

293
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,020
that God's Word plainly and clearly states to us that

294
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:44,720
you can be sincerely wrong. This morning the plan was

295
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:51,420
required because man sins. Man is a sinner in need of

296
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,820
redemption. I want you to notice with me not only why

297
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,220
the plan was required, but number two, what this great

298
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,720
plan reveals. What does this plan reveal to us? This

299
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,920
plan of redemption that God developed before the world

300
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,220
began, before the foundation of the world. He says, and

301
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,220
again if you look at Ephesians chapter number one,

302
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,020
help me, or I want to help you to understand that He's

303
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,120
not speaking about the who of salvation, but He's

304
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,620
talking about the how of salvation. Again He said that

305
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,220
we should be holy without blame before Him in love. And

306
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,120
verse number five, having predestinated us unto the

307
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,020
adoption of children by Jesus Christ to Himself. That's

308
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:35,520
the only way to be saved, to be redeemed is through the

309
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,420
Lord Jesus Christ. And He's dealing with the how. God

310
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,120
developed this plan of redemption and He says this is

311
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,520
how man can be saved, can be redeemed. But I want you to

312
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,020
notice what this plan reveals to us. Look over at First

313
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,320
Timothy chapter number one if you will. In First

314
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,820
Timothy chapter number one, Paul is writing here into

315
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,920
the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God. And as he's

316
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,520
writing, he's speaking about his own testimony. He's

317
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,820
rejoicing in the opportunity that he has to serve God. But

318
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,820
in that same section he reveals to us something with

319
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,520
regard to the plan of redemption that we see God's

320
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,420
abundant grace. Notice in verse number 12 of First

321
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,520
Timothy one, the Bible says, And I thank Christ Jesus our

322
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,420
Lord, who hath enabled me, for that He counted me

323
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,520
faithful, putting me into the ministry, who was before a

324
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,120
blasphemer, and a persecutor, injurious. Notice where he

325
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,120
says, But I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly

326
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,620
in unbelief. And the grace of our Lord, notice how it's

327
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:43,120
described, was exceeding abundant with faith and love

328
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,720
which is in Christ Jesus. And so God's great plan of

329
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,420
redemption reveals to us His abundant grace. It says in

330
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,020
verse number 15 of First Timothy one, This is a

331
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,820
faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ

332
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,120
Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am

333
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,420
chief. Understand this morning that Jesus came with a

334
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,520
singular purpose. He came with a singular purpose. There

335
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,720
are many things that Jesus did while He was here upon

336
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,920
this earth during His earthly ministry. We can read of

337
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
the gospel accounts, and we can read of the great

338
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,620
miracles, and we can read and understand even as Peter

339
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,320
would tell us later that He left us an example that we

340
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,220
should follow His steps. And no doubt we can look at the

341
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,720
life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, and we can

342
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,720
learn some very valuable lessons with regard to living

343
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,320
for Him and pleasing Him. But understand that the

344
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,420
singular purpose by which Jesus came was to save

345
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,820
sinners. To save sinners. That's why in the book of

346
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,320
John He so often reveals to us that phrase with regard

347
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,820
to the hour, the reason, the purpose by which He came to

348
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,320
this earth. And so we find that here in First Timothy

349
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,320
chapter number one, this great plan of redemption, it

350
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:10,620
reveals to us God's exceeding abundant grace. I'm so

351
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,520
thankful for God's exceeding abundant grace. I know that

352
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,020
we just sang amazing grace, and it is amazing, and we

353
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,020
sing, and they played for the offitory today, and can it

354
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,620
be, and that leads us to the second thought as to what

355
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,120
this plan reveals to us is not only His abundant grace,

356
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,920
but His amazing love. So thankful for God's love. We're

357
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,520
familiar with the verse in John 3, 16, for God so loved

358
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,420
the world that He gave His only begotten Son that

359
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,020
whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have

360
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,020
everlasting life. Amazing love, the songwriter said,

361
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:53,120
how can it be that thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

362
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,820
Amazing love, indeed. And this plan that God developed

363
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:05,520
in eternity past reveals to us His abundant grace, reveals

364
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,520
to us His amazing love. We need to think about this plan

365
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:15,520
of redemption, and it's required because we're sinners.

366
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,320
It reveals to us God's grace and God's love. But we

367
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,720
understand that this plan that God developed had to be

368
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,720
fulfilled. And I want you to understand this morning that

369
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,920
the enemy tried to do everything he could to thwart

370
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:38,119
the plan of God. Satan and all of his angels did everything

371
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:42,920
he could to thwart the plan of God. I want you to consider

372
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,520
with me just a few thoughts with regard to the opposition

373
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:51,119
to the plan of God, with regard to this plan of redemption,

374
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,920
this great plan of redemption. I want you to understand

375
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,920
that it was opposed even during His birth. Think about

376
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,720
His birth, and if you were to precede the account that's

377
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,020
given to us in the Gospels with regard to the birth of

378
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,720
Christ, and even go back to the Old Testament, you'd

379
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,420
understand that the enemy was active even during that

380
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,820
time to try to thwart the plan of God. How? One way was

381
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,520
by eliminating the messianic line. You read the book of

382
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,619
Esther, and there's so many wonderful truths in the book

383
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,720
of Esther, but you understand that the hatred of Haman

384
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,720
towards the people of God was a demonic hatred. And it

385
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,619
was no doubt in my mind a plan of the enemy to try to

386
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:40,119
eliminate the messianic line. Because if he could have

387
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,920
all Jews killed, the Messiah was to come through that

388
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,020
seed of Abraham. He said, I didn't say the promise was

389
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,220
a seed in the book of Galatians, not seeds, but seed,

390
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,820
speaking of Jesus Christ. And so why is Haman so hatred,

391
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,420
such hatred toward Mordecai?

392
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,900
But we find that he says,

393
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,620
I want all the Jews to be destroyed.

394
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,900
The enemy seeking to eliminate the messianic line.

395
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,460
We can read how that many attempts

396
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,160
throughout the Old Testament

397
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,140
that were made to defile the messianic line.

398
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,200
I want you to think about the truth

399
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,000
in Matthew chapter number two,

400
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,260
when those attempts by the enemy

401
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,940
to thwart the plan of God

402
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,940
through eliminating or defiling the messianic line.

403
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,580
I want you to see that after the Lord Jesus Christ was born

404
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,540
that there was one by the name of Herod.

405
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,940
And we're familiar with the text,

406
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,520
we're familiar with what took place,

407
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,820
but I want you to read it with me this morning.

408
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,020
We read so often verses one through 12,

409
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,460
and really even backing up into the first chapter

410
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,560
of the book of Matthew, beginning in verse 18,

411
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,100
and reading about the announcement of Christ's birth

412
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,540
and the adoration of the Lord Jesus Christ

413
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,780
and those that would come and bring the gifts

414
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,940
and all of those things.

415
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,820
But we find that the Bible tells us

416
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,860
in Matthew two in verse number 13,

417
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,460
and when they were departed,

418
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,220
that's these men that came that were bearing these gifts.

419
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,580
It says in verse 13,

420
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,060
behold, the angel of the Lord

421
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,740
appeareth to Joseph in a dream saying,

422
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,260
arise and take the young child and his mother

423
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,980
and flee into Egypt and be thou there

424
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,140
until I bring the word for Herod

425
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,600
will seek the young child.

426
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,980
Why?

427
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,440
To destroy him.

428
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,420
Why was Herod gonna destroy Jesus?

429
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,060
Preventing Jesus from going to the cross of Calvary,

430
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,580
seeking to thwart the plan of God

431
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,660
that was developed in eternity past.

432
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,300
Notice in verse 14, when he arose,

433
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,660
he took the young child and his mother by night

434
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,980
and departed into Egypt.

435
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,760
And was there until the death of Herod,

436
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,680
that it might be fulfilled,

437
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,700
which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying,

438
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,440
out of Egypt have I called my son.

439
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,660
Notice in verse 16, the Bible says then Herod,

440
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,580
when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men

441
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,260
was exceeding wrath and sent forth

442
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,460
and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem.

443
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,320
Can you imagine?

444
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,940
Such wicked behavior.

445
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,580
So all the children that were in Bethlehem

446
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,220
and in all the coast thereof from two years old and under,

447
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,720
according to the time which he had diligently inquired

448
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,860
of the wise men.

449
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,660
You're gonna think about the hatred.

450
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,860
This is the enemy seeking to thwart the plan of God.

451
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,980
How do we keep Jesus from going to the cross of Calvary?

452
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,940
We'll kill him in his infancy.

453
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,780
Think about this, during his life,

454
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:38,180
we find that this attempt to defile

455
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,460
and to eliminate the messianic line,

456
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,260
this attempt to kill Jesus in his infancy,

457
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,240
these are not successful.

458
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,100
And so therefore, during the life and ministry

459
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,140
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

460
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,940
you'll read right after his ministry commences

461
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,860
where Satan tempts him.

462
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,220
Then you'll read multiple times throughout

463
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,100
the gospel records.

464
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,580
We don't have time this morning to look at the examples,

465
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,000
but you'll read of those that tried to kill Jesus.

466
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,860
What was the significance of killing Jesus,

467
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,880
of stoning him or throwing him over that precipice

468
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,380
or any other manner in which they would kill him?

469
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,060
Well, the issue is that the Bible tells us

470
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,240
that Jesus would go to a cross.

471
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,760
That Jesus would go to a cross.

472
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,280
That's what God's plan of redemption required,

473
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,480
that Jesus go to a cross,

474
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,160
that he shed his precious blood for you and for me.

475
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,960
And we find that the enemy sought

476
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,900
to prevent that from happening.

477
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,760
I find that at the end of the life and ministry

478
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,860
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

479
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,400
that even there at the cross,

480
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,340
turn to Matthew 26, if you will,

481
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,860
I believe that leading up to the cross,

482
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,060
I believe that the enemy sought to oppose Jesus

483
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,320
to ever make it to the cross.

484
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,820
When you read of what takes place

485
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,460
in the Garden of Gethsemane,

486
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,640
I believe that all of the forces of evil,

487
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,220
that Satan and all of his fallen angels

488
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,520
were doing everything within their power

489
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,560
to keep Jesus from going to the cross.

490
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,080
In fact, the Bible tells us in Matthew 26,

491
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,880
notice what the Bible says in verse number 38.

492
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,040
It says this,

493
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,040
then saith he unto them,

494
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,560
my soul is exceeding sorrowful,

495
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,120
even unto death.

496
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,100
Tarry ye here and watch with me.

497
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,600
So often as we read this portion of scripture,

498
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,240
and perhaps you've heard someone say this before,

499
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,680
and I don't seek to argue with anyone

500
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,800
or to cause controversy,

501
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,080
but so often people will come to this passage of scripture,

502
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,880
and as they read where Jesus says,

503
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,600
to let this cup pass from him,

504
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,800
nevertheless not as I will,

505
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,160
but as thou wilt,

506
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,940
that so often people will say that Jesus was praying

507
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,960
that he would not have to go to the cross.

508
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,200
I don't believe that for one second.

509
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,380
Why don't I believe that?

510
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,160
Well, because Jesus said it was for that hour

511
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,760
that he was born.

512
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,860
It was the purpose.

513
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,560
By the way, Hebrews chapter 12 says that for the joy

514
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,800
that was set before him,

515
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,560
he despised the shame, right?

516
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,480
He went to the cross willingly.

517
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,680
He was not praying in the garden of Gethsemane

518
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,000
after his life and ministry,

519
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,080
after he had announced to the disciples

520
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,560
and to all those that he ministered to

521
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,200
that this was the purpose by which he came to save sinners.

522
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,440
In that hour, he was not praying to be released from that.

523
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,800
I believe in that hour that Satan

524
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,440
and all of the power of the enemy

525
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,960
was trying to kill Jesus in the garden

526
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,720
so that he could never get to the cross.

527
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,400
But guess what?

528
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,760
Jesus went to the cross.

529
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,300
He was arrested in the garden.

530
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,960
He went and he stood before the high priest

531
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,620
who was beaten, tortured,

532
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,300
delivered to Pilate,

533
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,900
and went to that cross.

534
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,880
Why?

535
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,040
Because the plan of redemption required it.

536
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,920
And though the enemy sought to do everything possible

537
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,600
to thwart the plan of God,

538
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,440
God's plan is great and reveals to us his greatness.

539
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,280
Why?

540
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,480
Because the plan came to pass.

541
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,680
The plan was fulfilled.

542
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,680
It was executed just as God prophesied it to be

543
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,300
after Jesus is on the cross.

544
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,300
Matthew chapter number 27.

545
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,360
Notice the opposition continues.

546
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:51,540
We sing the song typically during resurrection Sunday.

547
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,940
Up from the grave he arose.

548
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,060
The bars, they could not hold him, right?

549
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,460
He tore the bars away.

550
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,580
Up from the grave he arose.

551
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,360
But notice what happens in Matthew 27 in verse 64.

552
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,820
Look at verse 62.

553
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,220
The Bible says, now the next day,

554
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,840
that followed the days of the preparation,

555
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,520
the chief priests and Pharisees came together

556
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,240
and to Pilate saying, sir,

557
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,980
we remember that that deceiver said,

558
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,500
what a horrible way to refer to God as being a deceiver.

559
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,020
God cannot lie.

560
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,140
But notice what they said.

561
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,460
While he was yet alive, after three days I will rise again.

562
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,340
Command therefore that the sepulcher be made sure

563
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,940
until the third day, lest his disciples come by night

564
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,780
and steal him away and say unto the people,

565
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,620
he is risen from the dead.

566
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,060
So the last hour shall be worse than the first.

567
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,660
Pilate said unto them, you have a watch.

568
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,340
Go your way, make it as sure as ye can.

569
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,680
So they went and made the sepulcher sure,

570
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,180
sealing the stone and setting a watch.

571
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,960
Let me help you understand this morning.

572
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,860
Jesus didn't need his disciples to come

573
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,700
and steal him away by night.

574
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,540
Amen.

575
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,960
Jesus is gonna rise from the dead,

576
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,860
conquering sin, death and the grave.

577
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,100
And by the way, when we understand the truth

578
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,220
of the gospel, it is the death, the burial

579
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,100
and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

580
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,180
It's the resurrection that proves that the sacrifice

581
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,540
at Calvary was acceptable by God.

582
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,580
Accepted by God.

583
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,620
We find that as you study that great prophecy

584
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,580
in Isaiah 53, the Bible talks about not only

585
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,460
the death of Christ, but it talks about

586
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,840
the resurrection of Christ.

587
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,420
You can read in the Psalms about the resurrection.

588
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,980
In fact, we find that the apostle Paul,

589
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,700
as you read Peter, is preaching and he talks about

590
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,100
this day have I begotten thee, referring to the Psalms.

591
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,980
That's not about the birth of Christ,

592
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,060
but about the resurrection of Christ.

593
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,720
You see that in the book of Hebrews.

594
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,420
And this morning, we find that though this plan

595
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,620
was opposed by the devil and all of those

596
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,620
that had power, that the plan was fulfilled,

597
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,900
revealing to us his greatness.

598
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,860
Finally, this morning, if you're taking notes,

599
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,060
not only why was this plan required,

600
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:03,980
because man has sinned, we are sinners

601
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,260
and we need to be redeemed.

602
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,340
What does this plan of redemption,

603
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,460
what does it reveal to us?

604
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,140
It reveals God's abundant grace.

605
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,440
It reveals to us his amazing love.

606
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,900
But number three, who does this great plan reach?

607
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,380
Who does this plan reach?

608
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,220
Who does it affect?

609
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,600
Who does it impact?

610
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,560
Well, very simply put, all people of all times.

611
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,360
Aren't you thankful for that?

612
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,920
The Bible says this, what a wonderful truth,

613
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,080
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

614
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,780
shall be saved.

615
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,880
That word whosoever is so precious,

616
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,800
because it means anyone.

617
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,540
This morning, as we begin to think about this truth,

618
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,840
we read in 1 Timothy 1 and verse 14 and 15

619
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,320
just previously about God's abundant grace

620
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,600
and how the apostle Paul says that this is a faithful saying

621
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,200
and worthy of all acceptation

622
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
that Christ Jesus came into the world.

623
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,700
world to save sinners. He then says of whom I am chief, but I

624
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,300
want you to notice that in chapter number 2 of 1st

625
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,100
Timothy as the Apostle Paul is giving instruction with

626
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,540
regard to prayer, then in 1st Timothy chapter number 2

627
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,040
there's a connection that we see in verse number 15 where

628
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,220
the Bible says that Christ Jesus came into the world to

629
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,880
save sinners of chapter number 1. And in chapter number 2

630
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:27,320
the Bible says this in verse number 4, who will have all

631
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,880
men to be saved and come unto the knowledge of the truth?

632
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:39,100
How many men? All men. All men. The plan reaches all

633
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:45,960
people of all times. The gospel is the hope of any

634
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,940
people. I preached a message at the beginning of this

635
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,440
month that the only hope for America is Jesus. But I said

636
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,340
this in the introduction to that message that this

637
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,500
message was being preached in the United States of

638
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:04,240
America on that particular day on July 2nd, 2023. But

639
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,400
the message that I was preaching on that day could

640
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,420
be preached anywhere around the globe because the only

641
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,640
hope for any people is Jesus. Why? Because God's great

642
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,420
plan reaches all people of all times. Now that's

643
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:23,000
amazing to me. That reveals to me an aspect of God's

644
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,220
greatness that He's developed this wonderful plan and

645
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:31,700
eternity past. He knew that man would sin. He knew that

646
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,740
man would be separated from God. But He developed a plan

647
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,700
that through Jesus Christ man could be redeemed. Man could

648
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,740
be reconciled through the blood of the Lamb. It was the

649
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,240
only way for man to be redeemed. And He offers this

650
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,720
plan and He's revealed to us this plan. And He says all

651
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:56,280
people of all times can receive this precious gift of

652
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,620
redemption. Isn't that wonderful? It's absolutely

653
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,180
just astounding as we look at this wonderful plan this

654
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,160
morning. We find that the Bible says this in 2 Peter 3

655
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,660
in verse number 9, that the Lord is not slack concerning

656
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,400
His promises. Some men count slackness. But His long

657
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,960
suffering to us we're not willing that any should

658
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,280
perish, but that all should come to repentance. And we

659
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,820
find this amazing God that we serve He's developed this

660
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,760
amazing plan, this plan of redemption. And He's so great

661
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,660
that He was able to bring this plan to pass, to

662
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,940
fulfillment that He says on the cross of Calvary, it is

663
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:49,900
finished. Hallelujah. This morning God's greatness is

664
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,640
revealed to us through His plan, specifically this

665
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:58,680
morning His plan of redemption. I wonder as we

666
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,640
speak about this plan of redemption this morning, I

667
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,880
wonder to make it personal have you been redeemed? Have

668
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,300
you been born again? Saved by the blood of the Lord Jesus

669
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:15,100
Christ? Understand this morning I've said this plenty

670
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,980
of times from this pulpit over the years that false

671
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,280
teachers will use our vocabulary, but they use a

672
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,380
different dictionary. What do I mean by that? They'll use

673
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,880
the term born again, but they mean something entirely

674
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,920
different. So let me make it crystal clear this morning.

675
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:37,140
Jesus in John chapter number 3 has an interaction with a

676
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:41,780
man by the name of Nicodemus. And Jesus says to Nicodemus,

677
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:49,820
ye must be born again. And Nicodemus in a time of

678
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,420
confusion and uncertainty as to what does this mean to be

679
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,860
born again? He says this, how can a man be born again when

680
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,740
he's old right? How can I as a grown man, how can I be born

681
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,060
again? Can I enter into my mother's womb a second time?

682
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,760
That's what he asks in John 3 specifically. He's not

683
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,500
tracking, he's not understanding. And Jesus says

684
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:19,240
except a man be born of water, physical birth, and of the

685
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:27,380
Spirit, second birth, being born again. Jesus did not say

686
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:31,100
to Nicodemus, ye must be born again. And Nicodemus inquires

687
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,900
and says, how can a man be born when he's old? And Jesus

688
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,540
says you need to be baptized. No, that's not what Jesus

689
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,440
said. There are some that would tell you that would say

690
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,080
to be born again is to be baptized. In fact there are

691
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,580
people that have told me as I've asked them before, are

692
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,880
you saved? Are you sure of heaven? Have you been born

693
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,260
again? Yes, I've been baptized. No, no, no I'm not

694
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,420
asking if you've been baptized. I'm asking if you've

695
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:59,440
been saved by the blood of Christ. This morning it's a

696
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:04,240
wonderful thing to be redeemed. To know that our

697
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,980
sins have been paid for, not by anything that I could do,

698
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,860
but all because of what Jesus did. Why? Because he loved

699
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,360
me. Because I deserved it? No, because he's gracious and

700
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,640
he's merciful and he loves and he offers us this free

701
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,040
gift. The Bible says, as you study the pages of

702
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,880
Scripture, that the gift of God is eternal life, but

703
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,420
prior to that it says the wages of sin is death. The

704
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,660
wages of sin is death. There's a great contrast

705
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:46,100
between a wage and a gift. What I earn for my sin is

706
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:50,080
death. Separation from God for all of eternity. That's

707
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,280
what I deserve. That's what you deserve for your sin.

708
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:59,760
That is the just judgment of God for your sin and my sin.

709
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:03,560
But God in his mercy and his grace, he says, but I offer

710
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:08,400
you a gift and the gift that I offer you is eternal life

711
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:14,400
through Jesus Christ our Lord. That's amazing to me. I

712
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,000
mean, listen, I know several this morning, you've been

713
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,540
saved, you've been born again, you have a testimony of

714
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,940
salvation, but I hope this morning that we are

715
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,440
overwhelmed with gratitude to understand this great plan of

716
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,180
God and to see how God's great plan of redemption was

717
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:35,080
opposed through the ages and Satan and his enemies did

718
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,020
everything they could to thwart the plan of God, but

719
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:44,260
God's plan was fulfilled so that we could be redeemed. So

720
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:49,200
that we could have a right standing with God. When we

721
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,140
sing the song redeemed, how I love to proclaim it, when we

722
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,800
say redeemed, we always make it clear that we're redeemed by

723
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,280
the blood. By the blood. It's not by any works that any

724
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:07,920
person could do. It's a gift. If you could work for it, it's

725
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,920
no longer a gift. It's something you've earned. It

726
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,280
would give you reason to boast. That's what he says in

727
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:20,160
Ephesians 2, verse 8 and 9. So I wonder this morning, have

728
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:24,360
you been redeemed? Could you stand here this morning with

729
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,940
100% confidence to sort of die today and go to heaven? Not

730
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,060
because of anything I've done, but because I'm redeemed by

731
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:38,200
the blood of the Lamb, because Jesus is my Savior. He came

732
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,740
into the world to save sinners. Paul says, of whom I am

733
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,800
chief. But I stand here this morning and say, I'm saved.

734
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,980
I've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb. I wonder this

735
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,720
morning, will we praise Him for this great plan of redemption?

736
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:00,580
Will we praise Him for this wonderful, fascinating plan of

737
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:07,800
redemption? That God has infinite wisdom. He said, I

738
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:14,260
have to die for man. Think about that. He left the throne

739
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:18,660
room of heaven, all of the splendor and all of the glory

740
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:23,980
of heaven to die for you, to die for me. Oh, how we should

741
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,340
praise Him. How shall we escape if we neglect so great

742
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:32,020
salvation? Hebrews chapter number 2. It ought to be a song

743
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,180
in our lips every day of our lives that we're praising Him

744
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,680
for this truth of redemption. And then this morning I would

745
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,340
ask finally this question, will you tell someone about this

746
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:48,280
great plan? I mean, honestly, it's a wonderful plan. It's the

747
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:57,080
greatest plan ever, developed by God, fulfilled, finished. And

748
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:02,060
we can stand this morning with great confidence and with

749
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:06,380
biblical authority and say to anyone that we come into

750
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,720
contact with, Jesus died for you because He loves you. And

751
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,300
Jesus wants to redeem you. He wants to save you. We can stand

752
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,500
with confidence and with biblical authority, not just

753
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:24,100
with a thought that we have that we just want to be, you

754
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:30,240
know, reaching everyone. No, no, this is what God says. This is

755
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:37,100
what God's plan includes. And I'm so thankful for that. He

756
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:45,040
included me. He included you. Whosoever will may come. And

757
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:51,620
this morning, this plan of redemption needs to be shared.

758
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,220
You need to tell other people about it. It reveals God's

759
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,080
greatness. And this morning...

760
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:04,680
I hope that if you've never been redeemed, you're either here personally or you're watching

761
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:11,240
via live stream, oh, I would tell you that the Bible says today is the day of salvation.

762
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,140
The Bible says, boast not thyself of tomorrow.

763
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:18,660
We don't know what's on the morrow.

764
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,820
I would tell you that today is the day of salvation.

765
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:28,600
If you're not sure, man, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how you can trust Christ

766
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:33,960
as your personal Savior, how you can be redeemed, and have that confidence.

767
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:40,140
But for those of us that have been redeemed, oh, would we rejoice if we tell somebody?

768
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:44,680
Because this plan of redemption reveals how great our God is.

769
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,160
What a wonderful God we serve.

770
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,160
Let's pray together.

771
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,680
Father, we love you.

772
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,440
We thank you so much for loving us.

773
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:59,320
As we look at these truths this morning, I pray, God, you'd work in hearts and lives.

774
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:05,080
Maybe there's one, maybe there's several that are in the sound of my voice today that have

775
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,540
never trusted Christ as their Savior.

776
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:18,240
They could not stand and say, I've been redeemed, but I pray that they'd understand this great

777
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,720
plan of redemption was developed in eternity past.

778
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,920
Why was it required?

779
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,160
Because we're sinners.

780
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:34,040
It reveals your great love and grace, and it reaches every individual.

781
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:41,080
God, I pray that today they would accept the free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ

782
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,080
our Lord.

783
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,080
They'd be saved, redeemed.

784
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,360
I pray for every child of God, Lord, many that are here this morning that I've heard

785
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,960
their personal testimony.

786
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,360
God, would you help us to rejoice?

787
00:41:55,360 --> 00:42:02,560
Would you help us to share this wonderful truth with someone?

788
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:10,560
God, I pray that we would look for opportunities, pray for opportunities, and then seize those

789
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:18,600
opportunities to declare this wonderful truth of redemption.

790
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,240
Would you move and work in hearts and lives as only you can?

791
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,680
I pray that as we've been ready to receive truth from your Word today, that we would

792
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:33,480
be equally ready to respond, as we have this moment of invitation that we would be doers

793
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:40,840
of the Word and not hearers only, that we'd not delay, that we'd not put off.

794
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,840
I pray that you'd be honored and glorified through every decision that's made.

795
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,880
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

796
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,880
Would you stand with me?

797
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,000
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

798
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,560
Kimberly's going to pray.
