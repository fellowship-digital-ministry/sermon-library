1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
17, 1 Kings chapter number 17.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,739
And last week was a message that I preached

3
00:00:06,739 --> 00:00:09,720
on the only hope for America is Jesus.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,439
And it was the, of course, 4th of July weekend,

5
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:15,239
4th of July being on Tuesday, and preached that message.

6
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:18,159
But two weeks ago, we started to examine

7
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:20,840
God's care for his children.

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,120
And of course, this year, our theme,

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,600
great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,959
You see the banners, we've had it all over the place

11
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:30,680
trying to get us in that understanding.

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,819
Psalm 48, we sing as our theme song.

13
00:00:33,819 --> 00:00:37,439
Each service to remind us that our God is so great

14
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,400
and his greatness is known, but yet the Bible tells us

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,720
that his greatness is unsearchable.

16
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,479
And there's no contradiction in those statements.

17
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,279
The reality is that as much as you or I could understand

18
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:53,659
about how great God is, he's still greater.

19
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:56,200
And that ought to encourage us this morning

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,900
to know that we serve a great God.

21
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,680
He is the living God, and he's able to exceeding

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,239
abundantly above all that we ask or think.

23
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,819
We've looked at a number of things this year

24
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:10,400
that have helped us to discover the greatness of God.

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,160
We started out by saying, we believe that God is great,

26
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,519
but why, what is it about God that would lead us

27
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:17,919
to say that he's great?

28
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:20,360
And we've looked at a whole host of things

29
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,000
as we discover God's greatness in his word.

30
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,019
And then we'll transition here in just another six weeks

31
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:31,639
or so into the second phase of our message series,

32
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:34,279
if you will, not only discovering God's greatness,

33
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:37,919
but then we are to declare God's greatness.

34
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:40,680
If we know how great he is, it's a wonderful thing

35
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,839
for us to know that personally, but there's a lost world

36
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:45,680
that needs to know of our great savior

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,639
and how wonderful he is.

38
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:50,239
One of the aspects as we began looking a couple of weeks ago

39
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,519
at this portion of scripture in 1 Kings

40
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:55,360
is dealing with the fact that God's care for his children

41
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,639
reveals to us how great he is.

42
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:02,400
We've been using, last message and then again today,

43
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,559
we'll be using the events here in the life of Elijah.

44
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:08,360
I believe that these events are recorded for us

45
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,360
so clearly revealed to us God's care for his people.

46
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:17,399
I believe this morning as we truly grasp the truth

47
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:21,279
regarding God's care, it'll lead us to understand

48
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,720
a greater aspect of God's greatness.

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,559
Why do I say that?

50
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, God tells us this in 1 Peter 5 in verse number seven,

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,320
casting all your care upon him, why?

52
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,479
For he careth for you.

53
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:37,520
We understand this morning that that promise,

54
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,600
that truth that is given to us in 1 Peter 5

55
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,360
in verse number seven is a promise, a truth

56
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,880
that is given to every believer globally.

57
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,080
And I begin to think about that and I begin to think

58
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,039
about our interactions one with another

59
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,720
and an individual's ability to be able to care

60
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,440
for someone else and the reality this morning

61
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,320
is that my ability to care for you,

62
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,000
your ability to care for me,

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,119
your ability to care for one another is limited.

64
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,039
But God's ability to care for every single one of us

65
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:11,119
just in this room, then to think about

66
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:15,759
all of the believers globally causes us to understand

67
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,960
just how great our God is.

68
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,960
That he cares about every aspect of your life and my life.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,119
He is intimately involved and aware

70
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:28,520
of what's going on in your lives.

71
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,000
We looked at in our last message the fact

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,639
that he tells us that we're of greater care

73
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:38,080
or we're of greater value than the ravens, than the birds.

74
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,880
And he tells us that the very hairs of our head

75
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,720
are numbered and he knows everything about us.

76
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,440
He is a personal God.

77
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,000
And for that we ought to rejoice.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,880
It's wonderful to know that he is the Lord God omnipotent.

79
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,240
He rules and he reigns, but he's my God personally

80
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,399
and he cares about me and he cares about you.

81
00:03:57,399 --> 00:04:00,440
We find that as we began studying in 1 Kings chapter 17,

82
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,199
we find that God's care was given, was evidence to us

83
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,479
as we look at the interactions with Elijah

84
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,360
as God would give him direction to go to the brook Cherith.

85
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,839
And we understand that God said it was there

86
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:16,679
at that place specifically where God had commanded

87
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:18,959
the ravens to feed him there.

88
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,640
And I said this, I said the ravens are more interested

89
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,359
typically in stealing your lunch than in bringing you lunch.

90
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:27,239
And we see that, we understand that,

91
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:29,239
but God is the creator.

92
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:32,959
He said, I'm going to allow the brook

93
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,079
to sustain you with water and I'm gonna command

94
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,959
the ravens to bring you food.

95
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,119
And the Bible tells us that Elijah obeyed the Lord

96
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:44,480
and he went and he dwelt there and the ravens brought him

97
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,519
bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh

98
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:50,079
in the evening and he drank of the brook.

99
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,559
What a wonderful provision that God made demonstrating

100
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:58,559
to us, revealing to us the care that God has for his people.

101
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,600
We find that the Bible tells us there in verse number seven

102
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,279
that the brook dried up.

103
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,079
By the way, we will, it's important to understand

104
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,160
that that truth did not surprise God.

105
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,839
God knew, remember it was God that said

106
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,959
that there'd be no rain.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,399
He gave Elijah the responsibility of taking that message

108
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:20,320
to King Ahab, but we find that here,

109
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,399
as we see the condition of the brook drying up,

110
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:27,359
that God then speaks to Elijah again in verse number eight,

111
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:31,640
thus demonstrating even further truth to us

112
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,239
with regard to his care for his people.

113
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:37,279
Notice in verse number eight of 1 Kings 17,

114
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,079
the Bible says this, and the word of the Lord

115
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:43,799
came unto him saying, arise,

116
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,799
get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon,

117
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:49,399
and dwell there.

118
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,440
Listen to what he says.

119
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,440
Behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.

120
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,000
Many of us this morning are familiar with the passage

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,679
of scripture before us, 1 Kings 17.

122
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:02,160
We're familiar with this passage,

123
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,920
we're familiar with what takes place,

124
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,079
but I hope this morning that as we take a fresh approach

125
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:10,359
at this portion of scripture that we'd be encouraged

126
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:13,239
to know of God's care for us personally

127
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:17,480
and to understand how God cares about us as individuals,

128
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,200
and I hope that it would encourage us this morning.

129
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,239
I want you to notice I've titled the message this morning

130
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:25,480
there from verse number nine, get thee to Zarephath.

131
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,720
Number one, if you're taking notes,

132
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,600
I want you to note God's plan.

133
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,980
Understand this with me this morning, God always has a plan.

134
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,519
God always has a plan.

135
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,920
We understand that his plan for the ages

136
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,980
is revealed to us through the Bible,

137
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,320
and he's given us his precious word,

138
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,600
and he has revealed to us the plan for the ages,

139
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,899
and what God has revealed is going to come to pass,

140
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:49,339
and we can rest assured of that,

141
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:51,299
but we can rejoice this morning in knowing

142
00:06:51,299 --> 00:06:54,559
that God has a plan for our lives individually.

143
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:55,399
Why?

144
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,239
Because he cares about us, and he has a plan for us,

145
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:00,839
and we find that here in verse number nine

146
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,500
of our text of scripture that once again,

147
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,040
God provides clear direction to Elijah.

148
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,040
He gives him the direction to go to a particular place,

149
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,600
and then tells him that in that place of Zarephath,

150
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,839
that he's commanded a widow woman there to sustain him,

151
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,040
and I want you to understand here just for a moment

152
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,160
that as we look at the geography of what's taking place,

153
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,320
and we see where Elijah is,

154
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,679
remember he's at the Brook Cherith,

155
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:34,440
and the Bible tells us that it's before Jordan,

156
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,399
and so if you were to look at what's taking place

157
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,040
from a geographical perspective,

158
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,399
you find that Elijah is here at the east side of the Jordan

159
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,119
in a place called Cherith,

160
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,480
and he's there at that place,

161
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,239
and God has miraculously sustained him,

162
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:53,920
and now God is telling him to go to Zarephath.

163
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,519
Now, Zarephath is on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.

164
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,660
The geography would help us understand

165
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,359
that this distance between Zarephath and Cherith

166
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:08,079
is approximately 100 miles.

167
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,760
That's a long distance.

168
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,859
Today, we don't think much about traveling 100 miles

169
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,559
with our modern conveniences,

170
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:16,880
and transportation, and what have you,

171
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,119
but I want you to understand that in Elijah's day

172
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:20,519
to travel 100 miles,

173
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,839
especially across the Judean wilderness,

174
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,839
and all of that is a very difficult journey,

175
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,440
and we begin to think about this journey,

176
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,200
and we see what's taking place,

177
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,159
and we also understand that this journey

178
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,000
would be a long journey,

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,820
but I want you to understand this morning

180
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,900
that Elijah was a marked man.

181
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,559
Elijah was a man that stood before King Ahab,

182
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:44,200
and we mentioned briefly in our last message

183
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,599
that King Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel

184
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:50,239
to anger than all the kings that went before him,

185
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:53,559
and here, Ahab is the king, this wicked man.

186
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,280
Jezebel is his wife,

187
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,000
and here, Elijah stands before him

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,640
and announces the judgment of God.

189
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,919
So how does Ahab refer to Elijah?

190
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,080
As he that troubleth Israel.

191
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,840
It's Elijah's fault that we don't have any rain.

192
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,200
It's Elijah's fault that we have this drought.

193
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,340
It's Elijah's fault that we have no water,

194
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,599
and no food, and all of this.

195
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:20,520
It's Elijah's fault.

196
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,619
He's the one that troubles Israel,

197
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:27,520
but the reality is that it was not Elijah

198
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,200
that troubled Israel.

199
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,280
It was the wickedness of the people of God.

200
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,880
It was their idolatrous worship.

201
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,599
It was their turning their back to God

202
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:41,960
that resulted in the judgment of God coming upon them,

203
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,840
and I want you to look in chapter 18 just for a moment,

204
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,380
and I want you to see this morning

205
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,340
that Elijah was a marked man.

206
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:53,340
Not only that Ahab, but also Jezebel wanted Elijah dead.

207
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:56,479
Notice what the Bible tells us in 1 Kings 18,

208
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,760
in verse number four.

209
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,359
The Bible says this, and this is the.

210
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:03,519
there with Obadiah, but it says in verse number four,

211
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,079
for it was so when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord

212
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,239
that Obadiah took in a hundred prophets

213
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:12,119
and hid them by fifty in a cave

214
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:14,679
and fed them with bread and water.

215
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:17,199
So why did Jezebel do this?

216
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,799
Why is it that she killed the prophets of the Lord

217
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:23,179
and Obadiah interceded and helped to protect

218
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:27,119
and sustain these prophets of the Lord, a hundred of them?

219
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:29,719
We see also in verse number 13 that it says this,

220
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,639
was it not told my Lord what I did

221
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:34,239
when Jezebel slew the prophets of the Lord,

222
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:36,599
how I hid in a hundred men of the Lord's prophets

223
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:39,859
by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water?

224
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:42,859
And so why is Obadiah rehearsing this to Elijah?

225
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:45,279
Because Elijah comes to Obadiah and says,

226
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,319
go tell Ahab that I'm here.

227
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:49,259
Now Obadiah is a little bit fearful of that

228
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:50,959
because he says you're gonna disappear

229
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,079
and then it's gonna be problematic for me.

230
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:54,899
That's Obadiah's perspective.

231
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:56,759
Why does Obadiah have that perspective?

232
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,559
Well, look at verse number 10

233
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:00,119
here in First Kings chapter 18.

234
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:01,679
Notice what the Bible says.

235
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:07,399
As the Lord thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom

236
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:11,239
whither my Lord hath not sent to seek, who?

237
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:12,079
Thee.

238
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:12,999
Who's he talking about?

239
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:14,479
Elijah.

240
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:15,799
There's no, look at what he says.

241
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,119
I mean, notice carefully.

242
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,159
There is no nation or kingdom

243
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,159
whither my Lord hath not sent to seek thee.

244
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:25,359
And when they said he is not there,

245
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:28,279
he took an oath of the kingdom and nation

246
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:31,479
that they found thee not.

247
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:32,519
He was a marked man.

248
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:38,239
Why would Ahab and Jezebel go through great lengths,

249
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:42,599
these kind of lengths, to try to find Elijah?

250
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:44,279
They wanted to kill him.

251
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,479
They thought if we could get rid of this guy Elijah.

252
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:48,099
I mean, they slay all these other prophets

253
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:49,719
and they wanna get rid of Elijah

254
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:51,979
because of the announcement of judgment,

255
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:53,639
because of the experience that they have.

256
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:56,519
And we don't know exactly the total amount of time

257
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,479
that takes place between Elijah being at the Brook Cherith

258
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:01,359
and then Elijah receiving this information

259
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:02,439
to go to Zarephath.

260
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:04,419
But whatever the period of time is,

261
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:06,159
we know that it's three years

262
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,259
before he appears to Obadiah in chapter number 18.

263
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:11,359
But we find that during this time,

264
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:13,119
now understand with me,

265
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:15,719
Elijah's gonna take a hundred mile journey

266
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:19,999
as a marked man.

267
00:12:21,219 --> 00:12:22,479
Now think about that.

268
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:24,159
As we think about God's plan,

269
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,559
and we consider this morning,

270
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:27,439
the care of God is revealed to us

271
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:30,199
through God providing direction for his children.

272
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:33,479
And again, I'm thankful, as I mentioned two weeks ago,

273
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:35,779
that God continues to provide us

274
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:37,859
as his people with clear direction.

275
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:40,199
I'm thankful that I can seek the face of God

276
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:42,479
and I can ask him to provide me with leadership

277
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:44,079
and with direction in my life.

278
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,519
And we can find that God will guide us

279
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,599
and he will lead us.

280
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:51,879
And we find here as we look at this passage of scripture

281
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:54,559
that not only is God's care revealed

282
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:57,799
through God giving this clear direction,

283
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:01,679
but as we understand the journey that is before Elijah,

284
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,239
we understand here in this text of scripture

285
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:08,399
that God would supernaturally protect his child,

286
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,919
thus giving us further insight

287
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:14,139
with regard to the care of our God.

288
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,519
It's a long journey.

289
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:21,479
Could God have sustained Elijah somewhere closer?

290
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,639
Sure he could have.

291
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,479
God can do anything, right?

292
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,759
But God chose to send his servant to Zarephath,

293
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:37,139
100 miles away.

294
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:40,839
And in this plan, God gives him a promise,

295
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:42,639
we'll note that in just a moment,

296
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,959
but we find that in this plan, there would be this journey.

297
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,019
And guess what happens?

298
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:50,599
Elijah ends up in Zarephath.

299
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:51,919
Even though he's a marked man,

300
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,419
even though there's a long journey,

301
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:56,439
there are plenty of perils that could come his way.

302
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:58,839
But God is protecting.

303
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,719
We know God's plan.

304
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:03,719
Number two this morning, we consider God's promise.

305
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,119
As we noted in verse number nine,

306
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:07,239
that God gave him the instruction,

307
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:10,399
he gave him the clear direction with regard to where to go.

308
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,399
But we notice that this wonderful promise

309
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,859
is given at the end of verse number nine.

310
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:15,199
Notice what the Bible says.

311
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,359
Behold, I have commanded a widow woman there

312
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,079
to sustain thee.

313
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:23,859
Now, this morning, when we think about the promises of God,

314
00:14:23,859 --> 00:14:26,639
I'm thankful that God's promises are precious,

315
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,879
and they're certain.

316
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:30,019
I'm thankful this morning that we can stand on the promises.

317
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:32,159
We didn't sing the song, but many of us are familiar

318
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,159
with that wonderful hymn, Standing on the Promises.

319
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:37,799
And I'm so thankful, as Peter would refer

320
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:40,259
to the promises of God as being exceeding great

321
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:42,059
and precious promises.

322
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:44,839
And we can rejoice this morning that our God

323
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:46,739
is not a man that he should lie.

324
00:14:46,739 --> 00:14:49,619
What God has promised he will bring to pass,

325
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:53,239
and we find that here, God says that I've commanded

326
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:55,579
a widow woman to sustain thee.

327
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:56,979
Now, I want you to think about Elijah,

328
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,719
and I want you to consider the events in his life.

329
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:01,899
First, God tells him to go to a brook, Cherith,

330
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:04,599
and he's commanded the ravens to sustain him.

331
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:07,659
Now he says, go to Zarephath, and I've commanded

332
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:10,699
a widow woman to sustain thee.

333
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:14,099
Now, typically speaking, it would be that widows

334
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:15,539
were to be cared for.

335
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:19,079
Widows were to be cared for.

336
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:24,059
But yet, God says, I'm going to use this widow woman

337
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:28,419
to sustain thee, Elijah, to sustain thee.

338
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:30,819
As we begin to think about this truth,

339
00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:33,579
this promise that God gives, we find that God

340
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:36,919
has given to you and to me many promises in his word,

341
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:40,179
and we rejoice in those promises, and we find

342
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:43,099
that some of those promises are conditional promises,

343
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:46,139
and some promises are unconditional promises.

344
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:48,699
And as we begin to think about the two aspects

345
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,299
of the promises that God has given us in his word,

346
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:53,179
we can think of an unconditional promise,

347
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:55,379
one that's very simple for us to relate to,

348
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:57,459
is the promise that Jesus made when he said,

349
00:15:57,459 --> 00:15:59,419
I will come again.

350
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:01,500
That has nothing to do with any conditions

351
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,139
that any of us have to meet.

352
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:06,099
He's going to come at the appointed time.

353
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:08,819
He's gonna come right on time, and there's going

354
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:12,239
to be no delay, and we understand that he will come.

355
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:14,339
Just as he came the first time, when the fullness

356
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:17,139
of time was come, God sent forth his son,

357
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:19,259
according to the book of Galatians, for the purpose

358
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:21,099
of redeeming them that were under the law,

359
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:24,500
and I'm so thankful that Jesus came the first time,

360
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,299
but oh, what a wonderful Bible truth

361
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:28,679
that he's coming a second time, and when he comes,

362
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:31,179
listen, he says, I will come again.

363
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:34,699
That's an unconditional promise.

364
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:38,299
As we look at the word of God, we find that there

365
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:42,219
are many times that God gives us conditional promises.

366
00:16:42,219 --> 00:16:45,859
Many times, those conditional promises can be easily seen

367
00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:49,379
in the scriptures, where the Bible says, if then,

368
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:51,179
and there are these if then promises,

369
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:53,339
these conditional promises, if you do this,

370
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,619
then God says he's going to do this,

371
00:16:55,619 --> 00:16:57,859
and we find here in this text of scripture,

372
00:16:57,859 --> 00:17:00,419
both promises that were given, the one about going

373
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,299
to the book of Cherith, and then even here,

374
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:03,699
the one that's before us this morning,

375
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:06,339
with this man, Elijah, going to Zarephath,

376
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:08,379
this is a conditional promise, why?

377
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:10,579
Because he had to go.

378
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:13,179
He had to go to that place, he had to obey the Lord.

379
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:16,979
We find that, as I mentioned last week,

380
00:17:16,979 --> 00:17:19,019
or two weeks ago, in verse number four,

381
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:20,699
at the end of the verses, I have commanded

382
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,739
the ravens to feed thee there.

383
00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:27,139
Every word of God is pure.

384
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:32,819
Not one jot or one tittle is going to pass away,

385
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:35,859
and we find that God, he did not say,

386
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:38,019
I've commanded the ravens to feed thee,

387
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:41,019
he says, I've commanded the ravens to feed thee there.

388
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:47,259
Here, we find that he tells them to go to Zarephath,

389
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:49,339
which is a city that belongeth to Zidon,

390
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:53,699
and dwell there, behold, I have commanded a widow woman

391
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:58,500
there to sustain thee, there.

392
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,319
Now, it's interesting, not only to note the distance

393
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:04,339
between Cherith and Zarephath, but it's also interesting

394
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:07,699
to note that Zarephath was a city that was the home

395
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:11,939
of Jezebel, in the center of Baal worship.

396
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:15,339
I mean, when we understand these things,

397
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:17,979
it begins to elevate in our minds,

398
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:20,079
God, are you sure you want me to go there?

399
00:18:20,979 --> 00:18:23,500
We don't see Elijah asking that question.

400
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,939
See, sometimes we ask questions like that.

401
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:30,779
But God gave clear direction, there was no hesitation

402
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:34,099
on God's part, there was no problem with God

403
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:38,059
communicating effectively to Elijah where he was to go,

404
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:42,320
it was Elijah's duty to simply obey what God said.

405
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:46,659
We find that the Bible tells us, even though the journey

406
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,859
would be long, and it would be difficult,

407
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:51,700
and perhaps met with, from a human perspective,

408
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,619
many perils, we find that the city was a city

409
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:57,459
that was an idolatrous city that was the home of Jezebel,

410
00:18:57,459 --> 00:19:00,579
but we find that the Bible tells us in verse number 10,

411
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:05,299
so he arose and went to Zarephath.

412
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:11,299
I am challenged by the immediate obedience of Elijah.

413
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:16,539
As I begin to consider, even as we had our lesson

414
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:18,859
in Sunday school this morning with the children of Israel

415
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:21,519
responding to the message that Samuel delivered,

416
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:24,579
a simple message in 1 Samuel chapter number seven,

417
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:26,380
that they immediately responded,

418
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,419
there was no need for delay, and we find that here

419
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,380
in this text of scripture that Elijah's behavior

420
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,880
is demonstrated by his immediate obedience.

421
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,579
Notice it says that he went to Zarephath.

422
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:42,899
When he came to the gate of the city,

423
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:44,419
notice the Bible says that the widow woman

424
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:47,260
was there gathering of sticks, and he called to her

425
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,739
and said, fetch me, I pray thee, a little water

426
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:52,179
and a vessel that I may drink.

427
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:56,979
So he, initially upon arriving to the city of Zarephath,

428
00:19:56,979 --> 00:19:59,099
the widow woman that God has commanded to sustain him

429
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,380
was there, and she's gathering.

430
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,520
and here comes the man of God, Elijah,

431
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,960
into the city that God told him to go to.

432
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,840
God had given him that promise,

433
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,720
and he responds in obedience,

434
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
and as he goes there, the Bible says

435
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,840
that he says to this widow woman

436
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,240
that's gathering these sticks,

437
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,800
fetch me, I pray thee, a little water

438
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,560
and a vessel that I may drink.

439
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,320
What does she do?

440
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,480
It says in verse number 11,

441
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,120
as she was going to fetch it,

442
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,700
so she's going to go get a drink for Elijah,

443
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,460
that he then calls to her and says,

444
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,780
fetch me, I pray thee, excuse me,

445
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,260
in verse number 11, bring me, I pray thee,

446
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,660
a morsel of bread in thine hand.

447
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,260
You know, not only am I thirsty,

448
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,060
but I'm kind of hungry as well.

449
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,420
Bring me something to drink,

450
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,080
but also bring me something to eat.

451
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,340
And we find that the response of the widow woman

452
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,220
is given to us in verse number 12,

453
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,320
and insight is provided with regard

454
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,560
to her situation, her condition,

455
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,140
and she says this,

456
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,440
as the Lord thy God liveth,

457
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,360
I have not a cake,

458
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,960
but a handful of meal in a barrel,

459
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,280
and a little oil in a cruise.

460
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,880
Behold, I'm gathering two sticks

461
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,300
that I may go in and dress it for me and my son,

462
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,960
that we may eat it and die.

463
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,120
God told Elijah that this widow woman

464
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,240
was gonna sustain him.

465
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,520
And he arrives, and the widow woman says,

466
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,560
yeah, I'll go get you some water,

467
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,160
and he says, you know, give me something to eat as well.

468
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,600
She says, let me explain something to you,

469
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,280
as the Lord thy God liveth,

470
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,820
I don't have but a handful of meal,

471
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,840
just a little bit of oil.

472
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,360
And my plan is actually for my son and I

473
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,920
to have this little meal,

474
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,640
and we're gonna eat it and we're gonna die.

475
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,920
Can you see the condition,

476
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,720
the situation of this woman, this widow woman?

477
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,340
And we find that Elijah responds to her,

478
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,900
and he says these words, fear not.

479
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,580
See, Elijah had a promise from God.

480
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,860
What was that promise from God?

481
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,400
That promise was,

482
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,400
I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.

483
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,360
And by the way, as he speaks to the widow woman,

484
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,260
we get further insight because the Bible says

485
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,059
that the meal shall not waste,

486
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:29,600
neither shall the crucible fail

487
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,000
until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth.

488
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,820
This was really the final stop for Elijah

489
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,960
during this drought season.

490
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,980
God moved him from the brook Cherith to Zarephath,

491
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,980
but it was in that place that God was gonna sustain him

492
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,100
until God sent rain.

493
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,059
And no one knew when that day would be.

494
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,360
But Elijah had a promise from God.

495
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,940
By the way, God is the one that sends the rain.

496
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,240
God is the one that's in control of all things.

497
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,880
And we find that as the creator God and the sustainer God,

498
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,980
that he is the one that was able to keep,

499
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,960
to prevent the rains from coming,

500
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,720
but he too would be the one that would send the rain.

501
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,600
And we find that Elijah has this promise,

502
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,660
and even though he hears the situation

503
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,000
as it's explained by this widow woman,

504
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,800
he says to her in verse number 13,

505
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,419
fear not, but notice what he says,

506
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,600
go and do as thou hast said,

507
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,120
but make me thereof a little cake first,

508
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,000
and bring it unto me,

509
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,040
and after make for thee and for thy son.

510
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,559
Little selfish there Elijah, aren't you?

511
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,200
No, no, he's just trusting God.

512
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,960
He's just proving God.

513
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,600
He's got a promise.

514
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,559
The promise is that this widow woman

515
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,200
is gonna sustain thee.

516
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,600
And here we find that the Bible says

517
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,480
that he responds to her,

518
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,680
and he then says, here's what God has said,

519
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,040
for thus saith the Lord God of Israel,

520
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,000
verse number 14, the barrel of meal shall not waste,

521
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,480
neither shall the cruise of oil fail

522
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,459
until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth.

523
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,660
How's God gonna do that?

524
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,500
God can.

525
00:24:24,459 --> 00:24:25,480
God can.

526
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,899
Sometimes we get so, and if you have

527
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:31,020
that analytical mind like I do,

528
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,480
sometimes that messes us up with faith.

529
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,399
Why, because we like to trust in our own understanding.

530
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:40,380
But God says that we're not to lean

531
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,339
on our own understanding,

532
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:45,140
we're to trust in the Lord completely, fully, wholly.

533
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,920
And we find that here, Elijah has a promise

534
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,839
from God Almighty, the Lord God, creator God.

535
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:58,040
God gave a promise, and Elijah was holding to that promise.

536
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,080
Listen, this morning, when you have a promise from God,

537
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,360
it reveals to us that God cares about us,

538
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,000
and he'd give us promises, and we know this morning

539
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,239
that God will always fulfill the promises that he's given.

540
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,380
No doubt in your life, and in my life,

541
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,160
there's been someone that has broken a promise

542
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,720
that they made to us.

543
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,779
No doubt in your life, and in my life,

544
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:22,279
there's been a time that we've given a promise

545
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:26,480
to someone that we could not fulfill, we could not uphold.

546
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:29,080
That'll never happen with God.

547
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:31,520
It'll never happen with God.

548
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,959
God said, go to that place, and I've commanded

549
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:38,920
a widow woman to sustain thee there.

550
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:43,380
And Elijah just believed God, just simple faith.

551
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,179
We could look at Elijah and say, what a great man of faith,

552
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:48,300
and you may have that perspective.

553
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:51,779
And I'm not telling you that that perspective is wrong,

554
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,459
but I understand this morning that it's simply

555
00:25:53,459 --> 00:25:54,899
taking God at his word.

556
00:25:54,899 --> 00:25:59,179
Listen, we have a big God, we have a God of the impossible.

557
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:02,179
He's able to do exceeding, abundantly above

558
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:04,660
all that we ask or think, according to Ephesians 3

559
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,459
and verse number 20.

560
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:10,239
And so often in our lives, we may not prove God

561
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:13,679
because we're not taking those promises that he's given us.

562
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,179
You know, sometimes in our prayer life,

563
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:19,459
it'd be important for us to pray back some promises to God.

564
00:26:19,459 --> 00:26:21,320
God, you promised that you would,

565
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,140
and I'm going to obey you based upon the promise

566
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,239
that you gave me.

567
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:29,959
And God, I'm trusting you, and I'm proving you, God,

568
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:33,300
that you're gonna do what you said you were gonna do.

569
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,040
As I take this step of obedience,

570
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,339
as I'm putting faith in your word,

571
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:40,580
and I'm believing you, Lord, to do what you said

572
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,500
you would do.

573
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,339
And Elijah exercised faith.

574
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:50,100
He communicates to this widow woman the promise of God.

575
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:55,100
He gives her this truth that the meal would waste not,

576
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,059
and the cruise of oil would not fail.

577
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,260
It does not seem, as you look at the text of Scripture,

578
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,899
that there's any further discussion,

579
00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:06,399
that there's any just, you know, interest from her

580
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:08,880
with regard to how's that going to happen.

581
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,239
He gave the promise, God did, to Elijah.

582
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:19,820
Elijah held firm to that promise,

583
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,660
and then communicated that promise to the widow woman.

584
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:26,380
No matter, as we look at this passive Scripture,

585
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,980
we see how no matter what's going on,

586
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,760
no matter what our minds might wanna believe,

587
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,660
we must believe what God has said in his word.

588
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,140
We must take God at his word.

589
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:45,440
The just shall live by faith.

590
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,720
The Bible tells us in Hebrews 11, in verse number six,

591
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,559
that but without faith it is impossible to please him.

592
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:57,200
For he that cometh to God must believe that he is,

593
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,119
and that he is a rewarder of them

594
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:01,679
that diligently seek him.

595
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,500
Faith is so important in our lives.

596
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,980
Believe God, believe God.

597
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,660
We consider this morning, we note God's plan,

598
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,540
we consider God's power, excuse me, his promise.

599
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,540
I want you to note number three, God's power.

600
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,000
His plan, his promise, and his power.

601
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,980
As we note in verses 15 and 16,

602
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,320
God's power is clearly demonstrated for us.

603
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,279
We've mentioned in previous messages that God is great

604
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:32,440
because of his great power.

605
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,119
And here we find that even as he would show his care

606
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:40,020
for his servant, that his power is once again displayed.

607
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,239
The Bible tells us in verse 15 that she, the widow woman,

608
00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:46,599
went and did according to the saying of Elijah.

609
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,720
So she obeyed what Elijah said.

610
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,400
Elijah had such conviction in communicating the promise

611
00:28:53,739 --> 00:28:56,739
of God that he had received to this widow woman

612
00:28:56,739 --> 00:28:59,059
that she too believed.

613
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:02,020
And she acts in obedience to what Elijah

614
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,419
has communicated to her.

615
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:08,260
And it says this, and she and he and her house did eat,

616
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,619
notice it says, many days.

617
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:13,099
I don't know how long many days.

618
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:15,059
I don't know, it doesn't tell us.

619
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,979
We know that between Brook, Cherith, and Zarephath

620
00:29:18,979 --> 00:29:22,900
is about three years, according to chapter 18.

621
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,599
But here, we don't know exactly the number of days,

622
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:29,539
but I want you to understand that she thought

623
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:32,640
on that morning, that day that she met Elijah

624
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,919
when he entered into the city,

625
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,080
she thought that was her last day.

626
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,239
We're gonna eat this and we're gonna die.

627
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:40,340
That's the plan.

628
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,679
And the Bible tells us that they did eat many days.

629
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,280
Notice what it says in verse 16.

630
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,440
Can you imagine?

631
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:54,099
It says in the barrel of meal, wasted not.

632
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:55,799
I got that underlined in my Bible.

633
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,500
Neither did the cruise of oil fail.

634
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
Got that underlined.

635
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:05,199
Notice what it says, according to the word of the Lord,

636
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:08,600
which he spake by Elijah.

637
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,239
I want you to think about the behavior

638
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:14,319
over these many days, this period of time.

639
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:17,520
Again, I don't know the amount of time,

640
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,120
but I want you to consider with me the routine,

641
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,299
the behavior.

642
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:22,639
I want you to think about this widow woman

643
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:26,399
as she would go and as she would have the opportunity

644
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,000
to make the food, to prepare it,

645
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,420
she would go to where she kept that meal.

646
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,419
Now she knew what she had in the beginning, right?

647
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:37,599
There's no question what she had in the beginning.

648
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:41,560
She said, I have enough for just a little cake,

649
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,020
and my son and I, we're gonna eat it, we're gonna die.

650
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,619
She went back to that thing and she prepared, she made,

651
00:30:53,459 --> 00:30:57,939
and then the next day, she goes back, and there's more.

652
00:30:58,779 --> 00:30:59,619
It's there.

653
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,419
Now, you can believe what you wanna believe,

654
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:05,419
and if you wanna preach, you can say what you wanna say

655
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:08,059
when you're preaching, but I believe

656
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:11,279
that God didn't just fill that thing up overflowing.

657
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,699
I don't believe that.

658
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,319
I believe that every day, there was enough for the day.

659
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:20,480
I believe that.

660
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,639
She'd make that, they'd eat, she'd go back,

661
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:27,760
and it wasted not.

662
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,400
The oil, it didn't fail.

663
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,419
God sustained them.

664
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:38,419
God provided for them, and we see God's power on display.

665
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:43,019
Listen, you can't explain this passage any other way

666
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:45,120
but say God did it.

667
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,040
There's no human ability that we would have to explain.

668
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,879
How did that not fail?

669
00:31:52,879 --> 00:31:54,120
How did it not waste?

670
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,480
I mean, it's totally impossible

671
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,040
that they could eat for many days.

672
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,080
I mean, was she, no, God did it,

673
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:03,319
and I want you to know this morning

674
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:07,239
that in your life and in my life, God cares about us,

675
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:09,279
and God knows what our needs are.

676
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,119
God knows what we're dealing with,

677
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:13,399
and God's given us some promises,

678
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,080
and as we claim the promises of God

679
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,199
and we act in obedience to God,

680
00:32:19,199 --> 00:32:21,559
we're gonna expect God to work.

681
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:24,199
We're gonna expect God to do what he said he would do.

682
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:26,320
We're gonna expect God to provide

683
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,919
as he said he would provide,

684
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,919
that he would take care of us.

685
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:34,119
Listen, we talk about the model prayer

686
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,720
when Jesus, the disciples say, Lord, teach us to pray,

687
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,119
and part of that model prayer,

688
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:40,000
it's not the Lord's prayer, it's the model prayer.

689
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,279
Part of that model prayer is give us this day

690
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:43,460
our daily bread.

691
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,919
Most of us this morning in this country,

692
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,360
we've been so blessed that we don't understand

693
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,759
what it means to pray for daily provision.

694
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:52,600
Why?

695
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,240
We got a cupboard full of stuff,

696
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,880
and I understand that sometimes we go and we say,

697
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,919
there's nothing to eat.

698
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:00,119
You guys ever do that?

699
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,360
And if you're the husband and your wife says there's,

700
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,399
and they start naming things that are available to eat,

701
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,080
and you're like, well, that's just nothing

702
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,880
that I really wanna eat right now.

703
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,639
We got plenty.

704
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,000
I remember when I went to Hope Children's Home

705
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,559
seven years ago, Holly and I toured that place,

706
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:24,880
and they had on the wall in their kitchen

707
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,679
that they were praying for bacon.

708
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:28,559
I like bacon.

709
00:33:30,139 --> 00:33:31,639
They're praying for bacon.

710
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:32,679
And a list of other things,

711
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:35,360
and I kinda just kinda inquire.

712
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:39,759
Chris was the fellow that took us on a tour.

713
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,320
He pastors in West Virginia now.

714
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,160
And I remember inquiring about that list of things,

715
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,039
and bacon was at the top.

716
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:47,520
He's like, it's been a really long time

717
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,619
since we've had bacon.

718
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:50,800
The kids really like some bacon,

719
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,639
and they're praying that we'd be able to get some bacon.

720
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:58,039
And Ron, I seriously, the thought that I had

721
00:33:58,039 --> 00:33:59,720
was I've never prayed for bacon.

722
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,080
You know what I do if I want bacon?

723
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,919
I go get it.

724
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,160
I'm being serious.

725
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,399
I'm not being prideful, I'm not boasting.

726
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:12,800
I'm not independently wealthy,

727
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,559
but I'm just saying God's taken care of us

728
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:16,839
that I just can go and buy bacon.

729
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:18,839
And by the way, most of you can as well.

730
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,519
They're praying for bacon.

731
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,279
You know what I did?

732
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:24,640
Holly and I got in the car after we took the tour,

733
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,480
and we went down to Walmart,

734
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,200
and I bought a whole cart of bacon.

735
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:29,399
I did, man.

736
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:30,359
I loaded that thing up.

737
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,480
People probably thought I was crazy.

738
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,320
Gonna be back in a minute.

739
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,760
People probably thought I was crazy.

740
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,279
Gonna be bad for your heart, your arteries.

741
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:38,079
I'm not eating it, I'm just giving it to somebody else.

742
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:38,920
Amen?

743
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,880
And we took that, and a whole host of other things

744
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,799
are on that list, and just try to be a blessing.

745
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:45,959
I want you to understand this morning

746
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,079
that God said he would take care of us.

747
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,239
He said he would take care of us.

748
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,980
And no matter what the circumstances are in your life,

749
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,880
no matter what we're facing,

750
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,940
God is able to take care of his children.

751
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,779
He is the Almighty God.

752
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,440
El Shaddai.

753
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:08,399
He made himself known to Abraham in that fashion.

754
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:11,079
He said, I am the Lord God Almighty.

755
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:13,600
Then he asked, was there anything too hard for me?

756
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,119
No, nothing's too hard for thee.

757
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,959
You're the Almighty God.

758
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:20,880
He's all-powerful.

759
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,720
He's all-knowing.

760
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,000
And he cares about every single one of us.

761
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,880
He said, Pastor, you don't know what I'm dealing with.

762
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,399
I may not.

763
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:32,519
And the real truth of the matter

764
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:34,399
might be that I can't care for you

765
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:36,440
the way that you might desire

766
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,200
because I'm a limited individual.

767
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,420
But the unlimited God can make a promise

768
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,799
to all of the believers around the globe

769
00:35:48,799 --> 00:35:50,760
for all of history,

770
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:55,260
casting all your care upon him,

771
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,880
for he careth for you.

772
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,079
He's a great God.

773
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:02,799
His care is evidenced in 1 Kings 17

774
00:36:02,799 --> 00:36:05,799
through providing direction to Elijah.

775
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:07,440
Elijah, I know the brook dried up.

776
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,320
I'm aware of that.

777
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,600
I knew it would happen.

778
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:12,700
Get me to Zarephath.

779
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:18,679
I've commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.

780
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,760
100-mile journey for a marked man

781
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,100
to the city that was the home of Jezebel,

782
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,059
the center of Baal worship.

783
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:35,019
And Elijah made it safely and dwelled there safely

784
00:36:35,019 --> 00:36:36,420
because God took care of him.

785
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,859
And then God supernaturally provided

786
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:41,820
not only for Elijah, but for the widow woman

787
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,299
and for her house, her son.

788
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:49,579
And the Bible tells us that the meal wasted not,

789
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,579
neither did the cruise of oil fail

790
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:55,579
according to the word of the Lord,

791
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:58,500
which he spake by Elijah.

792
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,140
Our God is able.

793
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,220
This morning, I don't know exactly what everyone's dealing.

794
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,140
We've got some visitors here.

795
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,339
I don't even know who you are.

796
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:07,899
Just met you a few moments ago.

797
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,739
But I know that man who is born a woman

798
00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:13,579
is a few days and full of trouble.

799
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,500
We have burdens.

800
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:20,220
We have concerns and cares.

801
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,540
And our great God says,

802
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:27,540
"'Casting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.'"

803
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:34,019
The life of Elijah so clearly demonstrates for us

804
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:36,579
God's care for his people.

805
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:39,179
And I hope this morning we'd be encouraged.

806
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:43,660
I hope this morning that we would cast our burden

807
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,420
unto the Lord, knowing that he'll sustain us.

808
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,480
He's promised to do so.

809
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,040
We have a great God.

810
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,119
He says to Elijah, "'Get thee to Zarephath.'"

811
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,519
And he proved his power.

812
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:58,640
What a great God we serve.

813
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,480
Let's pray.

814
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,559
Father, we love you.

815
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:02,220
Thank you for loving us.

816
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,239
Thank you for the life of Elijah,

817
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:10,720
the opportunity we have to study,

818
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,239
to be challenged by,

819
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:20,279
to be encouraged with the truth that's contained

820
00:38:20,279 --> 00:38:21,739
in this portion of Scripture.

821
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,959
God, I know that in a crowd of any size,

822
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,960
there are burdens, cares, concerns.

823
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:39,159
God, I pray that you would help each one

824
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:42,760
that's here this morning to know that you are a great God

825
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,159
and that you care about them.

826
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:46,239
You'll sustain them.

827
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,440
You gave us the instruction to cast our cares upon you.

828
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:52,799
I pray that we'd obey you.

829
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:56,080
God, we know the greatest need

830
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,799
for any individual's salvation.

831
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,239
There's one present here this morning

832
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:01,679
or one that's tuned in via live stream

833
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:02,940
that's not sure of heaven.

834
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,080
I pray that today, Lord, that the Holy Spirit of God

835
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,320
would convict them of their sin,

836
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,820
of Christ's righteousness and of judgment to come.

837
00:39:13,179 --> 00:39:16,859
And understand that they're a sinner in need of a Savior.

838
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:18,460
And Jesus Christ is the only Savior.

839
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,900
He bled and died, was buried, and rose again

840
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,780
to pay for their sin so they could be redeemed,

841
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,580
ransomed, reconciled.

842
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:30,460
What a wonderful Savior.

843
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:35,419
Lord, if someone needs to be saved today,

844
00:39:35,419 --> 00:39:36,659
I pray that you'd work and move.

845
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:38,619
Today is the day of salvation.

846
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,900
I pray there would not be delay.

847
00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:44,820
I pray there would not be delay, would not be put off.

848
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,179
No man knoweth what a day may bring forth.

849
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,099
God, I pray for every child of God.

850
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:53,320
Would you help us to trust you?

851
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,380
God, you've given us so many promises,

852
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,979
even as you gave Elijah this promise

853
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:59,299
here in this portion of Scripture.

854
00:39:59,299 --> 00:40:01,099
I pray that we'd respond as he did.

855
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:08,499
He did with obedience and with faith so you do what only you could do. I pray that in

856
00:40:08,499 --> 00:40:11,779
this few moments of invitation that you have your will and way that you move and work and

857
00:40:11,779 --> 00:40:15,899
hearts and lives as only you can. Well thank you for every decision that's made for it's

858
00:40:15,899 --> 00:40:17,699
in Christ's name we pray.
