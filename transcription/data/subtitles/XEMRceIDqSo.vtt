00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
17, 1 Kings chapter number 17.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.739
And last week was a message that I preached

00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:09.720
on the only hope for America is Jesus.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.439
And it was the, of course, 4th of July weekend,

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:15.239
4th of July being on Tuesday, and preached that message.

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.159
But two weeks ago, we started to examine

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:20.840
God's care for his children.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.120
And of course, this year, our theme,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.600
great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.959
You see the banners, we've had it all over the place

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:30.680
trying to get us in that understanding.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.819
Psalm 48, we sing as our theme song.

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:37.439
Each service to remind us that our God is so great

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:41.400
and his greatness is known, but yet the Bible tells us

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.720
that his greatness is unsearchable.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.479
And there's no contradiction in those statements.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:50.279
The reality is that as much as you or I could understand

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:53.659
about how great God is, he's still greater.

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:56.200
And that ought to encourage us this morning

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.900
to know that we serve a great God.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.680
He is the living God, and he's able to exceeding

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.239
abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.819
We've looked at a number of things this year

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:10.400
that have helped us to discover the greatness of God.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.160
We started out by saying, we believe that God is great,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.519
but why, what is it about God that would lead us

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:17.919
to say that he's great?

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:20.360
And we've looked at a whole host of things

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.000
as we discover God's greatness in his word.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.019
And then we'll transition here in just another six weeks

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:31.639
or so into the second phase of our message series,

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:34.279
if you will, not only discovering God's greatness,

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:37.919
but then we are to declare God's greatness.

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:40.680
If we know how great he is, it's a wonderful thing

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.839
for us to know that personally, but there's a lost world

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:45.680
that needs to know of our great savior

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.639
and how wonderful he is.

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:50.239
One of the aspects as we began looking a couple of weeks ago

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:52.519
at this portion of scripture in 1 Kings

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:55.360
is dealing with the fact that God's care for his children

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.639
reveals to us how great he is.

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:02.400
We've been using, last message and then again today,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.559
we'll be using the events here in the life of Elijah.

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:08.360
I believe that these events are recorded for us

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.360
so clearly revealed to us God's care for his people.

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:17.399
I believe this morning as we truly grasp the truth

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:21.279
regarding God's care, it'll lead us to understand

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.720
a greater aspect of God's greatness.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.559
Why do I say that?

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:30.000
Well, God tells us this in 1 Peter 5 in verse number seven,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.320
casting all your care upon him, why?

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.479
For he careth for you.

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:37.520
We understand this morning that that promise,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.600
that truth that is given to us in 1 Peter 5

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.360
in verse number seven is a promise, a truth

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.880
that is given to every believer globally.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.080
And I begin to think about that and I begin to think

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.039
about our interactions one with another

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:52.720
and an individual's ability to be able to care

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.440
for someone else and the reality this morning

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.320
is that my ability to care for you,

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.000
your ability to care for me,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.119
your ability to care for one another is limited.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.039
But God's ability to care for every single one of us

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:11.119
just in this room, then to think about

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:15.759
all of the believers globally causes us to understand

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:18.960
just how great our God is.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.960
That he cares about every aspect of your life and my life.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.119
He is intimately involved and aware

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:28.520
of what's going on in your lives.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.000
We looked at in our last message the fact

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.639
that he tells us that we're of greater care

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:38.080
or we're of greater value than the ravens, than the birds.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.880
And he tells us that the very hairs of our head

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.720
are numbered and he knows everything about us.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.440
He is a personal God.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.000
And for that we ought to rejoice.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.880
It's wonderful to know that he is the Lord God omnipotent.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.240
He rules and he reigns, but he's my God personally

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.399
and he cares about me and he cares about you.

00:03:57.399 --> 00:04:00.440
We find that as we began studying in 1 Kings chapter 17,

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.199
we find that God's care was given, was evidence to us

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:06.479
as we look at the interactions with Elijah

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.360
as God would give him direction to go to the brook Cherith.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.839
And we understand that God said it was there

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:16.679
at that place specifically where God had commanded

00:04:16.679 --> 00:04:18.959
the ravens to feed him there.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.640
And I said this, I said the ravens are more interested

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.359
typically in stealing your lunch than in bringing you lunch.

00:04:25.359 --> 00:04:27.239
And we see that, we understand that,

00:04:27.239 --> 00:04:29.239
but God is the creator.

00:04:29.239 --> 00:04:32.959
He said, I'm going to allow the brook

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:36.079
to sustain you with water and I'm gonna command

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:38.959
the ravens to bring you food.

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:42.119
And the Bible tells us that Elijah obeyed the Lord

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:44.480
and he went and he dwelt there and the ravens brought him

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.519
bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh

00:04:47.359 --> 00:04:50.079
in the evening and he drank of the brook.

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:53.559
What a wonderful provision that God made demonstrating

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:58.559
to us, revealing to us the care that God has for his people.

00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:01.600
We find that the Bible tells us there in verse number seven

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.279
that the brook dried up.

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:06.079
By the way, we will, it's important to understand

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:09.160
that that truth did not surprise God.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.839
God knew, remember it was God that said

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:13.959
that there'd be no rain.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.399
He gave Elijah the responsibility of taking that message

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:20.320
to King Ahab, but we find that here,

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.399
as we see the condition of the brook drying up,

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:27.359
that God then speaks to Elijah again in verse number eight,

00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:31.640
thus demonstrating even further truth to us

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.239
with regard to his care for his people.

00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:37.279
Notice in verse number eight of 1 Kings 17,

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:39.079
the Bible says this, and the word of the Lord

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:43.799
came unto him saying, arise,

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.799
get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon,

00:05:47.799 --> 00:05:49.399
and dwell there.

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:50.440
Listen to what he says.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.440
Behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:58.000
Many of us this morning are familiar with the passage

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.679
of scripture before us, 1 Kings 17.

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:02.160
We're familiar with this passage,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.920
we're familiar with what takes place,

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.079
but I hope this morning that as we take a fresh approach

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:10.359
at this portion of scripture that we'd be encouraged

00:06:10.359 --> 00:06:13.239
to know of God's care for us personally

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:17.480
and to understand how God cares about us as individuals,

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.200
and I hope that it would encourage us this morning.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.239
I want you to notice I've titled the message this morning

00:06:22.239 --> 00:06:25.480
there from verse number nine, get thee to Zarephath.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.720
Number one, if you're taking notes,

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.600
I want you to note God's plan.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.980
Understand this with me this morning, God always has a plan.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.519
God always has a plan.

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:35.920
We understand that his plan for the ages

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.980
is revealed to us through the Bible,

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.320
and he's given us his precious word,

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.600
and he has revealed to us the plan for the ages,

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.899
and what God has revealed is going to come to pass,

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:49.339
and we can rest assured of that,

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:51.299
but we can rejoice this morning in knowing

00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:54.559
that God has a plan for our lives individually.

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:55.399
Why?

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:58.239
Because he cares about us, and he has a plan for us,

00:06:58.239 --> 00:07:00.839
and we find that here in verse number nine

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:03.500
of our text of scripture that once again,

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.040
God provides clear direction to Elijah.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.040
He gives him the direction to go to a particular place,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.600
and then tells him that in that place of Zarephath,

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.839
that he's commanded a widow woman there to sustain him,

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:22.040
and I want you to understand here just for a moment

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.160
that as we look at the geography of what's taking place,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.320
and we see where Elijah is,

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.679
remember he's at the Brook Cherith,

00:07:30.679 --> 00:07:34.440
and the Bible tells us that it's before Jordan,

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.399
and so if you were to look at what's taking place

00:07:37.079 --> 00:07:39.040
from a geographical perspective,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.399
you find that Elijah is here at the east side of the Jordan

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:45.119
in a place called Cherith,

00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:46.480
and he's there at that place,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.239
and God has miraculously sustained him,

00:07:49.239 --> 00:07:53.920
and now God is telling him to go to Zarephath.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.519
Now, Zarephath is on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.

00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:01.660
The geography would help us understand

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.359
that this distance between Zarephath and Cherith

00:08:05.359 --> 00:08:08.079
is approximately 100 miles.

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:09.760
That's a long distance.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.859
Today, we don't think much about traveling 100 miles

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:14.559
with our modern conveniences,

00:08:14.559 --> 00:08:16.880
and transportation, and what have you,

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.119
but I want you to understand that in Elijah's day

00:08:19.119 --> 00:08:20.519
to travel 100 miles,

00:08:20.519 --> 00:08:22.839
especially across the Judean wilderness,

00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:25.839
and all of that is a very difficult journey,

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.440
and we begin to think about this journey,

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.200
and we see what's taking place,

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.159
and we also understand that this journey

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.000
would be a long journey,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.820
but I want you to understand this morning

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.900
that Elijah was a marked man.

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.559
Elijah was a man that stood before King Ahab,

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:44.200
and we mentioned briefly in our last message

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.599
that King Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel

00:08:47.599 --> 00:08:50.239
to anger than all the kings that went before him,

00:08:50.239 --> 00:08:53.559
and here, Ahab is the king, this wicked man.

00:08:53.559 --> 00:08:55.280
Jezebel is his wife,

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.000
and here, Elijah stands before him

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.640
and announces the judgment of God.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.919
So how does Ahab refer to Elijah?

00:09:05.919 --> 00:09:09.080
As he that troubleth Israel.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.840
It's Elijah's fault that we don't have any rain.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.200
It's Elijah's fault that we have this drought.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.340
It's Elijah's fault that we have no water,

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.599
and no food, and all of this.

00:09:19.599 --> 00:09:20.520
It's Elijah's fault.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.619
He's the one that troubles Israel,

00:09:24.619 --> 00:09:27.520
but the reality is that it was not Elijah

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.200
that troubled Israel.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.280
It was the wickedness of the people of God.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.880
It was their idolatrous worship.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.599
It was their turning their back to God

00:09:37.599 --> 00:09:41.960
that resulted in the judgment of God coming upon them,

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.840
and I want you to look in chapter 18 just for a moment,

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.380
and I want you to see this morning

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.340
that Elijah was a marked man.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:53.340
Not only that Ahab, but also Jezebel wanted Elijah dead.

00:09:54.119 --> 00:09:56.479
Notice what the Bible tells us in 1 Kings 18,

00:09:56.479 --> 00:09:57.760
in verse number four.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.359
The Bible says this, and this is the.

00:10:00.359 --> 00:10:03.519
there with Obadiah, but it says in verse number four,

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:08.079
for it was so when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord

00:10:08.079 --> 00:10:10.239
that Obadiah took in a hundred prophets

00:10:10.239 --> 00:10:12.119
and hid them by fifty in a cave

00:10:12.119 --> 00:10:14.679
and fed them with bread and water.

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:17.199
So why did Jezebel do this?

00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:19.799
Why is it that she killed the prophets of the Lord

00:10:19.799 --> 00:10:23.179
and Obadiah interceded and helped to protect

00:10:23.179 --> 00:10:27.119
and sustain these prophets of the Lord, a hundred of them?

00:10:27.119 --> 00:10:29.719
We see also in verse number 13 that it says this,

00:10:29.719 --> 00:10:31.639
was it not told my Lord what I did

00:10:31.639 --> 00:10:34.239
when Jezebel slew the prophets of the Lord,

00:10:34.239 --> 00:10:36.599
how I hid in a hundred men of the Lord's prophets

00:10:36.599 --> 00:10:39.859
by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water?

00:10:39.859 --> 00:10:42.859
And so why is Obadiah rehearsing this to Elijah?

00:10:42.859 --> 00:10:45.279
Because Elijah comes to Obadiah and says,

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:47.319
go tell Ahab that I'm here.

00:10:47.319 --> 00:10:49.259
Now Obadiah is a little bit fearful of that

00:10:49.259 --> 00:10:50.959
because he says you're gonna disappear

00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:53.079
and then it's gonna be problematic for me.

00:10:53.079 --> 00:10:54.899
That's Obadiah's perspective.

00:10:54.899 --> 00:10:56.759
Why does Obadiah have that perspective?

00:10:56.759 --> 00:10:58.559
Well, look at verse number 10

00:10:58.599 --> 00:11:00.119
here in First Kings chapter 18.

00:11:00.119 --> 00:11:01.679
Notice what the Bible says.

00:11:02.919 --> 00:11:07.399
As the Lord thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:11.239
whither my Lord hath not sent to seek, who?

00:11:11.239 --> 00:11:12.079
Thee.

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:12.999
Who's he talking about?

00:11:12.999 --> 00:11:14.479
Elijah.

00:11:14.479 --> 00:11:15.799
There's no, look at what he says.

00:11:15.799 --> 00:11:17.119
I mean, notice carefully.

00:11:17.119 --> 00:11:20.159
There is no nation or kingdom

00:11:20.159 --> 00:11:23.159
whither my Lord hath not sent to seek thee.

00:11:23.159 --> 00:11:25.359
And when they said he is not there,

00:11:25.359 --> 00:11:28.279
he took an oath of the kingdom and nation

00:11:28.999 --> 00:11:31.479
that they found thee not.

00:11:31.479 --> 00:11:32.519
He was a marked man.

00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:38.239
Why would Ahab and Jezebel go through great lengths,

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:42.599
these kind of lengths, to try to find Elijah?

00:11:42.599 --> 00:11:44.279
They wanted to kill him.

00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:46.479
They thought if we could get rid of this guy Elijah.

00:11:46.479 --> 00:11:48.099
I mean, they slay all these other prophets

00:11:48.099 --> 00:11:49.719
and they wanna get rid of Elijah

00:11:49.719 --> 00:11:51.979
because of the announcement of judgment,

00:11:51.979 --> 00:11:53.639
because of the experience that they have.

00:11:53.639 --> 00:11:56.519
And we don't know exactly the total amount of time

00:11:56.519 --> 00:11:59.479
that takes place between Elijah being at the Brook Cherith

00:11:59.479 --> 00:12:01.359
and then Elijah receiving this information

00:12:01.359 --> 00:12:02.439
to go to Zarephath.

00:12:02.439 --> 00:12:04.419
But whatever the period of time is,

00:12:04.419 --> 00:12:06.159
we know that it's three years

00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:09.259
before he appears to Obadiah in chapter number 18.

00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:11.359
But we find that during this time,

00:12:11.359 --> 00:12:13.119
now understand with me,

00:12:13.119 --> 00:12:15.719
Elijah's gonna take a hundred mile journey

00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:19.999
as a marked man.

00:12:21.219 --> 00:12:22.479
Now think about that.

00:12:22.479 --> 00:12:24.159
As we think about God's plan,

00:12:24.159 --> 00:12:25.559
and we consider this morning,

00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:27.439
the care of God is revealed to us

00:12:27.439 --> 00:12:30.199
through God providing direction for his children.

00:12:30.199 --> 00:12:33.479
And again, I'm thankful, as I mentioned two weeks ago,

00:12:33.479 --> 00:12:35.779
that God continues to provide us

00:12:35.779 --> 00:12:37.859
as his people with clear direction.

00:12:37.859 --> 00:12:40.199
I'm thankful that I can seek the face of God

00:12:40.199 --> 00:12:42.479
and I can ask him to provide me with leadership

00:12:42.479 --> 00:12:44.079
and with direction in my life.

00:12:44.079 --> 00:12:47.519
And we can find that God will guide us

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:48.599
and he will lead us.

00:12:48.599 --> 00:12:51.879
And we find here as we look at this passage of scripture

00:12:51.879 --> 00:12:54.559
that not only is God's care revealed

00:12:54.559 --> 00:12:57.799
through God giving this clear direction,

00:12:57.799 --> 00:13:01.679
but as we understand the journey that is before Elijah,

00:13:01.679 --> 00:13:04.239
we understand here in this text of scripture

00:13:04.239 --> 00:13:08.399
that God would supernaturally protect his child,

00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:11.919
thus giving us further insight

00:13:11.919 --> 00:13:14.139
with regard to the care of our God.

00:13:15.399 --> 00:13:16.519
It's a long journey.

00:13:18.179 --> 00:13:21.479
Could God have sustained Elijah somewhere closer?

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:24.639
Sure he could have.

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:27.479
God can do anything, right?

00:13:29.759 --> 00:13:34.759
But God chose to send his servant to Zarephath,

00:13:35.959 --> 00:13:37.139
100 miles away.

00:13:38.299 --> 00:13:40.839
And in this plan, God gives him a promise,

00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:42.639
we'll note that in just a moment,

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:45.959
but we find that in this plan, there would be this journey.

00:13:46.919 --> 00:13:48.019
And guess what happens?

00:13:48.019 --> 00:13:50.599
Elijah ends up in Zarephath.

00:13:50.599 --> 00:13:51.919
Even though he's a marked man,

00:13:51.919 --> 00:13:53.419
even though there's a long journey,

00:13:53.419 --> 00:13:56.439
there are plenty of perils that could come his way.

00:13:56.439 --> 00:13:58.839
But God is protecting.

00:13:58.839 --> 00:14:00.719
We know God's plan.

00:14:00.719 --> 00:14:03.719
Number two this morning, we consider God's promise.

00:14:03.719 --> 00:14:05.119
As we noted in verse number nine,

00:14:05.119 --> 00:14:07.239
that God gave him the instruction,

00:14:07.239 --> 00:14:10.399
he gave him the clear direction with regard to where to go.

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:12.399
But we notice that this wonderful promise

00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:13.859
is given at the end of verse number nine.

00:14:13.859 --> 00:14:15.199
Notice what the Bible says.

00:14:15.199 --> 00:14:19.359
Behold, I have commanded a widow woman there

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:21.079
to sustain thee.

00:14:21.079 --> 00:14:23.859
Now, this morning, when we think about the promises of God,

00:14:23.859 --> 00:14:26.639
I'm thankful that God's promises are precious,

00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:27.879
and they're certain.

00:14:27.879 --> 00:14:30.019
I'm thankful this morning that we can stand on the promises.

00:14:30.019 --> 00:14:32.159
We didn't sing the song, but many of us are familiar

00:14:32.159 --> 00:14:35.159
with that wonderful hymn, Standing on the Promises.

00:14:35.159 --> 00:14:37.799
And I'm so thankful, as Peter would refer

00:14:37.799 --> 00:14:40.259
to the promises of God as being exceeding great

00:14:40.259 --> 00:14:42.059
and precious promises.

00:14:42.059 --> 00:14:44.839
And we can rejoice this morning that our God

00:14:44.839 --> 00:14:46.739
is not a man that he should lie.

00:14:46.739 --> 00:14:49.619
What God has promised he will bring to pass,

00:14:49.619 --> 00:14:53.239
and we find that here, God says that I've commanded

00:14:53.239 --> 00:14:55.579
a widow woman to sustain thee.

00:14:55.579 --> 00:14:56.979
Now, I want you to think about Elijah,

00:14:56.979 --> 00:14:59.719
and I want you to consider the events in his life.

00:14:59.719 --> 00:15:01.899
First, God tells him to go to a brook, Cherith,

00:15:01.899 --> 00:15:04.599
and he's commanded the ravens to sustain him.

00:15:05.539 --> 00:15:07.659
Now he says, go to Zarephath, and I've commanded

00:15:07.659 --> 00:15:10.699
a widow woman to sustain thee.

00:15:10.699 --> 00:15:14.099
Now, typically speaking, it would be that widows

00:15:14.099 --> 00:15:15.539
were to be cared for.

00:15:17.259 --> 00:15:19.079
Widows were to be cared for.

00:15:19.939 --> 00:15:24.059
But yet, God says, I'm going to use this widow woman

00:15:24.059 --> 00:15:28.419
to sustain thee, Elijah, to sustain thee.

00:15:28.419 --> 00:15:30.819
As we begin to think about this truth,

00:15:30.819 --> 00:15:33.579
this promise that God gives, we find that God

00:15:33.579 --> 00:15:36.919
has given to you and to me many promises in his word,

00:15:36.919 --> 00:15:40.179
and we rejoice in those promises, and we find

00:15:40.179 --> 00:15:43.099
that some of those promises are conditional promises,

00:15:43.099 --> 00:15:46.139
and some promises are unconditional promises.

00:15:46.539 --> 00:15:48.699
And as we begin to think about the two aspects

00:15:48.699 --> 00:15:51.299
of the promises that God has given us in his word,

00:15:51.299 --> 00:15:53.179
we can think of an unconditional promise,

00:15:53.179 --> 00:15:55.379
one that's very simple for us to relate to,

00:15:55.379 --> 00:15:57.459
is the promise that Jesus made when he said,

00:15:57.459 --> 00:15:59.419
I will come again.

00:15:59.419 --> 00:16:01.500
That has nothing to do with any conditions

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.139
that any of us have to meet.

00:16:04.059 --> 00:16:06.099
He's going to come at the appointed time.

00:16:06.099 --> 00:16:08.819
He's gonna come right on time, and there's going

00:16:08.819 --> 00:16:12.239
to be no delay, and we understand that he will come.

00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:14.339
Just as he came the first time, when the fullness

00:16:14.379 --> 00:16:17.139
of time was come, God sent forth his son,

00:16:17.139 --> 00:16:19.259
according to the book of Galatians, for the purpose

00:16:19.259 --> 00:16:21.099
of redeeming them that were under the law,

00:16:21.099 --> 00:16:24.500
and I'm so thankful that Jesus came the first time,

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.299
but oh, what a wonderful Bible truth

00:16:26.299 --> 00:16:28.679
that he's coming a second time, and when he comes,

00:16:28.679 --> 00:16:31.179
listen, he says, I will come again.

00:16:32.619 --> 00:16:34.699
That's an unconditional promise.

00:16:36.419 --> 00:16:38.299
As we look at the word of God, we find that there

00:16:38.299 --> 00:16:42.219
are many times that God gives us conditional promises.

00:16:42.219 --> 00:16:45.859
Many times, those conditional promises can be easily seen

00:16:45.859 --> 00:16:49.379
in the scriptures, where the Bible says, if then,

00:16:49.379 --> 00:16:51.179
and there are these if then promises,

00:16:51.179 --> 00:16:53.339
these conditional promises, if you do this,

00:16:53.339 --> 00:16:55.619
then God says he's going to do this,

00:16:55.619 --> 00:16:57.859
and we find here in this text of scripture,

00:16:57.859 --> 00:17:00.419
both promises that were given, the one about going

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:02.299
to the book of Cherith, and then even here,

00:17:02.299 --> 00:17:03.699
the one that's before us this morning,

00:17:03.699 --> 00:17:06.339
with this man, Elijah, going to Zarephath,

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:08.379
this is a conditional promise, why?

00:17:08.379 --> 00:17:10.579
Because he had to go.

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:13.179
He had to go to that place, he had to obey the Lord.

00:17:14.179 --> 00:17:16.979
We find that, as I mentioned last week,

00:17:16.979 --> 00:17:19.019
or two weeks ago, in verse number four,

00:17:19.019 --> 00:17:20.699
at the end of the verses, I have commanded

00:17:20.699 --> 00:17:23.739
the ravens to feed thee there.

00:17:24.899 --> 00:17:27.139
Every word of God is pure.

00:17:28.299 --> 00:17:32.819
Not one jot or one tittle is going to pass away,

00:17:32.819 --> 00:17:35.859
and we find that God, he did not say,

00:17:35.859 --> 00:17:38.019
I've commanded the ravens to feed thee,

00:17:38.019 --> 00:17:41.019
he says, I've commanded the ravens to feed thee there.

00:17:42.259 --> 00:17:47.259
Here, we find that he tells them to go to Zarephath,

00:17:47.579 --> 00:17:49.339
which is a city that belongeth to Zidon,

00:17:49.339 --> 00:17:53.699
and dwell there, behold, I have commanded a widow woman

00:17:53.699 --> 00:17:58.500
there to sustain thee, there.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.319
Now, it's interesting, not only to note the distance

00:18:01.319 --> 00:18:04.339
between Cherith and Zarephath, but it's also interesting

00:18:04.339 --> 00:18:07.699
to note that Zarephath was a city that was the home

00:18:08.339 --> 00:18:11.939
of Jezebel, in the center of Baal worship.

00:18:13.899 --> 00:18:15.339
I mean, when we understand these things,

00:18:15.339 --> 00:18:17.979
it begins to elevate in our minds,

00:18:17.979 --> 00:18:20.079
God, are you sure you want me to go there?

00:18:20.979 --> 00:18:23.500
We don't see Elijah asking that question.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.939
See, sometimes we ask questions like that.

00:18:27.079 --> 00:18:30.779
But God gave clear direction, there was no hesitation

00:18:30.779 --> 00:18:34.099
on God's part, there was no problem with God

00:18:34.099 --> 00:18:38.059
communicating effectively to Elijah where he was to go,

00:18:38.059 --> 00:18:42.320
it was Elijah's duty to simply obey what God said.

00:18:43.339 --> 00:18:46.659
We find that the Bible tells us, even though the journey

00:18:46.659 --> 00:18:48.859
would be long, and it would be difficult,

00:18:48.859 --> 00:18:51.700
and perhaps met with, from a human perspective,

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.619
many perils, we find that the city was a city

00:18:54.619 --> 00:18:57.459
that was an idolatrous city that was the home of Jezebel,

00:18:57.459 --> 00:19:00.579
but we find that the Bible tells us in verse number 10,

00:19:00.579 --> 00:19:05.299
so he arose and went to Zarephath.

00:19:06.299 --> 00:19:11.299
I am challenged by the immediate obedience of Elijah.

00:19:13.559 --> 00:19:16.539
As I begin to consider, even as we had our lesson

00:19:16.539 --> 00:19:18.859
in Sunday school this morning with the children of Israel

00:19:18.859 --> 00:19:21.519
responding to the message that Samuel delivered,

00:19:21.519 --> 00:19:24.579
a simple message in 1 Samuel chapter number seven,

00:19:24.579 --> 00:19:26.380
that they immediately responded,

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.419
there was no need for delay, and we find that here

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:32.380
in this text of scripture that Elijah's behavior

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:36.880
is demonstrated by his immediate obedience.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.579
Notice it says that he went to Zarephath.

00:19:40.599 --> 00:19:42.899
When he came to the gate of the city,

00:19:42.899 --> 00:19:44.419
notice the Bible says that the widow woman

00:19:44.419 --> 00:19:47.260
was there gathering of sticks, and he called to her

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.739
and said, fetch me, I pray thee, a little water

00:19:49.739 --> 00:19:52.179
and a vessel that I may drink.

00:19:53.099 --> 00:19:56.979
So he, initially upon arriving to the city of Zarephath,

00:19:56.979 --> 00:19:59.099
the widow woman that God has commanded to sustain him

00:19:59.099 --> 00:20:01.380
was there, and she's gathering.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.520
and here comes the man of God, Elijah,

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.960
into the city that God told him to go to.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.840
God had given him that promise,

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.720
and he responds in obedience,

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.720
and as he goes there, the Bible says

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.840
that he says to this widow woman

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.240
that's gathering these sticks,

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.800
fetch me, I pray thee, a little water

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.560
and a vessel that I may drink.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.320
What does she do?

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.480
It says in verse number 11,

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.120
as she was going to fetch it,

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.700
so she's going to go get a drink for Elijah,

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.460
that he then calls to her and says,

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.780
fetch me, I pray thee, excuse me,

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.260
in verse number 11, bring me, I pray thee,

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.660
a morsel of bread in thine hand.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.260
You know, not only am I thirsty,

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.060
but I'm kind of hungry as well.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.420
Bring me something to drink,

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.080
but also bring me something to eat.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.340
And we find that the response of the widow woman

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.220
is given to us in verse number 12,

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.320
and insight is provided with regard

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.560
to her situation, her condition,

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.140
and she says this,

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.440
as the Lord thy God liveth,

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.360
I have not a cake,

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.960
but a handful of meal in a barrel,

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.280
and a little oil in a cruise.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.880
Behold, I'm gathering two sticks

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.300
that I may go in and dress it for me and my son,

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.960
that we may eat it and die.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.120
God told Elijah that this widow woman

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.240
was gonna sustain him.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.520
And he arrives, and the widow woman says,

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.560
yeah, I'll go get you some water,

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.160
and he says, you know, give me something to eat as well.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.600
She says, let me explain something to you,

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.280
as the Lord thy God liveth,

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.820
I don't have but a handful of meal,

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.840
just a little bit of oil.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.360
And my plan is actually for my son and I

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.920
to have this little meal,

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.640
and we're gonna eat it and we're gonna die.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.920
Can you see the condition,

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.720
the situation of this woman, this widow woman?

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.340
And we find that Elijah responds to her,

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.900
and he says these words, fear not.

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:11.580
See, Elijah had a promise from God.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:12.860
What was that promise from God?

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.400
That promise was,

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:19.400
I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:23.360
And by the way, as he speaks to the widow woman,

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.260
we get further insight because the Bible says

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.059
that the meal shall not waste,

00:22:28.059 --> 00:22:29.600
neither shall the crucible fail

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.000
until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth.

00:22:34.419 --> 00:22:37.820
This was really the final stop for Elijah

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.960
during this drought season.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.980
God moved him from the brook Cherith to Zarephath,

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.980
but it was in that place that God was gonna sustain him

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.100
until God sent rain.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.059
And no one knew when that day would be.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.360
But Elijah had a promise from God.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.940
By the way, God is the one that sends the rain.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.240
God is the one that's in control of all things.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.880
And we find that as the creator God and the sustainer God,

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.980
that he is the one that was able to keep,

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.960
to prevent the rains from coming,

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.720
but he too would be the one that would send the rain.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.600
And we find that Elijah has this promise,

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.660
and even though he hears the situation

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.000
as it's explained by this widow woman,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.800
he says to her in verse number 13,

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.419
fear not, but notice what he says,

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.600
go and do as thou hast said,

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:37.120
but make me thereof a little cake first,

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.000
and bring it unto me,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.040
and after make for thee and for thy son.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.559
Little selfish there Elijah, aren't you?

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:49.200
No, no, he's just trusting God.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.960
He's just proving God.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.600
He's got a promise.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.559
The promise is that this widow woman

00:23:56.559 --> 00:23:58.200
is gonna sustain thee.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.600
And here we find that the Bible says

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.480
that he responds to her,

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.680
and he then says, here's what God has said,

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.040
for thus saith the Lord God of Israel,

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:13.000
verse number 14, the barrel of meal shall not waste,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.480
neither shall the cruise of oil fail

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.459
until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth.

00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:22.660
How's God gonna do that?

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:23.500
God can.

00:24:24.459 --> 00:24:25.480
God can.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.899
Sometimes we get so, and if you have

00:24:28.899 --> 00:24:31.020
that analytical mind like I do,

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.480
sometimes that messes us up with faith.

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:38.399
Why, because we like to trust in our own understanding.

00:24:38.399 --> 00:24:40.380
But God says that we're not to lean

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:41.339
on our own understanding,

00:24:41.339 --> 00:24:45.140
we're to trust in the Lord completely, fully, wholly.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.920
And we find that here, Elijah has a promise

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:53.839
from God Almighty, the Lord God, creator God.

00:24:53.839 --> 00:24:58.040
God gave a promise, and Elijah was holding to that promise.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.080
Listen, this morning, when you have a promise from God,

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.360
it reveals to us that God cares about us,

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.000
and he'd give us promises, and we know this morning

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.239
that God will always fulfill the promises that he's given.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.380
No doubt in your life, and in my life,

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:16.160
there's been someone that has broken a promise

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.720
that they made to us.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.779
No doubt in your life, and in my life,

00:25:19.779 --> 00:25:22.279
there's been a time that we've given a promise

00:25:22.279 --> 00:25:26.480
to someone that we could not fulfill, we could not uphold.

00:25:27.399 --> 00:25:29.080
That'll never happen with God.

00:25:29.959 --> 00:25:31.520
It'll never happen with God.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.959
God said, go to that place, and I've commanded

00:25:36.959 --> 00:25:38.920
a widow woman to sustain thee there.

00:25:39.779 --> 00:25:43.380
And Elijah just believed God, just simple faith.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.179
We could look at Elijah and say, what a great man of faith,

00:25:46.179 --> 00:25:48.300
and you may have that perspective.

00:25:50.059 --> 00:25:51.779
And I'm not telling you that that perspective is wrong,

00:25:51.779 --> 00:25:53.459
but I understand this morning that it's simply

00:25:53.459 --> 00:25:54.899
taking God at his word.

00:25:54.899 --> 00:25:59.179
Listen, we have a big God, we have a God of the impossible.

00:25:59.179 --> 00:26:02.179
He's able to do exceeding, abundantly above

00:26:02.179 --> 00:26:04.660
all that we ask or think, according to Ephesians 3

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.459
and verse number 20.

00:26:06.459 --> 00:26:10.239
And so often in our lives, we may not prove God

00:26:10.239 --> 00:26:13.679
because we're not taking those promises that he's given us.

00:26:13.679 --> 00:26:15.179
You know, sometimes in our prayer life,

00:26:15.179 --> 00:26:19.459
it'd be important for us to pray back some promises to God.

00:26:19.459 --> 00:26:21.320
God, you promised that you would,

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.140
and I'm going to obey you based upon the promise

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:27.239
that you gave me.

00:26:27.239 --> 00:26:29.959
And God, I'm trusting you, and I'm proving you, God,

00:26:29.959 --> 00:26:33.300
that you're gonna do what you said you were gonna do.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.040
As I take this step of obedience,

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.339
as I'm putting faith in your word,

00:26:37.339 --> 00:26:40.580
and I'm believing you, Lord, to do what you said

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:41.500
you would do.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.339
And Elijah exercised faith.

00:26:45.339 --> 00:26:50.100
He communicates to this widow woman the promise of God.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:55.100
He gives her this truth that the meal would waste not,

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.059
and the cruise of oil would not fail.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.260
It does not seem, as you look at the text of Scripture,

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.899
that there's any further discussion,

00:27:01.899 --> 00:27:06.399
that there's any just, you know, interest from her

00:27:06.399 --> 00:27:08.880
with regard to how's that going to happen.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:16.239
He gave the promise, God did, to Elijah.

00:27:16.239 --> 00:27:19.820
Elijah held firm to that promise,

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.660
and then communicated that promise to the widow woman.

00:27:23.839 --> 00:27:26.380
No matter, as we look at this passive Scripture,

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.980
we see how no matter what's going on,

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.760
no matter what our minds might wanna believe,

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.660
we must believe what God has said in his word.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.140
We must take God at his word.

00:27:41.119 --> 00:27:45.440
The just shall live by faith.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.720
The Bible tells us in Hebrews 11, in verse number six,

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:53.559
that but without faith it is impossible to please him.

00:27:53.559 --> 00:27:57.200
For he that cometh to God must believe that he is,

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.119
and that he is a rewarder of them

00:27:59.119 --> 00:28:01.679
that diligently seek him.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.500
Faith is so important in our lives.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.980
Believe God, believe God.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.660
We consider this morning, we note God's plan,

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.540
we consider God's power, excuse me, his promise.

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:17.540
I want you to note number three, God's power.

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:20.000
His plan, his promise, and his power.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.980
As we note in verses 15 and 16,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.320
God's power is clearly demonstrated for us.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.279
We've mentioned in previous messages that God is great

00:28:30.279 --> 00:28:32.440
because of his great power.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:36.119
And here we find that even as he would show his care

00:28:36.119 --> 00:28:40.020
for his servant, that his power is once again displayed.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:43.239
The Bible tells us in verse 15 that she, the widow woman,

00:28:43.239 --> 00:28:46.599
went and did according to the saying of Elijah.

00:28:46.599 --> 00:28:48.720
So she obeyed what Elijah said.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:53.400
Elijah had such conviction in communicating the promise

00:28:53.739 --> 00:28:56.739
of God that he had received to this widow woman

00:28:56.739 --> 00:28:59.059
that she too believed.

00:28:59.059 --> 00:29:02.020
And she acts in obedience to what Elijah

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.419
has communicated to her.

00:29:03.419 --> 00:29:08.260
And it says this, and she and he and her house did eat,

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:11.619
notice it says, many days.

00:29:11.619 --> 00:29:13.099
I don't know how long many days.

00:29:13.099 --> 00:29:15.059
I don't know, it doesn't tell us.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.979
We know that between Brook, Cherith, and Zarephath

00:29:18.979 --> 00:29:22.900
is about three years, according to chapter 18.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.599
But here, we don't know exactly the number of days,

00:29:26.599 --> 00:29:29.539
but I want you to understand that she thought

00:29:29.539 --> 00:29:32.640
on that morning, that day that she met Elijah

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.919
when he entered into the city,

00:29:33.919 --> 00:29:36.080
she thought that was her last day.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.239
We're gonna eat this and we're gonna die.

00:29:39.239 --> 00:29:40.340
That's the plan.

00:29:41.679 --> 00:29:45.679
And the Bible tells us that they did eat many days.

00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:47.280
Notice what it says in verse 16.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.440
Can you imagine?

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:54.099
It says in the barrel of meal, wasted not.

00:29:54.099 --> 00:29:55.799
I got that underlined in my Bible.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.500
Neither did the cruise of oil fail.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:00.500
Got that underlined.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:05.199
Notice what it says, according to the word of the Lord,

00:30:05.199 --> 00:30:08.600
which he spake by Elijah.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:12.239
I want you to think about the behavior

00:30:12.239 --> 00:30:14.319
over these many days, this period of time.

00:30:14.319 --> 00:30:17.520
Again, I don't know the amount of time,

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.120
but I want you to consider with me the routine,

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.299
the behavior.

00:30:21.299 --> 00:30:22.639
I want you to think about this widow woman

00:30:22.639 --> 00:30:26.399
as she would go and as she would have the opportunity

00:30:26.399 --> 00:30:28.000
to make the food, to prepare it,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.420
she would go to where she kept that meal.

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:35.419
Now she knew what she had in the beginning, right?

00:30:35.419 --> 00:30:37.599
There's no question what she had in the beginning.

00:30:37.599 --> 00:30:41.560
She said, I have enough for just a little cake,

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:45.020
and my son and I, we're gonna eat it, we're gonna die.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.619
She went back to that thing and she prepared, she made,

00:30:53.459 --> 00:30:57.939
and then the next day, she goes back, and there's more.

00:30:58.779 --> 00:30:59.619
It's there.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.419
Now, you can believe what you wanna believe,

00:31:03.419 --> 00:31:05.419
and if you wanna preach, you can say what you wanna say

00:31:05.419 --> 00:31:08.059
when you're preaching, but I believe

00:31:08.059 --> 00:31:11.279
that God didn't just fill that thing up overflowing.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:13.699
I don't believe that.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.319
I believe that every day, there was enough for the day.

00:31:19.239 --> 00:31:20.480
I believe that.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:26.639
She'd make that, they'd eat, she'd go back,

00:31:26.639 --> 00:31:27.760
and it wasted not.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.400
The oil, it didn't fail.

00:31:31.519 --> 00:31:33.419
God sustained them.

00:31:33.419 --> 00:31:38.419
God provided for them, and we see God's power on display.

00:31:39.319 --> 00:31:43.019
Listen, you can't explain this passage any other way

00:31:43.019 --> 00:31:45.120
but say God did it.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:50.040
There's no human ability that we would have to explain.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.879
How did that not fail?

00:31:52.879 --> 00:31:54.120
How did it not waste?

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.480
I mean, it's totally impossible

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.040
that they could eat for many days.

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:01.080
I mean, was she, no, God did it,

00:32:02.239 --> 00:32:03.319
and I want you to know this morning

00:32:03.319 --> 00:32:07.239
that in your life and in my life, God cares about us,

00:32:07.239 --> 00:32:09.279
and God knows what our needs are.

00:32:09.279 --> 00:32:11.119
God knows what we're dealing with,

00:32:11.119 --> 00:32:13.399
and God's given us some promises,

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.080
and as we claim the promises of God

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.199
and we act in obedience to God,

00:32:19.199 --> 00:32:21.559
we're gonna expect God to work.

00:32:21.559 --> 00:32:24.199
We're gonna expect God to do what he said he would do.

00:32:24.199 --> 00:32:26.320
We're gonna expect God to provide

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.919
as he said he would provide,

00:32:27.919 --> 00:32:30.919
that he would take care of us.

00:32:30.919 --> 00:32:34.119
Listen, we talk about the model prayer

00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:36.720
when Jesus, the disciples say, Lord, teach us to pray,

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.119
and part of that model prayer,

00:32:38.119 --> 00:32:40.000
it's not the Lord's prayer, it's the model prayer.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.279
Part of that model prayer is give us this day

00:32:42.279 --> 00:32:43.460
our daily bread.

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.919
Most of us this morning in this country,

00:32:45.919 --> 00:32:48.360
we've been so blessed that we don't understand

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.759
what it means to pray for daily provision.

00:32:51.759 --> 00:32:52.600
Why?

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.240
We got a cupboard full of stuff,

00:32:55.919 --> 00:32:57.880
and I understand that sometimes we go and we say,

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.919
there's nothing to eat.

00:32:58.919 --> 00:33:00.119
You guys ever do that?

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.360
And if you're the husband and your wife says there's,

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.399
and they start naming things that are available to eat,

00:33:06.399 --> 00:33:08.080
and you're like, well, that's just nothing

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.880
that I really wanna eat right now.

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.639
We got plenty.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.000
I remember when I went to Hope Children's Home

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.559
seven years ago, Holly and I toured that place,

00:33:21.559 --> 00:33:24.880
and they had on the wall in their kitchen

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.679
that they were praying for bacon.

00:33:27.679 --> 00:33:28.559
I like bacon.

00:33:30.139 --> 00:33:31.639
They're praying for bacon.

00:33:31.639 --> 00:33:32.679
And a list of other things,

00:33:32.679 --> 00:33:35.360
and I kinda just kinda inquire.

00:33:36.919 --> 00:33:39.759
Chris was the fellow that took us on a tour.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.320
He pastors in West Virginia now.

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.160
And I remember inquiring about that list of things,

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.039
and bacon was at the top.

00:33:46.039 --> 00:33:47.520
He's like, it's been a really long time

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.619
since we've had bacon.

00:33:49.559 --> 00:33:50.800
The kids really like some bacon,

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.639
and they're praying that we'd be able to get some bacon.

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:58.039
And Ron, I seriously, the thought that I had

00:33:58.039 --> 00:33:59.720
was I've never prayed for bacon.

00:34:01.919 --> 00:34:04.080
You know what I do if I want bacon?

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:04.919
I go get it.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.160
I'm being serious.

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.399
I'm not being prideful, I'm not boasting.

00:34:11.399 --> 00:34:12.800
I'm not independently wealthy,

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.559
but I'm just saying God's taken care of us

00:34:14.559 --> 00:34:16.839
that I just can go and buy bacon.

00:34:16.839 --> 00:34:18.839
And by the way, most of you can as well.

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:21.519
They're praying for bacon.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.279
You know what I did?

00:34:23.279 --> 00:34:24.640
Holly and I got in the car after we took the tour,

00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.480
and we went down to Walmart,

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.200
and I bought a whole cart of bacon.

00:34:28.559 --> 00:34:29.399
I did, man.

00:34:29.399 --> 00:34:30.359
I loaded that thing up.

00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:32.480
People probably thought I was crazy.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.320
Gonna be back in a minute.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.760
People probably thought I was crazy.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.279
Gonna be bad for your heart, your arteries.

00:34:36.279 --> 00:34:38.079
I'm not eating it, I'm just giving it to somebody else.

00:34:38.079 --> 00:34:38.920
Amen?

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.880
And we took that, and a whole host of other things

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.799
are on that list, and just try to be a blessing.

00:34:44.799 --> 00:34:45.959
I want you to understand this morning

00:34:45.959 --> 00:34:48.079
that God said he would take care of us.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.239
He said he would take care of us.

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:53.980
And no matter what the circumstances are in your life,

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.880
no matter what we're facing,

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.940
God is able to take care of his children.

00:34:59.839 --> 00:35:02.779
He is the Almighty God.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:04.440
El Shaddai.

00:35:05.559 --> 00:35:08.399
He made himself known to Abraham in that fashion.

00:35:08.399 --> 00:35:11.079
He said, I am the Lord God Almighty.

00:35:11.079 --> 00:35:13.600
Then he asked, was there anything too hard for me?

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.119
No, nothing's too hard for thee.

00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:18.959
You're the Almighty God.

00:35:18.959 --> 00:35:20.880
He's all-powerful.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:21.720
He's all-knowing.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.000
And he cares about every single one of us.

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.880
He said, Pastor, you don't know what I'm dealing with.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.399
I may not.

00:35:30.399 --> 00:35:32.519
And the real truth of the matter

00:35:32.519 --> 00:35:34.399
might be that I can't care for you

00:35:34.399 --> 00:35:36.440
the way that you might desire

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.200
because I'm a limited individual.

00:35:41.679 --> 00:35:45.420
But the unlimited God can make a promise

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:48.799
to all of the believers around the globe

00:35:48.799 --> 00:35:50.760
for all of history,

00:35:52.279 --> 00:35:55.260
casting all your care upon him,

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.880
for he careth for you.

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.079
He's a great God.

00:35:59.079 --> 00:36:02.799
His care is evidenced in 1 Kings 17

00:36:02.799 --> 00:36:05.799
through providing direction to Elijah.

00:36:05.799 --> 00:36:07.440
Elijah, I know the brook dried up.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.320
I'm aware of that.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.600
I knew it would happen.

00:36:11.239 --> 00:36:12.700
Get me to Zarephath.

00:36:15.399 --> 00:36:18.679
I've commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.

00:36:18.679 --> 00:36:20.760
100-mile journey for a marked man

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:26.100
to the city that was the home of Jezebel,

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.059
the center of Baal worship.

00:36:30.859 --> 00:36:35.019
And Elijah made it safely and dwelled there safely

00:36:35.019 --> 00:36:36.420
because God took care of him.

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.859
And then God supernaturally provided

00:36:39.859 --> 00:36:41.820
not only for Elijah, but for the widow woman

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.299
and for her house, her son.

00:36:44.579 --> 00:36:49.579
And the Bible tells us that the meal wasted not,

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:52.579
neither did the cruise of oil fail

00:36:52.579 --> 00:36:55.579
according to the word of the Lord,

00:36:55.579 --> 00:36:58.500
which he spake by Elijah.

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.140
Our God is able.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:03.220
This morning, I don't know exactly what everyone's dealing.

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:04.140
We've got some visitors here.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.339
I don't even know who you are.

00:37:06.339 --> 00:37:07.899
Just met you a few moments ago.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.739
But I know that man who is born a woman

00:37:11.739 --> 00:37:13.579
is a few days and full of trouble.

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:15.500
We have burdens.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:20.220
We have concerns and cares.

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:22.540
And our great God says,

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:27.540
"'Casting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.'"

00:37:29.019 --> 00:37:34.019
The life of Elijah so clearly demonstrates for us

00:37:34.459 --> 00:37:36.579
God's care for his people.

00:37:36.579 --> 00:37:39.179
And I hope this morning we'd be encouraged.

00:37:39.179 --> 00:37:43.660
I hope this morning that we would cast our burden

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:47.420
unto the Lord, knowing that he'll sustain us.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.480
He's promised to do so.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.040
We have a great God.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.119
He says to Elijah, "'Get thee to Zarephath.'"

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.519
And he proved his power.

00:37:57.519 --> 00:37:58.640
What a great God we serve.

00:37:58.640 --> 00:37:59.480
Let's pray.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.559
Father, we love you.

00:38:00.559 --> 00:38:02.220
Thank you for loving us.

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.239
Thank you for the life of Elijah,

00:38:07.239 --> 00:38:10.720
the opportunity we have to study,

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:13.239
to be challenged by,

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:20.279
to be encouraged with the truth that's contained

00:38:20.279 --> 00:38:21.739
in this portion of Scripture.

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.959
God, I know that in a crowd of any size,

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:34.960
there are burdens, cares, concerns.

00:38:37.679 --> 00:38:39.159
God, I pray that you would help each one

00:38:39.159 --> 00:38:42.760
that's here this morning to know that you are a great God

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.159
and that you care about them.

00:38:45.059 --> 00:38:46.239
You'll sustain them.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.440
You gave us the instruction to cast our cares upon you.

00:38:51.559 --> 00:38:52.799
I pray that we'd obey you.

00:38:54.039 --> 00:38:56.080
God, we know the greatest need

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.799
for any individual's salvation.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.239
There's one present here this morning

00:39:00.239 --> 00:39:01.679
or one that's tuned in via live stream

00:39:01.679 --> 00:39:02.940
that's not sure of heaven.

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.080
I pray that today, Lord, that the Holy Spirit of God

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.320
would convict them of their sin,

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.820
of Christ's righteousness and of judgment to come.

00:39:13.179 --> 00:39:16.859
And understand that they're a sinner in need of a Savior.

00:39:16.859 --> 00:39:18.460
And Jesus Christ is the only Savior.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:21.900
He bled and died, was buried, and rose again

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:25.780
to pay for their sin so they could be redeemed,

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.580
ransomed, reconciled.

00:39:29.179 --> 00:39:30.460
What a wonderful Savior.

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:35.419
Lord, if someone needs to be saved today,

00:39:35.419 --> 00:39:36.659
I pray that you'd work and move.

00:39:36.659 --> 00:39:38.619
Today is the day of salvation.

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:40.900
I pray there would not be delay.

00:39:41.739 --> 00:39:44.820
I pray there would not be delay, would not be put off.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.179
No man knoweth what a day may bring forth.

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:51.099
God, I pray for every child of God.

00:39:51.099 --> 00:39:53.320
Would you help us to trust you?

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.380
God, you've given us so many promises,

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:56.979
even as you gave Elijah this promise

00:39:56.979 --> 00:39:59.299
here in this portion of Scripture.

00:39:59.299 --> 00:40:01.099
I pray that we'd respond as he did.

00:40:01.099 --> 00:40:08.499
He did with obedience and with faith so you do what only you could do. I pray that in

00:40:08.499 --> 00:40:11.779
this few moments of invitation that you have your will and way that you move and work and

00:40:11.779 --> 00:40:15.899
hearts and lives as only you can. Well thank you for every decision that's made for it's

00:40:15.899 --> 00:40:17.699
in Christ's name we pray.
