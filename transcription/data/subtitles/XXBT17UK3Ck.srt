1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
which Deborah was singing from,

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,920
thou wilt keep him in perfect peace

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,960
whose mind is stayed on thee

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,260
because he trusteth in thee.

5
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,220
And then verse number four says this,

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,260
trust ye in the Lord forever,

7
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,180
for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,719
Aren't you thankful?

9
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,639
The God that we serve,

10
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:24,680
he is the Lord God Almighty, El Shaddai,

11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,680
and he has all power,

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,639
and we ought to trust him, amen?

13
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:29,680
And what a blessing.

14
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:32,400
And I'm so thankful for that song and that reminder.

15
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,860
Hebrews chapter number 10,

16
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,360
I'll be looking at verses one through 18 this morning.

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,819
Hebrews chapter number 10, verses one through 18.

18
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:40,479
I'm gonna read verse one and verse 12,

19
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:42,080
and then we'll get into the message this morning.

20
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,540
The Bible says in verse number one of Hebrews 10,

21
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:49,040
for the law, having a shadow of good things to come,

22
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,619
and not the very image of the things,

23
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:54,259
can never, with those sacrifices

24
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:57,759
which they offered year by year continually,

25
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:01,500
make the comers thereunto perfect.

26
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,919
And verse number 12 says,

27
00:01:02,919 --> 00:01:05,959
but this man, speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ,

28
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:08,260
our great high priest,

29
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:13,260
after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever,

30
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,139
sat down on the right hand of God.

31
00:01:17,139 --> 00:01:18,599
I wanna preach a message this morning

32
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,900
that I've adopted the title from verse number 12,

33
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,620
one sacrifice for sins forever.

34
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,580
The discussion on the superiority of the Lord Jesus Christ

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,940
and the priesthood of Christ in particular

36
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,680
over these last several chapters of the book of Hebrews

37
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,720
is coming to a conclusion.

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,000
We, of course, understood as we started

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,199
in chapter number five of Hebrews

40
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:42,160
how that this subject matter of the priesthood

41
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,360
of the Lord Jesus Christ

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,760
and how his priesthood is superior

43
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,879
to that of the Aaronic priesthood,

44
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:51,059
that discussion began in chapter number five.

45
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:53,360
We find that the writer of Hebrews

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,239
presented the Lord Jesus Christ

47
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,739
as being the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy.

48
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:01,419
In fact, many times throughout the book of Hebrews,

49
00:02:01,419 --> 00:02:04,500
even as we find this morning in our text of scripture,

50
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,779
the writer will reference the Old Testament

51
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:09,580
and he'll show how that the Lord Jesus Christ

52
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,279
is the fulfillment of that particular prophecy.

53
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:15,300
Of course, in line with what was being dealt with

54
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,860
in chapter number five and discussed often

55
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,940
was the prophecy from Psalm 110,

56
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,100
that messianic psalm that the truth,

57
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,759
my son, today have I begotten thee in Psalm two,

58
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:30,059
but then in Psalm 100, thou art a priest forever,

59
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:33,520
sorry, Psalm 110, after the order of Melchizedek.

60
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,979
And we find that the writer of Hebrews

61
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:37,880
presented the Lord Jesus Christ

62
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,360
as being the fulfillment of this Old Testament prophecy.

63
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,619
And then he has spent the next several chapters

64
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:45,839
into chapter number 10

65
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:47,639
that we're studying here this morning

66
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:51,940
to prove that Christ is superior.

67
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,679
We have found, as we've studied through these chapters,

68
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:58,399
that his priesthood is after the order of Melchizedek.

69
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:01,679
Of course, that was the reference in Psalm 110,

70
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:03,880
and we find the fulfillment in Hebrews five,

71
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,380
the reference to that.

72
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,119
And of course, as we studied through,

73
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,179
remember chapter five,

74
00:03:09,179 --> 00:03:11,960
he had to have that moment of giving a warning

75
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,600
because he said the things that he had to utter,

76
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,919
that they were hard to utter,

77
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,279
seeing you're dull of hearing,

78
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,820
and then he gave a warning.

79
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,979
But we find in chapter number seven of the book of Hebrews,

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,039
he deals with that of Melchizedek

81
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,080
and the fulfillment of that messianic prophecy

82
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,000
in Psalm 110.

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,399
We find that the Lord Jesus Christ,

84
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:30,820
he passed through the heavens,

85
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,279
not simply through the veil.

86
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,000
We find that the Lord Jesus Christ,

87
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,279
that his offering was for sin,

88
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:38,960
the sin of the world,

89
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,740
but it was not for his own sin.

90
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,580
Remember, the priest, as he would make an offering,

91
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,360
he first had to make an offering for his own sin,

92
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,360
then for the sin of the people.

93
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,199
But our Savior is perfect.

94
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,779
He has no sin, had no sin.

95
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:55,979
He is pure and just and righteous.

96
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:59,820
And so we find, as we spoke about the superiority

97
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,300
of the Lord Jesus Christ, our great high priest,

98
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,500
we mentioned that truth.

99
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,940
We find that he conquered death and lives forever.

100
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,259
Remember, the priesthood in the Old Testament,

101
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:11,699
there would be a time that the high priest would die.

102
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:13,380
And then it would be the next person

103
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,940
that would be in line to assume

104
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,779
that title of being high priest.

105
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,579
But we find that the Lord Jesus Christ,

106
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:22,160
he conquered death, he rose from the dead,

107
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,119
and he lives forevermore.

108
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:27,880
He made one offering for sin forever.

109
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,839
And we see that once again in focus here

110
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,779
in Hebrews chapter number 10, these first 18 verses.

111
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:35,079
And let's dig in.

112
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,640
Look, if you're taking notes this morning,

113
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,839
look at the first four verses.

114
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,320
Number one this morning, the remembrance of sin.

115
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,359
The remembrance of sin.

116
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:45,100
Once again, we find that the Old Testament

117
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,299
sacrificial system is in full view.

118
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:49,679
The Bible begins by saying this in verse number one,

119
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:51,640
as I read already, for the law,

120
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,079
having a shadow of good things to come.

121
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,440
And we've spoken often throughout this section

122
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,040
of the book of Hebrews how the typologies

123
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,079
and how that the Old Testament type

124
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:06,959
is now presented in full view of the person of Jesus Christ.

125
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,000
And we find that it says that it was a shadow

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,339
of good things to come.

127
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:12,000
And then notice this phrase,

128
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,040
and not the very image of the things.

129
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:21,140
It then says this, can never, never, can never.

130
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:24,660
Amen, that's a pretty absolute statement, is it not?

131
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,700
Can never, with those sacrifices

132
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,380
which they offered year by year continually,

133
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,200
make the comers thereunto perfect.

134
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,660
But notice the natural conclusion

135
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,279
that you would come to in verse number two

136
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:44,100
when you look at the reality of what's being presented.

137
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:46,559
It says this, in verse number two, the first statement,

138
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:48,920
it's a question, it says, for then,

139
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,040
would they not have ceased to be offered?

140
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,640
In other words, if that Old Testament sacrificial system

141
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,320
could make the comers thereunto perfect,

142
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,100
if it was sufficient, then it would cease.

143
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,239
It wouldn't have to continue to be done every day.

144
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,200
And then of course, as the day of atonement

145
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,779
comes in full view, we find annually.

146
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:11,559
Remember, we mentioned on the day of atonement

147
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,619
as we've studied the ninth chapter of the book of Hebrews

148
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:17,079
how the high priest would go in,

149
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:19,859
and he would go in once to offer for his own sin,

150
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:21,579
and then he would come out,

151
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:23,500
and then he would go in a second time

152
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,820
to offer for the sin of the people,

153
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,299
and we find that that then would have to be repeated

154
00:06:29,299 --> 00:06:31,579
annually on the day of atonement.

155
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:34,940
We find that here, the natural conclusion

156
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,700
that we come to in the writer's offering

157
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,220
as of the question, would not it have ceased to be offered

158
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:42,959
if it was possible to bring life,

159
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,679
if it was possible to atone for sins,

160
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:49,519
to make that sacrifice that would be sufficient forever,

161
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,880
then it would cease.

162
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,320
But the reality is that it was a picture.

163
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,519
It was a type.

164
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,540
And there was a remembrance of sin.

165
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,959
You see in verse number three,

166
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,239
the Bible says, well, let me finish verse number two,

167
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:03,480
because that the worshipers once purged,

168
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,480
notice, should have had no more conscience of sins.

169
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,480
But in those sacrifices, there is a remembrance again,

170
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:18,940
made of sins every year.

171
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,579
The day of atonement was an important day

172
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:22,540
in the nation of Israel's history

173
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,540
on their calendar annually.

174
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,579
And we find that again, even as we read in verse number 12

175
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:30,339
and in verse number 11 that proceeds that,

176
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:32,220
talks about the fact that the priest standeth

177
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,859
daily ministering and offering oftentimes

178
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:38,760
the same sacrifices which can never take away sins.

179
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,799
And we find that there was a remembrance of sins.

180
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,040
There was no remission.

181
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,660
And we'll get to that in just a moment.

182
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,519
There was a constant remembrance of sin.

183
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,399
And we find that the nation of Israel,

184
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:52,880
the reality is that this is the plan that God put in place.

185
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,239
He gave this sacrificial system

186
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:57,320
and it would point to Messiah that would come.

187
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,480
You understand that Paul says it this way

188
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,739
in the book of Galatians,

189
00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:02,920
that when the fullness of time was come,

190
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,260
God sent forth his son to be born of a virgin.

191
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,739
But we find that as Paul continues

192
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:11,179
dealing with that subject matter in the book of Galatians,

193
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:14,100
and we often will view that passage of scripture,

194
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,779
we find that he continues.

195
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:19,059
He doesn't just speak about the incarnation,

196
00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:21,940
that he came, he was made of a woman, made under the law.

197
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:26,179
And then verse number five of Galatians four says this,

198
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:29,579
to redeem them that were under the law,

199
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:31,980
that we might receive the adoption of sons.

200
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,960
And so when the fullness of time was come,

201
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,320
at the exact perfect time, God sent forth his son.

202
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,400
And he sent them forth for a purpose

203
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,280
and that purpose was to die to redeem mankind.

204
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,960
And so all of that Old Testament sacrificial system,

205
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,119
it's pointing to Messiah who would come.

206
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:50,760
And we find that the Bible continues

207
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,440
in verse number four again,

208
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,200
for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats

209
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,520
should take away sins.

210
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,260
Now listen, for us in 2020,

211
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,320
if you've been around church long enough,

212
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,039
this is common knowledge for us, right?

213
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,039
Think about the Israelite,

214
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,479
think about this one that's Jewish,

215
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:17,159
that is being written to these initial recipients

216
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:20,159
and think about the change that has happened

217
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,840
because of Calvary.

218
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,400
Prior to Calvary, it was appropriate for them to go

219
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,159
and make these offerings, right?

220
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,099
And so depending on your age,

221
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:32,659
how old you were at the time of Calvary,

222
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:35,780
all of those years before Calvary, this is what you did.

223
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,260
This was your form of worship.

224
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,640
You went to the temple, you were mindful of this regularly.

225
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,580
And now we find that Jesus has come,

226
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,359
he has settled the subject matter of sin.

227
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:47,859
We dealt with that in chapter number nine

228
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:50,539
last Sunday morning, he has settled it.

229
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:54,460
And so now no longer do we bring those offerings.

230
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,820
And we find that the writer is saying to these individuals,

231
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,080
he's saying, it's not possible that the blood of.

232
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,240
bulls and of goats should take away sins and we say amen hallelujah we know that

233
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,800
again consider the initial recipients of the book they're being confronted with

234
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,600
this truth and again what's happening is this thought of being pulled back into

235
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,080
Judaism and all that's taking place at this particular era for these believers

236
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,400
we find that the the book of Hebrews is written to show that Christ is far

237
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:31,920
better don't return to that system that system is inefficient it cannot it's

238
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,560
inadequate a better word it's inadequate it cannot cover sins it cannot atone for

239
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:44,200
your sins there is a remembrance of sin we find that there in verse number four

240
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,600
when it talks about the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins and

241
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,920
of course again as you look at verses three and four what's in full view as we

242
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,360
found in chapter number nine and verse number seven was that specific day of

243
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,520
atonement again we mentioned that if you stand back and look in Leviticus chapter

244
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,560
number 16 and understand all of the details surrounding that which would be

245
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,560
done on that particular day and it was an important day for the nation of

246
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,600
Israel but we find that here the writer is is making it crystal clear he's

247
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,240
coming to a natural conclusion of all that he's presented really coming to a

248
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,280
climatic point if you will and he's saying it's that's not possible it's

249
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:31,720
any it's inadequate it's not going to work in verse 311 it says every priest

250
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,040
standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices again he

251
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:46,040
says this which can never take away sins so we see there's a remembrance of sins

252
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,320
Galatians 2 actually we'll go to Galatians 2 in just a moment let me look

253
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,200
at Galatians 3 let me share these verses with you in verse 21 and 22 in

254
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:00,720
Galatians chapter number 3 and we find here that the Apostle Paul is dealing

255
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,320
in giving truth with regard to the law and he says this in verse 21 and 22 of

256
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:14,080
Galatians 3 he says is the law then against the promises of God God forbid

257
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:20,000
for if it had been a law given which could have given life verily

258
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,480
righteousness should have been by the law but the scripture hath concluded all

259
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:34,560
under sin that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that

260
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,200
believe remember in verse 24 of this same text the Bible says that the law

261
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,440
was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by

262
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,680
faith and we're mindful of the truth that the the law condemns the law shows

263
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,880
us that we're insufficient in fact the Apostle Paul says that he had not known

264
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,560
sin but by the law in Romans chapter number 7 he says for I had not known

265
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,840
lust except the law had said thou shalt not covet and so he's showing how that

266
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:10,520
the law brings us to Christ and shows us our need of a Savior but in this Old

267
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,240
Testament sacrificial system that is in view these sacrifices that are mentioned

268
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,760
in verse number one which they offered year by year continually they could not

269
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,540
make the comers there unto perfect there was a remembrance of sins number two the

270
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:31,600
remission of sins as we get into verses 5 through 18 we see this glorious truth

271
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,760
with regard to the remission of sins the word remission means forgiveness or

272
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:43,280
pardon of sins and literally carries the idea to let them go as if they had never

273
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:51,160
even been committed and it wonderful to have remission to be pardoned to be

274
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,880
forgiven what a joy we of course understand in the Old Testament there's

275
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,440
many times in which we reference the grace and mercy of God but even finding

276
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,360
within the Old Testament how that the psalmist would cry out that with thee

277
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,560
there is forgiveness I think about the prayers of Ezra and he mentions how that

278
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:19,280
our God is a God who is ready to pardon and that wonderful he's ready to forgive

279
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:24,040
with him there is forgiveness as we look at verses 5 through 18 and we begin to

280
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,880
consider the subject matter of the remission of sins we find here that

281
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:33,360
really there is a plan in verses 5 through 9 if we break up the section you

282
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,200
notice first of all the plan and again the writer of Hebrews will go back to

283
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,280
the Old Testament and it's a reference to Psalm 40 verses 6 through 8 and as he

284
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,840
references that Old Testament passage again as his as his custom has been

285
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,880
throughout the book of Hebrews he'll present this truth and he'll show that

286
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,040
Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ is the fulfillment so notice in verse number

287
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,200
5 the Bible says wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice

288
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:05,840
an offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me in burnt offerings

289
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:12,760
and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure then said I lo I come in the

290
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:20,080
volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will Oh God we think often in

291
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:25,560
the book of John as we hear the subject matter of his hour and we consider how

292
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,560
that in John chapter number two really the first reference of his hour at the

293
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,680
the miracle there at the marriage at Cana and he says mine hour is not yet

294
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,160
come and you see multiple references to the hour throughout the book of John and

295
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,800
it comes to a great truth in John chapter number 17 when Jesus is praying

296
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:53,800
and he says father the hour is come and we find that the truth that we see in

297
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,680
Hebrews 10 in verse number 70 says then said I lo I come in the volume of the

298
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:05,040
book it is written of me to do thy will Oh God we understand the plan of

299
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,560
redemption we understand that before the foundation of the world the Bible tells

300
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,520
us in first Peter chapter number one that Jesus is the lamb that was slain

301
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:20,280
before the foundation of the world that God had devised the plan of salvation of

302
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,840
redemption see he knew that though he created Adam and Eve in a perfect

303
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,560
environment he knew that they would fall and that they would sin and because of

304
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,360
their sin there would need to be a sacrifice and he understood that

305
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,480
throughout the entirety of the Old Testament these sacrifices of blood would

306
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,680
be a picture of the Lord Jesus Christ God in flesh who would come and make

307
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:48,800
that ultimate sacrifice when he offered himself we find here that in verse

308
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,760
number eight the Bible says above back in Hebrews 10 in verse 8 above when he

309
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,620
said sacrifice an offering and burnt offerings an offering of sin for sin

310
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:03,080
thou wouldest not neither hath pleasure therein which are offered by the law

311
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:09,680
again in verse 9 then said he lo I come to do thy will O God he taketh away the

312
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:16,000
first that he may establish the second we've mentioned about the first covenant

313
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,560
in the second covenant the new covenant as we've often referred to it in fact as

314
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,920
we studied the last section of chapter 8 we dealt with the new covenant and we

315
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,480
find that the reference will be made again in verses 16 through 18 in our

316
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,560
text of Scripture with regard to this new covenant and it's interesting as we

317
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,480
look at the passage of Scripture and we find that in verses 6 and 8 he mentions

318
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,200
about this fact that there was no pleasure in these offerings and these

319
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,160
sacrifices and we find that as you think about the history of Israel and you

320
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:57,000
think about their their offerings Isaiah calls them vain oblations see here's

321
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,880
what was happening in Israel's history again not necessarily that these people

322
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,320
would understand and maybe a greater context than we would because of their

323
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,800
closeness to the the Jewish tradition and all that they had gone through but

324
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:17,480
we find that they often were criticized they were condemned in the Old Testament

325
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,040
because of their vain oblations go back to the Isaiah 1 and see what the Lord

326
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:28,520
says of course Isaiah is the prophet of God he's speaking the words of the Lord

327
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,560
and we find that the indictment is given we'll look at a couple of chapters here

328
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:38,799
within the prophets and notice what is said about these vain oblations in verse

329
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,880
number 11 of Isaiah 1 to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me

330
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,520
sayeth the Lord I am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed

331
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,760
beasts and I delight not in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of he goats

332
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,239
verse 12 when you come to appear before me who hath required this at your hand

333
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:07,280
to tread my courts bring no more vain oblations empty offerings incense and

334
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,840
an abomination unto me the new moons and Sabbaths the calling of assemblies I

335
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:16,160
cannot away with it is iniquity even the solemn meeting and we find that what was

336
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,720
happening of course we understand the sin of idolatry that the nation of

337
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,960
Israel was so often guilty of and they would make all sorts of offerings to

338
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,880
these false deities but we also understand that what was happening in

339
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,640
the nation of Israel is they would go through the motion but their heart was

340
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:42,920
not with God they would simply do the motion they would conform outwardly they

341
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,920
would do what had been prescribed thinking we've done what we've been told

342
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:54,920
to do their heart see God is interested in our heart he wants our heart I've

343
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,920
often said this if God has your heart he has all of you he has every part of you

344
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,920
and all

345
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:08,460
how we see what's happening in Israel's history and we understand that God is

346
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,580
saying, listen, if your heart's not right, don't bring those offerings. I'm not

347
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,900
pleased with those offerings. Jeremiah chapter number 6 and verse number 20

348
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:22,180
notice, again, a reference to this same type of behavior that is going on. In

349
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:27,180
fact, we understand much that is taking place in the book of Jeremiah and the

350
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,580
indictments that have been laid upon Judah throughout these first several

351
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,300
chapters of the book and we find that in verse number 20 the Bible says this,

352
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,500
To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba and the sweet cane

353
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:46,060
from a far country? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices

354
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:52,580
sweet unto me. It's pretty clear language, is it not? Notice what is said in Amos

355
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:58,660
chapter number 5. Turn to the minor prophet, the book of Amos, Hosea, Joel,

356
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,500
Amos, before Hosea is Daniel. Kind of give you a little bit of reference point.

357
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,500
I often have heard as preachers would go to minor prophets, they say it's just

358
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,540
after Genesis and before Revelation. It's not very helpful, amen, but try to give

359
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:18,220
you a little reference point there. And Hosea, Joel, Amos. And Amos chapter 5,

360
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:25,300
look here in verse number 20. Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness and not

361
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:31,900
light, even very dark and no brightness in it? I hate, I despise your feast days,

362
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:36,620
and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies. Though ye offer me burnt

363
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:41,860
offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them, neither will I regard

364
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:47,540
the peace offerings of your fat beast. Take thou away from me the noise of thy

365
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:53,100
songs, for I will not hear the melody of thy vials. But let judgment run down as

366
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,700
waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream. Have you offered unto me

367
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,020
sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?

368
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:06,900
But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Molech and Chion, your images, the star of

369
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,180
your God, which you made to yourselves. Therefore will I cause you to go into

370
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:16,740
captivity beyond Damascus, saith the Lord, whose name is the God of hosts. Again, we

371
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:21,580
see the idolatry mentioned here, specifically in verse number 26, and of

372
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:27,180
course the nation of Israel constantly dealing with the sin of idolatry, but we

373
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,540
find that as we look back in Hebrews chapter number 10 and we understand

374
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:37,700
what's happening and we see the plan that God is revealing here to these

375
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:43,980
recipients, these Jewish believers, that as we come to this climatic point

376
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,420
of the argument of the superiority of the priesthood of the Lord Jesus Christ,

377
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,140
he says, listen, the Old Testament is inadequate, that Old Testament sacrificial

378
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,540
system inadequate. By the way, he points back to some historical times within the

379
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:04,140
history of Israel that their heart was far from God. And now he comes to the

380
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:10,380
plan and he says, the plan that I have with regard to I come, remember he said

381
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,620
this, a body hast thou prepared me at the end of verse number five, I come, verse 7

382
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:23,140
and verse 9, to do thy will. And we find that the plan required a payment. The plan

383
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:28,140
required a payment, but there was only one payment that was acceptable, and that

384
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:33,620
was the blood of Jesus Christ. Again, we are familiar with this truth and as it's

385
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:38,300
been presented throughout these chapters and we come to this 10th chapter and we

386
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:44,820
see how it all comes together. Notice in verses 10 through 13 that that plan

387
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:49,460
that has been discussed required a payment and it's the precious blood of

388
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:54,180
the Lord Jesus Christ. In verse number 10, by the witch will we are sanctified

389
00:23:54,180 --> 00:24:03,660
through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. We read verse

390
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:09,420
number 11 already, again another contrast between the single offering of the Lord

391
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:16,140
Jesus Christ that dealt with sin forever versus the continual offering of

392
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:20,580
that Old Testament sacrificial system that often caused the people to have

393
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,540
that remembrance of sin. It could not take away sin and we read in verse

394
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:29,460
number 12, but this man after he'd offered one sacrifice for sins forever

395
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:34,340
sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be

396
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:39,780
made his footstool. Isn't it amazing what the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ

397
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:45,260
accomplished on the cross of Calvary? And we think about this truth that we find

398
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:50,860
here that the the payment that was required because of that plan that was

399
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,620
that was put in place by God Almighty, that it was the precious blood of Christ.

400
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,580
We understand John 3 16, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten

401
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:06,140
son, right? And what did he he sent his son Jesus Christ not simply to come and

402
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:11,420
live upon this earth and then and be a good model and so on and so forth. No, he

403
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:16,460
was born to die. We understand that in his lifetime that he did leave us an

404
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,900
example that we should follow his steps. He is the perfect example, we understand

405
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:26,220
that, but he's more than an example. He's more than just a teacher. We know in

406
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,820
John chapter 3 Nicodemus says we know that thou art a teacher sent from God.

407
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:36,620
He's so much greater than a teacher, amen? He is the truth. He's the Redeemer. He

408
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:44,140
came, what, to seek and to save. How would he save? Through his death, his burial, and

409
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:50,060
his glorious resurrection. In fact, as we're mindful of the truth that is

410
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:54,060
before us of the payment, we understand that Peter would say that we're redeemed

411
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:58,920
with the precious blood of Christ. In 1 Peter 1 in verse number 19, remember

412
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:03,640
the truth of Romans 5 in verse number 8, but God commended his love toward us in

413
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:09,920
that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. I want you to go back and

414
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,560
look at a few verses of Scripture, if you would. Go back to Matthew chapter 26, and

415
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:18,560
we're just gonna go through a few verses of Scripture to show the remission of

416
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:24,440
sin and the reality that the plan required this payment. In Matthew

417
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:30,400
chapter number 26, really on the eve of the Lord going to the cross of Calvary,

418
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,840
we understand that here within the text of Scripture, we'll read about the

419
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,680
betrayal and all that will take place in the hearing and what-have-you. In

420
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,760
chapter number 26 and verse number 28, as they are observing what we would often

421
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,200
refer to, the Passover there, the Lord's Supper, we reference this passage of

422
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,440
Scripture in verse 28, for this is my blood of the New Testament which is shed

423
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,560
for many, what does he say, for the remission of sins. Remember the word

424
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,920
remission, forgiveness or pardon of sins, the idea of letting them go as if they

425
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:09,360
had never been committed. See, our God is just. We have a problem in our nation

426
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,040
today understanding justice. Amen? We really do. We have a problem understanding

427
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:19,680
justice and equality. It's way, way gone as to what those words actually mean. Our

428
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:25,280
God is just, and as a just God, he cannot just pretend that it never happened.

429
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:34,620
There had to be a payment, and Jesus said, I'll pay it. But the payment had to be

430
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:40,640
made, and the only payment that was acceptable was the payment that was made

431
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,480
by the Lord Jesus Christ, and therefore justice could be served. Why? Because the

432
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,920
fact that it had been paid for, the sin of mankind has been paid for with the

433
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,160
blood of Jesus Christ, and so he says that this Last Supper, he says, this is my

434
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:02,760
blood of the New Testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins. Go to

435
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,760
the book of Acts and understand as we look through the book of Acts, the

436
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,440
disciples as they're preaching, and I want you to consider in Acts chapter

437
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,000
number 2 and verse number 38 as Peter is preaching, and I want you to understand

438
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,800
that Peter was there in that passage in Matthew 26. He heard what the Lord Jesus

439
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Christ said, and between that moment in Matthew 26 and this one in Acts 2, some

440
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,560
amazing things happened historically. Jesus actually went to the cross. He had

441
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,600
not gone to the cross yet in Matthew 26, but he said that this blood was going to

442
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,000
be shed for many for the remission of sins. What does he do? He goes to the

443
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,160
cross. By the way, did Peter, was he aware of the fact that Jesus went to the cross?

444
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:45,400
Sure he was. He denied him thrice, did he not? And we find that after that

445
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,480
situation that Jesus is put into a borrowed tomb, he rises on the third day

446
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,320
conquering sin, death, and the grave. He appears to his disciples. By the way, he

447
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,960
appears to Peter, does he not? And we find that as he appears to Peter, remember John

448
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,840
chapter number 21, and you read there how that they're fishing, and Jesus is on the

449
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:10,680
shore, and he says, hey, do you have any fish? No. There'd been another time in

450
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,880
which they'd been asked the same question, and they'd not caught any. In

451
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,840
fact, it was at the calling of Peter, and God gave him, the Lord Jesus Christ said,

452
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:24,400
hey, thrust out into the deep and cast out thy net for a draw of fishes, a draft

453
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,320
of fishes, and we find that as we go through that passage of Scripture, we

454
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,080
find that Peter initially was like, no, I mean, nevertheless, at thy will, we will.

455
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,440
We toyed all the night, we caught nothing, but we'll do it. What'd they do? They

456
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:42,120
caught a great host of fish. But in John chapter number 21, then I think it was

457
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:47,880
probably their largest catch ever, and then John says, I think it's the Lord. As

458
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,840
Peter do, he gets up to shore real quick. We find that Jesus, he gives some

459
00:29:53,840 --> 00:30:00,120
instruction. Peter, do you love me? Peter, do you love me? Peter, do you love me? Then we

460
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,760
find that Acts chapter number 1 is recorded for us.

461
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:09,160
We find that they're the Great Commission, the Ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ.

462
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:15,160
I mean, these are amazing events that have happened between Matthew chapter 26 and Acts chapter number 2.

463
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,160
He tells them they're to stay there in Acts chapter number 1,

464
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,760
but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you.

465
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,160
And so we find that they're there, they're tarrying,

466
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:31,160
and we find that the Holy Spirit comes, Pentecost, Acts chapter number 2,

467
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,960
and Peter is preaching.

468
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,960
The message of Peter begins in verse number 14.

469
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,760
We don't have time to read the entirety of the message,

470
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,760
but we find that in Acts 2, in verse number 37, notice what it says.

471
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,360
Now when they heard this, they heard the message that Peter preached,

472
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,560
they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles,

473
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:55,560
Men and brethren, what shall we do?

474
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,760
Then Peter said unto them, Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ.

475
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,760
What does it say? For the remission of sins.

476
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,160
And you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

477
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,560
Why was it for the remission?

478
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:13,160
Or how could it be that Peter could offer this salvation, this remission of sins?

479
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:17,760
Because Jesus Christ shed his blood, because the payment was made.

480
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,360
We find in Acts chapter number 10, notice,

481
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,760
as we continue to move forward here throughout the book of Acts,

482
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,560
and we'll just use this as our last example.

483
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,160
Again, Peter is preaching here, and this is an amazing situation,

484
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,360
as we find in Acts chapter number 10, of course,

485
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,760
the situation with Cornelius and all that is taking place,

486
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,960
and how that Peter receives that vision from the Lord,

487
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,160
and Peter is given the instruction to go.

488
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,960
He goes to the house of Cornelius, and I mean, they're just waiting for him to come,

489
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,160
and they're ready for him to speak to him.

490
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,160
What an opportunity.

491
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,560
And Peter begins to preach.

492
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,160
In fact, in verse number 34, it says,

493
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,160
then Peter opened his mouth and begins to preach.

494
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,960
And in verse number 43, the Bible says,

495
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,160
to him give all the prophets witness that through his name,

496
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:12,560
whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.

497
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,160
This is a message that's being preached.

498
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:19,960
Why? Because it's the message that we've been instructed to deliver, to preach.

499
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:25,160
You find the theme of this subject throughout the New Testament.

500
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:29,560
You find this preaching of the gospel for the remission of sin.

501
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,360
And we come back to Hebrews chapter number 10,

502
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,160
and we see the payment that was made,

503
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,960
and we find that the plan had been established.

504
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,360
It required, however, a payment.

505
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,760
The payment resulted in the pardon.

506
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,960
I'm so thankful for the pardon.

507
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,160
As you go back to Hebrews chapter number 10,

508
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
and you look at verses 14 through 18,

509
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:57,160
you see the reference that is given here with regard to what the payment,

510
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,360
the precious blood of Christ accomplished,

511
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,360
what it resulted in, and that is the pardon.

512
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,560
In verse number 14, for by one offering,

513
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:10,960
he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified.

514
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,560
Now let me ask you a really simple question.

515
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,560
These New Testament, these first century believers,

516
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,760
these Jewish believers, as they're dealing with all they're dealing with,

517
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,760
and they're told on this side, you have the law.

518
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,560
It's a shadow of good things to come.

519
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,360
And you offer all of these offerings, and you're very familiar with this,

520
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,760
and there's a remembrance of sin, and it's not possible.

521
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,760
It can never take away sins. It's not possible.

522
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,160
And then on this side, we have the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ,

523
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,160
by the way, that took place one time.

524
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:45,560
And it did, it handled, it took care of the sin of mankind

525
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,360
with one sacrifice for sins forever.

526
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,360
And by this one offering,

527
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,560
he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified.

528
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,960
Which one do you want?

529
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,760
It's kind of a no-brainer, is it not?

530
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,160
I'm going to go with the one that is sufficient.

531
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:07,560
I'm going to go with the one that satisfies God Almighty.

532
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,360
And the pardon that is offered,

533
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:14,160
it's perfected forever them that are sanctified.

534
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,360
Notice verse 15,

535
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,760
whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us,

536
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,960
for after that he had said before.

537
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,360
Now we find again another reference to the Old Testament,

538
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,960
in verses 16 through 18,

539
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,560
we find the new covenant being referenced again.

540
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,760
This is that quote that we looked at in Hebrews chapter number 8,

541
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,760
in verses 6 through 13,

542
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,560
and we're not going to review all of that,

543
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,760
but really it goes back to Jeremiah chapter 31,

544
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,960
and it deals with this new covenant.

545
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,960
And notice what is said in verses 16, 17, and 18,

546
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,960
and what a blessed truth is given with regard to this pardon.

547
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,360
He says in verse 16,

548
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,360
this is the covenant that I will make with them after those days,

549
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,960
sayeth the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts,

550
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,960
and in their minds will I write them,

551
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,760
and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.

552
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,760
Now where remission of these is,

553
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,360
there is no more offering for sin.

554
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,760
As we look at these three verses of Scripture,

555
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,760
we'll remind ourselves of the truth

556
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,960
from that 8th chapter when we looked at verses 6

557
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,160
down through verse number 13,

558
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,360
and we dealt with that second, that new covenant.

559
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,960
And as we dealt with the new covenant,

560
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,960
we spent a lot of time dealing with the fact of

561
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,760
specifically how it relates to Israel.

562
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,760
There's a promise that's given to Israel.

563
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,160
We understand that.

564
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,760
And we went through, and if you did not hear that message,

565
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,560
you could go back to that message,

566
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,560
it was entitled, A Better Covenant.

567
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,560
I preached that on July the 19th,

568
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,160
and we dealt with how the specifics of the covenant,

569
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,760
of this new covenant, how it relates to Israel.

570
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,760
But then we mentioned how it relates

571
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,160
to individual believers today.

572
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,760
We spent a lot of time looking at

573
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,760
a number of passages of Scripture,

574
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,360
and we spoke about, in Romans chapter 11,

575
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,960
how that we've been graft in,

576
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,160
and what a joy to understand

577
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,560
all of the dynamics of that truth.

578
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,760
And we find here at the end of the section

579
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,160
we're studying here this morning,

580
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,960
in verses 16 through 18,

581
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,360
this comes in focus again.

582
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,960
And He gives to us the result,

583
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,760
this pardon that is given.

584
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,960
Notice, I will put My laws into their hearts,

585
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,360
and in their minds will I write them.

586
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,560
Notice verse 17,

587
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,760
and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.

588
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,960
That's in direct contrast to that Levitical system

589
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,360
that we see in the beginning of Hebrews 10.

590
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,960
In fact, specifically in verse 3,

591
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,160
it says that there is a remembrance again

592
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,560
made of sins every year.

593
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,760
And He says that this pardon,

594
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,560
He says that their sins and iniquities

595
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,760
will I remember no more.

596
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,560
Notice, now where remission of these is,

597
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,560
there is no more offering for sin.

598
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,760
What He's saying in verse 18

599
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,960
is that there's only one acceptable payment for sin,

600
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,360
and it's been made.

601
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,760
There's nothing else that you can do.

602
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,560
You want to stick to that Old Testament

603
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,960
sacrificial system and make all of those sacrifices,

604
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,560
it's not going to work.

605
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,360
So we have today a number of religious organizations

606
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,160
that would teach that somehow

607
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,160
you need to achieve your own salvation.

608
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,760
There are things that you need to do

609
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,360
in order to obtain eternal life.

610
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,360
The reality is that there's no more offering for sin.

611
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,760
Why? Because Jesus paid it all.

612
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,560
What did He say on the cross of Calvary?

613
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,160
We understand there's seven last sayings

614
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,360
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

615
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,760
One of them in particular,

616
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,560
it is finished.

617
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,960
I've often used this terminology.

618
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,560
When He said it is finished,

619
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,360
He's saying it's done. Right?

620
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,160
There's nothing that we need to do.

621
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,160
There are some religious organizations

622
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,960
that speak about doing,

623
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,760
but Christ says no, it's finished.

624
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,560
It's done.

625
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,160
All you have to do is have

626
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,760
the righteousness of God imputed upon your account.

627
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,560
You receive the Lord Jesus Christ

628
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,360
as your personal Savior.

629
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,160
See, the gift of salvation,

630
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,360
the gift of God which is eternal life,

631
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,560
is being offered to every human being,

632
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,360
every person, whosoever will may come.

633
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,960
We sang that song this morning.

634
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,560
Aren't you thankful for that truth?

635
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,760
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

636
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,960
shall be saved.

637
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,560
I'm thankful for that truth of Scripture.

638
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,560
Romans 10 and verse 13.

639
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,760
And as we understand the payment being made,

640
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,160
Jesus then offers the gift of eternal life,

641
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,760
and all you must do is receive,

642
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,760
accept that gift.

643
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,960
You can reject it.

644
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,160
Unfortunately, people do.

645
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,160
They say, no, I'm going to try my own way.

646
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,960
I'm going to do my own thing.

647
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,560
I'm going to follow this teaching,

648
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,160
this religious organization.

649
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,360
I'm going to follow their teaching.

650
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,160
But we find here that the culmination

651
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,360
of all of this truth that has been given

652
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,360
is that where remission of these is,

653
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,960
how did the pardon come?

654
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,760
How did that forgiveness come?

655
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,160
Where did that remission come from?

656
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,760
It was through that payment, right?

657
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,560
God had a plan, a plan of redemption,

658
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,760
but that plan required a payment.

659
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,160
The payment is the precious blood of Christ,

660
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,760
and we find that that payment results in a pardon.

661
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,760
This morning, we can rejoice greatly

662
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,560
in the fact that we've been forgiven,

663
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,960
that we've been pardoned,

664
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,360
that there is remission of sin.

665
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,560
We find here that there's no more offering for sin,

666
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,760
nothing else that could be acceptable.

667
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,960
I'm mindful of what the Old Testament tells us.

668
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,960
In fact, we sing about these truths often,

669
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,560
about the truth of how that God forgives us

670
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,560
and what a joy it is to be forgiven.

671
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,360
And we find that in Psalm 103, in verse 12,

672
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:48,960
the Bible says,

673
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,960
as far as the east is from the west,

674
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,560
so far hath He removed our transgressions from us.

675
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,160
Isn't that wonderful?

676
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,360
We find that in the book of Micah,

677
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,760
the Bible speaks about the fact

678
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,760
that they're buried in the sea.

679
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,760
Notice in Micah 7, in verse number 19.

680
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,320
the Bible says He will turn again,

681
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,080
He will have compassion upon us,

682
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,920
He will subdue our iniquities,

683
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,220
and that will cast all their sins

684
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:17,560
into the depths of the sea.

685
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,720
Isn't that wonderful?

686
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,840
And we find here this morning

687
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,760
that as we are looking at this climatic point

688
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,200
where the writer comes to these first 18 verses

689
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,360
of chapter 10,

690
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,440
and he says listen,

691
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,560
there's a remembrance of sin

692
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,520
in that law that's a shadow of good things to come.

693
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,480
But in what Jesus Christ offered

694
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,760
when He offered Himself,

695
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,280
the offering that He made,

696
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,120
there is a remission of sin.

697
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,720
The forgiveness, the pardon.

698
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,680
Now understand with me this morning

699
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,040
that we find ourselves in the midst

700
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,120
of a generation that often as you speak

701
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,560
this message that is an important message

702
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,560
to deliver,

703
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,840
even as we've noted how in the book of Acts

704
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,760
we're preaching this message of remission,

705
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,480
this pardon of sin

706
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,600
because of what Jesus Christ accomplished

707
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,960
on the cross of Calvary

708
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,400
that you will have some that say

709
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,720
I'm doing the best I can,

710
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,440
I'm working, I'm trying.

711
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,160
The reality is that Ephesians 2 in verses 8 and 9

712
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,960
for by grace are you saved through faith

713
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,600
and that not of yourselves is the gift of God,

714
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,760
not of works lest any man should boast.

715
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,800
Look at the book of Titus if you will,

716
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,880
turn just a few pages back

717
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,800
there from where you are in Hebrews

718
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,640
and look at Titus chapter number 3

719
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,080
and notice what is said here

720
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,280
with regard to salvation.

721
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,960
The Bible says in Titus 3 and verse number 5,

722
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,920
not by works of righteousness

723
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,120
which we have done.

724
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,640
We can't work our way to heaven.

725
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,760
You can't be good enough to get to heaven.

726
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,480
The Bible says there's none good.

727
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,840
No, not one.

728
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,400
Right? Romans 3.

729
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,800
For all have sinned and come short

730
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,920
in the glory of God.

731
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,680
We say not by works of righteousness

732
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,800
which we have done,

733
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,480
but according to His mercy He saved us.

734
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,120
By the washing of regeneration,

735
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,320
renewing of the Holy Ghost.

736
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,600
Aren't you thankful to be redeemed

737
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,640
by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ?

738
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,160
Notice this truth over in the book of 1 Peter.

739
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,880
I mentioned in 1 Peter 1 and verse number 19

740
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,920
where the Bible speaks about

741
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,040
the precious blood of Christ,

742
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,960
but look at verse 18 along with it

743
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,320
in 1 Peter 1, verses 18 and 19.

744
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,840
The Bible says here,

745
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,080
let's catch it all.

746
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,880
Let's look at verse number 17 with it.

747
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,680
Notice,

748
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,640
And if ye call on the Father,

749
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,280
who without respect of persons

750
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,200
judgeth according to every man's work,

751
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,560
past the time of your sojourning here in fear,

752
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,240
aren't you thankful that our God

753
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,960
is no respecter of persons?

754
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,480
He says in verse number 18,

755
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,640
For as much as ye know,

756
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,480
notice this,

757
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,600
that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things,

758
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,040
as silver and gold from your vain conversation

759
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,320
received by tradition from your fathers.

760
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,800
No, our redemption isn't with gold and silver,

761
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,640
with those things that are corruptible.

762
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,960
And we come to verse 19,

763
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,080
But with the precious blood of Christ,

764
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,600
as of a lamb without blemish and without spot,

765
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,000
who verily, notice,

766
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,640
was foreordained before the foundation of the world,

767
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,440
and was manifest in these last times for you,

768
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,360
who by Him do believe in God,

769
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,680
that raised Him up from the dead

770
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,920
and gave Him glory,

771
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:38,840
that your faith and hope might be in God.

772
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,440
So we begin to consider this truth

773
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,200
that is before us this morning.

774
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,560
And we understand there's only one way

775
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,800
to have that pardon.

776
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,640
Paul said it this way in Galatians 2.

777
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,960
In verse 21, he said,

778
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,720
I do not frustrate the grace of God.

779
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,640
If righteousness came by the law,

780
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:59,200
then Christ is dead in vain.

781
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,920
If we could keep the law and get to heaven,

782
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,000
there's no need for Christ to die.

783
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,240
But the reality is that as we looked at already

784
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,640
in Galatians 3, verses 21 and 22,

785
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,760
the law could not give life.

786
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,920
Therefore, Christ had to die.

787
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,920
And can I tell you this morning

788
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,120
that His death was not in vain.

789
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,880
We find that it was the perfect sacrifice

790
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,320
that was acceptable by God the Father.

791
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,000
And this morning as we look at the truth

792
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,440
of Hebrews 10,

793
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,640
I really hope that this morning,

794
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,440
two things would be the result of our study

795
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,120
of these first 18 verses of Hebrews 10.

796
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,880
Number one, I hope you would rejoice.

797
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,120
I mean, it's a wonderful thing to be pardoned.

798
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,080
Amen?

799
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,000
I mean, it's wonderful to have that remission of sins,

800
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,480
to understand that Jesus paid it all,

801
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,680
to understand that we are redeemed

802
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,880
by the blood of the Lamb,

803
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,200
that we can sing about it.

804
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,800
We sing plenty of songs.

805
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,920
Redeemed how I love to proclaim it.

806
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,960
Redeemed how?

807
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,400
By the blood of the Lamb.

808
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,080
Right? We sing about it.

809
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,280
And we ought to.

810
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,840
We ought to rejoice in the fact

811
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,680
that we've been redeemed,

812
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,120
that we've been forgiven,

813
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,360
that we have been pardoned.

814
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,600
What a joy.

815
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,080
The reality is, as I mentioned,

816
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,160
by that definition of remission,

817
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,840
it says letting them go as if they had never been committed.

818
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,200
Again, not in the sense of I'm going to turn a blind eye.

819
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,560
Not in the sense of we're going to sweep it under the rug.

820
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:23,320
But in the sense that Jesus paid it for you.

821
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,520
He paid a debt that He did not owe.

822
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,160
He paid a debt that I could not pay.

823
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,600
There's nothing I could do to earn that forgiveness,

824
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,760
to attain that salvation.

825
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,000
It was given to me as a free gift

826
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,200
because God Himself died in my place.

827
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,880
And I ought to rejoice in that.

828
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,760
And so should you.

829
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,920
I'm often mindful of the songwriter who said,

830
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,600
I'm not discouraged.

831
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,600
Why? Because I'm heaven-bound.

832
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,600
Amen?

833
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,040
I mean, listen, I understand there's some things

834
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,320
in this world that can weigh heavy on our hearts.

835
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,760
I understand there are some things that we deal with

836
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,240
and there are some things that are struggles

837
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,960
and they're weights and they're heavy

838
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,160
and they're burdens,

839
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:11,000
but we understand that those things are just temporary.

840
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,680
Right?

841
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,640
Paul said, while we look not at those things

842
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,520
which are temporal,

843
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,200
but at those things which are eternal.

844
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,760
In fact, in 2 Corinthians 4, verses 17 and 18,

845
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,360
when he deals with that wonderful truth

846
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,440
about having that eternal perspective,

847
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,280
he deals with, listen, he says,

848
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,320
our light affliction but which is for a moment.

849
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,720
Now, if you've studied anything about the life of Paul,

850
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:35,680
you understand that he dealt with quite a bit of affliction.

851
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,520
Amen?

852
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,760
He dealt with quite a bit of difficulty.

853
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,080
But yet when he looks at it in light of eternity,

854
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:45,120
he says, our light affliction but is for a moment.

855
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,200
See, this morning we had to rejoice that we're heaven bound.

856
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,120
The remission, the pardon that we've received.

857
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,400
But can I tell you this morning

858
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,640
that in addition to rejoicing over the truth

859
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,160
that is presented to us here

860
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:01,000
in Hebrews 10, verses 1 through 18,

861
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,320
I really hope that we'd be motivated to tell someone.

862
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,320
That we'd be motivated to tell someone.

863
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:13,200
The reality is that there's a world that's dying.

864
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,480
Every day.

865
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,320
Globally.

866
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,760
I understand everyone wants to talk about

867
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,640
the number of deaths from the pandemic.

868
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,880
I understand that.

869
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,000
But you understand that every single day,

870
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,160
over 150,000 people die around the world.

871
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,000
Every day.

872
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:36,360
The pandemic has brought a certain level of reality

873
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,120
to people with regard to their mortality.

874
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,640
They're more aware of it.

875
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,360
But you can look at studies.

876
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,120
In fact, I looked at some of them last week

877
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,840
in comparing death rates daily of 2020

878
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,400
to some previous years.

879
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,040
And really, the death rates are no different.

880
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,440
People are not dying at an exponentially higher rate

881
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,720
because of coronavirus

882
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,920
than people are just dying every day anyway.

883
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,080
Death is a certainty, right?

884
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,280
People are dying every day.

885
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,320
And we have an opportunity to give them this message.

886
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,160
Listen, that what you're doing,

887
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,200
the thing that you think is going to get you

888
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,160
right with God, it's not possible.

889
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,000
There's only one possible,

890
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,480
there's only one acceptable way,

891
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,040
and it's by the way of the cross.

892
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,320
It's only through the blood of Jesus Christ

893
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,600
that you can have remission.

894
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,440
And begin to understand that we're living

895
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,160
in the midst of a generation in which people are dying

896
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,120
and they're dying and going to a Christless eternity.

897
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,080
They're dying without the truth of salvation.

898
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,640
And who's gonna tell them?

899
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:45,600
Nobody from the CDC is preparing anybody for death.

900
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,360
Nobody from the World Health Organization

901
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,120
is preparing anybody for death.

902
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,560
They're giving them particular things that they can do

903
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:57,600
in order to potentially prevent getting coronavirus

904
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,680
and what have you.

905
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,080
But the reality is that whether you die from COVID

906
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,120
or something else, we wanna give you truth

907
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,240
on how you can be prepared for death.

908
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,280
In fact, I spoke to one of our elected officials

909
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,240
a couple months back.

910
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,680
And I said, with all due respect,

911
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,680
I understand exactly what you're saying.

912
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,600
I began to share with them the reality

913
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,680
of the likelihood of potentially contracting

914
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,840
and dying from COVID and the numbers

915
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:27,320
and how unlikely it was, though possible.

916
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,560
So the reality is one day you will die,

917
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,880
you'll die from something.

918
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,640
Are you prepared for that day?

919
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,320
They said, I think our conversation is over.

920
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,000
I was saddened by that response.

921
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
The reality is that in that response,

922
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,640
I understood that the truth was that

923
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,480
they were not prepared for that day.

924
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,920
You come in contact with people regularly.

925
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,360
I understand that it's a lot more challenging today.

926
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,440
I understand that.

927
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,320
But can I tell you that the gospel still works?

928
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,800
The gospel still works.

929
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,800
And as we would be purposed about taking a message,

930
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:10,400
Listen, this is the greatest offer ever.

931
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,160
That we say, listen, there's nothing you can do.

932
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,160
You can do all of that stuff,

933
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,120
but it's never going to take away sin.

934
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,860
You can go to church every day of your life.

935
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:20,860
You can give as much of your income

936
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,120
as you can possibly give.

937
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,780
You can pray whatever you want to pray.

938
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:25,400
You can do whatever you want to do.

939
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,600
It's never going to get you salvation.

940
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,760
It's never going to work.

941
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,640
Why?

942
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,020
Because God's plan said

943
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,460
that there was a required payment,

944
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:41,140
and that that payment was only the blood of Christ.

945
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:43,140
It was the only payment that was going to work.

946
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,220
And that's what results in pardon.

947
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:48,460
And so this morning, we have that truth.

948
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,140
And it's good for us to rejoice in it.

949
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,540
And we ought to.

950
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:54,900
We ought to rejoice that we're heaven-bound.

951
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,980
But can I tell you that we ought to purpose

952
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,060
to tell someone.

953
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:03,300
There's a, I can't remember the dean knows it.

954
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,340
Is it 91.3 dean?

955
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:08,620
That faith for the family, right?

956
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,140
The news around here.

957
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:13,200
And there's a particular segment

958
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,500
on that particular radio station,

959
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,060
and it's the Family Foundation.

960
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:18,900
I can't remember what it is.

961
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,740
But anyway, they end their program

962
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,700
by saying something like this.

963
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:27,700
Tell someone about, and whatever their show is called.

964
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,100
But more importantly than that,

965
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,860
tell somebody about Jesus.

966
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:36,260
And I like the way that they use that tagline

967
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,980
to end their particular segment,

968
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,620
because the reality this morning

969
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:43,300
is that we need to tell somebody about Jesus.

970
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,500
There are people dying.

971
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:49,140
And I'm mindful of the difficulties

972
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,300
that we are presented with,

973
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,500
but I'm mindful of the fact

974
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,020
that our God is still in control.

975
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,900
And that if we really ask God,

976
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,300
God, would you give me this week.

977
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:59,940
See, if we pray anything according to his will,

978
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:02,060
he heareth us, right?

979
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:05,180
Do you believe that you could pray today?

980
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:08,540
God, would you give me a divine appointment this week?

981
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:13,540
Give me an opportunity to speak to somebody about Jesus.

982
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,980
Do you think God would be pleased in answering that prayer?

983
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:20,020
I think he would, right?

984
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,780
Because he's given us that responsibility, that duty.

985
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,980
And so we purposely, and by the way,

986
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,460
if we pray that way,

987
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,580
I think we'll be more aware

988
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:32,860
of the opportunities that God gives us, right?

989
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:33,700
Why?

990
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,820
Because we're praying, God, give me an opportunity.

991
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,820
I know I've referenced before,

992
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,260
D.L. Moody, it's well documented

993
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:40,500
that he made a commitment to the Lord

994
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,940
that he would share the gospel with one person every day.

995
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,340
He was not gonna let a day go by

996
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:48,940
where he did not share the gospel with at least one person.

997
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,540
There are many a time that D.L. Moody

998
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:53,100
would have busy schedule, things going on,

999
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:56,220
and he would get up to his study late in the evening,

1000
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,500
and he would realize I'd not yet taken the opportunity

1001
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,260
to share the gospel with someone today,

1002
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,540
and he would leave his study,

1003
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:05,740
and he'd go find somebody to share the gospel with.

1004
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:08,100
No wonder God used him in such a way

1005
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,860
to see so many people saved.

1006
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:15,100
The message this morning that we have before us

1007
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,780
in Hebrews 10, verses one through 18,

1008
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,540
it's a glorious message.

1009
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,580
And it's a message that we ought to rejoice

1010
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,660
in having received.

1011
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:29,460
But this morning, someone, someone needs this message.

1012
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,380
Someone that's in your sphere of influence.

1013
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:35,900
There was a day in your life that you needed this message.

1014
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,180
Aren't you thankful this morning

1015
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,940
that somewhere along the line,

1016
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,980
someone obeyed the Lord to give the gospel?

1017
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,460
You say, well, I was born in a Christian home.

1018
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,100
Somebody told your parents.

1019
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,180
Well, they were born in a Christian home.

1020
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,660
Somebody told your grandparents.

1021
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:49,500
You understand what I'm saying?

1022
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,900
We can keep on going, we can play that game

1023
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,340
until somewhere we find where somebody

1024
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:56,420
gave the gospel to your family, right?

1025
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,980
No one gave the gospel to my grandparents,

1026
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:04,420
but I sure am happy that somebody gave it to my parents.

1027
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,820
I wasn't born in a Christian home,

1028
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:09,180
but my parents got saved when I was a teenager.

1029
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:11,940
I'm so thankful for it.

1030
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:15,700
And this morning, we don't just keep it to ourselves.

1031
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,620
We say this is a message that we're gonna proclaim.

1032
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:19,700
Amen?

1033
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:20,820
Jesus saves.

1034
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:21,740
What a joy.

1035
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,700
There's a remembrance of sin.

1036
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:27,420
And again, the people that are being written to,

1037
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:30,380
they need to understand that this system

1038
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,940
is no longer in place because Jesus has come

1039
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:36,260
and He has fulfilled all.

1040
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:40,460
What was in type is now available and it's the real thing.

1041
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:43,700
It's not any longer just a shadow of an image to come,

1042
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:44,860
a shadow of good things to come.

1043
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,700
No, it is now the very image.

1044
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:50,580
It's God in flesh that has died that paid the price.

1045
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:53,700
And you now have no longer a remembrance of sins,

1046
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,980
but you have remission of sins.

1047
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,220
And I'm so thankful for that.

1048
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,060
Let's pray.

1049
00:54:59,060 --> 00:54:59,900
Father, we love you this morning.

1050
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,540
We thank you for loving us.

1051
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:05,020
We thank you for this one sacrifice for sin forever.

1052
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:10,980
We thank you that in your wisdom, in your omniscience,

1053
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:19,060
you created a plan by which your creation could be redeemed.

1054
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:23,740
And we understand as we study the whole of Scripture

1055
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:27,100
that that plan of redemption required a payment.

1056
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,900
All of the sacrifices and all of the blood

1057
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,860
that was shed in the Old Testament,

1058
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:42,340
being a type of Messiah who would one day come,

1059
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:46,980
we're thankful that when the fullness of time came,

1060
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,380
that God, you sent forth your son.

1061
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,460
We're thankful that he was born of a virgin

1062
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:54,180
and he was made under the law.

1063
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:57,220
We're thankful that he came to die to redeem.

1064
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:02,460
We're thankful that that payment results in a pardon.

1065
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:06,100
Oh, what joy it is to be forgiven.

1066
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,660
God, if there's one present here this morning

1067
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,580
that's never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

1068
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:12,460
as their personal Savior.

1069
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:15,260
In fact, they're trying their own way.

1070
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:17,740
They're doing their own thing.

1071
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:19,780
God, I pray that you would help them

1072
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,100
to understand this morning

1073
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,380
that there's no more offering for sin.

1074
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:30,300
That that which was offered when Jesus offered himself

1075
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,300
is the only acceptable payment.

1076
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:36,540
Father, for those of us that have trusted

1077
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,340
the Lord Jesus Christ as our personal Savior,

1078
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,460
would you help us to rejoice this morning?

1079
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,620
God, help us to take it even a step further

1080
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,180
and help us to purpose to tell someone.

1081
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:51,540
In the midst of all that's going on in our society,

1082
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,340
Lord, I pray that you would help us daily

1083
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,260
to seek that opportunity,

1084
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,780
to pray, God, that you would lead our paths

1085
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,660
in such a way that we would have the opportunity

1086
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:10,300
to open our mouths and share the good tidings,

1087
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,380
the gospel of Jesus Christ,

1088
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:18,220
to proclaim that message loud and clear that Jesus saves.

1089
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:20,260
Lord, use us.

1090
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:21,980
Help us to redeem the time.

1091
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:25,580
Help us, Lord, to seek those opportunities

1092
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:28,460
and then to seize them as they're presented to us.

1093
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,060
We pray that many would come to know you

1094
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,740
as their personal Lord and Savior

1095
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:38,380
because of the power of the gospel message.

1096
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:40,820
Have your will and weigh in the hearts of your people

1097
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,900
over these next few moments.

1098
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,620
We pray that you'd move and work as only you can.

1099
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:46,460
We'll thank you for it.

1100
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,380
In Christ's name we pray.

1101
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,220
Would you stand with me?

1102
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:49,780
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

1103
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,980
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

1104
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:55,780
Two things that I've asked that would be a result

1105
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,740
of this message this morning that I've challenged you with.

1106
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,740
Number one, that we'd rejoice in our salvation.

1107
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:03,020
Number two, that we'd purpose to tell someone.

1108
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,380
This morning, as Kimberly plays,

1109
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:10,540
would you ask the Lord to work in your heart and life?

1110
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,900
The altar is open as Kimberly plays.
