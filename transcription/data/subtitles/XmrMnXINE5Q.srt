1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And we are thankful for the opportunity

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,119
to be gathered together this evening.

3
00:00:04,119 --> 00:00:06,400
And I got some friends from South Carolina

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,760
watching tonight, Gene and Ruth Boyce,

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,399
and not related to Holly,

6
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:13,000
it's actually spelled differently

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,880
than what her maiden name is.

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,200
But I haven't seen Gene and Ruth for years and years.

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,200
And Gene just recently had hip replacement

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,079
and they're friends of my parents.

11
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:25,040
We met them down there years ago

12
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,319
and they go to Harmony Baptist Church as well

13
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,280
and they're supposed to be tuned in tonight.

14
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,920
And so welcome to them.

15
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,840
I trust they're doing well.

16
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,560
Tongues Shall Cease.

17
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,259
That is the title for the message this evening.

18
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:39,599
On Sunday nights here for several weeks now,

19
00:00:39,599 --> 00:00:43,159
we've been dealing with this Ask the Pastor series.

20
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:45,799
And as we have had the opportunity

21
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:48,479
for you to submit questions,

22
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:50,919
and as I've mentioned, as we have this series,

23
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:53,439
this is the third time that we've done this,

24
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,720
is that we take your questions

25
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,919
and they become the sermon series through the summer.

26
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,919
I thoroughly enjoy it and I trust that you do as well

27
00:01:02,919 --> 00:01:04,519
and it gives us an opportunity.

28
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,919
I found this in life,

29
00:01:05,919 --> 00:01:09,000
many times if one person has a question,

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,199
there are many people that have a question.

31
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:14,279
And we, of course, have an opportunity

32
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:15,919
to be able to learn what God says.

33
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:18,639
And so the subject of tongues is before us this evening.

34
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:20,160
We find that the subject of tongues

35
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,440
is commonly brought up.

36
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,440
Unfortunately, I would say that there is much confusion

37
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,319
with regard to the subject of tongues.

38
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:32,480
And it's sad to me because I believe that the Bible

39
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,160
provides us with such clarity.

40
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,839
And so there's so much clarity that God gives us

41
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:41,919
in his word with regard to the subject of tongues,

42
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:45,279
and yet there's so much confusion in our world

43
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:47,400
with regard to tongues.

44
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,760
And so we seek, as we've said many times over the years

45
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,279
as Baptists, the Bible is our sole authority

46
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:57,400
for faith and for practice.

47
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,559
And so we must understand what does God tell us in his word.

48
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:04,720
The question that was submitted specifically has to do

49
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,839
with when will tongues cease or when did tongues cease?

50
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:10,479
And so that's why we find ourselves here

51
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,240
in 1 Corinthians 13 and verse number eight,

52
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,080
really as a springboard into the message this evening.

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,479
We'll be looking again, as we did this morning,

54
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,479
we'll be looking at a number of different portions

55
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,759
of scripture within the Bible

56
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,199
in order to answer the question.

57
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:27,559
But here in 1 Corinthians 13 and verse number eight,

58
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:30,679
the Bible says, charity never faileth.

59
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:34,220
But whether there be prophecies, they shall fail.

60
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,800
Now understand that it's not speaking about prophecies

61
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
not coming to pass,

62
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,899
meaning that they're going to cease to be given

63
00:02:42,899 --> 00:02:44,360
in the manner in which it's speaking here

64
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,559
of these sign gifts.

65
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:46,800
And then it continues and says,

66
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,740
whether there be tongues, they shall cease.

67
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,839
Whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.

68
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,479
For we know in part and we prophesy in part,

69
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,759
but when that which is perfect is come,

70
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,800
then that which is in part shall be done away.

71
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,960
When I was a child, I spake as a child,

72
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,639
I understood as a child, I thought as a child,

73
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:11,759
but when I became a man, I put away childish things.

74
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,759
For now we see through a glass darkly,

75
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:18,000
but then face to face, now I know in part,

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,960
but then shall I know even as also I am known.

77
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,320
And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three,

78
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,160
but the greatest of these is charity.

79
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,000
And so we see right in the midst of verse number eight,

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,360
the Bible says specifically,

81
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,639
whether there be tongues, they shall cease.

82
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,160
In order to answer the question

83
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,479
with regard to tongue ceasing,

84
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:42,720
I believe it's important for us to understand two things.

85
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,160
Number one, I believe that we need to understand

86
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,399
the purpose of tongues,

87
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,880
and then we also need to understand

88
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,559
the biblical usage of tongues.

89
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:54,800
If we can understand the purpose of tongues

90
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,899
and the biblical usage of tongues,

91
00:03:56,899 --> 00:03:59,119
then it helps us to be able to answer the question

92
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:02,720
with regard to what it says here in 1 Corinthians 13, eight,

93
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,720
whether there be tongues, they shall cease.

94
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,259
So we begin to dig in and we understand this evening

95
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:11,039
that within 1 Corinthians 13,

96
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,720
really beginning in chapter 12

97
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,539
and all the way through chapter 14,

98
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:18,179
the apostle Paul is addressing the church in Corinth

99
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:20,279
about spiritual gifts.

100
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,679
As he's addressing the church in Corinth

101
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,880
regarding spiritual gifts,

102
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,339
it's important for us to understand

103
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:27,059
some fundamental truths.

104
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:30,000
Number one, I would say that as we have

105
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,839
an understanding of the audience to whom Paul is writing,

106
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,320
this is a carnal church,

107
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,959
this is a church that's dealing with

108
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,239
all sorts of carnality and competition

109
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,359
and saying, I have this spiritual gift

110
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:44,799
and so I'm better than you are,

111
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:47,940
and there's all of this comparison and competitiveness

112
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,880
and all of this carnality.

113
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,920
And he says that he can't speak to them as unto spiritual.

114
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,739
Why?

115
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:55,579
Because they're carnal.

116
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:59,959
And so we understand the audience that Paul is writing to

117
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:03,160
and we find that as Paul is giving them the truth

118
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,500
with regard to spiritual gifts,

119
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,739
there was obviously some matter, excuse me, of confusion

120
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:12,720
because he starts in 1 Corinthians 12 in verse one

121
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,959
and says, now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren,

122
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:19,399
I would not have you ignorant.

123
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,760
And so what is Paul saying?

124
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,440
He wants them to be informed.

125
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,880
He wants them to understand these spiritual gifts.

126
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,059
He wants them to have an understanding

127
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:31,640
of how God is working and what God is doing

128
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,160
and the purpose of these spiritual gifts.

129
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,920
He tells them in the first chapter,

130
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,600
in chapter one in verse number seven,

131
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,480
so that you come behind in no gift.

132
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,239
And so we find that the gifts, they were gifted,

133
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:46,640
they had spiritual gifts, they'd receive them.

134
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,440
Just as we'd understand from 1 Peter

135
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,200
that the Bible says, as every man hath received the gift,

136
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,679
even so let him minister.

137
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:59,799
And so we find that if you're saved this evening,

138
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:02,820
you've been given a spiritual gift.

139
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,559
Now, Paul is going to give them instruction

140
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:08,779
because there's an element of ignorance

141
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:11,440
that they have with regard to spiritual gifts.

142
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,200
So fundamentally, it's important

143
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,440
that we have an understanding of spiritual gifts

144
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,320
generally, and then as we speak about tongues specifically,

145
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,700
it will enable us to answer the question

146
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,359
with regard to when tongues will cease.

147
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:31,299
I do not think that it's a matter of arguing

148
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:34,799
whether they will cease, for the Bible plainly says

149
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:39,040
that whether there be tongues, they shall cease.

150
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,700
So the question that arises is when will this take place?

151
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,920
Has this already taken place?

152
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,279
And we try to again, answer that question

153
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,320
by understanding the purpose and the biblical use of tongues.

154
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,440
Now, let me say this, the Bible gives us three books

155
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,720
that deal with, that Paul touches on spiritual gifts.

156
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,600
1 Corinthians is one of them,

157
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,880
the book of Romans and the book of Ephesians.

158
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,739
Those are the three books that you study

159
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:12,320
within the New Testament that deal with spiritual gifts.

160
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,920
And as those three books deal with spiritual gifts,

161
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,579
and as we understand in 1 Corinthians 13 and verse eight,

162
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:20,399
whether there be tongues, they shall cease.

163
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,519
Paul deals in 1 Corinthians much with the subject of tongues

164
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,440
but as you study the book of Romans

165
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,600
and as you study the book of Ephesians,

166
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,779
you will notice immediately

167
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:34,359
that the reference to tongues is omitted.

168
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:38,679
It's not even addressed in either one of those books.

169
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:41,320
Now, as we understand that truth

170
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,000
and then begin to try to process,

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,040
what does that mean to us?

172
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,559
Well, we understand that the Bible was not,

173
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:50,119
the way that we have the Bible,

174
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:53,119
the way that the canon of scripture is organized

175
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:58,119
is not given to us chronologically, all right?

176
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,200
So in other words, we look at the New Testament

177
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,160
and although Romans is in the Bible

178
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,799
before 1 Corinthians,

179
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:10,359
the reality is that 1 Corinthians was written

180
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:12,440
before the book of Romans.

181
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,079
Is everyone tracking on that?

182
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,720
Sometimes when we read the New Testament,

183
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,279
we read it as if,

184
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,559
and in fact, any of the portion of the Bible,

185
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:22,160
we read it as if it's chronological

186
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,480
that the book of Romans must have been written

187
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,959
before the book of 1 Corinthians

188
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,440
because it's in our Bibles in that order.

189
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,679
But the reality is that the book of 1 Corinthians

190
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:35,679
was written about 55 AD.

191
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,000
The next book to be written

192
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,440
with regard to these three

193
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,719
that deal with spiritual gifts

194
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,880
is the book of Romans

195
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,960
that was written two to three years later

196
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,520
between 57 and 58 AD.

197
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,520
And then you go to the book of Ephesians

198
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,880
which was written in AD 61.

199
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,919
So there's six years

200
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,840
in between the writing of 1 Corinthians

201
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,880
and the writing of Ephesians.

202
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,080
Why do I bring that out?

203
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,919
Well, when Paul says whether there be tongues,

204
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,880
they shall cease

205
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,400
and tongues is addressed in the book of 1 Corinthians,

206
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,719
but it's omitted in the book of Romans

207
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:08,799
and the book of Ephesians.

208
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:13,799
It seems as if it was already beginning to fade away

209
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:19,119
as the scriptures were coming into completion, all right?

210
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:20,760
Is everyone tracking with that?

211
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,880
So we find that as we study the scripture.

212
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,119
So what is the purpose of tongues?

213
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:27,320
In 1 Corinthians 14,

214
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,359
you're here in chapter 13,

215
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,320
turn to chapter 14 if you will

216
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,799
and look at verse number 21.

217
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,440
We'll read a few verses of scripture here

218
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,679
as we seek to answer the question,

219
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,280
what is the purpose of tongues?

220
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,159
Again, it's gonna be difficult.

221
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:42,599
It's gonna be challenging for us to answer

222
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:44,039
when tongues will cease

223
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:47,679
if we do not understand the purpose of tongues.

224
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,799
In 1 Corinthians 14 and verse 21,

225
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,960
the Bible says in the law,

226
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,440
it is written with men of other tongues and other lips,

227
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,200
will I speak unto this people.

228
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:07,200
And yet for all that, will they not hear me, saith the Lord?

229
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Wherefore, tongues are for a sign,

230
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,200
not to them that believe, but to them that believe not.

231
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,200
But prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.

232
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,200
If therefore the whole church be come together into one place,

233
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,200
and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned or unbelievers,

234
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,200
will they not say that you are mad?

235
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,200
But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned,

236
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,200
he is convinced of all, he is judged of all,

237
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,200
and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest.

238
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,200
And so falling down on his face, he will worship God,

239
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,200
and report that God is in you of a truth.

240
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,200
In verses 21 and 22, God makes it plain,

241
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,200
the purpose of tongues, that tongues are given as a sign.

242
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Notice in verse 22, wherefore tongues are for a sign.

243
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
Who are they assigned to?

244
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,200
Well, according to verse number 21, they are assigned to the Jewish people.

245
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,200
It says in verse 21, in the law it is written.

246
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,200
Who is the law written to? It is written to the Jewish people.

247
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
It says with men of other tongues and other lips.

248
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,200
You can go back to Isaiah and read this prophecy in chapter 28.

249
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Well, I speak unto this people, and yet for all that will they not hear me sayeth the Lord.

250
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,200
And not only when we understand the purpose of tongues is for a sign,

251
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,200
to whom, verse 21, this people, the Jewish people,

252
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,200
but in verse 22, it says them that believe not.

253
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe,

254
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
but to them that believe not.

255
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,200
And so we begin to understand the purpose.

256
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Why is it that God has given the sign?

257
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
To whom is this sign given?

258
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Well, it's given to the Jewish people, this people, verse 21,

259
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,200
and it's given to them that believe not, verse 22.

260
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
Then we say, why?

261
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Why tongues?

262
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Why did God allow for these apostolic sign gifts?

263
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,200
I taught a series in Sunday school a while ago,

264
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,200
and as I taught that series, I mentioned that as we studied through the book of Acts,

265
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,200
we looked at a number of things in which God gave us

266
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,200
with regard to the growing of the church, the foundation of the church,

267
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,200
and we used as a foundation from the book of Mark,

268
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,200
where the Bible says in Mark 16 and verse 20,

269
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
and they went forth and preached everywhere,

270
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:38,200
the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following.

271
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Amen.

272
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
So I want you to just think for a moment,

273
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
as the apostle Paul would go on a missionary journey,

274
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
as they were preaching the day of Pentecost,

275
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
as Peter gets up to preach,

276
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,200
we find that they're preaching, but they don't have a Bible like we have a Bible.

277
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
I stand up here this evening, I stood up here this morning,

278
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
I stand up here week after week after week,

279
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,200
and I preach the Bible, I preach the word of God,

280
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,200
but you can go back because you have a Bible as well,

281
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,200
and you can read and you can tell if these things be.

282
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Amen.

283
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,200
The Bible tells us in 1 John that we're to try the spirits,

284
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,200
and so we find that because God has given us a whole Bible,

285
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,200
you can go back and you can verify whether these things be so.

286
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,200
Peter stands up and preaches, Paul stands up and preaches,

287
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,200
they don't have a Bible like we have a Bible.

288
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,200
And so God, until the Bible was completed,

289
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,200
He allowed for these sign gifts,

290
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,200
He's confirming the word with signs following.

291
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,200
So as they're preaching the word,

292
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:50,200
these signs that follow are confirming that the word that's being given is true.

293
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,200
And that's the purpose that God would use these apostolic sign gifts.

294
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,200
You look at the Apostle Paul where he would heal people,

295
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,200
you look at Peter where he would heal people,

296
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
and you look at that situation,

297
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,200
but then later on down the road of ministry,

298
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:13,200
you find that Paul mentions people by name that he left sick.

299
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
He didn't heal them,

300
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,200
because healing them was not just his own volition of,

301
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
bam, I want to heal you.

302
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,200
No, the healing was confirming the word that was being preached.

303
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
The same is true with tongues.

304
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,200
So what was the purpose? Why did God use this?

305
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
And I want you to understand this distinction.

306
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
It's important in 1 Corinthians 14

307
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,200
that we understand to whom the sign is given,

308
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,200
because it helps us to understand why.

309
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
The Jews are always looking for a sign.

310
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
That's what the Bible tells us.

311
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200
The Bible tells us, in fact,

312
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,200
in this very book that we're looking at in 1 Corinthians,

313
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:56,200
the Bible speaks about the truth that the Jewish people are looking for a sign.

314
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
In verse 22 of chapter 1, it says,

315
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,200
for the Jews require a sign,

316
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,200
and the Greeks seek after wisdom.

317
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
So the Jews require a sign.

318
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
God's given them this sign of tongues.

319
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,200
So I want you to consider what's taking place.

320
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,200
The Jewish people, and as we study the Scriptures,

321
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,200
we find evidence of this in an abundance.

322
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,200
There was a great disdain for Gentiles.

323
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,200
The Jewish people, by and large,

324
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,200
they hated Gentiles.

325
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,200
They viewed them as dogs.

326
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Biblical. We see it. We understand it.

327
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Jesus was breaking down those barriers

328
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
because in John chapter number 4,

329
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,200
he said, I must needs go through Samaria.

330
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,200
The Jewish people would go around Samaria

331
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,200
because of their view of the inhabitants of Samaria.

332
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,200
And Jesus went through and he talked to a woman at the well,

333
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:01,200
which obviously was also something that was not culturally acceptable

334
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
for a Jewish person to do.

335
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,200
And he is breaking down that barrier. Why?

336
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,200
Because for God so loved the world.

337
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Amen?

338
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
And he talks about the church.

339
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
There's neither Jew nor Gentile.

340
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,200
There's neither circumcision nor uncircumcision.

341
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,200
We're all in Christ.

342
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,200
So understand that as the church is moving forward,

343
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,200
the Jewish people as a nation,

344
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,200
they rejected Messiah.

345
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
They said crucify him, crucify him.

346
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,200
The church in Jerusalem begins the day of Pentecost,

347
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,200
all that takes place.

348
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,200
But Jesus said that after,

349
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
but you shall receive power after that

350
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
the Holy Ghost has come upon you

351
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,200
and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem

352
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,200
and Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.

353
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,200
So the gospel, because of the Jewish rejection,

354
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,200
the nation rejecting Messiah,

355
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,200
the Gentiles are grafted in.

356
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
There's an amazing truth of God's word

357
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,200
and we find that the gospel is given to the Gentiles.

358
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
Peter is the first one.

359
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,200
Turn over to the book of Acts in the 10th chapter if you will.

360
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,200
He's the first one that God uses

361
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,200
to speak to a Gentile man by the name of Cornelius.

362
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Now, as we begin to understand

363
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:28,200
and look at this truth with regard to the purpose of tongues,

364
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:33,200
there was this disdain that the Jewish people had of the Gentiles.

365
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,200
But now God is offering repentance to the Gentiles

366
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
and yet there's going to be some Jewish people

367
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
that are going to say, wait, hold on a minute.

368
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,200
They're Gentiles.

369
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
They're not allowed to be part of this.

370
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
So it becomes a real problem.

371
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,200
So in Acts chapter 10, God gives Peter a vision.

372
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,200
I don't have time to study all of it

373
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,200
and read through all of chapter number 10 this evening,

374
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
but God gives Peter a vision.

375
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,200
In that vision, he tells him, rise and eat,

376
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,200
and he says, not so, Lord, for I have never eaten anything

377
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
that is common or unclean.

378
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,200
And what God was giving to him in this vision

379
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
was not so much about food

380
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,200
as much as it was taking the gospel to the Gentiles.

381
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
He tells them that someone's going to come

382
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
and he's going to bear witness

383
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,200
and Cornelius had sent some people, so on and so forth.

384
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:26,200
I'm going to pick it up in verse number 33 of Acts chapter number 10.

385
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,200
Peter has already traveled from where he was

386
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,200
over to where Cornelius is.

387
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
And the Bible says this in verse 33,

388
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,200
This is Cornelius speaking.

389
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Peter had been in Joppa.

390
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
It says,

391
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
This is an awesome opportunity.

392
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
See, Cornelius had seen a vision,

393
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
but in his vision it was sent for Peter,

394
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,200
and Peter's going to tell you what you need to know.

395
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
And we find that Peter,

396
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,200
because God was working in Peter's heart,

397
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Peter obeys the Lord and he goes to the house of Cornelius

398
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
and Cornelius says, I'm glad you came.

399
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
It's good that you came. We're all here ready.

400
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
What do you got for us? Isn't that awesome?

401
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,200
I mean, what an opportunity.

402
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
And we find that the Bible says in verse 34,

403
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Then Peter opened his mouth

404
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,200
and said of a truth I perceive that God

405
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
is no respecter of persons.

406
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
Aren't you thankful

407
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,200
that our God is no respecter of persons?

408
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
Praise the Lord.

409
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
It says this,

410
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,200
The word which God sent unto the children of Israel,

411
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,200
preaching peace by Jesus Christ,

412
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,200
he is Lord of all.

413
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,200
That word, I say, ye know,

414
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
which was published throughout all Judea

415
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,200
and began from Galilee after the baptism which John preached,

416
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,200
how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth

417
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
with the Holy Ghost and with power,

418
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
who went about doing good and healing all

419
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
that were oppressed of the devil,

420
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
for God was with him.

421
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,200
And we are witnessing

422
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,200
which he did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem,

423
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,200
whom they slew and hanged on a tree.

424
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Him God raised up the third day and showed him openly."

425
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
This is the gospel.

426
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,200
The gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

427
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
In verse 41,

428
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,200
"'Now to all the people, but unto witnesses, not to all the people,

429
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,200
but unto witnesses chosen before of God even to us,

430
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,200
who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.'

431
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,200
And he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify

432
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,200
that it was he which was ordained of God to be the judge of quick and dead.

433
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,200
To him give all the prophets witness that through his name

434
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,200
whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.'"

435
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,200
You ought to underline verse 43 in your Bible

436
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,200
and rejoice greatly for that Bible truth.

437
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,200
The Bible says that through his name,

438
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,200
there's no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.

439
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Jesus said,

440
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,200
"'I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

441
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,200
Through his name whosoever believeth.'"

442
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,200
I'm so thankful that the gospel is a whosoever gospel.

443
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,200
I'm so thankful that because of my heritage, my lineage, my nationality,

444
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:23,200
that I've not been excluded from being able to be a recipient of God's grace.

445
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,200
I am a whosoever and you are a whosoever.

446
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:32,200
"'For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.'"

447
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
And Peter says that through his name,

448
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,200
"'Whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.'"

449
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,200
Every single person has an issue with sin.

450
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
It's a universal condition.

451
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
It's a sin problem.

452
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,200
And because of our sin, there is a penalty.

453
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
We understand this.

454
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,200
The Bible says the wages of sin is death.

455
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,200
But the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

456
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,200
And so he says that you can receive remission of sins,

457
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:05,200
that forgiveness that is only through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.

458
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
Hallelujah.

459
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
So Peter's preaching the gospel.

460
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Cornelius and all these are gathered.

461
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
These are Gentiles.

462
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,200
They're gathered together and Peter's preaching the gospel.

463
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,200
And the Bible says in verse 44,

464
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,200
"'While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.'"

465
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Because they were believing.

466
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
They didn't pray a sinner's prayer.

467
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
They were believing it already.

468
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Sometimes we think that salvation is in praying a prayer.

469
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,200
But I'm telling you, these people, they received the word and they received it with gladness

470
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
and they were saved by the grace of God.

471
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
And the Holy Spirit fell on them.

472
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
"'And they of the circumcision.'"

473
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Now who are those?

474
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,200
Those are the Jewish people that accompanied Peter on this journey.

475
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,200
It says, "'And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished.'"

476
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
"'As many as came with Peter.'"

477
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Why?

478
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,200
"'Because then on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.'"

479
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,200
But how did they know?

480
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,200
Somebody can tell you, I have the Holy Ghost.

481
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
How do you know?

482
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,200
Now Ephesians reveals to us as now having the whole canon of Scripture.

483
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,200
But remember, at this point in Acts 10,

484
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,200
at the point in 1 Corinthians, Ephesians hasn't been written yet.

485
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Ephesians chapter 5 reveals to us when the Bible says,

486
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,200
"'But be not drunk with wine, where it is in excess, but be filled with the Spirit, speaking to yourselves.'"

487
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,200
It gives us what the evidence of being Spirit-filled is.

488
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:34,200
But here, why were these Jewish people astonished that on the Gentiles,

489
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,200
the Holy Ghost, the gift of the Holy Ghost was poured upon them?

490
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
How did they know that?

491
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Verse 46, "'For they.'"

492
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
Who's they?

493
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
That's the circumcision, the Jewish people.

494
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:51,200
"'They heard them speak with tongues and magnify God.'"

495
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:59,200
So God allowed those Gentile believers to speak in tongues

496
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,200
to show the evidence that they too had been saved,

497
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,200
that they received the Holy Spirit.

498
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Are we tracking?

499
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,200
Now, in verse 47, "'Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized,

500
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?'

501
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,200
And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.

502
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,200
Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.'

503
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Chapter 11, "'And the apostles and brethren that were in Judea

504
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,200
heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.'"

505
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,200
Now, these people in Judea, they're rejoicing.

506
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,200
I mean, the Gentiles got saved. No way.

507
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
They're not rejoicing.

508
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,200
They're saying, hold on a minute.

509
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,200
Jewish, Gentile, what's going on here?

510
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,200
It says, "'And when Peter was come up,' in verse number 2,

511
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,200
"'to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision,' Jewish people,

512
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,200
"'contended with him.'"

513
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,200
They've got a problem.

514
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
What's their problem? Well, verse number 3,

515
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,200
"'Thou wentest into men uncircumcised and didst eat with them.'"

516
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,200
Not only did he eat with them, but he gave them the gospel,

517
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,200
and they got saved.

518
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
Hallelujah.

519
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,200
But they weren't happy in Jerusalem.

520
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
They said, hold on, what's going on here?

521
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,200
We're Jewish. They're Gentiles.

522
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
It's a problem.

523
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,200
Do you understand the mindset?

524
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
I understand that we're living in America.

525
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,200
We don't really think that way,

526
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,200
of the Jewish mindset with the Gentiles and all of that.

527
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,200
But it's plain in the Scriptures to understand

528
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,200
the culture and the historical truth of what's going on.

529
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,200
So what happens? They're upset with Peter.

530
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
So in verse number 4, the Bible says,

531
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,200
"'But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning

532
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,200
"'and expounded it by order unto them, saying...'"

533
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
Now, Peter's going to rehearse everything.

534
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,200
We don't have time to read it.

535
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,200
But you read chapter 11, and Peter's going to rehearse

536
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,200
the vision, the instruction that God gave,

537
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
his arrival to the house of Cornelius,

538
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,200
his preaching, all that takes place.

539
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Pick it up with me in chapter 11,

540
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200
in verse number 15.

541
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,200
The Bible says, "'And as I began to speak,

542
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,200
"'the Holy Ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning.'"

543
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,200
Now, they remembered that.

544
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
"'So he tells them the Holy Ghost fell on them,

545
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,200
"'then remembered I.'"

546
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Peter says, "'I remember the word of the Lord,

547
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
"'how that he said, John indeed baptized with water,

548
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
"'but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.

549
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,200
"'For as much then as God gave them the like gift

550
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,200
"'as he did unto us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ,

551
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,200
"'what was I that I could withstand God?'

552
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
Peter says, "'Listen, it was obvious

553
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,200
"'that they were saved the same way we were saved,

554
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,200
"'and the evidence was there.

555
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,200
"'The people that accompanied me saw it, they heard it.

556
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,200
"'It's evidence that they were saved.'"

557
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,200
And so notice in verse 18, "'When they,'' who's they?

558
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,200
Well, that's the circumcision that we're contending with Peter.

559
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,200
"'When they heard these things, they held their peace

560
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,200
"'and glorified God, saying,

561
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,200
"'Then hath God also to the Gentiles

562
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,200
"'granted repentance unto life.'"

563
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,200
God's way is perfect.

564
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
Do you agree with that this evening?

565
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
God doeth all things well.

566
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,200
He knows.

567
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,200
And so God chose to allow this situation

568
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,200
to be the way that it was

569
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,200
so that the Jewish believers that would have rejected

570
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,200
the idea of Gentiles being part of the body

571
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
being part of the church,

572
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,200
that they hold their peace and glorify God.

573
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Why?

574
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Because the evidence was so overwhelming

575
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,200
that the Gentiles also have remission of sins,

576
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,200
that the Gentiles also have been granted life eternal.

577
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
Isn't that awesome?

578
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
And God knows.

579
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
And so God allowed for this sign.

580
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,200
Notice, if you will, in Acts chapter 15.

581
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,200
We're going to fast forward a couple of chapters here.

582
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,200
There's a few things that take place there in Antioch

583
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,200
and the situation with Peter going to be put to death

584
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,200
and then the missionary journey

585
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,200
that takes place in chapters 13 and 14.

586
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
We come to chapter 15,

587
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,200
and this is after the first missionary journey.

588
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
Paul goes into the region of Galatia.

589
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
There are churches that are established,

590
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
but there's some Judaizers.

591
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
What are Judaizers?

592
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
Well, they're Jewish people

593
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,200
that are trying to make these people Jewish.

594
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200
The idea is not becoming Jewish.

595
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,200
The idea is trusting Christ as your Savior.

596
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Since I have been born again,

597
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,200
since Jesus came into my heart,

598
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
we sang that song this evening.

599
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,200
So notice in Acts chapter 15,

600
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
this is the council at Jerusalem.

601
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,200
The Bible says this in verse number 1.

602
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,200
And certain men which came down from Judea

603
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
taught the brethren and said...

604
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Here's what they're teaching.

605
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,200
Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses,

606
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,200
that is, ye cannot be saved.

607
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
Now that's an error.

608
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,200
That is not true Bible teaching.

609
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
You do not have to be circumcised

610
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,200
after the manner of Moses

611
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
in order to be saved.

612
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,200
Amen?

613
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,200
This was something they were adding.

614
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,200
This was not true.

615
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,200
By the way, this caused a great stir.

616
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,200
It caused a big problem.

617
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,200
We were at dinner on Monday night.

618
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
We got to Tennessee.

619
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
We drove down there on Monday.

620
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
We go to dinner.

621
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,200
Maybe you've been there.

622
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,200
Maybe you know that place.

623
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,200
They have great potato soup.

624
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,200
And that's why we went to the apple barn.

625
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,200
And we go to the apple barn.

626
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,200
And our waitress notices on a shirt that I'm wearing,

627
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,200
I'm wearing a polo shirt,

628
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,200
and it has Hebrews chapter 6 on there

629
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,200
that Jesus is the anchor of my soul.

630
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,200
Mady made it for me a few years ago for my birthday.

631
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,200
And I was wearing that particular shirt.

632
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,200
And she says,

633
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,200
Are you Christians?

634
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
Praise the Lord.

635
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Open door.

636
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,200
We sit down and I say,

637
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
it's kind of interesting you ask us if we're Christians.

638
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,200
She says,

639
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,200
Are you a Christian?

640
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
She says,

641
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
Well, yeah, I believe in God,

642
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,200
but I haven't been baptized.

643
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
That's what she said.

644
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
That was her answer.

645
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,200
So she's busy.

646
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,200
She's a waitress.

647
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,200
We're there in the...

648
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,320
the restaurant, we place our order, she comes back, it's kind of slowing down, it's getting

649
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,160
close to closing time, and she comes back over and I'm looking for that opportunity

650
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,120
and I say to her, I say, ma'am, I say, let me ask you this, when I asked you if you were

651
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:18,440
a Christian, you said you believed in God but you haven't been baptized.

652
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,900
What do you mean by that?

653
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,840
What is the significance in your mind of being baptized?

654
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,880
She provided an answer and basically in her mind, she believed that it was important for

655
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,880
her to believe in God but that she had to be baptized in order to be saved in order

656
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,320
to go to heaven.

657
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,320
That's not true.

658
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,320
Amen?

659
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,400
That's not biblically true.

660
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:46,000
So I'm going to ask her questions and I'm going to say to her, well, if that's true,

661
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,700
and I gave her Bible verses, I'm going to share with her truth with regard to works

662
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,440
and so on and so forth, boil everything down.

663
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,000
Basically she thinks, if I'm a good person, then I'll go to heaven, but if I'm a bad person,

664
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I'm not going to go to heaven.

665
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,960
Now, a lot of people think that.

666
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,000
That's just not true biblically because we're all bad people.

667
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,160
We've all sinned.

668
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,880
For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

669
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,960
So we understand this universal condition of sin.

670
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,120
So I have this conversation with this lady, and as we're sitting there and we're supposed

671
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:20,960
to be having dinner, I finished eating earlier because I was hungry, and they're finishing

672
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,000
up and I'm talking to the waitress and I'm sharing with her and giving her Bible truth

673
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,960
and sharing Bible verses with her.

674
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,960
And I went to Galatians and I said this, I didn't have my Bible with me, but I was just

675
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,280
quoting scripture to her.

676
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:39,720
And I said, listen, the Bible says, Paul says, that if righteousness came by the law, then

677
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,160
Christ is dead in vain.

678
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:47,520
I said, I believe this night that as you're standing here, that you do not believe Christ

679
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,520
died in vain.

680
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,520
And she said, not a bit.

681
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,680
No way.

682
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:55,240
I said, and he died so that you could be saved.

683
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,200
He died so that I could, because being baptized isn't going to save me.

684
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,920
Being circumcised isn't going to save these people.

685
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,600
This was, these were the Judaizers.

686
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,320
So what happens, verse two, when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension

687
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,920
and disputation with them is a big deal.

688
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,320
They determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain other of them should go up to Jerusalem

689
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,760
and to the apostles and elders about this question.

690
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:21,800
So they, they convened this, this council and they're going to answer the question.

691
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,120
These guys are running around saying you got to be circumcised after the matter of Moses

692
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,120
or you cannot be saved.

693
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
And this is not true biblically.

694
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,600
And I mean, that's a big deal.

695
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
So what happens?

696
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,000
Well, Peter stands up and he makes some comments.

697
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,680
Notice with me in verse number eight, I'll back up in verse number seven.

698
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:43,960
And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up and said unto them, men and brethren,

699
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,200
we know how that a good while ago God made choice among us that the Gentiles by my mouth

700
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,600
shall hear the word of the gospel and believe.

701
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,360
What is Peter referring to in Acts 15 in verse eight, seven?

702
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,440
He's referring to what we just read in the life of Cornelius.

703
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,600
It's exactly what he's referring to.

704
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:05,440
He says that God determined, made choice among us that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear

705
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,500
the word of the gospel and believe.

706
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:13,680
So Peter is standing after much disputation or disputing takes place and he says, listen,

707
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,320
we all know what happened.

708
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,720
God sent me to the house of Cornelius and they believed, notice in verse eight, in God,

709
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,520
which knoweth the hearts, bear them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did

710
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,520
unto us.

711
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,800
How do we know that he gave them the Holy Ghost?

712
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,480
They spoke in tongues.

713
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,600
It was a sign for the Jews.

714
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,280
So it says in verse number nine, and put no difference between us and them, purifying

715
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,600
their hearts by faith.

716
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,880
By the way, I'm thankful there's no difference between us and them.

717
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,160
There's only one way to be saved and it's Jesus.

718
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,280
There's only one way to be saved.

719
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,620
There's not many ways that lead to heaven.

720
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,680
There's not just be sincere about what you believe and everything's going to work out.

721
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,680
No, there's one way.

722
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,920
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth and the life.

723
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,200
No man cometh unto the father, but by me.

724
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,680
Verse 10, now therefore, why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples,

725
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,880
which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?

726
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:18,800
But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be saved even

727
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,200
as they.

728
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,660
Hallelujah.

729
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:31,360
But understand that in Acts 10 and 11 and 15, that in each of these passages of scripture,

730
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:39,400
we see the purpose of tongues and how it gave evidence that these Gentiles were saved.

731
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,400
So here's what happens.

732
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:45,040
Oftentimes, people say, okay, well, then you have to speak in tongues if you get saved.

733
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
That's the evidence of being saved.

734
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,040
No, no, no.

735
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
Back up.

736
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,040
Hold on just a minute.

737
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,040
It happened in the book of Acts.

738
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,760
But understand that there were many people that got saved in the book of Acts that never

739
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,040
spoke in tongues.

740
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,640
So you can study through the book of Acts.

741
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,880
We don't have time this evening.

742
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,160
It's already 6.50.

743
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,160
We don't have time this evening.

744
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,720
But you can study through the book of Acts and you can read of other people that trusted

745
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:11,000
Christ as their Savior that did not speak in tongues.

746
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,360
Were they saved?

747
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,440
Absolutely.

748
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,640
They were saved.

749
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,720
But they didn't speak in tongues.

750
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,720
Why?

751
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,720
Well, maybe there were no Jews there.

752
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,600
Sometimes you see that to be the case and you find that there was no need for that evidence

753
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,380
to be displayed to the Jewish people because there were no Jewish people there.

754
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:32,700
And so you look at each of the situations independently and understand the reason, the

755
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,140
purpose.

756
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,900
So we answer the question, what's the purpose of tongues?

757
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,380
Then we answer the question, the biblical usage of tongues.

758
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,100
Turn to our 1 Corinthians 14.

759
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,700
I know I've given you a lot this evening, but look here in 1 Corinthians 14, if you

760
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,700
will.

761
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,700
People that talk about, well, when will tongues cease or have tongues ceased.

762
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:55,260
Those that would argue that tongues have not ceased and that they're still an active, valid

763
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:01,540
sign gift for today, they still have to answer the question, when are they going to cease?

764
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,860
So here's what I've often said to people, okay, if you believe that tongues are still

765
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:09,140
for today, which I don't, I believe they've ceased, I'll give you that in conclusion this

766
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,140
evening.

767
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:16,220
But if you believe that they're still in existence today, then you have to agree that they have

768
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:23,779
to follow the biblical principles that God has set forth for how tongues were to be utilized.

769
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:31,540
Because God put forth regulations, if you will, in 1 Corinthians 14 for how tongues

770
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,860
were to be utilized.

771
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,220
Understand with me that in 1 Corinthians 14, the instruction that's given in verse 26 through

772
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:52,700
40 is almost always violated in the modern charismatic Pentecostal movement today.

773
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,340
There are many times that I've said, hey, okay, so you believe that speaking in tongues

774
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,340
is for today.

775
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,340
Do you believe that there needs to be an interpreter?

776
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:02,420
Well, it depends if the Spirit wills.

777
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,620
Sorry, the Spirit has already willed.

778
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,020
How do I know that?

779
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:11,660
God told us in His Word that if they're going to speak in tongues, there has to be an interpreter.

780
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:15,820
So it's not if the Spirit wills at that moment, He already has.

781
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,340
Does that make sense?

782
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:23,660
And so we begin to find that if they're violating the regulations that are laid forth in the

783
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:29,820
Scripture for the proper biblical usage of tongues, we have to say, hold on, is that

784
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,700
appropriate?

785
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,700
Is that biblical?

786
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,700
Does that make sense?

787
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:38,540
So notice in verse 26, how is it then, brethren, when you come together, every one of you hath

788
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:43,380
a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation.

789
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,460
Let all things be done unto edifying.

790
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,460
What was the purpose?

791
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:50,420
In 1 Corinthians 12, He gives us two purposes of these spiritual gifts.

792
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:55,100
Number one is to honor God, and number two is to edify the believers.

793
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:59,260
Those are the two purposes of spiritual gifts.

794
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:03,740
He continues in verse 27, if any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two or

795
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:09,380
at the most by three, and that by course, and let one interpret.

796
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,340
But if there be no interpreter, let him what?

797
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:15,620
Keep silence in the church, and let him speak to himself and to God.

798
00:38:15,779 --> 00:38:18,740
Let the prophet speak two or three, and let the other judge.

799
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:22,940
We go through, I don't have time to deal with all of this regulation because I need to get

800
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:27,420
to the end, but in verse 33, God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, is in all

801
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,180
churches of the saints.

802
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,779
Let your women keep silence in the churches.

803
00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:34,419
You know what you find in the modern charismatic movements?

804
00:38:34,419 --> 00:38:38,299
Oftentimes, it's primarily women.

805
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:45,179
But the regulation is let the women keep silence in your churches within the context of tongues.

806
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:51,020
Verse 40, let all things be done decently and in order.

807
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:57,460
You find that in the modern charismatic apostolic ministries today that there's a lot of chaos

808
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,059
and confusion.

809
00:38:59,059 --> 00:39:05,340
There's a lot of lack of order and decency, and so we find that the regulations are provided.

810
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,700
Turn back to chapter 12 just for a moment, and I want you to look at two verses with

811
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:14,020
me because some say, well, it's a, you speak in tongues, it's an evidence of salvation.

812
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,000
We disagree because of what I've looked at in the book of Acts already.

813
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,580
Then others say, well, speaking in tongues is evidence of being spirit-filled.

814
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:25,720
We disagree because of what Ephesians says, because Ephesians 5 gives the evidence of

815
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,460
being spirit-filled in verse 18 through 20.

816
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:33,419
But then I want you to look at what the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 12 within the context

817
00:39:33,419 --> 00:39:35,380
of tongues specifically.

818
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:41,460
In verse 13 of 1 Corinthians 12, notice the Bible says this, for by one spirit are we

819
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:47,859
all baptized into one body, whether we be Jew or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free

820
00:39:47,859 --> 00:39:53,419
and have been made, and have been all made to drink into one spirit.

821
00:39:53,419 --> 00:39:59,220
Now if you're saved, we look here at 1 Corinthians 12, we look at what the Bible says in Ephesians

822
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,220
1.

823
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:00,220


824
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,580
deals with it as well.

825
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,140
If you're saved, at the moment of salvation,

826
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,000
the Holy Spirit of God indwells you.

827
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,260
At the moment of salvation,

828
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,860
the Holy Spirit of God indwells you.

829
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,880
The Bible says that our bodies are the temple

830
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,300
of the Holy Ghost, which is in you,

831
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,340
which you have of God, you're not your own.

832
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,940
1 Corinthians 6 deals with that.

833
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,820
And so he talks about, why does he use the terminology,

834
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,980
all of us are baptized?

835
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,500
Well, he's writing to a church,

836
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,740
a church made up of saved people.

837
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,620
But notice in verse number 29 and 30,

838
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,300
when Paul begins to list, and it really starts in verse 28,

839
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,220
about all of the particular gifts

840
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,940
and all of the differences of gifts,

841
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,660
he says, are all apostles, in verse 29?

842
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,520
Are all prophets, are all teachers,

843
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,500
are all workers of miracles, verse 30?

844
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,980
Have all the gifts of healing?

845
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,140
Do all speak with tongues?

846
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,820
Do all interpret?

847
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,640
You know what Paul's saying?

848
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,220
He's speaking with a level of,

849
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,100
here, dealing with this situation,

850
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,180
and really being somewhat sarcastic of saying,

851
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,580
listen, not everybody has the same gift.

852
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:01,820
We've all been baptized by the Holy Spirit,

853
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,380
we all have the Holy Spirit of God if we're saved,

854
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,900
but we don't all have the same spiritual gifts.

855
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,300
So therefore, for someone to say that speaking in tongues

856
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,480
is the evidence of being filled with the Spirit of God,

857
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,200
you have a problem with 1 Corinthians 12.

858
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,380
So the Bible, again, as I mentioned by way of introduction,

859
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:27,380
there's much confusion, but the Bible gives us much clarity

860
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,820
with regard to the subject.

861
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,680
Now that we understand the purpose and use of tongues,

862
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,960
we can attempt to answer the question

863
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,660
of when tongues will cease.

864
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,320
I believe that it's clear that the Bible teaches

865
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,900
that tongues will cease.

866
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,500
It says in 1 Corinthians 13, eight,

867
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,740
whether there be tongues, they shall cease.

868
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,340
Obviously, everyone that would even believe

869
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,340
in the practice of tongues has to agree

870
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,220
that they have to cease at some point.

871
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,540
I believe that the scriptures reveal

872
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:56,580
that tongues would cease when the New Testament was complete.

873
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,860
In verse number 10 of 1 Corinthians 13, it says,

874
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,300
but when that which is perfect is come,

875
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,340
then that which is in part shall be done away.

876
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,980
Now, I believe, and he talks in verse number 11,

877
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,060
when I was a child, I spake as a child,

878
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,700
I understood as a child, I thought as a child,

879
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,900
but when I became a man, I put away childish things.

880
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,300
He's talking about the church,

881
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,500
and he's talking about the infancy of the church

882
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,420
versus the maturity of the church.

883
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,380
And in those infant stages,

884
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:27,980
God allowed for these sign gifts to confirm the word

885
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,100
because they didn't have a whole Bible.

886
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,940
So then when the whole Bible was given,

887
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:37,180
there was no need for the temporary sign gifts

888
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,420
because the Bible had been completed.

889
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,640
Now, Hebrews chapter two and James chapter number one

890
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,060
give us some evidence to deal with this truth

891
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:50,060
of 1 Corinthians 13, 10 being the Bible being complete.

892
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,880
And there are some that argue

893
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,660
that that's the return of Christ, the rapture.

894
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:58,660
I disagree as you compare scripture with scripture,

895
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,760
and I'll answer that question in just a moment,

896
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,780
but in Hebrews chapter two and verse number three,

897
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,060
the Bible says, how shall we escape

898
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,880
if we neglect so great salvation,

899
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,820
which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord

900
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:14,780
and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him?

901
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,120
How was it confirmed?

902
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,220
Verse four, God also bearing them witness

903
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:23,540
both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles

904
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:28,020
and gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will.

905
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,580
And so we find that God was working with the disciples.

906
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,740
He was confirming their word with signs following.

907
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,620
And Hebrews two deals with that subject

908
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:40,860
and helps us to understand that sign gifts

909
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:45,640
were given to confirm the message that was being delivered.

910
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,820
James one in verse number 25 tells us this

911
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,340
as we compare that with first Corinthians chapter 13

912
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,780
in James one and verse number 25,

913
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:58,740
but who so looketh into the perfect law of liberty,

914
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,180
that's the Bible, and continueth therein,

915
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,840
he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work,

916
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,560
this man shall be blessed in his deed.

917
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,460
So if we understand the why,

918
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:13,260
to whom is the sign gift given?

919
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,540
And we begin to answer the question, when would it cease?

920
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,620
I believe that the scriptures are clear

921
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,220
that even within the context

922
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,220
that it's when the Bible is complete.

923
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,060
The argument, and some have said,

924
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,820
that it's no, it's when Jesus returns.

925
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,340
So then we would, and that's their validation

926
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,140
for why this speaking in tongues consists

927
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,260
or continues until the present day

928
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,040
because Jesus hasn't returned.

929
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,060
The problem with that is that we have to have

930
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,900
an understanding properly of what takes place

931
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,220
at the rapture and what the purpose of the tribulation is.

932
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:53,460
If the rapture is the removing of the church,

933
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,700
but tongues was a gift given to the church,

934
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,620
then at the rapture it would automatically cease

935
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,240
and God would not have to say

936
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,460
whether there be tongues they shall cease.

937
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,700
Does that make sense?

938
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,100
Because if the gift is given to the church,

939
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,300
and it is, that's who the gift is given to,

940
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,940
to believers, that makes up the church,

941
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,620
then as the church is raptured,

942
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:21,100
everything pertaining to the church ceases at that point

943
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,100
because the church is raptured.

944
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,220
There's no more church in the book of,

945
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:29,300
in the tribulation as we know it today in this church age.

946
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,140
The church ceases to exist in the same manner

947
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:35,020
that it exists today during the tribulation.

948
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:38,660
And so therefore, if God says whether there be tongues

949
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:43,500
they shall cease, I don't, it makes zero sense in my mind

950
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,420
why he would tell us it would cease

951
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,140
if that time of ceasing is at the rapture.

952
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,260
There's gotta be a different time.

953
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:52,660
And that time, I believe,

954
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:55,020
according to 1 Corinthians 13, verse 10,

955
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,780
is when the complete canon of scripture is given.

956
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:01,900
I'm so thankful to have a whole Bible.

957
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:06,420
And so I believe this evening that it's clear.

958
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,580
I know that there are people that differ on this teaching.

959
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,120
I believe, even as I shared with someone this morning

960
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,660
that asked a question about it,

961
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:16,100
as they saw the title, they said,

962
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,180
man, I'm not gonna be able to make it back this evening

963
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,180
but it's a subject that I'm very interested in.

964
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,620
And I believe that tongues,

965
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:24,380
one of the issues with tongues today

966
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:29,380
and still becoming somewhat of a dispute, if you will,

967
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,780
as to why people think that it continues until today

968
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,800
is because tongues can be manufactured.

969
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,140
Do you know that in the Bible

970
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:40,520
no one was ever instructed on how to speak in tongues?

971
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,700
No one ever desired, except for the carnal people in Corinth

972
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,380
to speak in tongues.

973
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,980
And we find that Paul said,

974
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:50,420
I'd rather speak five words of understanding

975
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:52,920
than 5,000 words with an unknown tongue.

976
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,220
And so we find that as we study the scriptures

977
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,620
that today there's,

978
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,580
hey, we're gonna teach you how to speak in tongues.

979
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,500
No one ever was taught how to speak in tongues

980
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,540
in the New Testament.

981
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,700
No one was coveting after that.

982
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:10,380
No, the spirit gives as he will to every man.

983
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,820
And we find that tongues can be manufactured.

984
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:14,020
What do I mean by that?

985
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,020
Well, someone can stand up

986
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,100
and say they're speaking in tongues

987
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,000
and you don't know if they are or not.

988
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:23,460
But no one's walking around healing somebody

989
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,700
without you knowing whether they were healed.

990
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:27,780
Am I right?

991
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,380
No one's drinking poison

992
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,740
without you knowing if that poison affected them or not.

993
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,220
People trying to handle snakes,

994
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:41,060
crazy people trying to handle snakes outside of their mind.

995
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,980
They're not shaking it off like Paul did.

996
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:48,100
What happened when he shook that beast off, that serpent?

997
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,260
They went from saying he was a murderer

998
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,860
to saying he was a God.

999
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:54,740
And you know what that allowed him to do?

1000
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:58,340
Preach the gospel and those people got saved.

1001
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,740
That was the purpose of the...

1002
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,820
Paul wasn't walking around playing with snakes

1003
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:04,980
and letting them bite him and showing that he's immune to it.

1004
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,480
No, it was a sign to confirm the word.

1005
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,400
Amen.

1006
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,680
And so tongues so often today can be manufactured

1007
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,440
in people looking at the fact that,

1008
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,960
oh, I spoke in tongues

1009
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,000
and some elevation of a position

1010
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,040
of being spirit-filled or otherwise,

1011
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,160
and you don't know if they are or are not.

1012
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,440
But you know one thing that's interesting

1013
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,360
about speaking of tongues in the Bible?

1014
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,140
It was always a known language.

1015
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,440
It was a known language.

1016
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,880
Every man heard them in Acts 2 in his own tongue.

1017
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,880
That's why they marveled.

1018
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,400
How is it that all of us are hearing in our own tongue?

1019
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,280
We're gonna go to Panama in two weeks.

1020
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,320
I don't speak but about 20 words of Spanish.

1021
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,760
I'm gonna need an interpreter.

1022
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,600
Why?

1023
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,920
Because I don't speak the language.

1024
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,920
I'm not gonna hear them in my language.

1025
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,920
They're not gonna hear me in their language.

1026
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,180
We're gonna need an interpreter.

1027
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,760
This evening, we see the answer to the question,

1028
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,560
but I say tonight as well,

1029
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:13,000
it's so awesome that in the plan of God,

1030
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,120
he allowed for this sign gift of tongues to be given

1031
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,320
so that the Jewish people would know

1032
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:23,280
that the Gentile people were saved the same way.

1033
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,060
We sang to start the service this evening

1034
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,200
since Jesus came into my heart.

1035
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,680
I hope you know tonight that you're saved,

1036
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,280
that you know for sure that heaven is your home,

1037
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,880
that you understand that you're a sinner.

1038
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,960
There's only one savior.

1039
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,120
His name is Jesus.

1040
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,240
For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

1041
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,560
I mentioned that on Saturday,

1042
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,160
this upcoming week will be 27 years

1043
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,360
since I trusted Christ as my savior.

1044
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,800
I'm so happy and so thankful to know Christ.

1045
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,560
And I was saved the same way anybody else

1046
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,240
and anyone else will ever be saved.

1047
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,680
And that's through trusting the Lord Jesus Christ.

1048
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,260
and has finished work on the cross of Calvary.

1049
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:04,600
It's not by any merit of my own.

1050
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,180
There's no righteousness that I could do.

1051
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,980
There's no good work that I could do or that you could do.

1052
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,400
It's only through Jesus Christ

1053
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,020
and to God be the glory for that wonderful truth.

1054
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:13,860
Let's pray together.

1055
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,480
Father, we love you.

1056
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,400
We thank you for loving us.

1057
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,600
We thank you for your word.

1058
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,600
And this evening, we've covered a lot of territory.

1059
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,980
And God, I pray that there's a measure of clarity

1060
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,480
that's been given,

1061
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,780
that God, you'd help us to understand

1062
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,680
the truth of your word.

1063
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,640
I pray, God, that if there's one here tonight

1064
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,480
that's not saved,

1065
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,560
they've never trusted Christ as their savior.

1066
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,520
I pray that tonight would be the night of their salvation.

1067
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,020
I pray the Holy Spirit of God would convict of their sin,

1068
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,820
of Christ's righteousness and of judgment to come.

1069
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,860
Pray that you'd give us an opportunity to take a Bible

1070
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,200
and show them how they could know for sure

1071
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,400
that heaven is their home.

1072
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,560
I pray, God, that if there's some

1073
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,480
that are struggling with this area of tongues,

1074
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,200
that, Lord, they would understand the simplicity

1075
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,280
and the truth of your word,

1076
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,940
the clarity that you provide us with.

1077
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,140
I pray that you'd move and work

1078
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,000
in the moment of invitation as only you can,

1079
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,180
and we'll thank you for it in Christ's name, we pray.

1080
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:05,380
Would you stand with me?

1081
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,280
As you know, at the conclusion of our services,

1082
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,100
we have a time of invitation,

1083
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,020
not intended to embarrass anyone or to pressure anyone,

1084
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,780
but to simply give you an opportunity to respond.

1085
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,580
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano,

1086
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,820
and as she does, the altar is open.

1087
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:20,860
If you're not sure of heaven,

1088
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,100
we'd love to take a Bible and show you

1089
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,480
how you can know for sure that heaven is your home.

1090
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,140
Maybe this evening, you wanna come and just thank God

1091
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,860
for his word and the clarity that he provides.

1092
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,300
Maybe you wanna thank God for saving you.

1093
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,420
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
