WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And we are thankful for the opportunity

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.119
to be gathered together this evening.

00:00:04.119 --> 00:00:06.400
And I got some friends from South Carolina

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.760
watching tonight, Gene and Ruth Boyce,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.399
and not related to Holly,

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:13.000
it's actually spelled differently

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.880
than what her maiden name is.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.200
But I haven't seen Gene and Ruth for years and years.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.200
And Gene just recently had hip replacement

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.079
and they're friends of my parents.

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.040
We met them down there years ago

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.319
and they go to Harmony Baptist Church as well

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:29.280
and they're supposed to be tuned in tonight.

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:30.920
And so welcome to them.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.840
I trust they're doing well.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.560
Tongues Shall Cease.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.259
That is the title for the message this evening.

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:39.599
On Sunday nights here for several weeks now,

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:43.159
we've been dealing with this Ask the Pastor series.

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:45.799
And as we have had the opportunity

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:48.479
for you to submit questions,

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:50.919
and as I've mentioned, as we have this series,

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:53.439
this is the third time that we've done this,

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:55.720
is that we take your questions

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.919
and they become the sermon series through the summer.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.919
I thoroughly enjoy it and I trust that you do as well

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:04.519
and it gives us an opportunity.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.919
I found this in life,

00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:09.000
many times if one person has a question,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.199
there are many people that have a question.

00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:14.279
And we, of course, have an opportunity

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:15.919
to be able to learn what God says.

00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:18.639
And so the subject of tongues is before us this evening.

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:20.160
We find that the subject of tongues

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.440
is commonly brought up.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.440
Unfortunately, I would say that there is much confusion

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.319
with regard to the subject of tongues.

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.480
And it's sad to me because I believe that the Bible

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.160
provides us with such clarity.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.839
And so there's so much clarity that God gives us

00:01:38.839 --> 00:01:41.919
in his word with regard to the subject of tongues,

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:45.279
and yet there's so much confusion in our world

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:47.400
with regard to tongues.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.760
And so we seek, as we've said many times over the years

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.279
as Baptists, the Bible is our sole authority

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.400
for faith and for practice.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.559
And so we must understand what does God tell us in his word.

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:04.720
The question that was submitted specifically has to do

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.839
with when will tongues cease or when did tongues cease?

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:10.479
And so that's why we find ourselves here

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.240
in 1 Corinthians 13 and verse number eight,

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.080
really as a springboard into the message this evening.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.479
We'll be looking again, as we did this morning,

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:20.479
we'll be looking at a number of different portions

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:22.759
of scripture within the Bible

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:24.199
in order to answer the question.

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:27.559
But here in 1 Corinthians 13 and verse number eight,

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:30.679
the Bible says, charity never faileth.

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:34.220
But whether there be prophecies, they shall fail.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.800
Now understand that it's not speaking about prophecies

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.800
not coming to pass,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.899
meaning that they're going to cease to be given

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:44.360
in the manner in which it's speaking here

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.559
of these sign gifts.

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:46.800
And then it continues and says,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.740
whether there be tongues, they shall cease.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.839
Whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.479
For we know in part and we prophesy in part,

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:59.759
but when that which is perfect is come,

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:02.800
then that which is in part shall be done away.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.960
When I was a child, I spake as a child,

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.639
I understood as a child, I thought as a child,

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.759
but when I became a man, I put away childish things.

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.759
For now we see through a glass darkly,

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:18.000
but then face to face, now I know in part,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.960
but then shall I know even as also I am known.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.320
And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three,

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.160
but the greatest of these is charity.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.000
And so we see right in the midst of verse number eight,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.360
the Bible says specifically,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.639
whether there be tongues, they shall cease.

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.160
In order to answer the question

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.479
with regard to tongue ceasing,

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.720
I believe it's important for us to understand two things.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.160
Number one, I believe that we need to understand

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.399
the purpose of tongues,

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:48.880
and then we also need to understand

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.559
the biblical usage of tongues.

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:54.800
If we can understand the purpose of tongues

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.899
and the biblical usage of tongues,

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:59.119
then it helps us to be able to answer the question

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:02.720
with regard to what it says here in 1 Corinthians 13, eight,

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.720
whether there be tongues, they shall cease.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.259
So we begin to dig in and we understand this evening

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:11.039
that within 1 Corinthians 13,

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:12.720
really beginning in chapter 12

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.539
and all the way through chapter 14,

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:18.179
the apostle Paul is addressing the church in Corinth

00:04:18.179 --> 00:04:20.279
about spiritual gifts.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.679
As he's addressing the church in Corinth

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:23.880
regarding spiritual gifts,

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.339
it's important for us to understand

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:27.059
some fundamental truths.

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:30.000
Number one, I would say that as we have

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.839
an understanding of the audience to whom Paul is writing,

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:36.320
this is a carnal church,

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.959
this is a church that's dealing with

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:41.239
all sorts of carnality and competition

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.359
and saying, I have this spiritual gift

00:04:43.359 --> 00:04:44.799
and so I'm better than you are,

00:04:44.799 --> 00:04:47.940
and there's all of this comparison and competitiveness

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.880
and all of this carnality.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.920
And he says that he can't speak to them as unto spiritual.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.739
Why?

00:04:54.739 --> 00:04:55.579
Because they're carnal.

00:04:55.579 --> 00:04:59.959
And so we understand the audience that Paul is writing to

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:03.160
and we find that as Paul is giving them the truth

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.500
with regard to spiritual gifts,

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.739
there was obviously some matter, excuse me, of confusion

00:05:09.739 --> 00:05:12.720
because he starts in 1 Corinthians 12 in verse one

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.959
and says, now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren,

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:19.399
I would not have you ignorant.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.760
And so what is Paul saying?

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.440
He wants them to be informed.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.880
He wants them to understand these spiritual gifts.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.059
He wants them to have an understanding

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:31.640
of how God is working and what God is doing

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.160
and the purpose of these spiritual gifts.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.920
He tells them in the first chapter,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.600
in chapter one in verse number seven,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.480
so that you come behind in no gift.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.239
And so we find that the gifts, they were gifted,

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:46.640
they had spiritual gifts, they'd receive them.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.440
Just as we'd understand from 1 Peter

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.200
that the Bible says, as every man hath received the gift,

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.679
even so let him minister.

00:05:56.679 --> 00:05:59.799
And so we find that if you're saved this evening,

00:05:59.799 --> 00:06:02.820
you've been given a spiritual gift.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.559
Now, Paul is going to give them instruction

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:08.779
because there's an element of ignorance

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:11.440
that they have with regard to spiritual gifts.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.200
So fundamentally, it's important

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.440
that we have an understanding of spiritual gifts

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.320
generally, and then as we speak about tongues specifically,

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.700
it will enable us to answer the question

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.359
with regard to when tongues will cease.

00:06:28.359 --> 00:06:31.299
I do not think that it's a matter of arguing

00:06:31.299 --> 00:06:34.799
whether they will cease, for the Bible plainly says

00:06:34.799 --> 00:06:39.040
that whether there be tongues, they shall cease.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.700
So the question that arises is when will this take place?

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.920
Has this already taken place?

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.279
And we try to again, answer that question

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:51.320
by understanding the purpose and the biblical use of tongues.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.440
Now, let me say this, the Bible gives us three books

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.720
that deal with, that Paul touches on spiritual gifts.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.600
1 Corinthians is one of them,

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.880
the book of Romans and the book of Ephesians.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.739
Those are the three books that you study

00:07:07.739 --> 00:07:12.320
within the New Testament that deal with spiritual gifts.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.920
And as those three books deal with spiritual gifts,

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.579
and as we understand in 1 Corinthians 13 and verse eight,

00:07:17.579 --> 00:07:20.399
whether there be tongues, they shall cease.

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:24.519
Paul deals in 1 Corinthians much with the subject of tongues

00:07:24.519 --> 00:07:26.440
but as you study the book of Romans

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.600
and as you study the book of Ephesians,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.779
you will notice immediately

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:34.359
that the reference to tongues is omitted.

00:07:34.359 --> 00:07:38.679
It's not even addressed in either one of those books.

00:07:38.679 --> 00:07:41.320
Now, as we understand that truth

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.000
and then begin to try to process,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.040
what does that mean to us?

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.559
Well, we understand that the Bible was not,

00:07:48.559 --> 00:07:50.119
the way that we have the Bible,

00:07:50.119 --> 00:07:53.119
the way that the canon of scripture is organized

00:07:53.119 --> 00:07:58.119
is not given to us chronologically, all right?

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.200
So in other words, we look at the New Testament

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.160
and although Romans is in the Bible

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.799
before 1 Corinthians,

00:08:06.799 --> 00:08:10.359
the reality is that 1 Corinthians was written

00:08:10.359 --> 00:08:12.440
before the book of Romans.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.079
Is everyone tracking on that?

00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:15.720
Sometimes when we read the New Testament,

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.279
we read it as if,

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:19.559
and in fact, any of the portion of the Bible,

00:08:19.559 --> 00:08:22.160
we read it as if it's chronological

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.480
that the book of Romans must have been written

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.959
before the book of 1 Corinthians

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:29.440
because it's in our Bibles in that order.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.679
But the reality is that the book of 1 Corinthians

00:08:31.679 --> 00:08:35.679
was written about 55 AD.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:38.000
The next book to be written

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.440
with regard to these three

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.719
that deal with spiritual gifts

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:41.880
is the book of Romans

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.960
that was written two to three years later

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.520
between 57 and 58 AD.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.520
And then you go to the book of Ephesians

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.880
which was written in AD 61.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.919
So there's six years

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:53.840
in between the writing of 1 Corinthians

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.880
and the writing of Ephesians.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.080
Why do I bring that out?

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.919
Well, when Paul says whether there be tongues,

00:09:00.919 --> 00:09:02.880
they shall cease

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.400
and tongues is addressed in the book of 1 Corinthians,

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.719
but it's omitted in the book of Romans

00:09:07.719 --> 00:09:08.799
and the book of Ephesians.

00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:13.799
It seems as if it was already beginning to fade away

00:09:14.719 --> 00:09:19.119
as the scriptures were coming into completion, all right?

00:09:19.119 --> 00:09:20.760
Is everyone tracking with that?

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.880
So we find that as we study the scripture.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.119
So what is the purpose of tongues?

00:09:26.119 --> 00:09:27.320
In 1 Corinthians 14,

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.359
you're here in chapter 13,

00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:30.320
turn to chapter 14 if you will

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.799
and look at verse number 21.

00:09:31.799 --> 00:09:33.440
We'll read a few verses of scripture here

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.679
as we seek to answer the question,

00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:37.280
what is the purpose of tongues?

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.159
Again, it's gonna be difficult.

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:42.599
It's gonna be challenging for us to answer

00:09:42.599 --> 00:09:44.039
when tongues will cease

00:09:44.039 --> 00:09:47.679
if we do not understand the purpose of tongues.

00:09:47.679 --> 00:09:49.799
In 1 Corinthians 14 and verse 21,

00:09:49.799 --> 00:09:51.960
the Bible says in the law,

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.440
it is written with men of other tongues and other lips,

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.200
will I speak unto this people.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:07.200
And yet for all that, will they not hear me, saith the Lord?

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.200
Wherefore, tongues are for a sign,

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.200
not to them that believe, but to them that believe not.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:19.200
But prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.200
If therefore the whole church be come together into one place,

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.200
and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned or unbelievers,

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.200
will they not say that you are mad?

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.200
But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned,

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.200
he is convinced of all, he is judged of all,

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.200
and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.200
And so falling down on his face, he will worship God,

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.200
and report that God is in you of a truth.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.200
In verses 21 and 22, God makes it plain,

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.200
the purpose of tongues, that tongues are given as a sign.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:01.200
Notice in verse 22, wherefore tongues are for a sign.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.200
Who are they assigned to?

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.200
Well, according to verse number 21, they are assigned to the Jewish people.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.200
It says in verse 21, in the law it is written.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.200
Who is the law written to? It is written to the Jewish people.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.200
It says with men of other tongues and other lips.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.200
You can go back to Isaiah and read this prophecy in chapter 28.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:26.200
Well, I speak unto this people, and yet for all that will they not hear me sayeth the Lord.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.200
And not only when we understand the purpose of tongues is for a sign,

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.200
to whom, verse 21, this people, the Jewish people,

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.200
but in verse 22, it says them that believe not.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.200
Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe,

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.200
but to them that believe not.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.200
And so we begin to understand the purpose.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.200
Why is it that God has given the sign?

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.200
To whom is this sign given?

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.200
Well, it's given to the Jewish people, this people, verse 21,

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.200
and it's given to them that believe not, verse 22.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.200
Then we say, why?

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.200
Why tongues?

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:05.200
Why did God allow for these apostolic sign gifts?

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.200
I taught a series in Sunday school a while ago,

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:14.200
and as I taught that series, I mentioned that as we studied through the book of Acts,

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.200
we looked at a number of things in which God gave us

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.200
with regard to the growing of the church, the foundation of the church,

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.200
and we used as a foundation from the book of Mark,

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.200
where the Bible says in Mark 16 and verse 20,

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.200
and they went forth and preached everywhere,

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:38.200
the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.200
Amen.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.200
So I want you to just think for a moment,

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.200
as the apostle Paul would go on a missionary journey,

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.200
as they were preaching the day of Pentecost,

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.200
as Peter gets up to preach,

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.200
we find that they're preaching, but they don't have a Bible like we have a Bible.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.200
I stand up here this evening, I stood up here this morning,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.200
I stand up here week after week after week,

00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.200
and I preach the Bible, I preach the word of God,

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.200
but you can go back because you have a Bible as well,

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.200
and you can read and you can tell if these things be.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.200
Amen.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.200
The Bible tells us in 1 John that we're to try the spirits,

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.200
and so we find that because God has given us a whole Bible,

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:23.200
you can go back and you can verify whether these things be so.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.200
Peter stands up and preaches, Paul stands up and preaches,

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.200
they don't have a Bible like we have a Bible.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.200
And so God, until the Bible was completed,

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.200
He allowed for these sign gifts,

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.200
He's confirming the word with signs following.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.200
So as they're preaching the word,

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:50.200
these signs that follow are confirming that the word that's being given is true.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.200
And that's the purpose that God would use these apostolic sign gifts.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.200
You look at the Apostle Paul where he would heal people,

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.200
you look at Peter where he would heal people,

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.200
and you look at that situation,

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.200
but then later on down the road of ministry,

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:13.200
you find that Paul mentions people by name that he left sick.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.200
He didn't heal them,

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.200
because healing them was not just his own volition of,

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.200
bam, I want to heal you.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:25.200
No, the healing was confirming the word that was being preached.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.200
The same is true with tongues.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.200
So what was the purpose? Why did God use this?

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.200
And I want you to understand this distinction.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.200
It's important in 1 Corinthians 14

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.200
that we understand to whom the sign is given,

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.200
because it helps us to understand why.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.200
The Jews are always looking for a sign.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.200
That's what the Bible tells us.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.200
The Bible tells us, in fact,

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.200
in this very book that we're looking at in 1 Corinthians,

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:56.200
the Bible speaks about the truth that the Jewish people are looking for a sign.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.200
In verse 22 of chapter 1, it says,

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.200
for the Jews require a sign,

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.200
and the Greeks seek after wisdom.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.200
So the Jews require a sign.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.200
God's given them this sign of tongues.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.200
So I want you to consider what's taking place.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.200
The Jewish people, and as we study the Scriptures,

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.200
we find evidence of this in an abundance.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:24.200
There was a great disdain for Gentiles.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.200
The Jewish people, by and large,

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.200
they hated Gentiles.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.200
They viewed them as dogs.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.200
Biblical. We see it. We understand it.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.200
Jesus was breaking down those barriers

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.200
because in John chapter number 4,

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:44.200
he said, I must needs go through Samaria.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.200
The Jewish people would go around Samaria

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.200
because of their view of the inhabitants of Samaria.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:56.200
And Jesus went through and he talked to a woman at the well,

00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:01.200
which obviously was also something that was not culturally acceptable

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.200
for a Jewish person to do.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.200
And he is breaking down that barrier. Why?

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.200
Because for God so loved the world.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.200
Amen?

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.200
And he talks about the church.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.200
There's neither Jew nor Gentile.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.200
There's neither circumcision nor uncircumcision.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.200
We're all in Christ.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:24.200
So understand that as the church is moving forward,

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.200
the Jewish people as a nation,

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.200
they rejected Messiah.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.200
They said crucify him, crucify him.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:35.200
The church in Jerusalem begins the day of Pentecost,

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.200
all that takes place.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.200
But Jesus said that after,

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.200
but you shall receive power after that

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.200
the Holy Ghost has come upon you

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.200
and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:51.200
and Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.200
So the gospel, because of the Jewish rejection,

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.200
the nation rejecting Messiah,

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.200
the Gentiles are grafted in.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.200
There's an amazing truth of God's word

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.200
and we find that the gospel is given to the Gentiles.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.200
Peter is the first one.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.200
Turn over to the book of Acts in the 10th chapter if you will.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.200
He's the first one that God uses

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:20.200
to speak to a Gentile man by the name of Cornelius.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.200
Now, as we begin to understand

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:28.200
and look at this truth with regard to the purpose of tongues,

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:33.200
there was this disdain that the Jewish people had of the Gentiles.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:38.200
But now God is offering repentance to the Gentiles

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.200
and yet there's going to be some Jewish people

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.200
that are going to say, wait, hold on a minute.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.200
They're Gentiles.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.200
They're not allowed to be part of this.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.200
So it becomes a real problem.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.200
So in Acts chapter 10, God gives Peter a vision.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.200
I don't have time to study all of it

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.200
and read through all of chapter number 10 this evening,

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.200
but God gives Peter a vision.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.200
In that vision, he tells him, rise and eat,

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.200
and he says, not so, Lord, for I have never eaten anything

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.200
that is common or unclean.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.200
And what God was giving to him in this vision

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.200
was not so much about food

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.200
as much as it was taking the gospel to the Gentiles.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.200
He tells them that someone's going to come

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.200
and he's going to bear witness

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.200
and Cornelius had sent some people, so on and so forth.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:26.200
I'm going to pick it up in verse number 33 of Acts chapter number 10.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.200
Peter has already traveled from where he was

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.200
over to where Cornelius is.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.200
And the Bible says this in verse 33,

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.200
This is Cornelius speaking.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.200
Peter had been in Joppa.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.200
It says,

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.200
This is an awesome opportunity.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.200
See, Cornelius had seen a vision,

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.200
but in his vision it was sent for Peter,

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.200
and Peter's going to tell you what you need to know.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.200
And we find that Peter,

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.200
because God was working in Peter's heart,

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.200
Peter obeys the Lord and he goes to the house of Cornelius

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.200
and Cornelius says, I'm glad you came.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.200
It's good that you came. We're all here ready.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.200
What do you got for us? Isn't that awesome?

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.200
I mean, what an opportunity.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.200
And we find that the Bible says in verse 34,

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.200
Then Peter opened his mouth

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.200
and said of a truth I perceive that God

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.200
is no respecter of persons.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.200
Aren't you thankful

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.200
that our God is no respecter of persons?

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.200
Praise the Lord.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.200
It says this,

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.200
The word which God sent unto the children of Israel,

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.200
preaching peace by Jesus Christ,

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.200
he is Lord of all.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.200
That word, I say, ye know,

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.200
which was published throughout all Judea

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.200
and began from Galilee after the baptism which John preached,

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.200
how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.200
with the Holy Ghost and with power,

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.200
who went about doing good and healing all

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.200
that were oppressed of the devil,

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.200
for God was with him.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.200
And we are witnessing

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.200
which he did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem,

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.200
whom they slew and hanged on a tree.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:10.200
Him God raised up the third day and showed him openly."

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.200
This is the gospel.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.200
The gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.200
In verse 41,

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.200
"'Now to all the people, but unto witnesses, not to all the people,

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.200
but unto witnesses chosen before of God even to us,

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.200
who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.'

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.200
And he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:35.200
that it was he which was ordained of God to be the judge of quick and dead.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:40.200
To him give all the prophets witness that through his name

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:45.200
whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.'"

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.200
You ought to underline verse 43 in your Bible

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.200
and rejoice greatly for that Bible truth.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.200
The Bible says that through his name,

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:58.200
there's no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.200
Jesus said,

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.200
"'I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.200
Through his name whosoever believeth.'"

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:12.200
I'm so thankful that the gospel is a whosoever gospel.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:17.200
I'm so thankful that because of my heritage, my lineage, my nationality,

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:23.200
that I've not been excluded from being able to be a recipient of God's grace.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.200
I am a whosoever and you are a whosoever.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:32.200
"'For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.'"

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.200
And Peter says that through his name,

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:39.200
"'Whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.'"

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.200
Every single person has an issue with sin.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.200
It's a universal condition.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.200
It's a sin problem.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.200
And because of our sin, there is a penalty.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.200
We understand this.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.200
The Bible says the wages of sin is death.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.200
But the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.200
And so he says that you can receive remission of sins,

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:05.200
that forgiveness that is only through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.200
Hallelujah.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.200
So Peter's preaching the gospel.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.200
Cornelius and all these are gathered.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.200
These are Gentiles.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.200
They're gathered together and Peter's preaching the gospel.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.200
And the Bible says in verse 44,

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:21.200
"'While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.'"

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.200
Because they were believing.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.200
They didn't pray a sinner's prayer.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.200
They were believing it already.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.200
Sometimes we think that salvation is in praying a prayer.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.200
But I'm telling you, these people, they received the word and they received it with gladness

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.200
and they were saved by the grace of God.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.200
And the Holy Spirit fell on them.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.200
"'And they of the circumcision.'"

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.200
Now who are those?

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:45.200
Those are the Jewish people that accompanied Peter on this journey.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:50.200
It says, "'And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished.'"

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.200
"'As many as came with Peter.'"

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.200
Why?

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:57.200
"'Because then on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.'"

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.200
But how did they know?

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.200
Somebody can tell you, I have the Holy Ghost.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.200
How do you know?

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.200
Now Ephesians reveals to us as now having the whole canon of Scripture.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.200
But remember, at this point in Acts 10,

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:17.200
at the point in 1 Corinthians, Ephesians hasn't been written yet.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.200
Ephesians chapter 5 reveals to us when the Bible says,

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:25.200
"'But be not drunk with wine, where it is in excess, but be filled with the Spirit, speaking to yourselves.'"

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.200
It gives us what the evidence of being Spirit-filled is.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:34.200
But here, why were these Jewish people astonished that on the Gentiles,

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.200
the Holy Ghost, the gift of the Holy Ghost was poured upon them?

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.200
How did they know that?

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.200
Verse 46, "'For they.'"

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.200
Who's they?

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.200
That's the circumcision, the Jewish people.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:51.200
"'They heard them speak with tongues and magnify God.'"

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:59.200
So God allowed those Gentile believers to speak in tongues

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.200
to show the evidence that they too had been saved,

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.200
that they received the Holy Spirit.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.200
Are we tracking?

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.200
Now, in verse 47, "'Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized,

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.200
which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?'

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.200
And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.200
Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.'

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.200
Chapter 11, "'And the apostles and brethren that were in Judea

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:27.200
heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.'"

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.200
Now, these people in Judea, they're rejoicing.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.200
I mean, the Gentiles got saved. No way.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.200
They're not rejoicing.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.200
They're saying, hold on a minute.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.200
Jewish, Gentile, what's going on here?

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.200
It says, "'And when Peter was come up,' in verse number 2,

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.200
"'to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision,' Jewish people,

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.200
"'contended with him.'"

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.200
They've got a problem.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.200
What's their problem? Well, verse number 3,

00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:00.200
"'Thou wentest into men uncircumcised and didst eat with them.'"

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.200
Not only did he eat with them, but he gave them the gospel,

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.200
and they got saved.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.200
Hallelujah.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.200
But they weren't happy in Jerusalem.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.200
They said, hold on, what's going on here?

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.200
We're Jewish. They're Gentiles.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.200
It's a problem.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.200
Do you understand the mindset?

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.200
I understand that we're living in America.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.200
We don't really think that way,

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.200
of the Jewish mindset with the Gentiles and all of that.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.200
But it's plain in the Scriptures to understand

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.200
the culture and the historical truth of what's going on.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.200
So what happens? They're upset with Peter.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.200
So in verse number 4, the Bible says,

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:39.200
"'But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:43.200
"'and expounded it by order unto them, saying...'"

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.200
Now, Peter's going to rehearse everything.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.200
We don't have time to read it.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.200
But you read chapter 11, and Peter's going to rehearse

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.200
the vision, the instruction that God gave,

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.200
his arrival to the house of Cornelius,

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.200
his preaching, all that takes place.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.200
Pick it up with me in chapter 11,

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.200
in verse number 15.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.200
The Bible says, "'And as I began to speak,

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:09.200
"'the Holy Ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning.'"

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.200
Now, they remembered that.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.200
"'So he tells them the Holy Ghost fell on them,

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.200
"'then remembered I.'"

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.200
Peter says, "'I remember the word of the Lord,

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.200
"'how that he said, John indeed baptized with water,

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.200
"'but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.200
"'For as much then as God gave them the like gift

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.200
"'as he did unto us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:30.200
"'what was I that I could withstand God?'

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.200
Peter says, "'Listen, it was obvious

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.200
"'that they were saved the same way we were saved,

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.200
"'and the evidence was there.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.200
"'The people that accompanied me saw it, they heard it.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.200
"'It's evidence that they were saved.'"

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.200
And so notice in verse 18, "'When they,'' who's they?

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.200
Well, that's the circumcision that we're contending with Peter.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.200
"'When they heard these things, they held their peace

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.200
"'and glorified God, saying,

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.200
"'Then hath God also to the Gentiles

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:04.200
"'granted repentance unto life.'"

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.200
God's way is perfect.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.200
Do you agree with that this evening?

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.200
God doeth all things well.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.200
He knows.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:16.200
And so God chose to allow this situation

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.200
to be the way that it was

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:22.200
so that the Jewish believers that would have rejected

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.200
the idea of Gentiles being part of the body

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.200
being part of the church,

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:31.200
that they hold their peace and glorify God.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.200
Why?

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.200
Because the evidence was so overwhelming

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.200
that the Gentiles also have remission of sins,

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:43.200
that the Gentiles also have been granted life eternal.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.200
Isn't that awesome?

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.200
And God knows.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.200
And so God allowed for this sign.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.200
Notice, if you will, in Acts chapter 15.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.200
We're going to fast forward a couple of chapters here.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:57.200
There's a few things that take place there in Antioch

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:01.200
and the situation with Peter going to be put to death

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.200
and then the missionary journey

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.200
that takes place in chapters 13 and 14.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.200
We come to chapter 15,

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.200
and this is after the first missionary journey.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.200
Paul goes into the region of Galatia.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.200
There are churches that are established,

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.200
but there's some Judaizers.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.200
What are Judaizers?

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.200
Well, they're Jewish people

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.200
that are trying to make these people Jewish.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.200
The idea is not becoming Jewish.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.200
The idea is trusting Christ as your Savior.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.200
Since I have been born again,

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.200
since Jesus came into my heart,

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.200
we sang that song this evening.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.200
So notice in Acts chapter 15,

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.200
this is the council at Jerusalem.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.200
The Bible says this in verse number 1.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.200
And certain men which came down from Judea

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.200
taught the brethren and said...

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.200
Here's what they're teaching.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:49.200
Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses,

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:53.200
that is, ye cannot be saved.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.200
Now that's an error.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.200
That is not true Bible teaching.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.200
You do not have to be circumcised

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.200
after the manner of Moses

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.200
in order to be saved.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.200
Amen?

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.200
This was something they were adding.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.200
This was not true.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.200
By the way, this caused a great stir.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.200
It caused a big problem.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.200
We were at dinner on Monday night.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.200
We got to Tennessee.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.200
We drove down there on Monday.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.200
We go to dinner.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.200
Maybe you've been there.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.200
Maybe you know that place.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.200
They have great potato soup.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.200
And that's why we went to the apple barn.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.200
And we go to the apple barn.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.200
And our waitress notices on a shirt that I'm wearing,

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.200
I'm wearing a polo shirt,

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.200
and it has Hebrews chapter 6 on there

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.200
that Jesus is the anchor of my soul.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.200
Mady made it for me a few years ago for my birthday.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.200
And I was wearing that particular shirt.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.200
And she says,

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.200
Are you Christians?

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.200
Praise the Lord.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.200
Open door.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.200
We sit down and I say,

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.200
it's kind of interesting you ask us if we're Christians.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.200
She says,

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.200
Are you a Christian?

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.200
She says,

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.200
Well, yeah, I believe in God,

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.200
but I haven't been baptized.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.200
That's what she said.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.200
That was her answer.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.200
So she's busy.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.200
She's a waitress.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.200
We're there in the...

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:04.320
the restaurant, we place our order, she comes back, it's kind of slowing down, it's getting

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:08.160
close to closing time, and she comes back over and I'm looking for that opportunity

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:12.120
and I say to her, I say, ma'am, I say, let me ask you this, when I asked you if you were

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:18.440
a Christian, you said you believed in God but you haven't been baptized.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.900
What do you mean by that?

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:25.840
What is the significance in your mind of being baptized?

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:31.880
She provided an answer and basically in her mind, she believed that it was important for

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:35.880
her to believe in God but that she had to be baptized in order to be saved in order

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.320
to go to heaven.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.320
That's not true.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.320
Amen?

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.400
That's not biblically true.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:46.000
So I'm going to ask her questions and I'm going to say to her, well, if that's true,

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.700
and I gave her Bible verses, I'm going to share with her truth with regard to works

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.440
and so on and so forth, boil everything down.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:58.000
Basically she thinks, if I'm a good person, then I'll go to heaven, but if I'm a bad person,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
I'm not going to go to heaven.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.960
Now, a lot of people think that.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:06.000
That's just not true biblically because we're all bad people.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.160
We've all sinned.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.880
For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.960
So we understand this universal condition of sin.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:16.120
So I have this conversation with this lady, and as we're sitting there and we're supposed

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:20.960
to be having dinner, I finished eating earlier because I was hungry, and they're finishing

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:26.000
up and I'm talking to the waitress and I'm sharing with her and giving her Bible truth

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.960
and sharing Bible verses with her.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.960
And I went to Galatians and I said this, I didn't have my Bible with me, but I was just

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.280
quoting scripture to her.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:39.720
And I said, listen, the Bible says, Paul says, that if righteousness came by the law, then

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.160
Christ is dead in vain.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:47.520
I said, I believe this night that as you're standing here, that you do not believe Christ

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.520
died in vain.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.520
And she said, not a bit.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.680
No way.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:55.240
I said, and he died so that you could be saved.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:58.200
He died so that I could, because being baptized isn't going to save me.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.920
Being circumcised isn't going to save these people.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.600
This was, these were the Judaizers.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:07.320
So what happens, verse two, when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.920
and disputation with them is a big deal.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:14.320
They determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain other of them should go up to Jerusalem

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.760
and to the apostles and elders about this question.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:21.800
So they, they convened this, this council and they're going to answer the question.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.120
These guys are running around saying you got to be circumcised after the matter of Moses

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.120
or you cannot be saved.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.120
And this is not true biblically.

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.600
And I mean, that's a big deal.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.600
So what happens?

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:34.000
Well, Peter stands up and he makes some comments.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.680
Notice with me in verse number eight, I'll back up in verse number seven.

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:43.960
And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up and said unto them, men and brethren,

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:48.200
we know how that a good while ago God made choice among us that the Gentiles by my mouth

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.600
shall hear the word of the gospel and believe.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:54.360
What is Peter referring to in Acts 15 in verse eight, seven?

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:57.440
He's referring to what we just read in the life of Cornelius.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.600
It's exactly what he's referring to.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:05.440
He says that God determined, made choice among us that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.500
the word of the gospel and believe.

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:13.680
So Peter is standing after much disputation or disputing takes place and he says, listen,

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.320
we all know what happened.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:20.720
God sent me to the house of Cornelius and they believed, notice in verse eight, in God,

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:24.520
which knoweth the hearts, bear them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.520
unto us.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.800
How do we know that he gave them the Holy Ghost?

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.480
They spoke in tongues.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.600
It was a sign for the Jews.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.280
So it says in verse number nine, and put no difference between us and them, purifying

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.600
their hearts by faith.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.880
By the way, I'm thankful there's no difference between us and them.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:48.160
There's only one way to be saved and it's Jesus.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.280
There's only one way to be saved.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.620
There's not many ways that lead to heaven.

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.680
There's not just be sincere about what you believe and everything's going to work out.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.680
No, there's one way.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:00.920
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth and the life.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.200
No man cometh unto the father, but by me.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:08.680
Verse 10, now therefore, why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples,

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.880
which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:18.800
But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be saved even

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.200
as they.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.660
Hallelujah.

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:31.360
But understand that in Acts 10 and 11 and 15, that in each of these passages of scripture,

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:39.400
we see the purpose of tongues and how it gave evidence that these Gentiles were saved.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.400
So here's what happens.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:45.040
Oftentimes, people say, okay, well, then you have to speak in tongues if you get saved.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.040
That's the evidence of being saved.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.040
No, no, no.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.040
Back up.

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.040
Hold on just a minute.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.040
It happened in the book of Acts.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:53.760
But understand that there were many people that got saved in the book of Acts that never

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:57.040
spoke in tongues.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.640
So you can study through the book of Acts.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.880
We don't have time this evening.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.160
It's already 6.50.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.160
We don't have time this evening.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.720
But you can study through the book of Acts and you can read of other people that trusted

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:11.000
Christ as their Savior that did not speak in tongues.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.360
Were they saved?

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.440
Absolutely.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.640
They were saved.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.720
But they didn't speak in tongues.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.720
Why?

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:17.720
Well, maybe there were no Jews there.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:23.600
Sometimes you see that to be the case and you find that there was no need for that evidence

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.380
to be displayed to the Jewish people because there were no Jewish people there.

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:32.700
And so you look at each of the situations independently and understand the reason, the

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.140
purpose.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:35.900
So we answer the question, what's the purpose of tongues?

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.380
Then we answer the question, the biblical usage of tongues.

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:40.100
Turn to our 1 Corinthians 14.

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:43.700
I know I've given you a lot this evening, but look here in 1 Corinthians 14, if you

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:44.700
will.

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.700
People that talk about, well, when will tongues cease or have tongues ceased.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:55.260
Those that would argue that tongues have not ceased and that they're still an active, valid

00:35:55.260 --> 00:36:01.540
sign gift for today, they still have to answer the question, when are they going to cease?

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.860
So here's what I've often said to people, okay, if you believe that tongues are still

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:09.140
for today, which I don't, I believe they've ceased, I'll give you that in conclusion this

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:10.140
evening.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:16.220
But if you believe that they're still in existence today, then you have to agree that they have

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:23.779
to follow the biblical principles that God has set forth for how tongues were to be utilized.

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:31.540
Because God put forth regulations, if you will, in 1 Corinthians 14 for how tongues

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:34.860
were to be utilized.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:39.220
Understand with me that in 1 Corinthians 14, the instruction that's given in verse 26 through

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:52.700
40 is almost always violated in the modern charismatic Pentecostal movement today.

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:56.340
There are many times that I've said, hey, okay, so you believe that speaking in tongues

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:57.340
is for today.

00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.340
Do you believe that there needs to be an interpreter?

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:02.420
Well, it depends if the Spirit wills.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.620
Sorry, the Spirit has already willed.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.020
How do I know that?

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:11.660
God told us in His Word that if they're going to speak in tongues, there has to be an interpreter.

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:15.820
So it's not if the Spirit wills at that moment, He already has.

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.340
Does that make sense?

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:23.660
And so we begin to find that if they're violating the regulations that are laid forth in the

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:29.820
Scripture for the proper biblical usage of tongues, we have to say, hold on, is that

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.700
appropriate?

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:32.700
Is that biblical?

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:33.700
Does that make sense?

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:38.540
So notice in verse 26, how is it then, brethren, when you come together, every one of you hath

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:43.380
a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.460
Let all things be done unto edifying.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:46.460
What was the purpose?

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:50.420
In 1 Corinthians 12, He gives us two purposes of these spiritual gifts.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:55.100
Number one is to honor God, and number two is to edify the believers.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:59.260
Those are the two purposes of spiritual gifts.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:03.740
He continues in verse 27, if any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two or

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:09.380
at the most by three, and that by course, and let one interpret.

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.340
But if there be no interpreter, let him what?

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:15.620
Keep silence in the church, and let him speak to himself and to God.

00:38:15.779 --> 00:38:18.740
Let the prophet speak two or three, and let the other judge.

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:22.940
We go through, I don't have time to deal with all of this regulation because I need to get

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:27.420
to the end, but in verse 33, God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, is in all

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.180
churches of the saints.

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:31.779
Let your women keep silence in the churches.

00:38:31.779 --> 00:38:34.419
You know what you find in the modern charismatic movements?

00:38:34.419 --> 00:38:38.299
Oftentimes, it's primarily women.

00:38:38.299 --> 00:38:45.179
But the regulation is let the women keep silence in your churches within the context of tongues.

00:38:45.179 --> 00:38:51.020
Verse 40, let all things be done decently and in order.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:57.460
You find that in the modern charismatic apostolic ministries today that there's a lot of chaos

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.059
and confusion.

00:38:59.059 --> 00:39:05.340
There's a lot of lack of order and decency, and so we find that the regulations are provided.

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:08.700
Turn back to chapter 12 just for a moment, and I want you to look at two verses with

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:14.020
me because some say, well, it's a, you speak in tongues, it's an evidence of salvation.

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:17.000
We disagree because of what I've looked at in the book of Acts already.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.580
Then others say, well, speaking in tongues is evidence of being spirit-filled.

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:25.720
We disagree because of what Ephesians says, because Ephesians 5 gives the evidence of

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.460
being spirit-filled in verse 18 through 20.

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:33.419
But then I want you to look at what the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 12 within the context

00:39:33.419 --> 00:39:35.380
of tongues specifically.

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:41.460
In verse 13 of 1 Corinthians 12, notice the Bible says this, for by one spirit are we

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:47.859
all baptized into one body, whether we be Jew or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free

00:39:47.859 --> 00:39:53.419
and have been made, and have been all made to drink into one spirit.

00:39:53.419 --> 00:39:59.220
Now if you're saved, we look here at 1 Corinthians 12, we look at what the Bible says in Ephesians

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:00.220
1.

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:00.220


00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.580
deals with it as well.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:05.140
If you're saved, at the moment of salvation,

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:07.000
the Holy Spirit of God indwells you.

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.260
At the moment of salvation,

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:11.860
the Holy Spirit of God indwells you.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:13.880
The Bible says that our bodies are the temple

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.300
of the Holy Ghost, which is in you,

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.340
which you have of God, you're not your own.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:18.940
1 Corinthians 6 deals with that.

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:21.820
And so he talks about, why does he use the terminology,

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:22.980
all of us are baptized?

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:24.500
Well, he's writing to a church,

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.740
a church made up of saved people.

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:28.620
But notice in verse number 29 and 30,

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:31.300
when Paul begins to list, and it really starts in verse 28,

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.220
about all of the particular gifts

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.940
and all of the differences of gifts,

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:38.660
he says, are all apostles, in verse 29?

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.520
Are all prophets, are all teachers,

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.500
are all workers of miracles, verse 30?

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:43.980
Have all the gifts of healing?

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:45.140
Do all speak with tongues?

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:46.820
Do all interpret?

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:47.640
You know what Paul's saying?

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.220
He's speaking with a level of,

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:53.100
here, dealing with this situation,

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.180
and really being somewhat sarcastic of saying,

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:58.580
listen, not everybody has the same gift.

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:01.820
We've all been baptized by the Holy Spirit,

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:04.380
we all have the Holy Spirit of God if we're saved,

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:07.900
but we don't all have the same spiritual gifts.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:12.300
So therefore, for someone to say that speaking in tongues

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.480
is the evidence of being filled with the Spirit of God,

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:18.200
you have a problem with 1 Corinthians 12.

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:23.380
So the Bible, again, as I mentioned by way of introduction,

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:27.380
there's much confusion, but the Bible gives us much clarity

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:28.820
with regard to the subject.

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:31.680
Now that we understand the purpose and use of tongues,

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.960
we can attempt to answer the question

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:35.660
of when tongues will cease.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.320
I believe that it's clear that the Bible teaches

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.900
that tongues will cease.

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:41.500
It says in 1 Corinthians 13, eight,

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.740
whether there be tongues, they shall cease.

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:46.340
Obviously, everyone that would even believe

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.340
in the practice of tongues has to agree

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:50.220
that they have to cease at some point.

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:52.540
I believe that the scriptures reveal

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:56.580
that tongues would cease when the New Testament was complete.

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:59.860
In verse number 10 of 1 Corinthians 13, it says,

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:02.300
but when that which is perfect is come,

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.340
then that which is in part shall be done away.

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.980
Now, I believe, and he talks in verse number 11,

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:10.060
when I was a child, I spake as a child,

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:12.700
I understood as a child, I thought as a child,

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:14.900
but when I became a man, I put away childish things.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:16.300
He's talking about the church,

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:18.500
and he's talking about the infancy of the church

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.420
versus the maturity of the church.

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:23.380
And in those infant stages,

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:27.980
God allowed for these sign gifts to confirm the word

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:30.100
because they didn't have a whole Bible.

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:32.940
So then when the whole Bible was given,

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:37.180
there was no need for the temporary sign gifts

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:39.420
because the Bible had been completed.

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:42.640
Now, Hebrews chapter two and James chapter number one

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.060
give us some evidence to deal with this truth

00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:50.060
of 1 Corinthians 13, 10 being the Bible being complete.

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:52.880
And there are some that argue

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:55.660
that that's the return of Christ, the rapture.

00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:58.660
I disagree as you compare scripture with scripture,

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:00.760
and I'll answer that question in just a moment,

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.780
but in Hebrews chapter two and verse number three,

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:06.060
the Bible says, how shall we escape

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:07.880
if we neglect so great salvation,

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.820
which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:14.780
and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him?

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:16.120
How was it confirmed?

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.220
Verse four, God also bearing them witness

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:23.540
both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:28.020
and gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will.

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:31.580
And so we find that God was working with the disciples.

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:34.740
He was confirming their word with signs following.

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:37.620
And Hebrews two deals with that subject

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:40.860
and helps us to understand that sign gifts

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:45.640
were given to confirm the message that was being delivered.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:48.820
James one in verse number 25 tells us this

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:52.340
as we compare that with first Corinthians chapter 13

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:54.780
in James one and verse number 25,

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:58.740
but who so looketh into the perfect law of liberty,

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:01.180
that's the Bible, and continueth therein,

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:04.840
he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work,

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.560
this man shall be blessed in his deed.

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.460
So if we understand the why,

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:13.260
to whom is the sign gift given?

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:16.540
And we begin to answer the question, when would it cease?

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.620
I believe that the scriptures are clear

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:20.220
that even within the context

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:23.220
that it's when the Bible is complete.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:26.060
The argument, and some have said,

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:28.820
that it's no, it's when Jesus returns.

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.340
So then we would, and that's their validation

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:34.140
for why this speaking in tongues consists

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:37.260
or continues until the present day

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:40.040
because Jesus hasn't returned.

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:42.060
The problem with that is that we have to have

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.900
an understanding properly of what takes place

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:48.220
at the rapture and what the purpose of the tribulation is.

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:53.460
If the rapture is the removing of the church,

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:57.700
but tongues was a gift given to the church,

00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:00.620
then at the rapture it would automatically cease

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:02.240
and God would not have to say

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.460
whether there be tongues they shall cease.

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:05.700
Does that make sense?

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:09.100
Because if the gift is given to the church,

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.300
and it is, that's who the gift is given to,

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.940
to believers, that makes up the church,

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:16.620
then as the church is raptured,

00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:21.100
everything pertaining to the church ceases at that point

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:23.100
because the church is raptured.

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:25.220
There's no more church in the book of,

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:29.300
in the tribulation as we know it today in this church age.

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:32.140
The church ceases to exist in the same manner

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:35.020
that it exists today during the tribulation.

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:38.660
And so therefore, if God says whether there be tongues

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:43.500
they shall cease, I don't, it makes zero sense in my mind

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.420
why he would tell us it would cease

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.140
if that time of ceasing is at the rapture.

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:51.260
There's gotta be a different time.

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:52.660
And that time, I believe,

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:55.020
according to 1 Corinthians 13, verse 10,

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:58.780
is when the complete canon of scripture is given.

00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:01.900
I'm so thankful to have a whole Bible.

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:06.420
And so I believe this evening that it's clear.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:10.580
I know that there are people that differ on this teaching.

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:13.120
I believe, even as I shared with someone this morning

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.660
that asked a question about it,

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:16.100
as they saw the title, they said,

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.180
man, I'm not gonna be able to make it back this evening

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:20.180
but it's a subject that I'm very interested in.

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.620
And I believe that tongues,

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:24.380
one of the issues with tongues today

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:29.380
and still becoming somewhat of a dispute, if you will,

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:32.780
as to why people think that it continues until today

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:34.800
is because tongues can be manufactured.

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.140
Do you know that in the Bible

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:40.520
no one was ever instructed on how to speak in tongues?

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:43.700
No one ever desired, except for the carnal people in Corinth

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.380
to speak in tongues.

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:46.980
And we find that Paul said,

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:50.420
I'd rather speak five words of understanding

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:52.920
than 5,000 words with an unknown tongue.

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:56.220
And so we find that as we study the scriptures

00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:57.620
that today there's,

00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:59.580
hey, we're gonna teach you how to speak in tongues.

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:01.500
No one ever was taught how to speak in tongues

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:02.540
in the New Testament.

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:06.700
No one was coveting after that.

00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:10.380
No, the spirit gives as he will to every man.

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:12.820
And we find that tongues can be manufactured.

00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:14.020
What do I mean by that?

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:15.020
Well, someone can stand up

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:16.100
and say they're speaking in tongues

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:18.000
and you don't know if they are or not.

00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:23.460
But no one's walking around healing somebody

00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:25.700
without you knowing whether they were healed.

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:27.780
Am I right?

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.380
No one's drinking poison

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:34.740
without you knowing if that poison affected them or not.

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.220
People trying to handle snakes,

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:41.060
crazy people trying to handle snakes outside of their mind.

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.980
They're not shaking it off like Paul did.

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:48.100
What happened when he shook that beast off, that serpent?

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.260
They went from saying he was a murderer

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:51.860
to saying he was a God.

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:54.740
And you know what that allowed him to do?

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:58.340
Preach the gospel and those people got saved.

00:47:58.340 --> 00:47:59.740
That was the purpose of the...

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:01.820
Paul wasn't walking around playing with snakes

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:04.980
and letting them bite him and showing that he's immune to it.

00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:08.480
No, it was a sign to confirm the word.

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:09.400
Amen.

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:13.680
And so tongues so often today can be manufactured

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.440
in people looking at the fact that,

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:16.960
oh, I spoke in tongues

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.000
and some elevation of a position

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.040
of being spirit-filled or otherwise,

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:24.160
and you don't know if they are or are not.

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:25.440
But you know one thing that's interesting

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:28.360
about speaking of tongues in the Bible?

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.140
It was always a known language.

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.440
It was a known language.

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:37.880
Every man heard them in Acts 2 in his own tongue.

00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:40.880
That's why they marveled.

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:44.400
How is it that all of us are hearing in our own tongue?

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.280
We're gonna go to Panama in two weeks.

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:49.320
I don't speak but about 20 words of Spanish.

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.760
I'm gonna need an interpreter.

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:52.600
Why?

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:53.920
Because I don't speak the language.

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.920
I'm not gonna hear them in my language.

00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:58.920
They're not gonna hear me in their language.

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.180
We're gonna need an interpreter.

00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:04.760
This evening, we see the answer to the question,

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.560
but I say tonight as well,

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:13.000
it's so awesome that in the plan of God,

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.120
he allowed for this sign gift of tongues to be given

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:19.320
so that the Jewish people would know

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:23.280
that the Gentile people were saved the same way.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.060
We sang to start the service this evening

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:29.200
since Jesus came into my heart.

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.680
I hope you know tonight that you're saved,

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:34.280
that you know for sure that heaven is your home,

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.880
that you understand that you're a sinner.

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:36.960
There's only one savior.

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:39.120
His name is Jesus.

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.240
For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.560
I mentioned that on Saturday,

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.160
this upcoming week will be 27 years

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.360
since I trusted Christ as my savior.

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.800
I'm so happy and so thankful to know Christ.

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:55.560
And I was saved the same way anybody else

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:58.240
and anyone else will ever be saved.

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.680
And that's through trusting the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:03.260
and has finished work on the cross of Calvary.

00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:04.600
It's not by any merit of my own.

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.180
There's no righteousness that I could do.

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:08.980
There's no good work that I could do or that you could do.

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:10.400
It's only through Jesus Christ

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:13.020
and to God be the glory for that wonderful truth.

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:13.860
Let's pray together.

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:15.480
Father, we love you.

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.400
We thank you for loving us.

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.600
We thank you for your word.

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:21.600
And this evening, we've covered a lot of territory.

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.980
And God, I pray that there's a measure of clarity

00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:25.480
that's been given,

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.780
that God, you'd help us to understand

00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:29.680
the truth of your word.

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.640
I pray, God, that if there's one here tonight

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:32.480
that's not saved,

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:34.560
they've never trusted Christ as their savior.

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:37.520
I pray that tonight would be the night of their salvation.

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:41.020
I pray the Holy Spirit of God would convict of their sin,

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:43.820
of Christ's righteousness and of judgment to come.

00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:45.860
Pray that you'd give us an opportunity to take a Bible

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:47.200
and show them how they could know for sure

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.400
that heaven is their home.

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.560
I pray, God, that if there's some

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.480
that are struggling with this area of tongues,

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:55.200
that, Lord, they would understand the simplicity

00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:56.280
and the truth of your word,

00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:58.940
the clarity that you provide us with.

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:00.140
I pray that you'd move and work

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:02.000
in the moment of invitation as only you can,

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.180
and we'll thank you for it in Christ's name, we pray.

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:05.380
Would you stand with me?

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:08.280
As you know, at the conclusion of our services,

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.100
we have a time of invitation,

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:13.020
not intended to embarrass anyone or to pressure anyone,

00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:15.780
but to simply give you an opportunity to respond.

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:17.580
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano,

00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:19.820
and as she does, the altar is open.

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:20.860
If you're not sure of heaven,

00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:22.100
we'd love to take a Bible and show you

00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:24.480
how you can know for sure that heaven is your home.

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.140
Maybe this evening, you wanna come and just thank God

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:27.860
for his word and the clarity that he provides.

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:30.300
Maybe you wanna thank God for saving you.

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:32.420
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
