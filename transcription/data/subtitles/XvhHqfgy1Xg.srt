1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Different times we live in, aren't they?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,519
And sometimes we can allow a negative spirit

3
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:07,880
to kind of sweep over us.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,960
And we just have to be careful that we don't do that.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,800
Our God is great and he can speak to our hearts

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,719
whether we're in a room or whether we're at home,

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,520
we're listening on live stream, God is able.

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,959
I was thinking to myself, God could speak to Jonah

9
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,639
when Jonah was in the belly of a whale.

10
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:32,200
God found Peter on a rooftop, spoke to his heart.

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,159
He found John in exile on the Isle of Patmos

12
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:38,159
and spoke to John there.

13
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,319
So I think God is able even in 2021

14
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:45,279
to allow us to be in our living room

15
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,520
or somewhere on live stream,

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,279
some in the auditorium, very few.

17
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:52,240
And he is able to speak to our hearts.

18
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,560
It really is about our attitude.

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,799
And so my prayer is, is that you will

20
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,959
just for these next few moments,

21
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:04,160
allow the Lord through his Holy Spirit to take his word

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,000
and speak to your heart.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,760
And let's just see what God can do in our lives.

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,459
It'll be a wonderful thing.

25
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:14,360
Take your Bible if you would and turn with me to Psalm 89.

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,760
I appreciate pastor allowing me to be here.

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,559
We are friends and for some period of time

28
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:24,480
pastored in the same area.

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,559
And I'm glad for all the years that we had in the DC area.

30
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:31,279
We moved to Charlotte, North Carolina,

31
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:32,959
where we have two sons,

32
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,440
but I will always be a Virginian at heart.

33
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,440
I love Virginia, even the traffic of Northern Virginia.

34
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,019
Maybe not so much that part.

35
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:49,339
Psalm 89, and let's notice beginning in verse one.

36
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:55,339
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever.

37
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,339
With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness

38
00:02:00,339 --> 00:02:02,779
to all generations.

39
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:07,260
For I have said, mercy shall be built up forever.

40
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:12,259
Thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.

41
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,220
I have made a covenant with my chosen.

42
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,699
I have sworn unto David, my servant.

43
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,059
Thy seed will I establish forever

44
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,940
and build up thy throne to all generations.

45
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,779
Selah.

46
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,399
And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Lord.

47
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:37,000
Thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,539
For who in the heaven can be compared unto the Lord?

49
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:44,059
Who among the sons of the mighty

50
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:46,940
can be likened unto the Lord?

51
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,940
God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints

52
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,580
and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.

53
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,580
O Lord God of hosts, who is a strong Lord like unto thee

54
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,080
or to thy faithfulness round about thee?

55
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,779
Let's pray and ask God to help us.

56
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:10,380
Father, we're so grateful for this morning

57
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,979
that you've given us to be together

58
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:15,740
in whatever way you've allowed us to be

59
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,779
in tune with this service.

60
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,539
Lord, we're not gathering because we are people

61
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:23,259
who have it all figured out.

62
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,179
We're gathering because we are needy people.

63
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:30,000
We need your Holy Spirit's help.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,139
We need your word.

65
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:35,580
Lord, we need your touch upon our lives.

66
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,000
And we offer ourselves in these few moments

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,320
for you to speak to us, to teach us.

68
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,160
Lord, there are so many that need encouragement

69
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,679
and I pray that you would encourage them today.

70
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:52,080
But Lord, we also need to be convicted.

71
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,759
And where we need conviction and where we need

72
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:00,279
to change attitude, action, words,

73
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:03,919
I pray that you would impress that upon our hearts

74
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,619
and help us not to be stiff-necked,

75
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:10,479
but to be willing to hear you and make the changes

76
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,639
with the help of your Holy Spirit

77
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,360
that would please you in our lives.

78
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,760
So work in our hearts.

79
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,600
Thank you for this moment.

80
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,779
We pray in Jesus' name, amen.

81
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:24,040
If you were to ask me,

82
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,179
what is the highest Christian virtue?

83
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:30,059
Of course, I would say love,

84
00:04:30,059 --> 00:04:35,059
because I believe love is the abiding great virtue.

85
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,640
But one of the virtues that I would rank very, very highly

86
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,119
is the virtue of faithfulness.

87
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:46,920
I love faithfulness.

88
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,119
I love the testimony of preachers, if you will.

89
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:54,279
I am one and so allow me to be self-interested for a moment.

90
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:58,679
I love preachers who have been at it and stay at it

91
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:00,720
in the way that they have energy to do,

92
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,959
but for a long time.

93
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,320
I love that.

94
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,320
I love Sunday school teachers who teach for a long time.

95
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,320
I think the greatest crown to be given in heaven

96
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,519
will be given to teachers who taught junior high boys

97
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,640
for 40 years.

98
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,399
They deserve a crown for sure.

99
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:25,140
I love faithfulness in marriage.

100
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,000
And I'm an older fellow.

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,799
I listened to Paul Harvey when he was on the radio

102
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:33,399
and I used to love a segment that he had.

103
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,019
It was called the Tournament of Roses.

104
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:38,899
And when he would talk about the Tournament of Roses,

105
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:43,899
he would mention a couple who had been married 60, 70 years

106
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:45,700
and he would just honor them.

107
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,339
And I think that's praiseworthy.

108
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:50,299
I just love the thought of faithfulness.

109
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:53,059
And as much as we could talk about the faithfulness

110
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:58,059
that we see in men and women, here's the truth.

111
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,940
Our faithfulness, if any,

112
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,859
is only evidence of God's faithfulness to us.

113
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,980
And when we praise faithfulness,

114
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:12,700
may we first understand that it is God's faithfulness

115
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:17,359
in our lives that allow us to move, to do,

116
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:21,820
and to have the privilege over years of pleasing him.

117
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,820
When I come to this great psalm,

118
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,880
I understand something about faithfulness.

119
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,399
I want you to notice some things in introduction.

120
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,299
If your Bible has ascriptions for the psalm,

121
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:39,299
mine says that it is a maskial of Ethan the Ezraite.

122
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,980
That word maskial just simply means

123
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,459
that it is a psalm written to instruct,

124
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:48,799
a psalm written to instruct.

125
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:50,779
So when we come to Psalm 89,

126
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:55,019
we know that God's intention is to teach us something.

127
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:58,980
Now, notice in verse one, the latter phrase,

128
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,260
thy faithfulness to all generations.

129
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,859
Notice verse two, latter phrase,

130
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:09,179
thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.

131
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:13,220
Verse five, thy faithfulness also

132
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,459
in the congregation of the saints.

133
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:20,459
Notice verse eight, or to thy faithfulness round about thee.

134
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:24,459
I am not the brightest bulb in the pack, I assure you.

135
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:28,380
But when God says I've written a maskial,

136
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,480
which has the intention of instructing us,

137
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,920
and four times in the first eight verses,

138
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,559
we're told about the faithfulness of God, I get it.

139
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:44,079
This is a psalm to instruct God's people

140
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,359
about his faithfulness to his own.

141
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:51,359
Well, second, I want you to notice who wrote this psalm.

142
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:53,440
It's important to understand a little bit

143
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,239
about Ethan the Ezraite.

144
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:58,320
I won't take you there for the sake of time,

145
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,679
but if we went to 1 Chronicles 15, verse 17,

146
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:06,920
we would learn that Ethan, of course, is a Levite,

147
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,399
and Ethan was put in charge of worship.

148
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:15,519
Now, as a Levite, he was to study and care about

149
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:17,519
and teach the word of God,

150
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,200
and he and his family have this special calling,

151
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:27,200
or special responsibility of teaching and leading in worship.

152
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,239
One of the other things I learned about Ethan

153
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:35,840
was in 2 Chronicles, I'm sorry, 1 Kings 4, verse 31,

154
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,840
that his wisdom is compared to the wisdom of Solomon.

155
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,320
Now, it doesn't say that he is as wise as Solomon,

156
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,119
but I would suggest to you that if you're even mentioned

157
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:51,440
in the same verse, you're a pretty wise guy.

158
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:54,799
I don't know about you, but I do know about me.

159
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,799
I do not know one word of Hebrew other than shalom, okay?

160
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,599
But I have a strong concordance,

161
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,840
and it often makes me dangerous.

162
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,919
And I love to understand names,

163
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:10,359
especially as they are in the Old Testament,

164
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:15,039
because God often will communicate an important thought

165
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:18,359
or a trait about that person through their name.

166
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:20,640
And so, as I was studying this passage,

167
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,080
it occurred to me I'd love to know

168
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,799
what that name Ethan means.

169
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:29,239
I looked it up in my strong concordance and was amazed.

170
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:33,880
It means literally to be permanent, to be constant.

171
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,520
Now, I wanna put that together for just a moment.

172
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:41,000
Here's God wanting to instruct his people

173
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,520
about his faithfulness.

174
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,719
So he chooses a man to inspire through his Holy Spirit

175
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:51,359
to write about his faithfulness to God's people,

176
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,479
and that man is a Levite

177
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:56,039
who is a teacher of the people of God.

178
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:59,960
He is a man who is wise.

179
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,760
And he is a man whose character,

180
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,360
I believe God is communicating to us,

181
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,040
is one of faithfulness.

182
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,240
Now all of that I find very interesting,

183
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,720
but I'll tell you the thing in my study

184
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,480
and introduction that really amazed me.

185
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,220
It is when the psalm was written.

186
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,080
When did God decide to inspire Ethan

187
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,000
to write a psalm about his faithfulness?

188
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,160
I could have understood it if it was written

189
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,880
during the reign of David,

190
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,480
because David was the sweet singer of Israel.

191
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,680
He was the man after God's own heart.

192
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,960
He was a flawed man, but he was a man after God's own heart,

193
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,960
and we so identify that kingdom of Israel with David.

194
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,900
But it wasn't written when David was king.

195
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,280
I could have even understood if it was written

196
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,660
when Solomon was king,

197
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,060
because under Solomon, the kingdom reached its zenith.

198
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,820
The greatest cities were built.

199
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,580
The greatest armies were in the field.

200
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:09,580
There was just a great sense of prosperity and blessing,

201
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,200
but it wasn't written when Solomon was king.

202
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,240
Do you know when God inspired Ethan to write Psalm 89?

203
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,840
Right after the kingdom split, when Rehoboam,

204
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,840
the son of Solomon, had made such an unwise decision

205
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,960
following the counsel of the young men

206
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,320
rather than the elders, and the kingdom was split,

207
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,560
and Jeroboam came back from Egypt and took 10 tribes

208
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,840
and went to the north and Samaria, made his capital.

209
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,840
That is now called Israel or Ephraim,

210
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,040
and Rehoboam is left with two tribes in the south,

211
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,840
Judah and Benjamin.

212
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,800
It is called Judah, and in the midst

213
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
of the kingdom being rent,

214
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,580
in the midst of the greatest chaos

215
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,080
Israel had ever experienced,

216
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,960
in the midst of when you would wonder,

217
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,200
does God even know where we are?

218
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,960
Does God even care about who we are?

219
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,000
That's when God said to Ethan,

220
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,920
Ethan, I want you to remind my people about something,

221
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,680
that regardless of the circumstances,

222
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,840
regardless of what they think they see,

223
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,840
regardless of what they're experiencing,

224
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:33,280
my faithfulness never changes.

225
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,360
I know where they are, I know where I'm taking them,

226
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,040
I know what they're experiencing,

227
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,280
and I am utterly faithful.

228
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,560
And when I understand that, to be honest with you,

229
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,080
the thing that occurs to me is this,

230
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,440
because the rest of the psalm is not necessarily

231
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,360
about God's faithfulness,

232
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,040
it speaks to what our response to God's faithfulness

233
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,680
should be, even in difficult circumstances.

234
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,360
I want you to notice several of them this morning.

235
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,400
Here's number one.

236
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,840
Our response to God's faithfulness

237
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,200
ought to be to have a rejoicing spirit

238
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,320
that celebrates God's faithfulness.

239
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,760
I'll say it again.

240
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,640
Our response to God's faithfulness

241
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,120
ought to be to have a rejoicing spirit

242
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,200
that celebrates God's faithfulness.

243
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,560
Go with me to verse one again.

244
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,560
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever.

245
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,200
With my mouth will I make known

246
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,720
thy faithfulness to all generations.

247
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,040
I think somebody ought to write a song like that,

248
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,120
don't you?

249
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh, wait a minute, they did.

250
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,580
A chorus, it's a wonderful chorus

251
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,660
that we sing as children,

252
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,280
but it has one of the greatest truths

253
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,240
that too often as adults we forget.

254
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:03,280
You see, we as adults can be so quick to be grumbling,

255
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,480
so quick to complain in all that God has done for us

256
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,760
and in all that God is presently doing for us.

257
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,000
There are times that out of the mouths of believers,

258
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,400
God does not hear praise and God does not hear rejoicing.

259
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,440
Instead, God hears complaining

260
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,480
and it is not an innocent thing.

261
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,400
I'm reminded of the time that Israel was in the wilderness.

262
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,480
They had come up out of Egypt

263
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,080
and oh, how they rejoiced when they came up out of Egypt

264
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,280
and oh, how they loved God

265
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,720
and God brought them to the edge of that Red Sea

266
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,360
and almost instantaneously the beginning complaint began.

267
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,320
God parted the Red Sea and they went across the Red Sea

268
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,240
and then of course we know the story of the spies

269
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,280
and the wrong decision made and here's the truth.

270
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,600
Because of that wrong decision, that unbelief,

271
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,600
they were destined to spend 40 years

272
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,080
in the wilderness of Sinai.

273
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,600
I don't know if you've ever been to the wilderness of Sinai

274
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,600
but it's not a garden spot, it is truly wilderness.

275
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,320
You can't grow crops there to sustain a million people.

276
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,040
You can't find enough water

277
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,640
to sustain your flocks and your herds.

278
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,760
It's not a comfortable place to dwell

279
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,480
and yet during those 40 years, think with me for a moment,

280
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,320
their sandals never wore out,

281
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,640
their clothes never deteriorated

282
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,000
and every day they had flocks out there,

283
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,240
there was enough water for their herds

284
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,840
and their flocks and for them

285
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,840
and oh yeah, every single morning other than Sabbath morning

286
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,440
they would wake up and they would see out there

287
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
what appeared to be dew at first

288
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,320
but when you walked up on it,

289
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,680
it was of a white coriander seed,

290
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:07,120
it looked like coriander, it had the taste of fresh oil,

291
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,120
it was manna and for every day of 40 years

292
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,600
in a wilderness that could not sustain you,

293
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,600
they ate, they had nutrition, it was tasty,

294
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,160
it was provided of God for his people

295
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,740
and can I remind you of what they did in Numbers 11?

296
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,960
They complained about the provision of God

297
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,920
and they said we loathe this white bread

298
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,080
and God did not hold them innocent for it.

299
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,320
Now I don't believe we live in the Old Testament

300
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,720
and I'm not predicting that God will do with us

301
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,240
what he did with them but of all people on the earth,

302
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,940
it ought to occur to us, God is good to me.

303
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,200
Even when the circumstances are difficult,

304
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,840
God is good to me and I think we ought to join with Ethan

305
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:12,840
and say, I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever,

306
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:18,320
I will sing, I will sing, I will sing of the mercies

307
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,520
of the Lord forever even as I sit on 66 or 95

308
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,520
or even as there's no supplies at Costco

309
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,720
and even though there's a pandemic

310
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,960
and even though it seems like all is changing

311
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,960
and all is falling apart, my God is good and able to supply

312
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,040
and you and I right now, listen, it is so easy

313
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,640
to have a grumbling, complaining spirit

314
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,560
and as believers, it ought to stop in our lives

315
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,480
and rejoice because God knows where we are,

316
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,800
God knows what we need, God knows where he's taking us

317
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,200
and God will deliver us to that place

318
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,680
because God is utterly faithful.

319
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,680
Here's number two, our faith can rest on God's faithfulness.

320
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,600
Look at verse two, for I have said,

321
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,880
mercy shall be built up forever,

322
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,880
thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.

323
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,559
There's not a lot that we can count on in these days.

324
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,540
How many of you notice that politicians

325
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,160
will often disappoint you?

326
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,280
What is popular today will be forgotten tomorrow.

327
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,960
Our own bodies and lives seem like they're always moving,

328
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,000
always moving, always changing.

329
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,720
What I could do yesterday, I can't do today

330
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,360
and I don't know about you but sometimes

331
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,360
I just wanna holler, let it stop, let it just stay here.

332
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,880
I'll never forget years ago, I was in a hospital room

333
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,440
where a husband and wife had just had a little baby

334
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,600
and I loved those visits, it's a time of real joy

335
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,600
and mom was attending to the baby and I was talking to dad

336
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,679
and as we were talking, I overheard her whisper

337
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,440
to this little baby, I want it to just stay like this.

338
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,840
She's holding her child, the child is not crying

339
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,119
and it's all peaceful, almost like a little halo

340
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,140
resting over the child's head and I thought to myself,

341
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,380
I wanted to turn to her as a fundamental Baptist preacher

342
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,820
and say, well it ain't gonna stay there

343
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,420
but I decided to be nice that day but it doesn't stay,

344
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,540
it always moves, it always moves

345
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,940
and to be honest with you, we're not promised.

346
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,940
easy or comfortable or pleasant circumstances all our lives.

347
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,940
But what we are promised is this,

348
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,540
that as our lives are always and ever changing,

349
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,260
and as the circumstances that surround us

350
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,020
are always and ever changing,

351
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,900
we have a sovereign God who is sovereign

352
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,780
over the change in our lives.

353
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,100
And I don't mean to be too elementary,

354
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:34,140
but God says, God says, look to the heavens

355
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:38,180
and comfort yourself when it is swirling around you

356
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,700
and you don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring,

357
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,500
you don't know what you're gonna do,

358
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,500
look to the heavens and remind yourselves, I do, God says.

359
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,000
I don't know if you noticed it,

360
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,980
but at about six o'clock last night, the sun went down.

361
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,580
I follow the science, I am deeply scientific.

362
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,180
How many of you noticed this morning

363
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,120
at about six o'clock, the sun came up?

364
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,740
Did you know that's gonna occur again today

365
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,700
and again tomorrow and again the next day?

366
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,260
And you say, well, yeah, preacher,

367
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,860
because the earth goes around the sun

368
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,520
because God did it on purpose.

369
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,740
Because God wanted us to look at that and say,

370
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,660
wow, has this thing changed,

371
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:28,020
but wow, does God know and does God have control

372
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,459
and God knows what happens in the night, in the dark,

373
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:33,819
and God knows what happens in the day

374
00:21:33,819 --> 00:21:36,779
and God knows how to get me there.

375
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,720
We're getting ready to experience my favorite season, fall.

376
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,500
I love the chill in the air,

377
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,980
I love the leaves getting ready to change.

378
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,620
My favorite thing in the world is apples.

379
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,700
I am the world's greatest apple connoisseur

380
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,139
and it is harvest season for apples.

381
00:21:56,139 --> 00:21:59,500
And sadly, it's going to give way

382
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,459
to my least favorite season of the year, which is winter.

383
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:05,500
You say, don't you love the beauty of the snow?

384
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,940
No, you have to shovel it.

385
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,660
But it's gonna give way to spring

386
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,960
and it's gonna give way to summer.

387
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,380
You say, preacher, we know that.

388
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,300
You said you wouldn't be elementary.

389
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,699
It's elementary, but it's vital for us to understand

390
00:22:18,699 --> 00:22:21,820
that God is in control

391
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,240
and God is able to bring life

392
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,059
where there doesn't seem to be life.

393
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:28,740
He is able to handle transition

394
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,339
and he is able to move us through it.

395
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:35,440
I love how the songwriter put this, and forgive my singing.

396
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:41,540
♪ Summer and winter, springtime and harvest ♪

397
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:47,979

00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,020

408
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,500
Boy, these are uncertain times, aren't they?

409
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,619
Honestly, we don't know what a day will bring forth.

410
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:02,559
I almost don't turn the news on

411
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,080
because the news cycle is like 12 minutes, not 12 hours.

412
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,419
But in all of this mess and all of this chaos,

413
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:17,980
there is a God who can make night turn into day.

414
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,299
There is a God who controls

415
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:22,540
and by whom all these things consist

416
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:27,220
and he moves us from summer to fall to winter to spring.

417
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,820
God is utterly faithful.

418
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,920
Here's number three.

419
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,339
No human faithfulness can be compared

420
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:36,459
to God's faithfulness.

421
00:24:36,459 --> 00:24:38,100
Look at verse eight.

422
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,140
Look over at verse eight.

423
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:45,179
Oh, Lord God of hosts, who is a strong Lord like unto thee

424
00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:49,739
or to thy faithfulness round about thee?

425
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,940
I love, as I began this sermon,

426
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,299
faithful men and women and their testimonies,

427
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:57,820
but can I tell you the truth?

428
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:01,700
Men and women, to include myself, will fail you.

429
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,019
I told my congregation for years and years,

430
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:10,640
hang around me long enough and I will disappoint you.

431
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,420
There'll be something that I do, something that I say,

432
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,420
I will disappoint you.

433
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:19,839
And my friend, you cannot build your faith on a man.

434
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:22,940
You can't build your faith on a political party.

435
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,700
You can't build your faith on an IRA.

436
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,420
You can't build your faith on a career.

437
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:33,420
There is only one who never, ever fails us.

438
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:36,739
That is God Almighty.

439
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:38,420
Put your trust in him.

440
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,640
Since I've been retired the few weeks that I'm home a year,

441
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,519
one of the things I love to do

442
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:48,299
is go with my wife grocery shopping.

443
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:51,019
She does not love it when I go with her grocery shopping,

444
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:52,299
but I love it.

445
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:56,700
And we only shop at the finer stores, so we go to Walmart.

446
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,459
And as we go into Walmart, there is a person there

447
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:04,899
whose purpose in life is to make me feel good

448
00:26:04,899 --> 00:26:06,899
about myself being at Walmart.

449
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,019
She's got, he or she's got a blue vest on,

450
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:10,420
they've got a smiley face.

451
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,559
Their job is to welcome me to Walmart.

452
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,440
Not long ago, I went with my wife.

453
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,459
We walked in, I pushed the cart, that's my job.

454
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:23,019
And be careful not to hit her in the back.

455
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:25,339
As we're going through and we're coming up to that door,

456
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:27,940
I see her, she's there.

457
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,019
This is gonna be great, I love people.

458
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,179
I'm gonna greet her, she's gonna greet me.

459
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:33,980
It's gonna make life wonderful.

460
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:38,519
She makes eye contact with me and turns and walks away.

461
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,820
Now can I tell you something?

462
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,799
I will never go to Walmart again

463
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,660
because of what that woman did.

464
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:52,420
You take me too seriously, okay?

465
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,100
I don't go to Walmart because I need somebody

466
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,820
to make me feel good about myself.

467
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:01,239
I go to Walmart because the Jif peanut butter is cheaper.

468
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:08,420
I am so weary of people who use what is universally known

469
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,899
that men will disappoint us as a reason

470
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:16,100
to not worship and serve the Lord

471
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,380
who will never fail them.

472
00:27:18,739 --> 00:27:22,100
Listen, I'm not making light that people have been hurt

473
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,380
by Christians and in significant ways.

474
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,700
Please do not think that's what I'm doing.

475
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,820
But you and I have to understand that it is a devil's tactic

476
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,500
to use the failure of men to cause us

477
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,480
not to want to have fellowship and faithfully worship

478
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,140
the one who is utterly faithful to us,

479
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,140
who has never failed us.

480
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,420
I don't come to church for somebody

481
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,420
to make me feel good about myself.

482
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,619
I come to church and sing and listen to preaching

483
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:54,179
and learn of him to worship the one

484
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:57,860
who is utterly faithful to me.

485
00:27:58,899 --> 00:28:03,420
And I pray that if somehow your life is marginalized

486
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:07,260
by the failure of a person in your life,

487
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,299
I'm not diminishing it.

488
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:13,100
I'm just saying, beg God for the grace to get over it

489
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,540
because he has never failed you.

490
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,420
And you are harming your own spiritual walk.

491
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:23,580
You're allowing the failure of failing men

492
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,980
to keep you from serving and worshiping and loving

493
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,760
and enjoying your walk with the Lord

494
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,739
who has never, ever failed you.

495
00:28:34,739 --> 00:28:36,280
Notice this very quickly.

496
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:40,700
Your sin does not change God's faithfulness.

497
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,840
Turn over to verse 31 with me, would you?

498
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:48,400
Here, Ethan says, if they break my statutes

499
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,280
and keep not my commandments,

500
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,039
then will I visit their transgression with the rod

501
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,400
and their iniquity with stripes.

502
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,280
Nevertheless, my loving kindness

503
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,119
will I not utterly take from him,

504
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:10,580
nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.

505
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:16,260
This psalm, if we had time to really study it in depth,

506
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:20,220
you would understand was to reassure Israel

507
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,559
of the promises that God had made to David,

508
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:27,559
that one of David's lineage would reign in perpetuity

509
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:28,640
over Israel.

510
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,659
That will be realized in the millennium

511
00:29:31,659 --> 00:29:34,739
when Jesus, the son of David,

512
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:39,260
reigns literally from Jerusalem for 1,000 years.

513
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:41,979
But now in the midst of this chaos,

514
00:29:41,979 --> 00:29:46,659
it looks like Israel's sin has broken the covenant

515
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:49,539
and now God has forsaken them

516
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:53,919
and he's not going to fulfill his promises to them.

517
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,820
But that is never true.

518
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,539
Yes, God is going to chastise them.

519
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:00,140
He's going to deal with them.

520
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:06,220
but in truth there is a remnant and God will bless them and God loves them even

521
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:12,140
through the chastising. You say preacher how does that relate to me? Well I've

522
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:17,540
been in ministry long enough that I've met a lot of people who use their

523
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:27,680
failure as a reason to not be restored and be used of the Lord. Hey David was a

524
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:33,760
flawed man. David committed adultery. I would suggest that's a very serious sin.

525
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:41,000
David actually conspired in the murder of Uriah. David was a man who had was

526
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,600
filled with pride at times and and numbered his armies because he wanted to

527
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:54,640
see how great his empire was. David was as flawed as you and I. But can I remind

528
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:03,020
you that God only has flawed people to work with and that God is able and God

529
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:11,920
loves us so much that even when we fail, when we sin, that God's desire is for us

530
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:17,920
to be restored and he convicts our hearts about what we've done and if we

531
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:24,360
will repent and if we will look to him that you and I can be restored.

532
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,640
Sometimes we have the image of God that he is in heaven and he's a God with a

533
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:35,080
thunderbolt who's just waiting, just waiting for one of his kids to step out

534
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,280
of line so that he can dash them with that thunderbolt. And I want to tell you

535
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:44,440
that is not the accurate picture of who our God is. The accurate picture of our

536
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:54,240
God comes from that great parable of the prodigal. A son takes what his father has

537
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,280
given to him, the blessing of his father, and takes it to the far country and then

538
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:10,280
wastes his his life in that place, finds himself in the pig pen having fed the

539
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:15,360
hogs and hoping to eat a little bit of what he has fed to the pigs. And I love

540
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:22,320
how simply the Bible puts it, it says he came to himself. And when he came to

541
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:31,520
himself, he said to himself, what what am I doing in a hog pen? And he gets up and

542
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,320
he makes the decision, I'm going back to my father. Now understand, when he goes

543
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:41,560
back to his father, he doesn't know what the reception will be. He doesn't know

544
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:46,360
whether his father will be there with a clenched fist, ready to beat him for his

545
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,040
sin. He doesn't know if his father will completely ignore him, and he'll have no

546
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:56,720
entrance to his father. He has no clue what it's going to be. But I want you to

547
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,800
understand, on that day when he's approaching home and perhaps very

548
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:06,440
nervous about what father is going to be, when he sees his father standing in

549
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,760
the road because he was waiting and watching and hoping his son would come

550
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:20,600
home, and his arms are wide open, that's the picture of our God. And I don't care

551
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:26,880
whether we have failed him or not, I'm not minimizing sin, I'm maximizing the

552
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:35,960
graciousness and the mercy of our God. And God says come home. One of the

553
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:42,440
moments that has just burned into my mind, I preached a sermon somewhat along

554
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,400
those lines, and a man came forward and he motioned to me, would you come down?

555
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,240
And of course I would come down and speak with him and pray with him, and he

556
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,680
said to me, I shouldn't be here. I said, well what do you mean you shouldn't be

557
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:01,040
here? He said, well you've preached on this probably ten times in the years

558
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,680
that I've been in this church, and he said, I've tried to get this thing

559
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:09,320
squared away, and I've tried to do it, and every time I failed, and here I am

560
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,800
back down here now. I've failed at this. And he said, I know God doesn't want me

561
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,440
to be here, but I wanted you to know that I know God doesn't want me to be here.

562
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:24,480
I said, what are you talking about? I said, of course God wants you to be here.

563
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:31,800
God's message to the disciple was seven times seventy, and he wasn't teaching up

564
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:37,080
to 490 times you can be forgiven. He was saying as long as you'll come, I'll work

565
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,960
with you, I'll help you, I'll restore you. And look, I'm not trying to get people to

566
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:47,960
run it out to 490 times to fail. What I'm telling you is, is the devil will

567
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:54,320
keep you from experiencing fullness in Christ, because he will convince you that

568
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,480
your failure disqualifies you for the love of God, and the blessing of God, and

569
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:07,400
to be used of God, and restored. And I'm telling you, God says you come, because

570
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,320
though your sin may have to be chastised, and though you must confess and repent

571
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:22,080
of your failure, God says I will never utterly forsake you. One last thing and

572
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:31,360
I'm done. You know what God is faithful to do? He is faithful to call upon those

573
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,840
that will call upon him to be saved. I'm sorry, he's faithful to save those who

574
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:41,240
will call upon him. I don't know about you, but I know about me. I wasn't

575
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:47,000
raised in a Christian home. My mother and dad were not Christians. Mother may have

576
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,080
been, but dad was definitely not a Christian. And he got saved when a

577
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:58,140
soul winner came by the door at 63 years old, and they started serving the Lord. In

578
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:04,320
70, he became a deacon. My mother determined that she didn't raise her

579
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:10,120
boys as Christians, but now that she was serving the Lord, they were going to know

580
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:15,720
about the Lord. And so she determinedly would witness to us to the point where I

581
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:20,440
finally had to say, I was married, we had children, and I finally had to say, mother

582
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,440
you've made a decision. I'm glad for you and dad. You go the direction that he

583
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,880
wants. God wants you to go. But for Nancy and I, we're content with our

584
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,160
life. We're decent people, good people. We're going to do what we do. Long story

585
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:43,000
short, she knew that I had an affinity for cobbler, blackberry cobbler. And she

586
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,880
said to me one day, she said, Mike, do you do you want that blackberry cobbler?

587
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,800
You're coming over for it. I said, well of course I want that blackberry

588
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:56,600
cobbler. And she said, I left my dish at church, and you go right past that church.

589
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:06,040
Could you just stop and pick that dish up? She had it set up, and the custodian,

590
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:11,720
who was a tremendous soul winner, had the dish in his hand. And it wasn't coming

591
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:17,800
out of his hand until I listened. And for 45 minutes he cornered me between a

592
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:24,000
water fountain and a wall, and he told me I was a sinner, and he told me I deserved

593
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,840
to go to hell. He told me that God loved me, my parents loved me, that yes, my mom

594
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,800
did this so that he could talk to me about the Lord. I was under conviction. I

595
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,280
got out of there without bowing my head and trusting Christ. I got home, thought

596
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,240
back and play with the baby, and I'll forget this, and I'll feel better. And I

597
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,800
got home, and my wife was gone with the baby. And my mother had given us a little

598
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:56,320
ward Bible, $2 Bible, no red letters, no notes, no maps, just a Bible. And she had

599
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,360
taken a red pen and a ruler and underlined Romans chapter 10, verses 9

600
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:09,460
and 10 and 13. And deeply under conviction, I took that Bible down from a

601
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:12,960
shelf. We'd put it on a shelf. We didn't, we were glad to have it, didn't need it.

602
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,160
And I opened that Bible to Romans chapter 10, verses 9 and 10 and 13, and

603
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,480
read them. And that man had just talked to me about the gospel and about Jesus's

604
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,680
resurrection, about his death, his resurrection, about his substitutionary

605
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:34,119
death for me. And I knew in my heart, I did believe that. And I knew I had to

606
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:38,280
confess that. And I came to Romans chapter 13, I'm sorry, chapter 10 and

607
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:46,840
verse 13, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. I

608
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,880
took that Bible over to our sofa. I laid it on the sofa. I kneeled down before the

609
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,080
sofa. I prayed the most deeply theological prayer you've ever heard. It

610
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,119
went something like this, God if you can save somebody like me, will you save me?

611
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:09,320
And he did. Because God is utterly faithful. God is utterly faithful. That

612
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:21,920
whether it is 1200 AD, 70 AD, or 2021 AD, if a man or a woman or a child will

613
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:29,160
acknowledge that indeed they are sinners, and that their only hope of salvation is

614
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:35,920
the gift that is given to us in the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who came and loving

615
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:42,880
us, lived on this earth for 33 years, and as the Bible says, was yet without sin.

616
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:49,480
And gave himself to die on the cross, and in a transaction that I will never

617
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:55,880
understand fully until I get to heaven, my sin is placed on him, and his

618
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:02,000
righteousness is placed on me because of what he did.

619
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
and because of my acceptance of that truth, and when God sees me, he no longer

620
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,039
sees sinful Mike Edwards. He sees the righteousness of his Son, Jesus Christ.

621
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:24,040
That is available to every person on this globe, because God is faithful to

622
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:30,040
save all those who, understanding their need and confessing the truth of Christ,

623
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:38,040
will call upon him. So a series of questions and I'm done. Have you developed

624
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:44,639
a complaining spirit in the chaos and the confusion, the sadness of our world,

625
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:51,520
the anger that surrounds us? Have you developed a spirit of grumbling? It's not

626
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:58,240
an innocent thing, and you and I must be the testimonies of God's mercy and grace

627
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:04,080
in this dark time, and our grumbling does not accomplish that. We may well

628
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:09,519
have been handed the greatest soul-winning evangelism tool the world

629
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:15,239
has known in hundreds of years in this pandemic, but if all our workmates here

630
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:21,120
is our complaining about a mask, or our complaining about this and complaining

631
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:26,239
about that, that will never draw people to the God that is so much

632
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:33,839
bigger than all this. Are you fearful? There's a lot to be fearful about in

633
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:38,760
this world, but you and I don't have to live fearfully. Our faith can rest on a

634
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,239
God who knows where we are, what we need, where he's taking us, and how to get

635
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:50,959
there. Have you been hurt, disappointed by someone? Don't let that marginalize

636
00:41:50,959 --> 00:42:00,000
your walk with the Lord. And how about this? Have you failed? Boy, a revival this

637
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
time in our lives is a moment when we can say, God, I want to get back into it.

638
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,119
Back into what? Back into serving you, back into pleasing you, back into loving

639
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:20,880
you, back into sharing the truth, and Lord, will you help me? And he will. And then

640
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,880
last, if you're here or under the sound of my voice on livestream, if you're not

641
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:34,800
sure you've trusted Christ as your Savior, please, it is a matter of knowing

642
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:41,360
your need because you are a sinner, knowing God's provision of his Son who

643
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:49,279
willingly died on the cross without sin, not guilty, without sin, taking our sin

644
00:42:49,279 --> 00:42:56,520
upon him so that we could be made the righteousness of God in him. If you'll

645
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:01,800
call upon the Lord, he'll save you. Would you pray with me? Father, we thank you so

646
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,440
much for these few minutes you've given us, and thank you for the patience of

647
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:12,199
people to listen to me. And I pray just now, whether folks are here or at home,

648
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:17,839
whether they need to kneel at their sofa or kneel at their chair or at their

649
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:23,399
table, whatever it is, God, a grumbling spirit is not an innocent thing, and I

650
00:43:23,399 --> 00:43:29,639
pray they deal with that. And Lord, being fearful in this time, it's understandable,

651
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:35,000
but it's not acceptable for the Christian. We've got a God, you, who are

652
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,199
able to care for us in the midst of this chaos. And for those who have been hurt

653
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:48,279
and use that hurt as a reason not to serve and live for you, deal with them

654
00:43:48,279 --> 00:43:54,639
and help them with that hurt. Lord, for those who have failed, they've sinned,

655
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:59,839
they have broken fellowship with you, would you convince them that you love

656
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:07,919
them, that you want to restore them? And for those who are unsaved, Father, if they

657
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:17,559
will but make this simple acknowledgment that they are indeed sinners, and then

658
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:25,959
believe that your Son, Jesus Christ, came to earth, lived sinlessly, died on a

659
00:44:25,959 --> 00:44:33,040
cross for them, and rose from the dead, and is coming again, if they will confess

660
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:40,119
that with their mouth, you are utterly faithful to save. So Lord, work in our

661
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:47,839
lives and accomplish these things, I pray, in Jesus' name, amen.
