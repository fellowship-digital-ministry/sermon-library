WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Different times we live in, aren't they?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.519
And sometimes we can allow a negative spirit

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:07.880
to kind of sweep over us.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.960
And we just have to be careful that we don't do that.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.800
Our God is great and he can speak to our hearts

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.719
whether we're in a room or whether we're at home,

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:22.520
we're listening on live stream, God is able.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.959
I was thinking to myself, God could speak to Jonah

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:28.639
when Jonah was in the belly of a whale.

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:32.200
God found Peter on a rooftop, spoke to his heart.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.159
He found John in exile on the Isle of Patmos

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:38.159
and spoke to John there.

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:41.319
So I think God is able even in 2021

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:45.279
to allow us to be in our living room

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:47.520
or somewhere on live stream,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.279
some in the auditorium, very few.

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:52.240
And he is able to speak to our hearts.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.560
It really is about our attitude.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.799
And so my prayer is, is that you will

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:59.959
just for these next few moments,

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:04.160
allow the Lord through his Holy Spirit to take his word

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.000
and speak to your heart.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.760
And let's just see what God can do in our lives.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.459
It'll be a wonderful thing.

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:14.360
Take your Bible if you would and turn with me to Psalm 89.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.760
I appreciate pastor allowing me to be here.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.559
We are friends and for some period of time

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:24.480
pastored in the same area.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.559
And I'm glad for all the years that we had in the DC area.

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:31.279
We moved to Charlotte, North Carolina,

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:32.959
where we have two sons,

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:36.440
but I will always be a Virginian at heart.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.440
I love Virginia, even the traffic of Northern Virginia.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:45.019
Maybe not so much that part.

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:49.339
Psalm 89, and let's notice beginning in verse one.

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:55.339
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.339
With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:02.779
to all generations.

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:07.260
For I have said, mercy shall be built up forever.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.259
Thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.220
I have made a covenant with my chosen.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.699
I have sworn unto David, my servant.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.059
Thy seed will I establish forever

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:25.940
and build up thy throne to all generations.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:26.779
Selah.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.399
And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Lord.

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:37.000
Thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.539
For who in the heaven can be compared unto the Lord?

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:44.059
Who among the sons of the mighty

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:46.940
can be likened unto the Lord?

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.940
God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.580
and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.580
O Lord God of hosts, who is a strong Lord like unto thee

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.080
or to thy faithfulness round about thee?

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.779
Let's pray and ask God to help us.

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:10.380
Father, we're so grateful for this morning

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.979
that you've given us to be together

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.740
in whatever way you've allowed us to be

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.779
in tune with this service.

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.539
Lord, we're not gathering because we are people

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:23.259
who have it all figured out.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.179
We're gathering because we are needy people.

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:30.000
We need your Holy Spirit's help.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.139
We need your word.

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.580
Lord, we need your touch upon our lives.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.000
And we offer ourselves in these few moments

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.320
for you to speak to us, to teach us.

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:46.160
Lord, there are so many that need encouragement

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.679
and I pray that you would encourage them today.

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:52.080
But Lord, we also need to be convicted.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.759
And where we need conviction and where we need

00:03:55.759 --> 00:04:00.279
to change attitude, action, words,

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:03.919
I pray that you would impress that upon our hearts

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.619
and help us not to be stiff-necked,

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:10.479
but to be willing to hear you and make the changes

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:12.639
with the help of your Holy Spirit

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.360
that would please you in our lives.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.760
So work in our hearts.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.600
Thank you for this moment.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.779
We pray in Jesus' name, amen.

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:24.040
If you were to ask me,

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.179
what is the highest Christian virtue?

00:04:28.179 --> 00:04:30.059
Of course, I would say love,

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:35.059
because I believe love is the abiding great virtue.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.640
But one of the virtues that I would rank very, very highly

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.119
is the virtue of faithfulness.

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:46.920
I love faithfulness.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.119
I love the testimony of preachers, if you will.

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:54.279
I am one and so allow me to be self-interested for a moment.

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:58.679
I love preachers who have been at it and stay at it

00:04:58.679 --> 00:05:00.720
in the way that they have energy to do,

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.959
but for a long time.

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:03.320
I love that.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.320
I love Sunday school teachers who teach for a long time.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.320
I think the greatest crown to be given in heaven

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.519
will be given to teachers who taught junior high boys

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:18.640
for 40 years.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.399
They deserve a crown for sure.

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:25.140
I love faithfulness in marriage.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.000
And I'm an older fellow.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.799
I listened to Paul Harvey when he was on the radio

00:05:30.799 --> 00:05:33.399
and I used to love a segment that he had.

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:36.019
It was called the Tournament of Roses.

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:38.899
And when he would talk about the Tournament of Roses,

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:43.899
he would mention a couple who had been married 60, 70 years

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:45.700
and he would just honor them.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.339
And I think that's praiseworthy.

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:50.299
I just love the thought of faithfulness.

00:05:50.299 --> 00:05:53.059
And as much as we could talk about the faithfulness

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:58.059
that we see in men and women, here's the truth.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.940
Our faithfulness, if any,

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.859
is only evidence of God's faithfulness to us.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.980
And when we praise faithfulness,

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.700
may we first understand that it is God's faithfulness

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.359
in our lives that allow us to move, to do,

00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:21.820
and to have the privilege over years of pleasing him.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.820
When I come to this great psalm,

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.880
I understand something about faithfulness.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.399
I want you to notice some things in introduction.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.299
If your Bible has ascriptions for the psalm,

00:06:34.299 --> 00:06:39.299
mine says that it is a maskial of Ethan the Ezraite.

00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:42.980
That word maskial just simply means

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.459
that it is a psalm written to instruct,

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:48.799
a psalm written to instruct.

00:06:48.799 --> 00:06:50.779
So when we come to Psalm 89,

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:55.019
we know that God's intention is to teach us something.

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:58.980
Now, notice in verse one, the latter phrase,

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.260
thy faithfulness to all generations.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.859
Notice verse two, latter phrase,

00:07:04.859 --> 00:07:09.179
thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:13.220
Verse five, thy faithfulness also

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.459
in the congregation of the saints.

00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:20.459
Notice verse eight, or to thy faithfulness round about thee.

00:07:20.859 --> 00:07:24.459
I am not the brightest bulb in the pack, I assure you.

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:28.380
But when God says I've written a maskial,

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.480
which has the intention of instructing us,

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.920
and four times in the first eight verses,

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.559
we're told about the faithfulness of God, I get it.

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:44.079
This is a psalm to instruct God's people

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:48.359
about his faithfulness to his own.

00:07:48.359 --> 00:07:51.359
Well, second, I want you to notice who wrote this psalm.

00:07:51.359 --> 00:07:53.440
It's important to understand a little bit

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.239
about Ethan the Ezraite.

00:07:56.239 --> 00:07:58.320
I won't take you there for the sake of time,

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.679
but if we went to 1 Chronicles 15, verse 17,

00:08:02.679 --> 00:08:06.920
we would learn that Ethan, of course, is a Levite,

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.399
and Ethan was put in charge of worship.

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:15.519
Now, as a Levite, he was to study and care about

00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:17.519
and teach the word of God,

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:22.200
and he and his family have this special calling,

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.200
or special responsibility of teaching and leading in worship.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.239
One of the other things I learned about Ethan

00:08:31.239 --> 00:08:35.840
was in 2 Chronicles, I'm sorry, 1 Kings 4, verse 31,

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.840
that his wisdom is compared to the wisdom of Solomon.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.320
Now, it doesn't say that he is as wise as Solomon,

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.119
but I would suggest to you that if you're even mentioned

00:08:48.119 --> 00:08:51.440
in the same verse, you're a pretty wise guy.

00:08:52.359 --> 00:08:54.799
I don't know about you, but I do know about me.

00:08:54.799 --> 00:08:59.799
I do not know one word of Hebrew other than shalom, okay?

00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:01.599
But I have a strong concordance,

00:09:01.599 --> 00:09:03.840
and it often makes me dangerous.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.919
And I love to understand names,

00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:10.359
especially as they are in the Old Testament,

00:09:10.359 --> 00:09:15.039
because God often will communicate an important thought

00:09:15.039 --> 00:09:18.359
or a trait about that person through their name.

00:09:18.359 --> 00:09:20.640
And so, as I was studying this passage,

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.080
it occurred to me I'd love to know

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.799
what that name Ethan means.

00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:29.239
I looked it up in my strong concordance and was amazed.

00:09:29.239 --> 00:09:33.880
It means literally to be permanent, to be constant.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.520
Now, I wanna put that together for just a moment.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:41.000
Here's God wanting to instruct his people

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.520
about his faithfulness.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.719
So he chooses a man to inspire through his Holy Spirit

00:09:47.719 --> 00:09:51.359
to write about his faithfulness to God's people,

00:09:51.359 --> 00:09:53.479
and that man is a Levite

00:09:53.479 --> 00:09:56.039
who is a teacher of the people of God.

00:09:56.039 --> 00:09:59.960
He is a man who is wise.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.760
And he is a man whose character,

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.360
I believe God is communicating to us,

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.040
is one of faithfulness.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.240
Now all of that I find very interesting,

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.720
but I'll tell you the thing in my study

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.480
and introduction that really amazed me.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.220
It is when the psalm was written.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:24.080
When did God decide to inspire Ethan

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.000
to write a psalm about his faithfulness?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.160
I could have understood it if it was written

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.880
during the reign of David,

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.480
because David was the sweet singer of Israel.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.680
He was the man after God's own heart.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.960
He was a flawed man, but he was a man after God's own heart,

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.960
and we so identify that kingdom of Israel with David.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.900
But it wasn't written when David was king.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.280
I could have even understood if it was written

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.660
when Solomon was king,

00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:00.060
because under Solomon, the kingdom reached its zenith.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.820
The greatest cities were built.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.580
The greatest armies were in the field.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:09.580
There was just a great sense of prosperity and blessing,

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.200
but it wasn't written when Solomon was king.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:20.240
Do you know when God inspired Ethan to write Psalm 89?

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.840
Right after the kingdom split, when Rehoboam,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.840
the son of Solomon, had made such an unwise decision

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.960
following the counsel of the young men

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.320
rather than the elders, and the kingdom was split,

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.560
and Jeroboam came back from Egypt and took 10 tribes

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.840
and went to the north and Samaria, made his capital.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.840
That is now called Israel or Ephraim,

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.040
and Rehoboam is left with two tribes in the south,

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.840
Judah and Benjamin.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.800
It is called Judah, and in the midst

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.800
of the kingdom being rent,

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.580
in the midst of the greatest chaos

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.080
Israel had ever experienced,

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.960
in the midst of when you would wonder,

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.200
does God even know where we are?

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.960
Does God even care about who we are?

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.000
That's when God said to Ethan,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.920
Ethan, I want you to remind my people about something,

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.680
that regardless of the circumstances,

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.840
regardless of what they think they see,

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.840
regardless of what they're experiencing,

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:33.280
my faithfulness never changes.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.360
I know where they are, I know where I'm taking them,

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.040
I know what they're experiencing,

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.280
and I am utterly faithful.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.560
And when I understand that, to be honest with you,

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.080
the thing that occurs to me is this,

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.440
because the rest of the psalm is not necessarily

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.360
about God's faithfulness,

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.040
it speaks to what our response to God's faithfulness

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.680
should be, even in difficult circumstances.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.360
I want you to notice several of them this morning.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.400
Here's number one.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.840
Our response to God's faithfulness

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.200
ought to be to have a rejoicing spirit

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.320
that celebrates God's faithfulness.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.760
I'll say it again.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.640
Our response to God's faithfulness

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.120
ought to be to have a rejoicing spirit

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.200
that celebrates God's faithfulness.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.560
Go with me to verse one again.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:36.560
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.200
With my mouth will I make known

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.720
thy faithfulness to all generations.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.040
I think somebody ought to write a song like that,

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.120
don't you?

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.000
Oh, wait a minute, they did.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.580
A chorus, it's a wonderful chorus

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.660
that we sing as children,

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.280
but it has one of the greatest truths

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.240
that too often as adults we forget.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:03.280
You see, we as adults can be so quick to be grumbling,

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:08.480
so quick to complain in all that God has done for us

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.760
and in all that God is presently doing for us.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:16.000
There are times that out of the mouths of believers,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.400
God does not hear praise and God does not hear rejoicing.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.440
Instead, God hears complaining

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.480
and it is not an innocent thing.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:31.400
I'm reminded of the time that Israel was in the wilderness.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.480
They had come up out of Egypt

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.080
and oh, how they rejoiced when they came up out of Egypt

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.280
and oh, how they loved God

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.720
and God brought them to the edge of that Red Sea

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:47.360
and almost instantaneously the beginning complaint began.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.320
God parted the Red Sea and they went across the Red Sea

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.240
and then of course we know the story of the spies

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.280
and the wrong decision made and here's the truth.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.600
Because of that wrong decision, that unbelief,

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.600
they were destined to spend 40 years

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.080
in the wilderness of Sinai.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.600
I don't know if you've ever been to the wilderness of Sinai

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:15.600
but it's not a garden spot, it is truly wilderness.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.320
You can't grow crops there to sustain a million people.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.040
You can't find enough water

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.640
to sustain your flocks and your herds.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.760
It's not a comfortable place to dwell

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:32.480
and yet during those 40 years, think with me for a moment,

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.320
their sandals never wore out,

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.640
their clothes never deteriorated

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.000
and every day they had flocks out there,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.240
there was enough water for their herds

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.840
and their flocks and for them

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.840
and oh yeah, every single morning other than Sabbath morning

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:55.440
they would wake up and they would see out there

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.440
what appeared to be dew at first

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.320
but when you walked up on it,

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.680
it was of a white coriander seed,

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:07.120
it looked like coriander, it had the taste of fresh oil,

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:12.120
it was manna and for every day of 40 years

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.600
in a wilderness that could not sustain you,

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.600
they ate, they had nutrition, it was tasty,

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.160
it was provided of God for his people

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.740
and can I remind you of what they did in Numbers 11?

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.960
They complained about the provision of God

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.920
and they said we loathe this white bread

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.080
and God did not hold them innocent for it.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.320
Now I don't believe we live in the Old Testament

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.720
and I'm not predicting that God will do with us

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.240
what he did with them but of all people on the earth,

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.940
it ought to occur to us, God is good to me.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.200
Even when the circumstances are difficult,

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.840
God is good to me and I think we ought to join with Ethan

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:12.840
and say, I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever,

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:18.320
I will sing, I will sing, I will sing of the mercies

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:24.520
of the Lord forever even as I sit on 66 or 95

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:30.520
or even as there's no supplies at Costco

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.720
and even though there's a pandemic

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.960
and even though it seems like all is changing

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.960
and all is falling apart, my God is good and able to supply

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.040
and you and I right now, listen, it is so easy

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.640
to have a grumbling, complaining spirit

00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:00.560
and as believers, it ought to stop in our lives

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.480
and rejoice because God knows where we are,

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.800
God knows what we need, God knows where he's taking us

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.200
and God will deliver us to that place

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.680
because God is utterly faithful.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.680
Here's number two, our faith can rest on God's faithfulness.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:24.600
Look at verse two, for I have said,

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.880
mercy shall be built up forever,

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.880
thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.559
There's not a lot that we can count on in these days.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.540
How many of you notice that politicians

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.160
will often disappoint you?

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.280
What is popular today will be forgotten tomorrow.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:52.960
Our own bodies and lives seem like they're always moving,

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.000
always moving, always changing.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.720
What I could do yesterday, I can't do today

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.360
and I don't know about you but sometimes

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:06.360
I just wanna holler, let it stop, let it just stay here.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.880
I'll never forget years ago, I was in a hospital room

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.440
where a husband and wife had just had a little baby

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.600
and I loved those visits, it's a time of real joy

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:23.600
and mom was attending to the baby and I was talking to dad

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.679
and as we were talking, I overheard her whisper

00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:32.440
to this little baby, I want it to just stay like this.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:37.840
She's holding her child, the child is not crying

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.119
and it's all peaceful, almost like a little halo

00:19:41.119 --> 00:19:44.140
resting over the child's head and I thought to myself,

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.380
I wanted to turn to her as a fundamental Baptist preacher

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.820
and say, well it ain't gonna stay there

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:54.420
but I decided to be nice that day but it doesn't stay,

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.540
it always moves, it always moves

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.940
and to be honest with you, we're not promised.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:04.940
easy or comfortable or pleasant circumstances all our lives.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.940
But what we are promised is this,

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:12.540
that as our lives are always and ever changing,

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.260
and as the circumstances that surround us

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.020
are always and ever changing,

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:22.900
we have a sovereign God who is sovereign

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.780
over the change in our lives.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.100
And I don't mean to be too elementary,

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:34.140
but God says, God says, look to the heavens

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.180
and comfort yourself when it is swirling around you

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.700
and you don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring,

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.500
you don't know what you're gonna do,

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:47.500
look to the heavens and remind yourselves, I do, God says.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.000
I don't know if you noticed it,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.980
but at about six o'clock last night, the sun went down.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:59.580
I follow the science, I am deeply scientific.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.180
How many of you noticed this morning

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.120
at about six o'clock, the sun came up?

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.740
Did you know that's gonna occur again today

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.700
and again tomorrow and again the next day?

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.260
And you say, well, yeah, preacher,

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.860
because the earth goes around the sun

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.520
because God did it on purpose.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.740
Because God wanted us to look at that and say,

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.660
wow, has this thing changed,

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:28.020
but wow, does God know and does God have control

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:31.459
and God knows what happens in the night, in the dark,

00:21:31.459 --> 00:21:33.819
and God knows what happens in the day

00:21:33.819 --> 00:21:36.779
and God knows how to get me there.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:41.720
We're getting ready to experience my favorite season, fall.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.500
I love the chill in the air,

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.980
I love the leaves getting ready to change.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.620
My favorite thing in the world is apples.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.700
I am the world's greatest apple connoisseur

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:56.139
and it is harvest season for apples.

00:21:56.139 --> 00:21:59.500
And sadly, it's going to give way

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.459
to my least favorite season of the year, which is winter.

00:22:03.459 --> 00:22:05.500
You say, don't you love the beauty of the snow?

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.940
No, you have to shovel it.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.660
But it's gonna give way to spring

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.960
and it's gonna give way to summer.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.380
You say, preacher, we know that.

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.300
You said you wouldn't be elementary.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.699
It's elementary, but it's vital for us to understand

00:22:18.699 --> 00:22:21.820
that God is in control

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:24.240
and God is able to bring life

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.059
where there doesn't seem to be life.

00:22:26.059 --> 00:22:28.740
He is able to handle transition

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.339
and he is able to move us through it.

00:22:31.339 --> 00:22:35.440
I love how the songwriter put this, and forgive my singing.

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:41.540
♪ Summer and winter, springtime and harvest ♪

00:22:42.979 --> 00:22:47.979
♪ Sun, moon, and stars in their courses above ♪

00:22:48.979 --> 00:22:53.979
♪ Join with all nature in manifold witness to what? ♪

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:03.380
♪ To thy great faithfulness, mercy, and love ♪

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.020
And I love what the songwriter does.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:16.020
♪ Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness ♪

00:23:18.979 --> 00:23:23.979
♪ Morning by morning, new mercies I see ♪

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.580
Now, you remember this line?

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:35.580
♪ All that I've needed, thy hand hath provided ♪

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.820
Regardless of the circumstances.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:47.820
♪ Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness ♪

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.479
♪ Lord, unto me. ♪

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.500
Boy, these are uncertain times, aren't they?

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.619
Honestly, we don't know what a day will bring forth.

00:24:00.619 --> 00:24:02.559
I almost don't turn the news on

00:24:02.559 --> 00:24:07.080
because the news cycle is like 12 minutes, not 12 hours.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:13.419
But in all of this mess and all of this chaos,

00:24:13.419 --> 00:24:17.980
there is a God who can make night turn into day.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.299
There is a God who controls

00:24:20.299 --> 00:24:22.540
and by whom all these things consist

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:27.220
and he moves us from summer to fall to winter to spring.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:30.820
God is utterly faithful.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:31.920
Here's number three.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.339
No human faithfulness can be compared

00:24:35.339 --> 00:24:36.459
to God's faithfulness.

00:24:36.459 --> 00:24:38.100
Look at verse eight.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.140
Look over at verse eight.

00:24:40.179 --> 00:24:45.179
Oh, Lord God of hosts, who is a strong Lord like unto thee

00:24:46.299 --> 00:24:49.739
or to thy faithfulness round about thee?

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.940
I love, as I began this sermon,

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.299
faithful men and women and their testimonies,

00:24:55.299 --> 00:24:57.820
but can I tell you the truth?

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:01.700
Men and women, to include myself, will fail you.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.019
I told my congregation for years and years,

00:25:06.019 --> 00:25:10.640
hang around me long enough and I will disappoint you.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.420
There'll be something that I do, something that I say,

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.420
I will disappoint you.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:19.839
And my friend, you cannot build your faith on a man.

00:25:19.839 --> 00:25:22.940
You can't build your faith on a political party.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.700
You can't build your faith on an IRA.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.420
You can't build your faith on a career.

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:33.420
There is only one who never, ever fails us.

00:25:34.179 --> 00:25:36.739
That is God Almighty.

00:25:36.739 --> 00:25:38.420
Put your trust in him.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:43.640
Since I've been retired the few weeks that I'm home a year,

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.519
one of the things I love to do

00:25:45.519 --> 00:25:48.299
is go with my wife grocery shopping.

00:25:48.299 --> 00:25:51.019
She does not love it when I go with her grocery shopping,

00:25:51.019 --> 00:25:52.299
but I love it.

00:25:52.299 --> 00:25:56.700
And we only shop at the finer stores, so we go to Walmart.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:00.459
And as we go into Walmart, there is a person there

00:26:00.459 --> 00:26:04.899
whose purpose in life is to make me feel good

00:26:04.899 --> 00:26:06.899
about myself being at Walmart.

00:26:06.899 --> 00:26:09.019
She's got, he or she's got a blue vest on,

00:26:09.019 --> 00:26:10.420
they've got a smiley face.

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.559
Their job is to welcome me to Walmart.

00:26:15.179 --> 00:26:17.440
Not long ago, I went with my wife.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.459
We walked in, I pushed the cart, that's my job.

00:26:20.459 --> 00:26:23.019
And be careful not to hit her in the back.

00:26:23.019 --> 00:26:25.339
As we're going through and we're coming up to that door,

00:26:25.339 --> 00:26:27.940
I see her, she's there.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.019
This is gonna be great, I love people.

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.179
I'm gonna greet her, she's gonna greet me.

00:26:32.179 --> 00:26:33.980
It's gonna make life wonderful.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:38.519
She makes eye contact with me and turns and walks away.

00:26:39.679 --> 00:26:41.820
Now can I tell you something?

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:44.799
I will never go to Walmart again

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.660
because of what that woman did.

00:26:50.019 --> 00:26:52.420
You take me too seriously, okay?

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.100
I don't go to Walmart because I need somebody

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.820
to make me feel good about myself.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:01.239
I go to Walmart because the Jif peanut butter is cheaper.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:08.420
I am so weary of people who use what is universally known

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.899
that men will disappoint us as a reason

00:27:12.899 --> 00:27:16.100
to not worship and serve the Lord

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.380
who will never fail them.

00:27:18.739 --> 00:27:22.100
Listen, I'm not making light that people have been hurt

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:25.380
by Christians and in significant ways.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.700
Please do not think that's what I'm doing.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.820
But you and I have to understand that it is a devil's tactic

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.500
to use the failure of men to cause us

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:39.480
not to want to have fellowship and faithfully worship

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.140
the one who is utterly faithful to us,

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.140
who has never failed us.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.420
I don't come to church for somebody

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.420
to make me feel good about myself.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:51.619
I come to church and sing and listen to preaching

00:27:51.619 --> 00:27:54.179
and learn of him to worship the one

00:27:54.179 --> 00:27:57.860
who is utterly faithful to me.

00:27:58.899 --> 00:28:03.420
And I pray that if somehow your life is marginalized

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:07.260
by the failure of a person in your life,

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.299
I'm not diminishing it.

00:28:09.299 --> 00:28:13.100
I'm just saying, beg God for the grace to get over it

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.540
because he has never failed you.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:19.420
And you are harming your own spiritual walk.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:23.580
You're allowing the failure of failing men

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:28.980
to keep you from serving and worshiping and loving

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.760
and enjoying your walk with the Lord

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.739
who has never, ever failed you.

00:28:34.739 --> 00:28:36.280
Notice this very quickly.

00:28:37.299 --> 00:28:40.700
Your sin does not change God's faithfulness.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.840
Turn over to verse 31 with me, would you?

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:48.400
Here, Ethan says, if they break my statutes

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.280
and keep not my commandments,

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:57.039
then will I visit their transgression with the rod

00:28:57.039 --> 00:28:59.400
and their iniquity with stripes.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.280
Nevertheless, my loving kindness

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.119
will I not utterly take from him,

00:29:06.119 --> 00:29:10.580
nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:16.260
This psalm, if we had time to really study it in depth,

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:20.220
you would understand was to reassure Israel

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.559
of the promises that God had made to David,

00:29:23.559 --> 00:29:27.559
that one of David's lineage would reign in perpetuity

00:29:27.559 --> 00:29:28.640
over Israel.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.659
That will be realized in the millennium

00:29:31.659 --> 00:29:34.739
when Jesus, the son of David,

00:29:34.739 --> 00:29:39.260
reigns literally from Jerusalem for 1,000 years.

00:29:39.299 --> 00:29:41.979
But now in the midst of this chaos,

00:29:41.979 --> 00:29:46.659
it looks like Israel's sin has broken the covenant

00:29:46.659 --> 00:29:49.539
and now God has forsaken them

00:29:49.539 --> 00:29:53.919
and he's not going to fulfill his promises to them.

00:29:53.919 --> 00:29:55.820
But that is never true.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.539
Yes, God is going to chastise them.

00:29:58.539 --> 00:30:00.140
He's going to deal with them.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:06.220
but in truth there is a remnant and God will bless them and God loves them even

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:12.140
through the chastising. You say preacher how does that relate to me? Well I've

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:17.540
been in ministry long enough that I've met a lot of people who use their

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:27.680
failure as a reason to not be restored and be used of the Lord. Hey David was a

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:33.760
flawed man. David committed adultery. I would suggest that's a very serious sin.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:41.000
David actually conspired in the murder of Uriah. David was a man who had was

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.600
filled with pride at times and and numbered his armies because he wanted to

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:54.640
see how great his empire was. David was as flawed as you and I. But can I remind

00:30:54.640 --> 00:31:03.020
you that God only has flawed people to work with and that God is able and God

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:11.920
loves us so much that even when we fail, when we sin, that God's desire is for us

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:17.920
to be restored and he convicts our hearts about what we've done and if we

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:24.360
will repent and if we will look to him that you and I can be restored.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:29.640
Sometimes we have the image of God that he is in heaven and he's a God with a

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:35.080
thunderbolt who's just waiting, just waiting for one of his kids to step out

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:39.280
of line so that he can dash them with that thunderbolt. And I want to tell you

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:44.440
that is not the accurate picture of who our God is. The accurate picture of our

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:54.240
God comes from that great parable of the prodigal. A son takes what his father has

00:31:54.240 --> 00:32:00.280
given to him, the blessing of his father, and takes it to the far country and then

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:10.280
wastes his his life in that place, finds himself in the pig pen having fed the

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:15.360
hogs and hoping to eat a little bit of what he has fed to the pigs. And I love

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:22.320
how simply the Bible puts it, it says he came to himself. And when he came to

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:31.520
himself, he said to himself, what what am I doing in a hog pen? And he gets up and

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:36.320
he makes the decision, I'm going back to my father. Now understand, when he goes

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:41.560
back to his father, he doesn't know what the reception will be. He doesn't know

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:46.360
whether his father will be there with a clenched fist, ready to beat him for his

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:51.040
sin. He doesn't know if his father will completely ignore him, and he'll have no

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:56.720
entrance to his father. He has no clue what it's going to be. But I want you to

00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:00.800
understand, on that day when he's approaching home and perhaps very

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:06.440
nervous about what father is going to be, when he sees his father standing in

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:11.760
the road because he was waiting and watching and hoping his son would come

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:20.600
home, and his arms are wide open, that's the picture of our God. And I don't care

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:26.880
whether we have failed him or not, I'm not minimizing sin, I'm maximizing the

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:35.960
graciousness and the mercy of our God. And God says come home. One of the

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:42.440
moments that has just burned into my mind, I preached a sermon somewhat along

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:48.400
those lines, and a man came forward and he motioned to me, would you come down?

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:52.240
And of course I would come down and speak with him and pray with him, and he

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:56.680
said to me, I shouldn't be here. I said, well what do you mean you shouldn't be

00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:01.040
here? He said, well you've preached on this probably ten times in the years

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.680
that I've been in this church, and he said, I've tried to get this thing

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:09.320
squared away, and I've tried to do it, and every time I failed, and here I am

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:13.800
back down here now. I've failed at this. And he said, I know God doesn't want me

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:17.440
to be here, but I wanted you to know that I know God doesn't want me to be here.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:24.480
I said, what are you talking about? I said, of course God wants you to be here.

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:31.800
God's message to the disciple was seven times seventy, and he wasn't teaching up

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:37.080
to 490 times you can be forgiven. He was saying as long as you'll come, I'll work

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:41.960
with you, I'll help you, I'll restore you. And look, I'm not trying to get people to

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:47.960
run it out to 490 times to fail. What I'm telling you is, is the devil will

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:54.320
keep you from experiencing fullness in Christ, because he will convince you that

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:59.480
your failure disqualifies you for the love of God, and the blessing of God, and

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:07.400
to be used of God, and restored. And I'm telling you, God says you come, because

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:12.320
though your sin may have to be chastised, and though you must confess and repent

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:22.080
of your failure, God says I will never utterly forsake you. One last thing and

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:31.360
I'm done. You know what God is faithful to do? He is faithful to call upon those

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.840
that will call upon him to be saved. I'm sorry, he's faithful to save those who

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:41.240
will call upon him. I don't know about you, but I know about me. I wasn't

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:47.000
raised in a Christian home. My mother and dad were not Christians. Mother may have

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.080
been, but dad was definitely not a Christian. And he got saved when a

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:58.140
soul winner came by the door at 63 years old, and they started serving the Lord. In

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:04.320
70, he became a deacon. My mother determined that she didn't raise her

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:10.120
boys as Christians, but now that she was serving the Lord, they were going to know

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:15.720
about the Lord. And so she determinedly would witness to us to the point where I

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:20.440
finally had to say, I was married, we had children, and I finally had to say, mother

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:24.440
you've made a decision. I'm glad for you and dad. You go the direction that he

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:28.880
wants. God wants you to go. But for Nancy and I, we're content with our

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:34.160
life. We're decent people, good people. We're going to do what we do. Long story

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:43.000
short, she knew that I had an affinity for cobbler, blackberry cobbler. And she

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.880
said to me one day, she said, Mike, do you do you want that blackberry cobbler?

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.800
You're coming over for it. I said, well of course I want that blackberry

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:56.600
cobbler. And she said, I left my dish at church, and you go right past that church.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:06.040
Could you just stop and pick that dish up? She had it set up, and the custodian,

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:11.720
who was a tremendous soul winner, had the dish in his hand. And it wasn't coming

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:17.800
out of his hand until I listened. And for 45 minutes he cornered me between a

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:24.000
water fountain and a wall, and he told me I was a sinner, and he told me I deserved

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.840
to go to hell. He told me that God loved me, my parents loved me, that yes, my mom

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:33.800
did this so that he could talk to me about the Lord. I was under conviction. I

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:38.280
got out of there without bowing my head and trusting Christ. I got home, thought

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:42.240
back and play with the baby, and I'll forget this, and I'll feel better. And I

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:47.800
got home, and my wife was gone with the baby. And my mother had given us a little

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:56.320
ward Bible, $2 Bible, no red letters, no notes, no maps, just a Bible. And she had

00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:01.360
taken a red pen and a ruler and underlined Romans chapter 10, verses 9

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:09.460
and 10 and 13. And deeply under conviction, I took that Bible down from a

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:12.960
shelf. We'd put it on a shelf. We didn't, we were glad to have it, didn't need it.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.160
And I opened that Bible to Romans chapter 10, verses 9 and 10 and 13, and

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:23.480
read them. And that man had just talked to me about the gospel and about Jesus's

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:27.680
resurrection, about his death, his resurrection, about his substitutionary

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:34.119
death for me. And I knew in my heart, I did believe that. And I knew I had to

00:38:34.119 --> 00:38:38.280
confess that. And I came to Romans chapter 13, I'm sorry, chapter 10 and

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:46.840
verse 13, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. I

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:51.880
took that Bible over to our sofa. I laid it on the sofa. I kneeled down before the

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.080
sofa. I prayed the most deeply theological prayer you've ever heard. It

00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.119
went something like this, God if you can save somebody like me, will you save me?

00:39:00.119 --> 00:39:09.320
And he did. Because God is utterly faithful. God is utterly faithful. That

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:21.920
whether it is 1200 AD, 70 AD, or 2021 AD, if a man or a woman or a child will

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:29.160
acknowledge that indeed they are sinners, and that their only hope of salvation is

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:35.920
the gift that is given to us in the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who came and loving

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:42.880
us, lived on this earth for 33 years, and as the Bible says, was yet without sin.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:49.480
And gave himself to die on the cross, and in a transaction that I will never

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:55.880
understand fully until I get to heaven, my sin is placed on him, and his

00:39:55.880 --> 00:40:02.000
righteousness is placed on me because of what he did.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000
and because of my acceptance of that truth, and when God sees me, he no longer

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:15.039
sees sinful Mike Edwards. He sees the righteousness of his Son, Jesus Christ.

00:40:15.039 --> 00:40:24.040
That is available to every person on this globe, because God is faithful to

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:30.040
save all those who, understanding their need and confessing the truth of Christ,

00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:38.040
will call upon him. So a series of questions and I'm done. Have you developed

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:44.639
a complaining spirit in the chaos and the confusion, the sadness of our world,

00:40:44.639 --> 00:40:51.520
the anger that surrounds us? Have you developed a spirit of grumbling? It's not

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:58.240
an innocent thing, and you and I must be the testimonies of God's mercy and grace

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:04.080
in this dark time, and our grumbling does not accomplish that. We may well

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:09.519
have been handed the greatest soul-winning evangelism tool the world

00:41:09.519 --> 00:41:15.239
has known in hundreds of years in this pandemic, but if all our workmates here

00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:21.120
is our complaining about a mask, or our complaining about this and complaining

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:26.239
about that, that will never draw people to the God that is so much

00:41:26.239 --> 00:41:33.839
bigger than all this. Are you fearful? There's a lot to be fearful about in

00:41:33.839 --> 00:41:38.760
this world, but you and I don't have to live fearfully. Our faith can rest on a

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:43.239
God who knows where we are, what we need, where he's taking us, and how to get

00:41:43.239 --> 00:41:50.959
there. Have you been hurt, disappointed by someone? Don't let that marginalize

00:41:50.959 --> 00:42:00.000
your walk with the Lord. And how about this? Have you failed? Boy, a revival this

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:06.000
time in our lives is a moment when we can say, God, I want to get back into it.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:12.119
Back into what? Back into serving you, back into pleasing you, back into loving

00:42:12.119 --> 00:42:20.880
you, back into sharing the truth, and Lord, will you help me? And he will. And then

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:27.880
last, if you're here or under the sound of my voice on livestream, if you're not

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:34.800
sure you've trusted Christ as your Savior, please, it is a matter of knowing

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:41.360
your need because you are a sinner, knowing God's provision of his Son who

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:49.279
willingly died on the cross without sin, not guilty, without sin, taking our sin

00:42:49.279 --> 00:42:56.520
upon him so that we could be made the righteousness of God in him. If you'll

00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:01.800
call upon the Lord, he'll save you. Would you pray with me? Father, we thank you so

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:05.440
much for these few minutes you've given us, and thank you for the patience of

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:12.199
people to listen to me. And I pray just now, whether folks are here or at home,

00:43:12.199 --> 00:43:17.839
whether they need to kneel at their sofa or kneel at their chair or at their

00:43:17.839 --> 00:43:23.399
table, whatever it is, God, a grumbling spirit is not an innocent thing, and I

00:43:23.399 --> 00:43:29.639
pray they deal with that. And Lord, being fearful in this time, it's understandable,

00:43:29.639 --> 00:43:35.000
but it's not acceptable for the Christian. We've got a God, you, who are

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:41.199
able to care for us in the midst of this chaos. And for those who have been hurt

00:43:41.199 --> 00:43:48.279
and use that hurt as a reason not to serve and live for you, deal with them

00:43:48.279 --> 00:43:54.639
and help them with that hurt. Lord, for those who have failed, they've sinned,

00:43:54.639 --> 00:43:59.839
they have broken fellowship with you, would you convince them that you love

00:43:59.839 --> 00:44:07.919
them, that you want to restore them? And for those who are unsaved, Father, if they

00:44:08.039 --> 00:44:17.559
will but make this simple acknowledgment that they are indeed sinners, and then

00:44:17.559 --> 00:44:25.959
believe that your Son, Jesus Christ, came to earth, lived sinlessly, died on a

00:44:25.959 --> 00:44:33.040
cross for them, and rose from the dead, and is coming again, if they will confess

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:40.119
that with their mouth, you are utterly faithful to save. So Lord, work in our

00:44:40.119 --> 00:44:47.839
lives and accomplish these things, I pray, in Jesus' name, amen.
