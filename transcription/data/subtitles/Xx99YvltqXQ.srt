1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,699
And we kind of ended up getting bogged down a little bit, but that's okay.

2
00:00:04,699 --> 00:00:09,199
And dealing with this subject and doing what we ought to do.

3
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:13,000
And in 1 John chapter number 2, in verse number 6,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,700
we're given this truth, and we've been looking at it now for

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,700
the last two Wednesday evenings. Tonight will be the third part.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,700
And I thought originally we would get through it in about three weeks,

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,000
but it's going to probably be five or six weeks.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And we're not in a hurry, and I'm thankful for the truth of God's word

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,500
and the opportunities that we have to study it.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,500
And here in 1 John 2, in verse number 6, it says,

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:46,000
He that saith he abideth in him, ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm thankful for the example that the Lord Jesus Christ gave us during His earthly ministry.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,500
Of course, we know several things about the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ.

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,500
And after His baptism and how He made Himself known and through all the miracles

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,500
and all that took place that eventually would lead to that trip to Jerusalem,

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,500
where He went to after the interrogations and all that took place,

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:15,500
going to a cruel cross to suffer and to shed His blood for your sin and for mine.

18
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,500
Of course, He rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

19
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,500
He's alive forevermore, and we rejoice in that.

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,500
But we think about those years in which He walked upon the earth.

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,500
John says that if all the things were written, the world itself couldn't contain the books.

22
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:35,500
And so we know that we don't have all that Christ did during His earthly ministry,

23
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,500
but God gave us a record through the gospel accounts.

24
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,500
We find that Peter tells us in 1 Peter that He left us, speaking of Christ,

25
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,500
left us an example that we should follow His steps.

26
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,500
And we find that many times through the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ,

27
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,500
as you study and you examine the portions of Scripture,

28
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,500
and you can see the miracles that are performed and the power of God that's on display

29
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
and the proof of deity and all of those things,

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:14,500
but you begin to trace His steps and you see that He walked in a certain manner.

31
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,500
And the very first week that we started this little mini-series within the series,

32
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,500
I said this, that Jesus walked wisely.

33
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,500
And how important it is that we also walk in wisdom,

34
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,500
understanding that we need the wisdom that is from above.

35
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,500
We don't need the earth's, the world's wisdom.

36
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
We need God's wisdom.

37
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,500
I'm so thankful that we serve a God who is the all-wise God.

38
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,500
And He said that if any lack, let them ask, right?

39
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,500
And He'll give to all men liberally, abrade it not.

40
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
He'll give us wisdom.

41
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,500
If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God.

42
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,500
And so often what I found in my life and even in ministry over the years

43
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,500
and working with individuals, a lot of times we don't acknowledge our lack of wisdom

44
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,500
and therefore we never ask for wisdom.

45
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,500
And oh, how desperately we need wisdom so that we could walk wisely in this world.

46
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
We find that number two, He walked humbly.

47
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,500
And the truth of humility, God says that He resisted the proud,

48
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
but He gives grace to the humble.

49
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,500
And how important it is that we as Christ walk, that we too would walk humbly.

50
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,500
Last week we said that He walked purposefully.

51
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,500
And everything He did, He did on purpose and with a purpose.

52
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,500
And there are times in which we can see very specifically the purpose

53
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,500
by which God was moving and working and why He delayed

54
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,500
and why He went to certain places and all of that.

55
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,500
It's a joy and a blessing to think about the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ

56
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,500
and how He lived, He walked with purpose.

57
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,500
And we dealt with this last Wednesday evening and said that we too,

58
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
we ought to walk purposefully.

59
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,500
We ought to have some purpose.

60
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
We ought to understand what our purpose is.

61
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,500
I'm thankful that as a New Testament believer,

62
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,500
I do not have the difficulty that so many in our society have today of saying,

63
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
why am I here?

64
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
What is my purpose?

65
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Why am I?

66
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,500
No, no, we know why we're here.

67
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,500
We're here to bring honor and glory to God.

68
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,500
And so we walk purposefully with that idea in mind

69
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,500
that He must increase and we must decrease.

70
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,500
This evening, I want to use this one as our next thought here and deal with it tonight.

71
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Jesus walked courageously.

72
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
He walked courageously.

73
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
And let me share a couple of passages of Scripture.

74
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Go to the Gospel of Mark, if you will.

75
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:45,500
And as our custom has been for these last couple of weeks here on Wednesday evening,

76
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,500
we'll examine a couple of portions of Scripture from the Gospels

77
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,500
to see how Christ walked in a particular manner this evening courageously.

78
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,500
And then we'll look at the instruction for us.

79
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
We see that Christ walked courageously.

80
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Okay, I am also to walk as Christ walks, so therefore I should walk courageously.

81
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
What does that mean?

82
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
What does it look like?

83
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
So on and so forth.

84
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,500
And so the idea of courage is that quality of mind

85
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:18,500
which enables men and or women to encounter danger and difficulties.

86
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,500
Notice this with firmness, bravery.

87
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,500
I like this one, boldness and resolution.

88
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,500
And that's what it means to have courage or to be courageous.

89
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:37,500
And we find that this evening as we consider the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ here in Mark,

90
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,500
if you turn to Mark chapter number 11, Mark chapter number 11,

91
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,500
and notice we find that as we look here at this text

92
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,500
that Jesus was walking, I believe, with courage.

93
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
He was walking courageously.

94
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,500
In verse number 27, the Bible says this,

95
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,500
And they come again to Jerusalem, and as he was walking in the temple,

96
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,500
there come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.

97
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
And notice what they say to him in verse 28,

98
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,500
By what authority doest thou these things?

99
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,500
And who gave thee this authority to do these things?

100
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,500
Now, I find it quite interesting, of course, in Mark's gospel,

101
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,500
chapter number 11, it only goes to chapter 16,

102
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,500
he's nearing the end of his earthly ministry

103
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,500
and soon going to the cross and all that will take place.

104
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,500
But we find that he's walking and he's there,

105
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,500
the Bible tells us in verse 27, in the temple,

106
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
and he's walking there, he's walking out in the midst,

107
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,500
the Pharisees, the scribes, the Sadducees, all the religious leaders,

108
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,500
they all at this point in Christ's ministry,

109
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,500
they were looking for any opportunity that they could possibly come up with to kill him,

110
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,500
they hated him, they were, every time they were around,

111
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,500
they were trying to find something to accuse him of,

112
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,500
and we find that they take this approach in Mark 11,

113
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,500
and they say, By what authority doest thou these things?

114
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Now, it's an interesting question because we know who Jesus is.

115
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Now, they're asking the question, of course,

116
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,500
they're denying the truth that was right before them.

117
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Jesus had made it abundantly clear, in fact, John,

118
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,500
when there's another situation in the Gospel of John

119
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,500
where they come and they say, Tell us plainly, are you the Christ?

120
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,500
And he says, I have, but you didn't believe.

121
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,500
And the reality is that he's made it abundantly clear who he is,

122
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,500
they've already attempted to kill him on more than one occasion

123
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
because they knew that he was claiming to be God,

124
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,500
but then they ask the question, By what authority are you doing these things?

125
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Well, he's God, he's the creator.

126
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,500
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,

127
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,500
and the Word was God, and we find that they ask him this question,

128
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,500
and then they say this, Who gave thee this authority to do these things?

129
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,500
And notice in verse 29, the Bible says this,

130
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,500
And Jesus answered and said unto them,

131
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,500
And I just begin to see the courage of the Lord standing before these that are questioning me,

132
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,500
and he says, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me,

133
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,500
and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.

134
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,500
And then notice where he says, Jesus, just the wisdom,

135
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,500
we could look at this passage as well with Jesus walked wisely,

136
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,500
it says, The baptism of John, verse 30,

137
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Was it from heaven or of men? Answer me.

138
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Now can you see Jesus? Now they think they have authority, right?

139
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,500
These religious leaders, and they were in a place,

140
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,500
and oftentimes these, notice it tells us, they come to him,

141
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,500
the chief priest, the scribes, and the elders, in verse 27,

142
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,500
these individuals, they were used to having a level of power and authority over the people,

143
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,500
and if they ask a question, they expect an answer.

144
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,500
And Jesus says, Well, I'm actually going to ask you a question,

145
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,500
and I'm going to ask you, and you answer me.

146
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,500
And he says at the end of verse number 30, answer me.

147
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,500
But notice verse 31, And they reasoned with themselves.

148
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,500
That's just comical to me, because you know what they did?

149
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,500
Jesus put them in a place where they couldn't give an answer,

150
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,500
because whatever answer they gave was going to really put them in a position

151
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,500
where they were going to be exposed.

152
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,500
And so Jesus, again, if you think about the wisdom of God and what he's doing here,

153
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,500
it says, They reasoned within themselves, saying,

154
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:30,500
If we shall say from heaven, then he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?

155
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,500
Verse 32, But if we shall say of men, they feared the people.

156
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,500
For all men count it John, that he was a prophet indeed.

157
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,500
And notice verse 33, And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell.

158
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,500
We cannot tell. And notice what Jesus said,

159
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:53,500
Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

160
00:09:53,500 --> 00:10:00,500
I see a measure of courage as he stands there to those that were the authority.

161
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,700
from a physical, from a human perspective,

162
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,659
the religious leaders of the day,

163
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:08,699
the chief priests, the scribes, the elders,

164
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:11,979
they come and they ask Jesus, and he says,

165
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,880
actually, I'm gonna ask you a question first.

166
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,060
If you answer me, then I'll answer you.

167
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,280
And he gives them the question, says, answer me.

168
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,020
They refuse to answer.

169
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,100
And then Jesus says, and I'm not gonna answer you either.

170
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,659
Wow.

171
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,100
Wow.

172
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,940
The courage of the Lord.

173
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,860
We find in John chapter seven, turn over if you will,

174
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,779
and I want you to see in John chapter number seven,

175
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:39,180
we looked at this passage a couple of weeks ago,

176
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,540
and as we talked about the wisdom of the Lord,

177
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,979
and where he said that he was not going yet,

178
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,360
but in John chapter number seven,

179
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,360
we find here that he says to those, his brethren,

180
00:10:53,979 --> 00:10:55,259
he tells them to go, verse six,

181
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:57,979
then Jesus said to them, my time has not yet come,

182
00:10:57,979 --> 00:11:00,459
but your time is always ready, in verse eight,

183
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,819
he says, go ye up unto the feast.

184
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:04,299
I go not up yet unto this feast,

185
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:06,379
for my time is not yet full come.

186
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:07,980
But we find that it's interesting,

187
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,099
because the Bible says when he had said these words

188
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:12,940
in verse number nine unto them, he abode still in Galilee.

189
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,819
Again, we could look at what we dealt with last week,

190
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:18,220
the purpose, he walked purposefully.

191
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,580
We begin to see these things weave together

192
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,459
as we study through this here, this little mini-series,

193
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:27,339
how that it's not independent that I walk wisely,

194
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:29,620
but not courageously, or I'm walking courageously

195
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,980
and not wisely, or I'm walking purposefully,

196
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,779
but not wisely, no, no, no, it all gets weaved together.

197
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,500
And we find that what happens is it says here,

198
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,300
in verse number nine, that he abodes still in Galilee.

199
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,900
Notice in verse 10, but when his brethren were gone up,

200
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,059
then went he also up unto the feast,

201
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:49,180
not openly, but as it were in secret.

202
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,680
Then the Jews sought him at the feast and said,

203
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,519
where is he?

204
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:54,199
Now, why were they seeking him?

205
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:56,300
Because they knew he was gonna be there,

206
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,699
and they wanted to kill him.

207
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:00,580
Why was it that they knew he was gonna be there?

208
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,260
Well, because he's a Jewish man,

209
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,699
and by the law, he was required to be there.

210
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:08,300
And so they knew that he would be there,

211
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,300
and they're seeking him, but they're not seeking him

212
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,300
because they wanna learn of him, or they have,

213
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,259
no, no, they're seeking him because they wanna kill him.

214
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:15,820
It tells us in verse number 12,

215
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,139
and there was much murmuring among the people

216
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:21,100
concerning him, for some said, he is a good man,

217
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,139
others said, nay, but he deceived the people,

218
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:26,300
how be it, no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.

219
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,580
Now, about the midst of the feast,

220
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,380
Jesus went up into the temple and taught.

221
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,059
That's public, that's courage.

222
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:40,759
He knew that they wanted to kill him.

223
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:45,139
If you go back into the text of scripture in verse number one

224
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,940
and after these things, Jesus walked in Galilee,

225
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,500
for he would not walk in Jewry

226
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,500
because the Jews sought to kill him.

227
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,300
And then we find that as they were searching for him,

228
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,100
and as they were looking for him,

229
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,100
they knew that he would be there,

230
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,899
that he goes, and according to verse number 14,

231
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,539
about the midst of the feast,

232
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:08,940
he went up into the temple and he taught.

233
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,860
And notice in verse 15 that the Jews marveled,

234
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,979
saying, how knoweth this man letters, having never learned?

235
00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:17,699
Jesus answered them and said, my doctrine is not mine,

236
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:19,020
but his that sent me.

237
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,300
If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,

238
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,059
whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself.

239
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:28,399
He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory,

240
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,220
but he that seeketh his glory that sent him,

241
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,460
the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him.

242
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,380
Notice in verse 19, did not Moses give you the law

243
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,940
and yet none of you keepeth the law?

244
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,699
Why go ye about to kill me?

245
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:44,679
He approaches it head on.

246
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:47,660
Why are you going about to kill me?

247
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,059
The people answered him, verse 20, thou hast a devil,

248
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:51,779
who goeth about to kill thee?

249
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,179
Jesus answered and said unto them,

250
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:55,699
I have done one work and ye all marvel.

251
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:57,860
Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision,

252
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,100
not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers,

253
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,139
and ye on the Sabbath day circumcise a man.

254
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:05,339
Why does Jesus say that?

255
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:07,259
Well, because they were always criticizing

256
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:09,940
the fact that he was working on the Sabbath.

257
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,899
What was he doing though?

258
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:12,580
He was healing people on the Sabbath.

259
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,579
He was showing that he is the Lord of the Sabbath.

260
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:20,339
And we find that that was always a contention.

261
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,820
In fact, as you trace the steps of Jesus,

262
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,339
many miracles that he performed were on the Sabbath.

263
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:29,579
And so we find that he says, but you on the Sabbath,

264
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,660
you circumcise a man.

265
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,500
Why?

266
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,579
Because of the law of Moses and he deals with that.

267
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:37,619
Verse number 23, if a man on the Sabbath day

268
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:40,019
receives circumcision, that the law of Moses

269
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:40,940
should not be broken.

270
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,859
Are you angry at me because I have made a man

271
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:45,500
every whit whole on the Sabbath day?

272
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,239
Judge not according to the appearance,

273
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,040
but judge righteous judgment.

274
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,619
Do you see the boldness and the courage of the Lord?

275
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:55,160
We find that in the midst of facing,

276
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,559
knowing that individuals were desiring to kill him,

277
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,559
that Jesus went and he's teaching publicly.

278
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,519
He's right there.

279
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,600
I then notice in John chapter 18,

280
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,160
quickly if you turn there,

281
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,279
I want you to see in John chapter number 18.

282
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,839
Now Jesus knew all things.

283
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,959
We find that Jesus in John 17 said the hour has come.

284
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:16,980
We find that Jesus had been preparing the disciples

285
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,220
for a period of time, especially in the Gospel of John,

286
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,820
as you trace kind of the chronological order

287
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,079
of the Gospel of John.

288
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,820
Jesus had been preparing the disciples for what?

289
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,980
I'm gonna go to Jerusalem, I'm going to be tried,

290
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,940
I'm going to die, and I'm gonna rise again.

291
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,500
And they weren't getting it, they weren't getting it,

292
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,059
but he's giving them the truth.

293
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:39,980
He knows what's going to happen.

294
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,040
He knew that it was for this hour that he was born.

295
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,980
He understood the plan.

296
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,380
And we find that in John 18,

297
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,500
this is the arrest in the Garden of Gethsemane.

298
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,299
We find that the Bible says in verse one,

299
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:55,339
when Jesus had spoken these words,

300
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:58,859
that's chapter 17, the hour's come, so on and so forth,

301
00:15:58,859 --> 00:16:02,220
he went forth with his disciples over the Beuchatron,

302
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,700
where was a garden into the which he entered

303
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,140
and his disciples.

304
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,779
And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place,

305
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:13,540
for Jesus oft times resorted thither with his disciples.

306
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,600
Now remember, what did he tell Judas to do

307
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,480
after they had the last supper?

308
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,920
He said, what you're gonna do, do it quickly, right?

309
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,140
Did Jesus know that he was gonna betray him?

310
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,279
Yes, he made it known.

311
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,359
Now the disciples didn't get it, why?

312
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:28,559
Because they're too busy arguing

313
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,239
about who's gonna be the greatest, right?

314
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:32,079
That's what's going on,

315
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,359
they're arguing about who's gonna be the greatest,

316
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:37,279
but Jesus knew that Judas was going to betray him,

317
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,720
and Jesus made it known, he to whom I give the sop,

318
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,880
and so on and so forth,

319
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,839
but he tells them what you do, do quickly.

320
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,440
Now they thought, oh man, he's got the bag,

321
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,959
he was in control of the money,

322
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:49,720
and therefore, whatever it was

323
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,320
that he was gonna go buy supplies or whatever it was,

324
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,079
they totally missed it, all right?

325
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:59,839
And so Jesus knew that Judas was gonna betray him,

326
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,820
and Jesus goes to a place,

327
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:05,440
a place that was very well known,

328
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,839
a place that Judas knew,

329
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,519
a place that Judas would be able to easily go to

330
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,239
and lead the religious leaders

331
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:18,640
that wanted to kill Jesus to betray him in that place.

332
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,679
But guess what Jesus did?

333
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,519
He went there anyway,

334
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:22,399
because he was walking courageously.

335
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:24,480
Notice it says this in verse number two,

336
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,200
and Judas also, which betrayed him,

337
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,480
knew the place, for Jesus oft times

338
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,559
resorted thither with his disciples.

339
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,880
Judas then, having received a band of men

340
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,000
and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees,

341
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,320
cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.

342
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,600
Now can you see in your mind's eye the scene?

343
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,079
I mean, I see this scene of this group of people coming,

344
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,720
I mean, this mob of people,

345
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,200
and they're coming with perceived power, right?

346
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,160
They're gonna take and arrest Jesus,

347
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,320
and Jesus, notice what it says in verse number four,

348
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,839
therefore, Jesus therefore,

349
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:58,119
knowing all things that should come upon him,

350
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,839
went forth and said unto them, whom seek ye?

351
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,799
That's courage.

352
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,359
This whole group of people come.

353
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:08,679
We know as we read the other gospel accounts

354
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,600
that when Judas comes and betrays them how?

355
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,600
With a kiss, that he says to Judas, friend, friend.

356
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,920
And Jesus knew all things,

357
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,119
and yet he goes out to this band of people

358
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:24,640
and says, whom seek ye?

359
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,839
And notice they answered him, Jesus of Nazareth.

360
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:30,279
Now, I've said this before,

361
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,840
I don't have time to deal with all of it tonight.

362
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,840
In the beginning of the calendar year of 2024,

363
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,520
we dealt with like 15 weeks of why

364
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,280
we should continue using the King James Bible,

365
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,960
but one of the lessons that I taught,

366
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,520
we talked about the italicized words.

367
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,440
The italicized words are not in the original language,

368
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,799
they're put in for the ease of readability.

369
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,919
There are some verses of scripture

370
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,200
that if you remove the italicized words,

371
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,000
you can understand why it's hard to follow the flow

372
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,559
because of the language differences

373
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,000
between the Greek and the Hebrew and the English,

374
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,679
and so they're entered in, they're inserted,

375
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,280
and they're put in italicized words

376
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,880
by the writers of the King James

377
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,239
because they're being transparent and they're saying,

378
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:18,400
hey, these are not in the original language

379
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,580
and we want it to be known.

380
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,280
They're not doing the deceitfulness kind of stuff

381
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,979
that the modern versions are doing

382
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:27,000
where they just take and change and remove and add

383
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,239
and so on and so forth,

384
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:30,239
and I want you, the reason that I say this

385
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:33,159
is because this passage is so powerful.

386
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:35,200
In John chapter 18 and verse number five,

387
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,599
they say that they're seeking Jesus of Nazareth

388
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:43,359
and Jesus said unto them, I am.

389
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,520
Now, your Bible says I am he,

390
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,479
and I understand it, I get it, he is italicized, all right?

391
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:52,719
But he says, I am.

392
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:54,479
What's the significance of that?

393
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,880
Exodus.

394
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,520
Moses says, whom shall I say sent me?

395
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,520
I am.

396
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,020
that I am, right?

397
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,440
What did Jesus say in John chapter number eight,

398
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,360
when he says, before Abraham was, I am.

399
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,160
And so Jesus, when they say, I'm searching,

400
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,360
we're looking for Jesus of Nazareth,

401
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,400
he goes to these group of people and he says, I am.

402
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,440
And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.

403
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,720
And then notice what it says,

404
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,680
as soon then, in verse number six,

405
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,040
as he said unto them, I am,

406
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,020
they went backward and fell to the ground.

407
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,040
The power of his word,

408
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,480
but the courage by which he walked.

409
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,160
He knew why Judas was coming.

410
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,520
He knew why that band of men were gathered together.

411
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,580
He knew what their evil intent was,

412
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,920
but he knew I was born for this purpose.

413
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,100
This is the hour by which I'm going to pay

414
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,800
for the sin of the world.

415
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,660
He knew all of that.

416
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,960
And he walked with courage.

417
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,120
We could go on and on this evening through the gospels

418
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,280
and look at various examples of Christ walking with courage,

419
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,460
but let me give some instruction for us

420
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,920
as the people of God,

421
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,520
that today we too are to walk with courage.

422
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,400
Not only are we to walk with courage,

423
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,020
but I would say it this way, we must walk courageously.

424
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,140
We must have courage.

425
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,040
We must have this firmness and this bravery

426
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,160
and this boldness and this resolution.

427
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,420
It's not being ugly.

428
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,720
It's not being unkind.

429
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,480
It's not running people over,

430
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:34,040
but it's just simply having a courageous approach

431
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,860
to how we live our lives,

432
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,040
that I'm living for Jesus.

433
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,600
I'm serving the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

434
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,960
I've been given authority from him,

435
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,240
and I'm gonna carry out what he's given me

436
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,240
the responsibility of doing,

437
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,600
and I'm gonna do it with courage.

438
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,440
Amen?

439
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,340
And we find, notice if you will, Joshua.

440
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,720
Great passage of scripture.

441
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,500
Joshua chapter number one,

442
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,340
we see the word courage used repeatedly

443
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,980
in Joshua chapter number one,

444
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,620
and I wanna read those verses

445
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,540
because I think they're so powerful.

446
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,980
Moses, of course, is not gonna be able to enter

447
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,180
into the land of promise,

448
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,500
and Joshua would be the next human leader

449
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,780
of the children of Israel,

450
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,300
and we find that in Joshua chapter number one,

451
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,540
if I could sum up the first nine verses

452
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,300
of Joshua chapter number one,

453
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,700
I would sum them up this way.

454
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,620
God encouraged his servant.

455
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,980
God was encouraging Joshua for the work,

456
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,100
for the task that was at hand,

457
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,420
and the Bible says this in verse number six.

458
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,460
Notice we're just gonna kind of pick our way through.

459
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,340
In verse number six,

460
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,980
be strong and of a good courage,

461
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,760
for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance

462
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,300
the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them.

463
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,860
Only be thou strong and very courageous

464
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,780
that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law

465
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,780
which Moses, my servant, commanded thee.

466
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,840
Turn not from it to the right hand or the left

467
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,660
that thou mayest prosper,

468
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,060
whithersoever thou goest.

469
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,380
Verse number eight,

470
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,460
this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth,

471
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,500
but thou shalt meditate therein day and night

472
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,220
that thou mayest observe to do according

473
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,960
to all that is written therein,

474
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,120
for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous,

475
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,940
and then thou shalt have good success.

476
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,100
Have not I commanded thee?

477
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,000
Be strong and of a good courage.

478
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,500
Be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed,

479
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,940
for the Lord thy God is with thee,

480
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,580
whithersoever thou goest.

481
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,220
You know, we have a promise,

482
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,260
just as Joshua had a promise,

483
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,300
for the Lord Jesus Christ said this

484
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,540
when he gave the great commission

485
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,140
that's recorded in Matthew,

486
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,760
and lo, I am with you always.

487
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,340
He said, I'm with you.

488
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,060
He tells Joshua to be courageous, why?

489
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,020
Because I'm with you.

490
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,340
He tells us that we're to have that courage, why?

491
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,380
Because he's with us.

492
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,080
And I have a mandate.

493
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,480
I have a command.

494
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,840
I have a commission from my God,

495
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,160
from my Savior, from my Lord,

496
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,960
to live courageously, to live obediently.

497
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,720
We find that in Matthew chapter number 10

498
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,880
and verse number 16, the Bible says this.

499
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,760
Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves.

500
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,080
Be you therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves.

501
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,900
You know what?

502
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,780
If we're sheep being sent forth into the midst of wolves,

503
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,820
we need to walk with courage.

504
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,820
We need to live courageously.

505
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,180
We need to understand that in this text of Scripture,

506
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:26,240
notice what the Bible says in Matthew 10 and verse 16.

507
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,640
It's not that I'm just choosing

508
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,380
to walk in the midst of sheep.

509
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:35,380
No, Jesus says, I send you forth.

510
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,460
Do you notice that?

511
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,940
He says, behold, I send you forth as sheep

512
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,580
in the midst of wolves.

513
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,220
Therefore, be you therefore wise as serpents

514
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,580
and harmless as doves.

515
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,420
And so I didn't just arbitrarily make a decision,

516
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,500
a choice, neither did you, that we're just gonna be sheep

517
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,560
that are gonna go walk amongst the wolves.

518
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,620
No, no, Jesus said, I'm sending you forth.

519
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,740
And therefore, I must have courage

520
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,760
because it requires courage to carry out the work of God.

521
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,680
Why?

522
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,520
Because there's opposition.

523
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,880
There's adversity.

524
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,020
There's people that are gonna say,

525
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,720
you're not allowed to do that.

526
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,460
You can't talk about this.

527
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,200
You can't, no, no, I'm having courage.

528
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,540
Again, I'm not trying to be ugly.

529
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,500
I'm not trying to be unkind.

530
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,200
I'm not trying to plow people over,

531
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,460
but I wanna have courage

532
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,940
because I've been given a mandate from God.

533
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,300
It's amazing to me how people can have such courage

534
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,560
when it comes to certain causes.

535
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,940
And yet as the people of God so often were timid,

536
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,060
we need to have courage, bold as a lion, amen?

537
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,780
I mean, seriously, we need to have boldness.

538
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,260
We find that in the book of Acts,

539
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,400
where does this boldness come from?

540
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,380
This courage, where does it come from?

541
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,840
Is it something that,

542
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,740
well, they're just naturally born courageous.

543
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,040
That's just in their DNA, that they're just courageous,

544
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,220
and I'm just not.

545
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,060
You ever hear somebody say,

546
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,060
well, they just naturally can,

547
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,620
they have a knack for talking,

548
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,140
and it's just not really my thing.

549
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,960
And no, no, no, we've been commanded to do things

550
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,000
that sometimes are within how we are designed

551
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,760
as far as what our natural tendencies are,

552
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,960
but not having the natural tendency

553
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,280
is not an excuse for disobeying what God told us to do.

554
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,080
And so we find that the Bible tells us

555
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,640
in Acts chapter number one, but ye shall receive power.

556
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,900
Now, if you're receiving power,

557
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,960
that means because you don't have power, am I right?

558
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,040
If I have a drill up here that's a power drill,

559
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,520
that's a corded drill,

560
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,080
and I have that thing in my hand

561
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,640
and I'm gonna try to do something,

562
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,880
that drill is absolutely useless

563
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,400
until I plug it into that outlet.

564
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,680
And then all of a sudden,

565
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,280
when I plug it into that outlet

566
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,240
and the current goes through,

567
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,660
all of a sudden my drill has power, am I right?

568
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:05,760
But without the power source, it's kind of useless.

569
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,720
What did Jesus say, without me you can do nothing.

570
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,840
And so we find here that the Bible tells us,

571
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,720
but ye shall receive power.

572
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,840
Oh, how we need power.

573
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,340
After that, the Holy Ghost is come upon you.

574
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,240
And ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem

575
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,740
and all Judean and Samarian

576
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,920
under the uttermost part of the earth.

577
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,600
I fear sometimes that we have allowed the Pentecostals

578
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,120
and the Charismatics to steal from us

579
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,160
Biblical truth with regard to the Holy Ghost

580
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,920
and the ministry of the Holy Ghost.

581
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,200
There is clear Bible teaching

582
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,060
about what it means to be indwelled

583
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,360
by the Holy Spirit of God,

584
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,920
what it means to be filled with the Holy Spirit of God

585
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,960
and what the ministry of the Holy Spirit of God is.

586
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,320
And sometimes we get so worked up

587
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,880
over the Pentecostals and the Charismatics

588
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,360
and the speaking in tongues and all of the scientists,

589
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,480
we can deal with all of that biblically.

590
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,160
It's very easy if you just study the scriptures

591
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,360
and you can address all of it and you can understand it,

592
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,840
but we can't get so far over correcting from it

593
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,320
that we shy away from talking about the ministry

594
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,240
of the Holy Spirit of God in the life of a believer.

595
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,400
I'm thankful to be sealed with the Spirit of God.

596
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,960
It's the earnest of our inheritance.

597
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,119
Listen, my spirit, his spirit,

598
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:35,559
it's gonna commune with my spirit.

599
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:37,920
And we understand that Paul,

600
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,040
he has said to go into Asia and Bithynia

601
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,880
and so on and so forth,

602
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,080
but the Spirit suffered him,

603
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,679
the ministry of the Holy Spirit of God.

604
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:47,179
I read recently, and this is kind of a rabbit trail,

605
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:48,480
but I'm gonna get the rabbit and kill him

606
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,540
and we're gonna get back.

607
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,800
But I read recently, these Pentecostals,

608
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,679
they got all this crazy stuff about the Holy Spirit

609
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,600
and it was tongues and it was this and it was that.

610
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,960
They said now, I just read this about three weeks ago,

611
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,679
that there was this new movement,

612
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:03,040
this is absolutely crazy, it blew my mind,

613
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,559
that to prove that you're filled with the Holy Spirit,

614
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,920
you start throwing up, okay?

615
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,720
Now that, Doc starts laughing.

616
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,880
Here's my immediate, Bart, my immediate thought was this.

617
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,160
Who's gonna clean all that mess up?

618
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,600
That was my immediate thought, all right?

619
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,960
It makes zero sense.

620
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,140
Where are you finding that in the Bible?

621
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,760
It's bizarre.

622
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,720
Back to the passage, back to the thought.

623
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,920
We're to have boldness so that we can walk courageously.

624
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,239
Notice in Acts chapter number four,

625
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:37,600
I think about Peter standing here in Acts chapter number four

626
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,360
and the Bible tells us in Acts chapter number four,

627
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,480
they'd already been imprisoned and they're kept in ward.

628
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,520
Why?

629
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,520
Because of the miracle that took place

630
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,200
in John chapter number, excuse me, Acts chapter number three

631
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,239
and we find that they're kept overnight

632
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:53,360
and they begin to get interrogated

633
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,480
and in verse number eight, Peter, the Bible says this,

634
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,119
filled with the Holy Ghost.

635
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:00,960
He said.

636
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,920
unto them, ye rulers of the people and elders of Israel."

637
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,760
And we can read what he says.

638
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,800
It's not very long, but we don't have much time.

639
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,800
He ends it by saying in verse 12,

640
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,880
neither is there salvation in any other,

641
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,920
for there's none other name under heaven given among men

642
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,460
whereby we must be saved.

643
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:21,460
Now, when they saw, notice what they saw, the boldness.

644
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,880
What did I say courage was?

645
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,100
Courage was having the quality of mind,

646
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,560
which enables an individual to encounter danger

647
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,060
and difficulties with firmness,

648
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,960
bravery, boldness, and resolution.

649
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,940
They saw the boldness of Peter and John.

650
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,900
See, they were used to having authority.

651
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,300
These that gathered, these religious leaders

652
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,660
that gathered John and Peter together,

653
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,000
and they're going to begin to interrogate them.

654
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,740
They're used to people being timid and shying away,

655
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,620
but Peter stands up filled with the Holy Ghost,

656
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,540
and he gives them an answer.

657
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,320
He's got courage.

658
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,380
He's got courage, and it says that they saw

659
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,980
the boldness of Peter and John

660
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:06,300
and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men.

661
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,900
They marveled, and they took knowledge of them,

662
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,180
noticed this, that they had been with Jesus.

663
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,620
I said this, I believe it was on the Sunday afternoon

664
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,600
service of our friend day this year.

665
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,600
You can't pretend when it comes to spending time with Jesus,

666
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,740
and people can tell if you've spent time with Jesus,

667
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,740
and we find here that they saw the boldness,

668
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,580
and how do they get that boldness?

669
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,140
Well, it's the key is in verse number eight

670
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,300
that they're filled with the Holy Ghost.

671
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,560
Notice, if you will, in Acts chapter number four,

672
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,820
as we continue to go through,

673
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,940
we don't have time to look at every verse of scriptures.

674
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,900
We dig through this very quickly tonight,

675
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,440
but we find that after they stand and they preach

676
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,580
that these religious leaders, they're stuck

677
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,820
because they don't know what to say.

678
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,880
They don't know what to do because guess what?

679
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,740
The man that was healed in Acts chapter number three

680
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,880
is standing there, and everybody saw him.

681
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,220
Everybody knew that he was lame, and he sat at the gate.

682
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,980
They saw him yesterday, and last week, and the week before,

683
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,100
and now he's leaping and praising God,

684
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,460
and they don't know what to do.

685
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,500
It actually says at the end of verse number 16

686
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,280
that a notable miracle was done, and we cannot deny it.

687
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,340
Listen, it was impossible for them to come out there

688
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,920
and say, hey guys, look, it's just a fake.

689
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,760
It's just a fraud.

690
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,460
No, they could not deny it, so what do we do?

691
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,480
How do we handle this situation?

692
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,340
Well, here's what we're gonna do.

693
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,180
We're gonna threaten them.

694
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,760
We're gonna tell them you can't talk

695
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,300
in the name of Jesus anymore.

696
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,500
We're gonna forbid you to speak about the name of Jesus.

697
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,340
That's what happens.

698
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,120
I can't read it all, but that's what happens

699
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,360
in the next several verses.

700
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,720
In verse number 23, being let go,

701
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,800
they went to their own company, and what do they do?

702
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,640
They prayed.

703
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,480
In verse 24, the Bible says, and when they heard that,

704
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,940
they lifted up their voice to God with one accord,

705
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,020
and notice they say, Lord, thou art God,

706
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,360
which hast made heaven and earth,

707
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,480
and seen all that in them is.

708
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,380
They recognize, as you study the prayer of the disciples

709
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,300
in Acts chapter number four, they knew who God was,

710
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,740
and their prayer revealed it.

711
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,120
I wonder when we examine our prayers,

712
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,500
how much does it reveal that we know about God?

713
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,460
It says to us in verse number 29,

714
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,460
and now, Lord, behold their threatenings,

715
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,060
and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness

716
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,260
they may speak thy word.

717
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,220
You know what they prayed for?

718
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,080
They prayed for boldness, but can I say it?

719
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,360
I don't think it's a stretch to say they prayed for courage,

720
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,920
because to have courage is to have boldness,

721
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,360
and we find that they pray, God, they didn't.

722
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,920
Now, could God have removed the enemy?

723
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,760
Sure.

724
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,400
Could God have dealt with them?

725
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,900
Absolutely, but they don't pray that way.

726
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,360
They say, God, you heard what they said.

727
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,840
You heard their threatenings.

728
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,540
You heard what they commanded us,

729
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,020
so now we're asking that you would give us boldness

730
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,280
to speak thy word, and the Bible tells us

731
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,520
in verse number 31, and when they had prayed,

732
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,880
the place was shaken where they were assembled together,

733
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,000
and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost,

734
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,840
and they spake the word of God with boldness.

735
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,800
Several more verses that I have in my notes.

736
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,120
We won't take time this evening.

737
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,200
We need to pray, but I want you to know

738
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,040
that there's an example after example after example

739
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,000
in the book of Acts of the disciples

740
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
really walking with Christ and walking courageously

741
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,540
in the midst of great adversity,

742
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,820
in the midst of great opposition.

743
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,260
They walked with courage.

744
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,620
They had boldness, and they're living in such a way

745
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,340
that they're making a difference,

746
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,980
so much so that they say you filled Jerusalem

747
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,820
with your doctrine.

748
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,300
They say that you've turned the world upside down.

749
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,260
They were courageous.

750
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,580
They were walking just like their Savior walked.

751
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,160
In Ephesians three and verse 12,

752
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,100
I'll close with this verse of Scripture.

753
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,480
The Bible says in whom we have boldness

754
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,480
and access with confidence by the faith of him.

755
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,560
Listen, God has given to each of us this evening

756
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,280
a mandate, a responsibility to walk in such a manner

757
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,040
that we would bring honor and glory to his name,

758
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,840
that we would walk with courage,

759
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,220
that we would live courageously,

760
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,840
that we would understand this evening

761
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,460
that our God is on his throne,

762
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,820
that we would understand tonight

763
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,540
that he's given us a responsibility,

764
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,580
and if I'm going to look at my life,

765
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,100
if I'm going to examine my life and say

766
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,420
am I walking as Christ walked?

767
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,980
Well, how did he walk?

768
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,340
Well, one way that he walked was courageously.

769
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,100
Then I have to examine my life and say

770
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,300
how many times have I shied away?

771
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,500
Have I had a measure of being timid

772
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,880
as opposed to being bold and not having the courage

773
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,800
because I was afraid of what maybe somebody would think

774
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,160
or somebody would say or what they would think of me?

775
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,080
No, no, no, we need to have courage

776
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,400
because can I tell you this evening

777
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,640
it matters a whole lot more what God thinks of me

778
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,760
than what any man thinks of me,

779
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,700
and the same is true of you.

780
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,200
Oh, that God would give us some courage tonight,

781
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,600
courage to stand for truth and for right,

782
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,240
courage to proclaim the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

783
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,080
Let's pray together.

784
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,900
Father, we love you.

785
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,860
We thank you for loving us.

786
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,500
Thank you for your word, the truth contained therein.

787
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,220
I pray, Lord, that you bless our time of prayer.

788
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,180
We thank you for the privilege.

789
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,380
Pray that you'd be honored and glorified

790
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,020
for it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
