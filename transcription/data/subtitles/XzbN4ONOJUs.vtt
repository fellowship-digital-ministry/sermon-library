00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
First Timothy chapter two.

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.240
I want you to hold your spot there

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.559
and turn over to Acts chapter number 20.

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:08.020
In fact, we'll begin in Acts chapter number 20,

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.319
but we will be preaching through

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:13.199
First Timothy two verses nine through 15 this morning.

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.319
But by way of introduction,

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:17.200
we'll reference part of the charge

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.200
that Paul issues in Acts chapter number 20

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.459
to the leaders of the church at Ephesus.

00:00:23.459 --> 00:00:25.200
It is necessary as we're studying

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.360
through the book of First Timothy,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.239
eventually we'll get through Second Timothy as well,

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.500
Lord willing, in this calendar year,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.900
our theme is continue and how we must continue.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.040
We see that thought interwoven in First and Second Timothy.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.680
We find that it is necessary

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.599
as we study these two books of the Bible

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:45.779
that we understand where Timothy is ministering,

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:47.919
not only where, but why.

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:50.560
Why is it that God had Timothy in Ephesus?

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.560
He's there in Ephesus.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.720
We see that in First Timothy chapter number one.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.720
And we find that Timothy was given a specific task,

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:02.720
a responsibility while he was ministering there in Ephesus.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.919
We find that he was to set some things in order.

00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:08.120
We find that as you look at the book of Titus,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.319
you would find of Titus with regard to being in Crete,

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:13.919
he too was given specific responsibility

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:16.400
with regard to similar things

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.239
that Timothy is doing there in Ephesus.

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:22.160
We find as we've studied the first chapter

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.639
that he was to confront the false teaching.

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:27.839
There were false teachers that had crept in

00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:30.120
and he was to confront that false teaching

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.519
and he was to teach sound doctrine.

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:35.379
And on Wednesday evening

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:37.319
from the book of First Thessalonians chapter five

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:41.080
verses 20 and 21, I preached on Wednesday evening,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.160
taught from that passage of scripture of sound in the faith

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.760
and how we need to be sound in the faith.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.639
And we find that as Timothy would receive this letter,

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:53.239
First Timothy, the letter that we're studying

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:54.879
through here on Sunday mornings,

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:56.959
that as he would receive that letter,

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:59.559
that it would be a reminder to Timothy

00:01:59.559 --> 00:02:03.959
of his responsibility, the reason that he was there.

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:04.900
You know, there are some times

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.680
that we can get busy in the work

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.199
and we can kind of lose sight of really why we're there

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:15.600
and what God's purpose is for us in that place.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.440
And we find that this letter, First Timothy,

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.080
would serve as a reminder to Timothy

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.440
with regard to his responsibility.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.160
Not only would it serve as a reminder,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.399
but I believe it would serve as an encouragement.

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:34.839
Paul is encouraging Timothy to continue.

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:37.479
Though there might be some opposition

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:38.320
that you're dealing with,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.940
though there might be some pushback

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.580
with regard to what you're dealing with,

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.580
you need to continue and finish the race, finish the course.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.279
And we find that this letter would provide both a reminder

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:53.800
but also encouragement.

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:55.759
As we enter into the second and third chapter

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.119
of the book of First Timothy,

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:59.800
we find that God begins to address

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.880
the subject of behavior in his church.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.199
And we find that we've already looked

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:08.000
at the first eight verses in chapter number two,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.880
and we acknowledge that there in chapter number two,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.460
the emphasis is placed in the beginning

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.639
of that portion of scripture on prayer.

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.839
And we spent several weeks

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:18.679
dealing on the subject matter of prayer

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:20.360
and the importance, remember,

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.800
Jesus said, my house should be a house of prayer.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.360
And we find prayer is so important.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.559
It's a privilege that we have as the children of God

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:32.399
that we can go boldly under the throne of grace,

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:35.399
that we have the promises that he hears us

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:37.960
and he answers us and that he's able to do,

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.800
exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.839
What a wonderful God we serve,

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:45.020
that he would listen to us,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.240
that we could enter into his presence at any time

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.639
for as long as we want,

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:50.539
and we can worship him through prayer,

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.240
we can bring our petitions to him in prayer,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.800
and what a joy it is to be in his presence.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.679
We must acknowledge that as we look at

00:03:57.679 --> 00:04:01.399
the second and third chapter of the book of 1 Timothy,

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:05.839
that this is God giving instruction

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:08.720
with regard to behavior in his church.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.320
So we must understand, number one, that it's God's church.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.800
Amen, it's not my church, it's not your church.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.559
I know sometimes we use that phraseology

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:21.000
of my church or our church, and I understand that,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.299
but ultimately, we must acknowledge this morning

00:04:24.299 --> 00:04:27.880
that it's God's church, and we understand this morning

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.040
that if it's God's church and he's established it,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.880
then he also, through his word, has given the instruction

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.880
on how people, his people, are to behave in his church.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.200
Amen, and that's important for us to understand.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.279
We find that though Timothy is receiving this letter

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:50.880
from Paul, we understand that all scripture

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.820
is given by inspiration of God, and it's profitable for us.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.579
We understand that the Bible is authoritative.

00:04:58.579 --> 00:05:02.160
It is profitable, and as we look at the second

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.820
and third chapter over the next couple of weeks,

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.420
we're gonna deal with this subject,

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.859
behavior in God's church, behavior in God's church.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.079
Today is part one.

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:11.820
Next week, well, we got a missionary next week,

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.679
so it'll be part two the following week,

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:18.679
but we look at this subject, and because it is his church,

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:22.459
understand this morning that because it is his church,

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:27.459
he has the authority and the right to dictate,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.380
I choose that word on purpose,

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.380
to dictate how we are to behave in his church, amen?

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.420
It's his church.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.019
We're his people.

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:45.700
He has the right to dictate behavior

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.839
that is appropriate and acceptable

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:52.540
versus behavior that is unacceptable and inappropriate,

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.739
amen, and it's his church,

00:05:54.739 --> 00:05:57.739
and so we should rejoice in that this morning.

00:05:57.739 --> 00:05:59.459
I have you in Acts chapter number 20.

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:01.019
I want you to notice just a few verses

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:03.320
before we jump over to the book of 1 Timothy.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.619
Notice in Acts chapter 20 and verse 28,

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:06.500
the Bible says this,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.579
take heed therefore unto yourselves

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:13.380
and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.380
hath made you overseers,

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.380
so he's speaking to the leaders of the church at Ephesus,

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.619
to feed the church of God.

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:23.019
Notice this phrase,

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:28.019
which he hath purchased with his own blood, amen?

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.700
Redeemed, we were singing this morning,

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.100
saved by the blood of the crucified one,

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.500
and the church is his church.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.880
It's not our church, it's his church.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.140
Notice in verse 29, as Paul gives this charge

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.059
to the elders, the leaders of the church,

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:47.459
he says, for I know this,

00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:51.019
that after my departing shall grievous wolves

00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:54.739
enter in among you, not sparing the flock.

00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:57.220
Verse number 30 of Acts 20,

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.100
also of your own selves shall men arise,

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:06.100
speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:12.019
So God in his wisdom and in his omniscience

00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:13.899
and the fact that he's eternal,

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:17.380
he knew what would happen in Ephesus.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.820
So therefore he used the apostle Paul

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.540
to give this charge to the leaders

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.899
in Acts chapter number 20 of the church at Ephesus,

00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:27.339
but then in God's infinite wisdom,

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:30.700
he had Timothy stay there in Ephesus

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.220
to be able to teach and to instruct

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.459
and to help this church walk worthy

00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:38.899
and please God, this church at Ephesus.

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:43.579
You know, the church at Ephesus is addressed in the book

00:07:43.579 --> 00:07:45.500
of Revelation, and they're charged

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.079
with the fact that they left their first love.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.059
That's a serious charge.

00:07:51.059 --> 00:07:53.100
And we find that Timothy is there

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.260
and Timothy is giving this instruction.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.500
And first, Timothy, I have you in chapter two,

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.059
but I want you to look very quickly at chapter three,

00:08:01.059 --> 00:08:04.980
really the latter statements with regard to this section

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.940
of chapter two and three on behavior in God's church.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.179
And I want you to see what Paul says

00:08:10.179 --> 00:08:13.859
beginning in verse number 14 of chapter three.

00:08:13.859 --> 00:08:15.579
In first Timothy three in verse number 14,

00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:17.019
notice what it says.

00:08:17.019 --> 00:08:21.540
These things write I unto thee.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.579
Okay, so what things?

00:08:22.579 --> 00:08:24.260
Well, the things that are contained in this letter,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.100
in this book.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.619
So Paul's saying here, I'm writing these things

00:08:27.619 --> 00:08:30.500
and then notice, hoping to come unto thee shortly.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.280
Now, he didn't know when he was gonna be able to come.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.900
We find in chapter number four,

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.419
the memory verse for the month of April.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:38.679
He says, till I come, give attendance.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.900
And he's speaking about his desire to come,

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.020
give attendance to what?

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.340
Well, to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.020
Now we understand also that one day Jesus is gonna come

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.099
and what a blessed truth that is.

00:08:50.099 --> 00:08:51.599
The head of the church, he's gonna come.

00:08:51.599 --> 00:08:53.580
The chief shepherd, he's gonna come

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.299
and he's gonna take us back to be with him.

00:08:56.299 --> 00:08:58.979
What a joyous truth that is.

00:08:58.979 --> 00:09:02.940
By the way, I wanna live for him until that trumpet sounds.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.500
That was what was said in that song that Julianna sang.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.599
And I hope that that is your joy, your desire this morning.

00:09:08.599 --> 00:09:12.840
But notice in verse 15, he says, but if I tarry long,

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.840
that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.539
in the house of God.

00:09:22.539 --> 00:09:26.500
Notice, which is the church of the living God,

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.659
the pillar and ground of the truth.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.979
So here in these chapters, Paul is giving Timothy

00:09:36.979 --> 00:09:41.539
instruction with regard to behavior in God's church.

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:43.059
As I mentioned, the second chapter begins

00:09:43.059 --> 00:09:45.280
with an emphasis on prayer.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.979
When we come to the end of the chapter of chapter number two

00:09:47.979 --> 00:09:49.940
and we find most of chapter number three,

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.859
the first 13 verses of chapter number three,

00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:57.859
deal with, address the matter of roles and structure

00:09:58.419 --> 00:10:00.260
within God's church.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:05.040
Now, understand this morning that the passage that is before us at the end of chapter number

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.840
two addresses specifically women in the church.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.560
Now, don't get mad to start out right now, because this is God's Word, amen?

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.840
And we have to understand what God says.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:23.600
And we find that as God is going to address the subject matter, that God gives great clarity

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:33.900
with regard to the roles and responsibilities, the structure, again, within His church.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.320
It's His church.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:45.280
And He has the right to demand of us that we behave in alignment to His Word.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:51.880
By the way, if we want to have God's blessing upon our ministry, we better do God's work

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.440
God's way, amen?

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:59.120
You say, well, there's some churches that are real big that don't follow God's Word.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:04.440
Numbers doesn't mean everything, amen?

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:11.000
There's some lousy athletic teams that get people to show up to pay big bucks to watch

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.120
them fumble and flounder around, and they have 60,000 people that pay to go.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.560
Crowds don't mean everything, okay?

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.540
So as we look at the text of Scripture this morning, notice in verse number 9, the Bible

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:30.480
says in like manner also, 1 Timothy 2, beginning in verse number 9, in like manner also that

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:37.140
women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety, not with braided

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:42.840
hair or gold or pearls or costly array, but which becometh women professing godliness

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.480
with good works.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:50.560
Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection, but I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.040
usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:59.560
For Adam was first formed, then Eve, and Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.160
was in the transgression.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:07.960
Notwithstanding, she shall be saved and childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.640
holiness with sobriety.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:16.760
Let me say today that as we look at this passage of Scripture, and again, specifically the

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.600
passage we'll deal with address women in the church.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:25.480
Understand with me that in the beginning, God said that He created male and female.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:30.400
This nonsense that's going on in our world today with gender confusion and gender dysphoria,

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.560
whatever else you want to call it, is a bunch of nonsense, and God said that He made in

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.520
the beginning male and female, amen?

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.680
And by the way, they're made in the image of God, amen?

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.160
But God has established structure.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.440
Someone said this to me this week with regard to a ministry opportunity that we were going

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.480
to partner together with and try to do, and here's what he said to me as a pastor of another

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.240
church and he wants to come alongside and help us with something, and he said, listen,

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:07.400
we're going to put ourselves under your authority because anything with two heads is a monster.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.440
Those were his words to me.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:15.000
And he said, we are going to put our church and our folks that will help with this ministry

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.200
under your authority.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.440
God has given authority.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:26.480
Here in this passage of Scripture, we find that God addresses the roles of women within

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:31.160
the church, and we find that as we look at this passage of Scripture, just two thoughts

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.720
this morning, as we look at this, number one, if you're taking notes, there's instruction

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:43.400
with respect to attire, to attire, and we find that God in verse 9 and 10 gives this

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.400
instruction.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:50.080
Now, we find that there's an obvious emphasis in this text of Scripture on that which is

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.320
modest and that which is appropriate.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:59.200
You find that the Bible says in like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:04.800
apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:11.200
costly array, but which becometh women professing godliness with good works.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:16.360
As we look at those two verses of Scripture, we would really understand that as you again

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:22.279
recognize where Timothy is ministering and what's going on in Ephesus, there was a tendency,

00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:29.240
if you read some historical data, there's a tendency within some, within this region,

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:35.279
to be real worried about their attire, almost like a fashion show type of thing.

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:40.480
Listen, when you go to church, you're not going to a fashion show, amen?

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.080
It's to be modest and it's to be appropriate.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.440
We find that as we look at these verses of Scripture, as God is giving instruction with

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:52.180
respect to attire, that God is giving us this instruction.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:58.279
This is not simply Paul providing the instruction, it's God speaking through Paul, using Paul

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.240
as his human penman to give the instruction.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:06.240
We find that the Bible, really as you study the whole of Scripture, you'll find that there

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:11.700
are many references with regard to attire and that which is appropriate.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.480
We understand this morning that there are different people that would have different

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.339
opinions with regard to what is modest or what is appropriate.

00:15:19.339 --> 00:15:23.119
So here's what I'm thankful for, God didn't leave it for my opinion or your opinion, He

00:15:23.119 --> 00:15:26.559
gave us truth in His Word, amen?

00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:29.839
And we need to take that truth and we need to understand that we apply it.

00:15:29.839 --> 00:15:33.839
I would say this by way of application of a number of verses that we don't have time

00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:39.760
to go to all of them this morning, but we would say this, it should not be too short,

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.020
it should not be too low, and it should not be too tight.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:49.200
Now let me say this, God is addressing women in this particular text of Scripture.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:54.360
But understand today that as we enter into this 2024 and all the things are going on,

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.520
some of those same things need to be said to men.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.800
There's some men that wear some clothes that are too tight, amen?

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.800
And they ought not.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.080
I don't know how many of you tried to buy a suit recently, but they got all this modern

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:12.320
fit suit stuff, I don't fit in what they have, amen?

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:17.400
And the reality is that modesty and appropriateness is important, why?

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.320
Because it's God's house.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:23.779
We're coming not for a fashion show, but we're coming to worship our God.

00:16:23.779 --> 00:16:25.540
And we're coming to worship Him.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:30.640
The text here, as we look at this and we see what's going on, and we find that modesty

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:35.260
and appropriateness has been an issue, not just in 2024, but it's been an issue throughout

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.900
the entire church age, and therefore God gives the instruction.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.580
Let me say this also, we're not going to, again, you can jot down the verses, but if

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:48.960
you were to go back to Proverbs chapter 7, and verse number 10 specifically, the Bible

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.220
speaks about the attire of an harlot, okay?

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:56.619
Now you say, man, pastor, that's strong language, that's the Bible, it's the words that are

00:16:56.619 --> 00:17:00.779
used in Proverbs 7 and verse number 10, and why do I bring that up this morning?

00:17:00.779 --> 00:17:11.300
Well, because there was attire that was communicating something to those that were in that society.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.339
What was the attire communicating?

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:15.700
That they were an harlot.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:21.779
That's why the attire is referred to as the attire of an harlot, okay?

00:17:21.779 --> 00:17:27.980
Now I would argue this morning that in our 2024, as we look at what's taking place in

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:32.660
our world today, that probably what God is referring to in Proverbs 7 and verse number

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:38.660
10 was actually a whole lot modest, more modest than a lot of things that are available today.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:43.779
I understand the difficulties, I have a wife and two daughters, I understand the difficulties,

00:17:43.779 --> 00:17:49.339
but we must acknowledge this morning the fact that God has given us instruction.

00:17:49.339 --> 00:17:56.380
I want to remind you that in Genesis chapter 38 and verses 14 and 15, what Tamar did was

00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:02.779
changed her garments and her appearance, and you can read of what takes place with Judah

00:18:02.779 --> 00:18:07.540
and Tamar, and Judah says, can I come in unto thee?

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:08.540
Why?

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:16.260
Because her attire was changed, her appearance was changed, she led on that she was available

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.740
in that fashion.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:24.660
So we find this morning that God is giving us this instruction, and it's good instruction,

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.140
it's profitable instruction.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:32.440
Now we find if you take over 1 Peter chapter 3, look over there, as we look at a sister

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:39.340
passage of Scripture in 1 Peter chapter number 3, that deals with this same subject matter,

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:48.340
and we find that here in 1 Peter chapter number 3 and verses 3 and 4, the Bible says this,

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:54.820
whose adorning, let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair and of wearing

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:59.580
of gold or of putting on of apparel, but let it be the hidden man of the heart, and that

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:04.140
which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.140
sight of God of great price.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.140
Now why do I come to 1 Peter chapter 3?

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:12.500
Well the same reason so many people look at 1 Samuel chapter 16, and I'll just reference

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.020
that passage of Scripture, we won't turn there.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:20.140
In 1 Samuel chapter number 16, God gives Samuel the responsibility of anointing the

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.140
next king of Israel.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:26.900
We know, if you know the Bible this morning, that that is David who will be the next king,

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:31.900
but David, when all the sons of Jesse are gathered together, he's left out in the field

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.419
taking care of the sheep.

00:19:33.419 --> 00:19:41.619
And so Eliab stands before Samuel first, and he sees this young man, and he says, surely

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.780
this is the Lord's anointed.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:51.780
And God says, look not at the outward appearance.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:59.700
Man, all we can see is the outward, but God looks on the heart.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:05.940
I reference 1 Samuel 16 and look at 1 Peter chapter 3 because I've heard so many times

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:11.380
over the years, when you talk about the subject that is before us in 1 Timothy chapter 2,

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:17.260
verses 9 and 10, as God gives instruction with respect to attire, with regard to that

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:21.520
which is modest and that which is appropriate, is it doesn't matter what's on the outside

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.060
because God looks at the heart.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:28.980
Can I tell you this morning that you have misapplied the truth of God's Word?

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:36.620
Because when God says that He sees the heart, He also says man can only see the outward.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.760
Let me say it this way this morning.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:43.220
If our inward is right, it's shown up on the outward.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.220
Amen?

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:49.160
Now, I understand that you can clean something up and it can be corrupt inside.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.880
The whited sepulchers, right?

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:51.880
You read that?

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.160
They're full of dead man's bones but they look real good on the outside.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.480
So we understand that principle.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:01.100
What I'm saying to you this morning is that if our heart is right, if we desire to please

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:05.940
God and to walk worthy, then we look at a subject like this and we say, hey listen,

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.840
I want to be modest and I want to be appropriate.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.840
Male or female.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.760
We ought to be modest and we ought to be appropriate.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.760
Amen?

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:19.060
I would say this, as we look at this text of scripture, and I say this to myself and

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:25.160
I say this to others as well, that I believe this morning that it's important, it's imperative

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:33.000
that husbands and fathers take an active role in guiding their wives and their daughters

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.380
with respect to what is modest and appropriate.

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:37.380
Why do I say that?

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.560
Because you're a man and you know.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.840
Do I have to go further than that or can we understand this morning?

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:49.280
You're a man and you know, and so you can know if what your wife or daughter is wearing

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.960
is modest and appropriate.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:59.280
And you, God has placed in that position to help and what a blessing it is.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.760
The church is not a fashion place.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.720
It's not a place to come for a fashion, no, it's good to look nice and put on your best

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.720
and all those things.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:11.120
I'm not suggesting that that's not something that we should do, but the reality is that

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:16.520
we see that God gives instruction and this instruction is important for us.

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:22.580
If we look at verses 11 through 15, number two this morning, instruction with regard

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.920
to authority.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:29.680
We see in verses 9 and 10 instruction with regard to attire.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.400
We see in verses 11 through 15 instruction with regard to authority.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:38.440
Now remember again that God established the church and He instructs the church.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:46.600
So God gives this in 1 Timothy 2 verses 10 through, 11 through 15, He gives us instruction

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.640
with regard to authority.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.000
This instruction will continue into chapter number three.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.460
Remember the chapter divisions and verse divisions were put into the Bible to help us with ease

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:02.400
of finding portions of Scripture, but the thought at the, in chapter two and three is

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:07.200
a singular thought with regard to behavior in God's church.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.840
Sorry, somebody wore a lot of cologne today, Dean, he's not in here right now, and that

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.720
stuff is killing me with my allergies, amen?

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:18.160
I'm going to tell him, listen, you've got to get rid of, get something different, amen?

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.280
And, but my allergies, I don't, I stopped wearing cologne because it messes me all up

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.640
in the springtime.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:29.400
But anyhow, we find that it's the book of Ephesians in the fifth chapter specifically,

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:35.760
the book of Colossians in the third chapter specifically, where God addresses authority

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.760
in the home.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:43.880
Here in 1 Timothy chapter number two and three, God is dealing with authority in His church.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:51.520
By the way, let me say this, God is the one who established the home, amen?

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.760
God is the one who established government.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.600
God is the one that established the church.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:04.160
Those are the three entities, if you will, that God established that are still in operation

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.160
today.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:14.800
And in God's word, He's provided instruction with regard to each institute that He started.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:21.000
So not only did He, did He begin the home, but He instructed, He instituted the home

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.840
and He instructed the home.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.920
He instituted the church and He instructed the church.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.680
He instituted government and He gives instruction.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.200
You say, well, they're not following it.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:35.720
Listen, there are churches and there are homes and there are governments that are in

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:42.600
direct rebellion to the one who established those entities, amen?

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.800
There are homes all across our nation.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.559
This message this morning is not on the home.

00:24:48.559 --> 00:24:50.160
This subject is dealing with the church.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:57.360
But there are homes all across this nation that are messed up because they're not following

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:02.600
the instruction that God has given in His word.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.880
Just the way it is.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:09.800
There are churches that are messed up because they're not following the instruction that

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.040
God gives in His word.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.680
We ought not get mad at the instruction manual.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:20.400
We ought to be thankful to the God who gave us the instructions and understanding that

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:24.279
He's provided us the path by which we can please Him.

00:25:24.279 --> 00:25:27.200
You ever buy a device?

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.600
Any of you, you drove here this morning and there are certain things that the manufacturer

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.320
of the automobile that you drove here in have put in order that you have to do in order

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.360
to drive that vehicle.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.320
Now it used to be that you always needed a key to start the vehicle.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.400
Now they have these push button things and you don't have to put the key in the ignition

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:48.600
but you still got to have a key in the vehicle, right?

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:53.520
And you have to do some things and you have to follow, well, I don't want to put the key

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.520
in there.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.520
I'm just going to sit there.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:04.000
You can get mad at Ford and whoever else, whatever vehicle you drive, you can get upset

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
with them.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.920
Why do I have to press the brake to get out of park?

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.279
I'm not going to do it.

00:26:09.279 --> 00:26:11.600
Well, you ain't going anywhere, right?

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.880
I mean, is that the case?

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:19.000
You have different appliances that you have at home and different processes that you need

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.600
to follow in order to make that thing work.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:26.920
Typically, people don't get mad and say, I'm not going to do it.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.920
No, they just follow the instructions.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:32.720
Now, some of us men put the instructions to the side and think we can figure it out without

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.880
the instruction manual.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.920
And then after we get all kinds of sideways trying to do something, we say, you know,

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.040
maybe I should look at the instructions.

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.440
We go over and grab them and then we can get the thing working.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:49.120
But as we look at the instructions, we understand that God is the eternal, all-wise God and

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.279
He's provided instruction for His church.

00:26:51.279 --> 00:26:56.040
So look at the authority or the instruction that's given with regard to authority here

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.660
in this passage of Scripture.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:02.820
We find the Bible says in verse number 11 and 12, let the woman learn in silence with

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:08.240
all subjection, but I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man,

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.680
but to be in silence.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:17.920
So we find here in verses 11 and 12 that women are not to teach or have authority over men

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.320
in God's church.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.640
Now let me say this this morning.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:27.000
This is not popular today, but it's biblical.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.880
It's biblical, amen?

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:35.840
There are churches all across our land that have women pastors.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:41.160
And there are people today that are saying, hey, it's 2024, can't we get with the times?

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.960
Why can't we have a lady be the pastor?

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:51.000
Well, because the eternal God, who is the creator of all things, established in His

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.160
word structure and authority.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:28:00.520
He did not say that the woman was not of equal value to the man.

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:07.059
He did not say that, no, He just said in the church, the woman is not to have that authority

00:28:07.059 --> 00:28:08.059
over a man.

00:28:08.059 --> 00:28:11.440
And we're going to look at a couple of verses of Scripture in a little while where what

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:15.720
is the role and what is the ministry of women in the church?

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:20.240
Because there is a place, there is an opportunity of ministry, and we're thankful for that.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:25.160
But the Bible says, then I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man,

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.279
but to be in silence.

00:28:27.279 --> 00:28:31.640
Now we understand this morning, I've mentioned already, you no doubt have seen it, we're

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:37.940
not a Southern Baptist church, but recently the Southern Baptists have had a real issue

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:40.040
with this subject matter.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:45.020
There are plenty of other denominations that have been dealing with it for decades, really,

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:49.140
but we find that most recently with the Southern Baptists, and I have people occasionally,

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.840
they find out we're a Baptist church, are you part of the Southern Baptist Convention?

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.239
We're not, we're independent Baptists.

00:28:54.239 --> 00:29:00.760
However, there was a huge issue at this last big conference that they had, why?

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:06.400
Because there are Southern Baptist churches that want to ordain women to be pastors.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:11.040
The Southern Baptists took a position on it, but there's this push.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:16.799
Listen, I said it on Wednesday evening, and I hope that we can understand it this morning,

00:29:16.799 --> 00:29:24.880
it does not matter how much the culture pushes, we have to be biblical.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.119
We have to be biblical.

00:29:26.119 --> 00:29:30.600
Listen, this morning as we understand the situation in Ephesus, and we understand what's

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:37.359
taking place, and even as we understand today that God has given us His eternal word, and

00:29:37.359 --> 00:29:42.799
He's outside of time, and His word is relevant to every generation, and His instruction is

00:29:42.799 --> 00:29:49.640
important for us to follow, that God said that the women are not to have authority over

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:53.280
the man.

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:58.720
If God wanted in a particular year for that to change, then God, who is eternal, could

00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.840
have told us...

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:06.240
us at this time in church history, then these changes are going to be made.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.200
But God didn't say that.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.040
So God gave us the instruction.

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:14.040
God provided us with this instruction.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:17.560
It's important that we understand it and that we apply it.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:25.000
We find that in Ephesus, just as it's in our day today, the church has always been called

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:33.960
to influence the society, not for the society to influence the church.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.800
You know what one of the big problems was in Corinth?

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.120
There are lots of them.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:44.900
But one of the main problems in Corinth was that the city, the culture, the society was

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:48.760
impacting and influencing the church.

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:55.320
And God said, no, the church is supposed to influence the culture.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:03.480
But what happens today, because a message like this is not very popular, is that you

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:12.040
have culture pushing and you have people folding, saying, well, we'll just kind of, you know,

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:18.560
we just want to be, want to fit in, and we want to be, listen, I want to please God.

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.100
Amen?

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:23.200
As an individual, as a church, I want to please God.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.460
That ought to be your goal as well.

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:31.040
We find that God, here in this passage of Scripture, goes all the way back to creation

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:37.720
with regard to providing an answer, if you will, or reason behind the instruction that

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.600
He gives to us in verses 11 and 12.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.440
By the way, I think that's gracious of God.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.280
God doesn't have to explain to us why He set any rules in place.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.440
Amen?

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.280
He's God.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.880
It's His right.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:56.240
But He goes back to creation, notice in verses 13 and 14, the example that He uses.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:00.320
He says this, for Adam was first formed, then Eve.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.440
So He goes back to the order of creation.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.680
When God created man initially, He created Adam.

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.160
But then He found there's no help for him.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.000
Now God knew that, and then He creates Eve, right?

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.520
That's the order of creation.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.240
We can go back and look at that in the book of Genesis.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:21.240
We find that in Genesis chapter number 3, now we see in verse number 13, He goes all

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.200
the way back to the beginning in Genesis 1 with creation.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:30.020
We come to verse 14, and He goes to Genesis chapter number 3 with the fall of man.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:42.780
Notice what He says, and Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:46.580
It's very interesting as you look at verse number 14 in 1 Timothy chapter number 2, because

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:50.860
as you look at the whole of Scripture, you look at various aspects of the New Testament

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:55.920
referring back to the fall of man in the garden in Genesis chapter number 3, Adam is always

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.740
the responsible party.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:02.020
Never is Eve the responsible party.

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:04.260
Always Adam.

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.360
As in Adam, all die.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:11.780
As for by one man, sin entered into the world, Romans chapter 5 and verse number 12.

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:12.780
Adam's always responsible.

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:19.860
Let me say this, before God created Eve, God gave Adam the instruction with regard to what

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:23.060
could be eaten and what could not be eaten.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:26.100
God didn't deliver that to Eve, He delivered it to Adam.

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:29.880
Adam, however, had a responsibility to communicate that to Eve.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:33.140
Why is it that the serpent, the most subtle beast of the field, why is it that he comes

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:36.420
to Eve in Genesis chapter number 3?

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:41.620
Well, we understand as we look at Genesis chapter number 3 that he comes to Eve and

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.220
he begins to deceive her.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:49.300
Yea, hath God said, no, it's not going to be that way.

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.500
God knows that in the day that you eat thereof, your eyes are going to be open, you're going

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:59.380
to be like God's and He deals with an emotional approach and He deals with, look, it's good

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:06.060
for you and He shows that fruit and she is deceived and she eats of that fruit.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:08.860
Adam, no deception whatsoever.

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:15.020
He knew, but he did.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:21.660
We find that as man is held accountable, we find that to be the case with Adam and God

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:28.420
references back to Genesis 1 and Genesis 3 with regard to providing us with some really

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:35.700
background reason, if you will, for why He's providing this instruction for His church

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:42.700
with regard to structure and authority and we find that He says, Adam was formed first,

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:44.940
then Eve.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:48.740
Eve was deceived, Adam was not.

00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:55.020
Adam knew right well what he was doing and he took of the fruit and sin entered in the

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:56.020
world.

00:34:56.020 --> 00:35:00.700
You know, it's very interesting, God, again, this passage of Scripture is dealing with

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:06.500
instruction, behavior in His church and specifically this section is dealing with authority in

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:11.860
the church, not in the home, but we find that God, as you look at the Scriptures, the New

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.020
Testament as we're dealing with the church, there's no church in the Old Testament.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:19.180
You find the nation of Israel, you can find there are several ladies, women that God used

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.740
in a great way.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:25.540
In the church, you find there are many ladies and women that God used in a great way, but

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:31.580
when it comes to a matter of authority, God says that the man, notice in chapter 3, this

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:37.300
is a true saying, if a man desire the office of a bishop, and so we're going to find in

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:42.100
chapter 3, He continues with this idea of behavior in the church, in His church, and

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:48.980
He deals with the pastor and the deacon, the two offices, to be a man, because it's

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:53.220
a matter of instruction with regard to authority.

00:35:53.220 --> 00:36:00.700
God has given to us that responsibility and God has provided for us the examples in His

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:01.700
Word.

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:04.380
We find this morning that Adam is the one that's held accountable.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.380
It's very interesting also, if you were to go to Genesis 18, we're not going to go there

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:13.620
this morning, but in Genesis 18, dealing with Sarah and Abraham, you'll find that

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:14.620
Sarah laughed.

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:15.620
Do you remember this?

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:16.940
When God says she's going to have a baby, right?

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.340
And she laughed.

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:19.540
You know what's very interesting?

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:21.980
God never asked Sarah why she laughed.

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:24.980
You know who He asked?

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.740
Abraham.

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.020
You know why He asked Abraham?

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:32.300
Because God told Abraham, you're going to have a son.

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:39.180
And Abraham had the responsibility to communicate God's truth to his wife, Sarah.

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.180
Amen?

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:44.580
And when she laughed, God didn't ask her why she laughed.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.580
He asked.

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:51.900
So, you know, authority is one of those things that so many people want it, but they don't

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:56.700
understand the responsibility that comes with authority.

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.980
The responsibility comes with authority.

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:05.820
During the COVID years, I had several people that attacked my leadership through COVID.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.020
They thought they knew better.

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.840
They thought we should this, we should that.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.340
And on more than one occasion, I said, hey, if you want to be the pastor, you can.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:13.220
I'll resign right now.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.220
You know why?

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.420
It wasn't easy.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:21.300
Every decision I made, half of the people liked it and half of the people didn't.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.740
Just the way it is.

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:23.740
With authority comes responsibility.

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.580
You know what I told people time after time, Bart?

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:26.580
I said, you know what?

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:27.580
I'm not trying to please you.

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:28.580
I'm trying to please God.

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.740
You know the greatest thing you could do for you, or do for me, is pray for me that God

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.740
will give me wisdom.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:35.540
It was a difficult time.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:41.100
See, people want authority, but you understand there's responsibility with authority.

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:43.100
And God holds Adam responsible.

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.020
God holds Abraham responsible.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:50.440
He's given to His church this instruction with regard to authority.

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.000
And it's vital that we don't worry about what the culture is doing.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.660
We don't worry about what other denomination is doing.

00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:03.580
We say, no, God gave us an instruction manual, and we're going to follow what God gave us.

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:08.780
Notice in verse 15, notwithstanding, she shall be saved and childbearing if they continue

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.020
in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:14.740
Now, many people say verse 15 is one of the hardest verses in all the New Testament to

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.420
be able to interpret and explain.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:17.420
It is greatly challenging.

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.680
And I'm going to give you my understanding of the verse.

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.820
If you think something different, man, I'll talk to you about it.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:24.120
I'm going to give you my understanding.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:28.520
It's not talking about being saved and childbearing, that you won't die when you give birth.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:29.640
Why do we know that?

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:34.200
Because many of godly women have died giving birth.

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:39.480
So it can't mean that a woman would be saved, they would be able to give birth and not die,

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:43.300
because many have, okay?

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:48.440
Some have the idea that maybe it's dealing with that the Savior would come through a

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.360
woman, the virgin birth.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.960
Certainly that could be part of the situation.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:59.200
But I think really what Paul is dealing with here is understanding what the role of the

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:06.720
women would be in training their children, in bringing up their children.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:11.720
Now we find that God gives the responsibility to the husbands that we find as you look in

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:16.240
Ephesians 5 and 6, Colossians chapter number 3, that were to bring them up in the nurture

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.740
and admonition of the Lord.

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:23.380
But God gives, listen, there's something different in the ability of training children between

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:25.500
a male and a female.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:29.460
I often look at Holly and say, I cannot do what you do.

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:30.740
I can't.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:34.380
She teaches them little kids, works in a nursery, man, I'd be outside of my mind.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.420
I'm just telling you the truth.

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:40.580
When our kids were little, she'd go to a ladies meeting and man, I'd be setting my watch for

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:45.040
when she's getting home, because there's only so many things I can handle, amen?

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.020
I'm not equipped for it.

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:51.100
And I have no problem acknowledging that.

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:57.420
So we find that the woman, the wife, the mother has this opportunity.

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:59.740
We also understand that it cannot mean that…

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.500
that all godly women would have children,

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.220
because we know that there are some that are barren.

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:06.400
We can read of that even in the Scriptures.

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:08.340
Amen?

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.100
So we find that the role,

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:11.960
and here's what I believe this morning,

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.520
that when we understand the instruction

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:14.860
that God has given us,

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:17.460
and we embrace what He's given us,

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:18.840
we can thrive.

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:22.860
But so long as we want to resist,

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:25.020
because we've been influenced by our culture

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:25.980
and our society,

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:28.060
and we want to hold our hands against it,

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:29.940
and we say, don't you know

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:31.660
that we're living in the 21st century,

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:32.700
and don't you know,

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:34.020
listen, you're gonna just,

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.780
you're beating your head against a wall.

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:42.300
If you just say, this is what God's role is for me,

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.380
and I find what my role is,

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.860
and I do what God's called me to do,

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:48.500
I can thrive,

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.660
and collectively we can please God,

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:55.140
because we're doing what God has called us to do.

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:58.300
I've used this terminology recently.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:00.700
Some of you may have heard me say it to you,

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:01.980
but I've used this terminology

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.700
in a number of different contexts,

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.260
and I'll use it here this morning

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:09.100
when we think about these roles and responsibilities

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.300
and authority that God gives in His church,

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.220
and what I would say is this phrase,

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:14.420
stay in your lane.

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.540
Stay in your lane.

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:17.460
What do I mean by that?

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:19.640
Well, when you drive your car,

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:22.540
it's important that you stay in your lane, right?

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:23.580
How many of you have been driving

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:25.520
and somebody tried to get in your lane?

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.620
I say something like this.

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:28.980
Pick one, buddy.

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.740
I mean, you gotta pick one or the other.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:32.540
You can't drive in both.

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.000
Is that right?

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.540
What happens if they drive in both?

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:36.860
Well, there's a problem.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:41.220
Those lines on the roads are important.

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:45.180
They give us what our boundaries are, right?

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:46.700
There's a lot of model of vehicles

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:47.860
here in Northern Virginia that don't,

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:51.060
that did not come equipped with blinkers, right?

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:51.980
Amen?

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.460
They just move and shift and do whatever they wanna do,

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:57.900
but my model came with a blinker,

00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:59.980
and when I wanna shift lanes,

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:01.260
I gotta turn on my blinker, right?

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.020
And I'm giving indication, right?

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:06.980
Well, listen, God's given us roles and responsibilities,

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.420
and when we understand what the God of the universe,

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.220
the one who instituted the church,

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.780
when He gives us what our roles are,

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:18.140
we don't have to stand in rebellion towards God.

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:20.340
We accept what our role is.

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:23.780
We stay in our lane, and we please God.

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:25.780
It's an amazing concept,

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:29.420
but so often, man wants to stand in rebellion to God.

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.980
Listen, even saved people rebel against God.

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:35.540
It happens all the time.

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.140
In Titus, turn over there, and we'll be done.

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.140
Titus chapter number two,

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:43.460
I want you to see a great responsibility

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.620
that God has given to women in the church.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:47.860
We know in verse number 15,

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.420
with regard to child rearing and what have you,

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.300
but I want you to see in Titus chapter two,

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:55.220
again, Titus and Timothy are really similar

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:57.140
with regard to the instruction that's given.

00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:58.940
Titus is in Crete.

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.180
Timothy's in Ephesus,

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:03.460
but God is giving them great responsibility,

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:06.140
very similar in these letters,

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:08.420
but notice in chapter two, in verse number one,

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.740
it says, but speak thou the things

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.020
which become sound doctrine,

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.220
and then notice where he says in verse number two

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:17.300
that the aged men be sober, grave, temperate,

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.700
and sound in faith and charity and patience,

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:21.740
and then notice in verse number three,

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:25.620
the aged women likewise that they be in behavior

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:29.340
as becometh holiness, not false accusers,

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:31.540
not given to much wine, teachers of good things,

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:35.300
and then notice this, that they may teach the young women

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.540
to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:41.340
to be discreet, chaste, keepers at home,

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.380
good, obedient to their own husbands,

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:46.700
that the word of God be not blasphemed,

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:48.660
and then verse six goes to young men,

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:50.900
and so we see in verses three through five,

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:53.980
God gives instruction with regard to the aged women.

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:55.980
Listen, I'm not gonna put a category

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:57.820
on who's an aged women and who's not.

00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.420
You figure that out, amen?

00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:04.020
But the reality is God has given a great opportunity

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:07.180
to the ladies that are mature,

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:09.140
aged is the word that is used,

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:13.080
to have a godly influence on a next generation.

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.900
You know what I believe's happened in our churches?

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:16.820
We've failed.

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:19.940
We have failed.

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.820
We have failed in discipleship, we have failed,

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:25.660
listen, why are more people leaving the church

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:26.980
than are coming to the church?

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:28.100
Because we failed.

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:31.180
They get to a certain age, I'm like, I'm out, I'm done.

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:32.820
You can't make me come anymore.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:38.020
But the aged women have a huge opportunity

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:40.220
to influence the younger women.

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.500
You know how much more effective it is

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:47.620
for you aged women to talk to these younger girls

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:51.280
about modesty and appropriateness than it is for me?

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:57.780
I'm begging you this morning, it's your responsibility.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:03.340
It's a hard thing for a pastor to have to deal with that.

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:06.900
Now I do, I have to, I preach the whole counsel of God,

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:10.060
but the aged women, there's a great opportunity.

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:13.660
But you know what so often happens?

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:16.480
Is I have people that come to me and complain

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.880
about things that are taking place,

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:22.540
but they're not doing what God instructed them to do.

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.020
I'm not mad about any of it this morning,

00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:28.300
but I'm simply saying God's given us

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.300
roles and responsibilities.

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:33.380
And instead of desiring to have somebody else's role

00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:36.220
and responsibility, why don't we embrace the role

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:38.980
and responsibility that God has given to us

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:41.660
and do what God has given us to do

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:43.920
so that he would be glorified.

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:46.100
Behavior in God's church.

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:46.940
Let's pray.

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:47.760
Father, we love you.

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:48.740
We thank you for loving us.

00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.580
Thank you for the word of God.

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:53.140
God, I know this morning this isn't super popular,

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:54.260
but it's biblical.

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:58.540
God, I pray that you deal with each of us as only you can.

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:04.660
God, help us to follow your word, to obey your word.

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:10.540
Lord, help us to be doers of the word.

00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:16.180
I pray that you'd move and work in this moment of invitation.

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.460
If there's one not sure of heaven,

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:18.940
God, I pray they'd be saved today.

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:20.940
We didn't preach on the gospel or salvation.

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:22.780
We sang about it.

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:25.180
God, if there's someone not sure of heaven,

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:26.180
I pray they'd come this morning.

00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.980
We take a Bible and show them how they can know for sure

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:29.220
that heaven's their home.

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:32.420
God, I pray that you'd move and work,

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:33.900
that you'd be glorified through every decision

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:36.300
that's made, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:37.140
We just.
