1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,519
Ezra chapter number 8 this evening, you say, I thought we were studying the life of Elisha.

2
00:00:03,519 --> 00:00:06,039
We were, but we're not tonight.

3
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:11,439
And on May 17th, a couple of Sunday nights ago, we had the opportunity to consider the

4
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:16,479
testimony of Ezra, and I preached on that Sunday evening about Ezra, and really from

5
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:20,559
the seventh chapter of the book of Ezra, and we talked about the fact that Ezra, he was

6
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:28,200
a ready scribe, and as we looked at the truth about his life and we understand the things

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,159
that he did, we mentioned from Ezra 7 and verse number 10 that he prepared his heart

8
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:34,759
to seek the law of the Lord.

9
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:37,919
We understand that he purposed to obey it.

10
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:43,319
It says there, and to do it, and then he planned to influence others.

11
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:49,159
He said, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments, and what a great testimony Ezra

12
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:56,119
has and had, of course, and we had the opportunity, as we studied a couple of Sunday nights ago,

13
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:00,159
the life of Ezra, to look at his testimony, and then we went over to the book of Nehemiah

14
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,559
and had the opportunity to see the ministry of Ezra and how he was preaching the Word

15
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,760
of God, and he was declaring the truths of the Word of God, and helping the people to

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,440
understand that which was written and contained therein, and what a blessing to see the life

17
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,959
of Ezra and his testimony.

18
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:21,720
This evening, we're going to take a few moments to study this portion in Ezra chapter number

19
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:29,000
eight that really is going to provide us with an account of their journey to Jerusalem.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,080
The first 20 verses of Ezra chapter number eight, we're not going to even read them.

21
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,839
Those first 20 verses really provide us with a record of the families who would accompany

22
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:45,239
Ezra to Jerusalem, and we'll look at a few verses of Scripture here in Ezra chapter number

23
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,160
eight, but I want you to look at verse number 31.

24
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,180
I'll give you the title and we'll get into the message this evening.

25
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,860
In Ezra eight, in verse 31, the Bible says this,

26
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:01,980
"'Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go

27
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,620
unto Jerusalem, and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand

28
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:12,419
of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.'"

29
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,339
I want to preach a message this evening that I've simply entitled, I've adopted the title

30
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:22,220
here from verse number 31, the hand of our God was upon us.

31
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,179
The hand of our God was upon us.

32
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:30,059
It's interesting that verse number 31 begins with that word, then.

33
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:35,699
There were some things that took place before you get to the departure that is recorded

34
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:40,300
in verse number 31, because really, in verse 31, we read of the departure from the river

35
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,460
Ahava.

36
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:46,059
We read in verse number 32 of their arrival to the city of Jerusalem, but we begin in

37
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:51,300
verse number 31 by noticing that word, then, and if we go back into the passage of Scripture,

38
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,699
we begin to find some things that Ezra and the children of Israel did before they left

39
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:59,460
and traveled to Jerusalem.

40
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,860
If you're taking notes this evening, I want you to notice, first of all, the danger they

41
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,860
faced.

42
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,139
We understand as we read the Old Testament, or we read portions of Scripture with regard

43
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:15,100
to the times in which Ezra is being written, of course, the captivity, the remnant that

44
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:21,139
would return to the city of Jerusalem, and God had prophesied that through His prophets,

45
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:27,619
and of course, many had been faithful, and the Bible gives us the record here in the

46
00:03:27,619 --> 00:03:32,460
book of Ezra, we read again in Nehemiah as well, of the return of that remnant.

47
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:37,619
What a blessing to see the fulfillment of God's prophecies, and to understand, however,

48
00:03:37,619 --> 00:03:42,580
that there was opposition, there was danger that they would certainly face.

49
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,979
In fact, as we read the passage of Scripture, both in Ezra and in Nehemiah, we understand

50
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:53,139
that the Lord gives us names specifically of those that were the adversaries of the

51
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:57,419
work of God, and those that were opposing the work of God.

52
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:03,820
Throughout the history of the world, we find that God's work has always been opposed.

53
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:09,919
There's always a certain amount of danger that someone would face in serving God.

54
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,679
We find that as you look at the New Testament, you read the life and ministry of the Apostle

55
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:19,720
Paul, and we reference some things about his life on Sunday evening in our message, and

56
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,359
as we consider the life of the Apostle Paul, he was aware of the danger that he faced,

57
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:28,040
and he was aware of those things that he would encounter along the way.

58
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,559
In fact, he gave truth to his followers, and specifically to Timothy.

59
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:38,480
He said, yea, all those that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution, and

60
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,119
he tells them that, and we find here in the passage of Scripture that there was some danger

61
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:44,200
that they faced.

62
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,880
Notice if you will, back up into the text of Scripture, and look at verse number 22.

63
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,519
The Bible says, for I was ashamed to require the king, a band of soldiers, and horsemen

64
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,839
to help.

65
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,920
Notice what he says, us against the enemy in the way.

66
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:05,119
So there was a certain knowledge that Ezra had with regard to the danger that they would

67
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:10,279
encounter as they would make their journey to Jerusalem.

68
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:13,480
He understood the danger that was there.

69
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,679
He mentions about the enemy that was in the way.

70
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:21,959
If you read in verse number 31, as he's giving and rejoicing as to the protection of God,

71
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,600
that he says there, then we departed from the river of Ahavon, the twelfth day of the

72
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,760
first month, to go into Jerusalem.

73
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,040
Notice what it says, and the hand of our God was upon us, notice, and he, God, delivered

74
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,760
us from the hand of the enemy.

75
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,040
So again, we see that the enemy is mentioned in verse 22, again in verse number 31.

76
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:46,480
Then notice how he ends the verse, and of such as lay in wait by the way.

77
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,040
Now if you're like me, you read a verse of Scripture like this, and you, in your sanctified

78
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:57,799
imagination, you can kind of perceive what it was that they would encounter as they would

79
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:59,880
take this journey.

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,679
Traveling in these days was quite different than it is to travel here in the United States

81
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:05,000
of America.

82
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,239
We have the privilege to be able to travel, and we travel freely often throughout the

83
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,959
state, and throughout the states.

84
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,880
Of course, during this pandemic, there have been some limitations to travel and what have

85
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:27,079
you, but we many times do not fully understand some of the dangers that were common to those

86
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:29,440
that would travel in these particular days.

87
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,040
There would be some considerable danger that they would face.

88
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,000
And so as we look at the text of Scripture, we notice, we understand that Ezra was aware

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,640
of the danger that they would face.

90
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,440
But as we look at the passage of Scripture, we don't only notice the danger that they

91
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,679
would face, but we notice their dependence is declared.

92
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:52,600
Notice what Ezra says in verse number 22.

93
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,679
It's interesting to me.

94
00:06:54,679 --> 00:07:02,440
The Bible tells us that he was ashamed to make the request for a military escort.

95
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,079
Notice what he says in verse 22.

96
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:13,239
For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against

97
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:15,320
the enemy in the way.

98
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,880
I almost in my mind's eye begin to think about this dilemma, if you will, that Ezra is facing.

99
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,640
He's understanding the journey that's going to take place.

100
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,040
He understands there's a band of families that are going to travel with him.

101
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:34,500
He knows there's a danger and there is the possibility of speaking to the king and requesting

102
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,559
a military escort.

103
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:44,000
And yet the Bible tells us that Ezra says of himself that he was ashamed to make this

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
request.

105
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:51,079
It's interesting that he acknowledges the fact that he could have made the request,

106
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:53,880
but he says that he was ashamed to make the request.

107
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,540
The question that we ask ourselves, and thankfully it's answered for us in the text of Scripture,

108
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:05,640
we would say, why is it that Ezra was ashamed to request this military escort?

109
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:11,559
Why was it, Ezra, that you were not willing when you see all that took place and you see

110
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:15,920
in the beginning of chapter number 8, it says, these are now the chief of their fathers.

111
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,519
This is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon in the reign of Artaxerxes

112
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,679
the king.

113
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:27,720
But you find that if you were to read in chapter number 7, in verse number 27, the Bible says,

114
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,559
blessed be the Lord God of our fathers, which hath put such a thing as this in the king's

115
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:37,799
heart to beautify the house of the Lord, which is in Jerusalem.

116
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,159
Well, guess what the king, Artaxerxes, had told Ezra.

117
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:45,039
He told him in verse number 20, and whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy

118
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:50,400
God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house.

119
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,119
In verse number 26, the Bible says, and whosoever will not do the law of thy God and the law

120
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:59,880
of the king of judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death or to banishment

121
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,179
or to confiscation of goods or to imprisonment.

122
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:09,599
And that's where Ezra then declares the blessing and seeing how God was working through the

123
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:12,840
heart of the king.

124
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,520
But Ezra says, I'm ashamed to ask for a military escort.

125
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,239
I'm ashamed.

126
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,919
Why, Ezra?

127
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:26,599
Well notice what it says in verse number 22, he was ashamed because of what he had previously

128
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:30,359
declared to the king regarding his God.

129
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:35,719
See, the Bible tells us in verse number 22, notice, for I was ashamed to require the king,

130
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:40,479
a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way, because, here's

131
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:44,400
the reason, we had spoken unto the king.

132
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:52,159
And here's what we said to the king saying, the hand of our God is upon all them for good

133
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:58,640
that seek him, but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.

134
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,960
So Ezra.

135
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,880
And those, he says, he uses the plural,

136
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,760
we had spoken to the king,

137
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,520
but we know that Ezra is part of that.

138
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,680
And what he had previously proclaimed to the king

139
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,800
was that our God is able.

140
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,160
He had previously declared to the king

141
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,840
that we believe that our God,

142
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,280
that the hand of our God is upon all them

143
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,080
for good that seek him.

144
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,520
So Ezra was mindful of what he had previously

145
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,520
proclaimed to the king about his God.

146
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,280
And then he says, therefore, I'm ashamed

147
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,720
to go ask him for a military escort

148
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,240
because I've already told him that my God is able.

149
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,640
I've already told him that my God's hand

150
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,000
is upon them for good that seek him

151
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,040
and that his power and his wrath

152
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,160
is against all them that forsake him.

153
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,880
So Ezra's in this dilemma, if you will,

154
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,480
of I'm not gonna ask for an escort from the king.

155
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,960
We could say it this way today.

156
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,320
We know that we serve the king of kings

157
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,640
and the Lord of lords,

158
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,040
that he is the Lord God omnipotent,

159
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,760
that safety is of the Lord.

160
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,240
We understand as many biblical truths

161
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,280
with regard to the ability and work of our God.

162
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,560
And we'd say, I'm not looking for

163
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,040
what some human can provide for me

164
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,520
because I know what God can provide for me.

165
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,240
And here's the thought.

166
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,280
It was time for Ezra and the children of Israel

167
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,680
to live what they had proclaimed,

168
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,520
to live what they had proclaimed.

169
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,360
See, sometimes it's easy for us to make some proclamations.

170
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,520
There's another thing to live it, amen?

171
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,440
It's easy for us to say, but God said he's gonna do this

172
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,640
and he's gonna do that and he's this and he's that.

173
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,600
He is.

174
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,760
This book is not just a book of theory.

175
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,160
This book is a book of practice.

176
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,200
And we find that everything that God has revealed

177
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,360
to us in this book about himself is true.

178
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,720
And he's dependable, he's trustworthy, he's faithful.

179
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,520
In Ezra, we find that his dependence is declared.

180
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,520
We find that he has this moment of revealing to us

181
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,080
the dilemma, if you will, but notice in verse number 21

182
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,560
and also in verse number 23,

183
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,640
notice what they were depending upon.

184
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,440
They weren't depending upon the king's escort.

185
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,320
They weren't depending upon the military escort,

186
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,440
the band of soldiers and the horsemen

187
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,280
that could be provided from the king.

188
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,520
No, the Bible tells us in verse number 21,

189
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,520
then I proclaimed a fast there at the river of Ahava

190
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,800
that we might afflict ourselves before our God

191
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,800
to seek of him a right way for us and for our little ones

192
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,760
and for all our substance.

193
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,600
Verse 23, so we fasted and besought our God for this

194
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,800
and he was entreated of us.

195
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,560
Isn't that good?

196
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,920
Perhaps there were some within the group that said,

197
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,080
hey Ezra, why don't we just ask the king for an escort?

198
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,720
I understand the Bible doesn't say that.

199
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,520
That's why I said it could be.

200
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,600
I'm not saying dogmatically that they did,

201
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,440
but I'm saying today that when a leader makes a decision,

202
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,480
when somebody is going to trust the Lord

203
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,360
and take that step of faith,

204
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,160
there are times in which somebody says,

205
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,600
well, we could do this or what about relying on this?

206
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,280
But the reality is that Ezra says,

207
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,520
no, it's a shame to do that.

208
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,360
Why?

209
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,560
Because I know what my God is able to do

210
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,120
and I've declared it to the king.

211
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,720
I've told Artaxerxes what God is able to do.

212
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,640
We look here, we find that the Bible says that after,

213
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,520
if you read the first 20 verses

214
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,880
and you see all of the names of those that are mentioned

215
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,120
that are going to accompany Ezra on his journey to Jerusalem,

216
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,440
we find that when they got there to the river of Ahava,

217
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,200
he proclaimed a fast.

218
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,080
What did he do?

219
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,920
Specifically, they were seeking direction from the Lord.

220
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,120
Notice, to seek of Him a right way for us

221
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,200
and for our little ones and for all our substance.

222
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,560
We find that not only were they seeking direction

223
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,400
from the Lord,

224
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,760
but they were seeking protection from the Lord.

225
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,000
Notice, to help us against the enemy in the way.

226
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,920
He said, I was ashamed to ask the king

227
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,520
for a band of soldiers and horsemen

228
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,120
to help us against the enemy in the way.

229
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,960
So what do they do?

230
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,960
They seek the Lord.

231
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,360
It says in verse number 23,

232
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,840
so we fasted and besought our God for this.

233
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,960
And I love the last words of verse 23.

234
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,040
And he was entreated of us.

235
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,280
This evening, we believe that God hears and answers prayer.

236
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,800
I quoted the verse to someone earlier today on the phone.

237
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,240
I've quoted it many times from this pulpit.

238
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,640
Many of you could quote it as well.

239
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,360
The truth of Ephesians 3 in verse number 20.

240
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,120
He is able to do exceeding abundantly

241
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,560
above all that we ask or think.

242
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,000
It's not just a cute cliche

243
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,120
that Christians run around and say, it's Bible truth.

244
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,840
We serve the Lord God omnipotent.

245
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,280
He is able.

246
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
We sing the song.

247
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,840
I preached a message many weeks ago now

248
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,600
from the life of Daniel.

249
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,440
And you read in Daniel chapter six

250
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,360
and you read all that's taking place with the writing

251
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,320
and the fact that they could not make any petitions

252
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,360
of any kings or gods and so on and so forth.

253
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,640
And you find that Daniel's going and he's praying

254
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,720
and he's seeking the Lord.

255
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,920
And of course they come and they accuse him

256
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,160
and he's going to go into the den of lions.

257
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,840
And the Bible tells us that the king Darius,

258
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,200
he says, I know that your God is able.

259
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,080
We sing the song.

260
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,880
He is able to deliver thee.

261
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,880
See what had to happen

262
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,760
for Ezra and the children of Israel

263
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,360
is it was time for them to live what they had proclaimed.

264
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,480
To be doers of the word.

265
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,920
To live by faith.

266
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,640
To believe that God was able.

267
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,800
Would it have been easy and maybe comfortable

268
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,760
to make the request of the king for a band of soldiers?

269
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,040
I can't even say to you that it would have been wrong

270
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,440
for him to ask of that.

271
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,240
I believe that he felt that way.

272
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,440
But if you look in the book of Nehemiah,

273
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,360
the Bible tells us that they sent horsemen with him.

274
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,960
If you look in Nehemiah chapter number two

275
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,720
and you think about Nehemiah and his journey,

276
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,680
the Bible says that when they came to the,

277
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,160
look in chapter two in verse number nine,

278
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,960
then I came to the governors beyond the river

279
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,320
and gave them the king's letters.

280
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,040
Now the king had sent captains of the army

281
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,040
and horsemen with me.

282
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,640
So I'm not telling you that it would have been wrong

283
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,160
for Ezra as we see that Nehemiah did have an escort.

284
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,720
But Ezra says for himself and for those that were with him,

285
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,240
I was ashamed to ask this thing.

286
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,240
I'm gonna trust my God.

287
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,520
I'm gonna trust that he is able.

288
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,960
That he will safely bring us to the place

289
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,440
of where we're planning to go, to Jerusalem.

290
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,920
We read of the danger that they face.

291
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,920
We read of their dependence that is declared.

292
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,680
We read number three of their departure

293
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,560
from the river Ahava.

294
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,640
We mentioned as we read for our text

295
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,560
to open the message this evening, verse 31,

296
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,520
after the fast was proclaimed,

297
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,640
after they sought the face of God,

298
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,840
after they spent time there seeking the face of God

299
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,040
and pleading with God for direction and for protection,

300
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,880
the Bible says, then we departed.

301
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,400
There was a time that they moved on by faith.

302
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,720
Their departure.

303
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,640
See, it was an act of faith.

304
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,480
They trusted the Lord to give them the direction

305
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,080
and the protection that they sought.

306
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,080
They believed that He was able

307
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,920
and they then stepped out by faith

308
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,320
and trusted that God would deliver them.

309
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,080
God did not miraculously put them in some kind of a vacuum

310
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,720
and just transport them from the river Ahava

311
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
and put them in Jerusalem.

312
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,080
No, no, they had to take the journey.

313
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,560
The enemy was in the way.

314
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,120
There were some that were laying in wait by the way.

315
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,800
There was an enemy, the danger was there,

316
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,120
but God was working and God is to be glorified

317
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,360
as we notice that after they prayed,

318
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,080
after they sought the face of God,

319
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,680
after they fasted, then we departed.

320
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,679
It says, they departed from the river of Ahava

321
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,280
on the twelfth day of the first month to go into Jerusalem.

322
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,679
Notice, we use this as our title this evening,

323
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:47,679
and the hand of our God was upon us.

324
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,679
Notice, and He, the Lord God Almighty,

325
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,679
by the way, He is the same yesterday and today,

326
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,679
the same yesterday and today and forever.

327
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,679
Right?

328
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:06,679
The God that Ezra served, same God I serve.

329
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:07,679
Amen?

330
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,679
He's as able today as He was then.

331
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:11,679
Amen?

332
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:18,679
Notice, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy,

333
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:22,679
and of such as lay in wait by the way.

334
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:30,679
And we came to Jerusalem and abode there three days.

335
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,679
They got to Jerusalem because they left the river Ahava.

336
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,679
You're never getting to Jerusalem if you don't leave the river.

337
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,679
They didn't leave the river until they fasted and prayed,

338
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,679
and sought direction and protection from God.

339
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:47,679
But at some point after they had fasted and prayed,

340
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,679
it was time to go.

341
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,679
Faith. Believe in God.

342
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,679
We see that God did.

343
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,679
He's able.

344
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,679
Our God is able.

345
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,799
I love the Bible.

346
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:02,999
I really do.

347
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:06,559
I read it every day. I love it.

348
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,959
I preach it with passion.

349
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,399
Why? Because I believe it.

350
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:13,479
I want to live it.

351
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,999
I love reading the accounts in God's Word

352
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,239
of these great heroes of the faith

353
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:20,259
as we refer to them as.

354
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:21,599
Reading through Hebrews 11

355
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:23,159
and other portions of Scripture,

356
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:24,919
and reading about the great things

357
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:27,359
that God accomplished through His people.

358
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,959
But one thing that we notice

359
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:30,919
in every one of those accounts

360
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:32,719
is that there was some point

361
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:35,559
that those Bible characters

362
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:37,719
stepped out and lived

363
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:40,079
what they had proclaimed.

364
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,239
Otherwise, there's no Bible account.

365
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:43,679
There's no David and Goliath

366
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,399
if David's hiding with all the other people

367
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:48,879
behind the rocks every time Goliath comes out.

368
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:50,479
You're not going to read of it.

369
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:52,079
1 Samuel 17 is not going to be there

370
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,799
in the manner in which it is.

371
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:56,039
There's not going to be a 1 Kings 17 and 18

372
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:01,959
where you see the miracles

373
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,399
and then you see the situation

374
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:06,319
in 1 Kings 18 with the showdown at Carmel

375
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,879
with all of the worshipers of Baal.

376
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:10,799
You don't see Elijah doing that

377
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,639
if he did not practice what he proclaimed.

378
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:18,439
And at some point in our lives,

379
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:21,119
we've got to practice what we proclaim.

380
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,839
We've got to do what we believe.

381
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,199
We've got to say this book is not theory.

382
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:28,479
It's practiced.

383
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:31,159
This is a book that's to be lived.

384
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:34,119
And we show that our God is real

385
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:36,199
and that our God is able.

386
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:37,719
And He is able to do exceedingly abundantly

387
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:39,159
above all that we ask or think.

388
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:40,879
I believe it.

389
00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:43,279
Does it mean that nothing bad's ever going to happen?

390
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:44,879
No!

391
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:45,959
Absolutely not.

392
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:49,039
We'd never preach that because it's not true.

393
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,519
All those that live godly in Christ Jesus

394
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,839
shall suffer persecution.

395
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:53,999
I told you about a story about a conversation

396
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:56,879
that I had with someone that called

397
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:58,519
to do a survey many years ago.

398
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:00,959
I was, I don't know, it was probably four or five years ago.

399
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:02,839
I was in the office and someone called

400
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:04,439
and they wanted to conduct a survey.

401
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:06,719
And quite honestly, typically,

402
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:09,159
99.9% of the time when that happens,

403
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:10,679
I just say I'm busy, I don't have time,

404
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,119
I'm just not interested in surveys.

405
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,799
And on this particular day, I don't know,

406
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,799
something must have happened

407
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:17,639
and I was just in one of those kind of rare moods

408
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:18,719
that you're just like, you know what?

409
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:20,599
You want to ask some questions?

410
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,759
Bring it on.

411
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:23,439
And they started to ask some questions

412
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:25,239
and I began to give some Bible answers

413
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:27,199
and they were asking me all kinds of things

414
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:30,599
about the progressive movement in our churches today

415
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,079
and the prosperity gospel and so on and so forth.

416
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:36,959
And they were a student down, I think, at UVA

417
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:38,639
and they were doing this survey

418
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:40,719
and I gave them straight answers.

419
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:42,519
I said, the Bible says,

420
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:44,319
yea, all those that live godly in Christ Jesus

421
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,719
shall suffer persecution.

422
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:48,599
We can't pretend that that's not in the book.

423
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,959
It is in the book.

424
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:51,959
The Bible also says,

425
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:55,879
for we know that all things work together for good.

426
00:22:55,879 --> 00:22:57,879
Did Joseph encounter some problems?

427
00:22:57,879 --> 00:22:58,759
Yeah.

428
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:00,199
Did he spend time in prison?

429
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:01,759
Yeah.

430
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:03,079
Was he forgotten in prison?

431
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,959
For two years.

432
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:08,439
But guess what?

433
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:13,159
Joseph is second in command of all of Egypt.

434
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:15,399
He didn't go to the palace

435
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:19,239
without first ending up in the pit and in the prison.

436
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:22,599
Then he goes to the palace.

437
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:24,919
See, we serve a God that is awesome.

438
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,039
And at some point in our lives,

439
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:34,039
we have to put in practice what we proclaim.

440
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,279
We have to live it.

441
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:39,199
The Christians, they were first called Christians in Antioch.

442
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:40,519
Why?

443
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,559
Because the behavior of those people was observed.

444
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:46,199
They said, man, these people, they live like Christ.

445
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:49,879
We believe a lot of things about this book

446
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,879
and we should,

447
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:56,879
but I've often said belief impacts behavior.

448
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,639
It has to.

449
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,839
And the other side of that coin,

450
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:06,399
and it's the same coin,

451
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:10,479
is that behavior reveals belief.

452
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:12,919
It's a two-sided coin.

453
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,679
Belief impacts behavior.

454
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:22,559
Behavior reveals belief.

455
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,519
In this evening, if we look at Ezra in Ezra 8,

456
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:30,720
we would have to conclude from his behavior

457
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,639
that he believed God.

458
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:35,199
He believed what he had proclaimed to the king.

459
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:38,320
He believed that the good hand of God would be upon him

460
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,759
and them as they sought the Lord.

461
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:42,600
And guess what?

462
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,959
God protected.

463
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,359
We see in this passage of Scripture

464
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,720
as we kind of bounce back and forth

465
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,600
between these verses of Scripture,

466
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,600
there was a danger that they faced.

467
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,440
It was real.

468
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:59,359
There was a dependence that they declared,

469
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,199
and it was this.

470
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,359
We're not gonna trust the king

471
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:05,279
to send some military escort to protect us.

472
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,359
We're gonna trust our God.

473
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:11,880
We're gonna fast and pray, seek the face of God.

474
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,839
And then they departed from the River Ahava.

475
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:16,759
They got done praying, fasting.

476
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:17,600
It was time to go.

477
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,239
It was time to live by faith and to believe God.

478
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,759
The Bible tells us, then they departed,

479
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:27,119
and then it tells us in verse 32,

480
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:29,279
they arrived in Jerusalem.

481
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,279
Praise the Lord for someone that would live by faith

482
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,119
and believe God.

483
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:36,720
This evening, I don't know what it is in your life.

484
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,600
I know that there's several things in my life

485
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,519
and several things that we deal with.

486
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:42,759
You can make the application.

487
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:44,000
I could make applications

488
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,519
in so many different ways this evening.

489
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:50,000
But for us tonight, we gotta live what we believe.

490
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:54,399
If it's in this book, it's true.

491
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,039
Dependable, trustworthy.

492
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,519
Oh, that we'd live it.

493
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:00,359
Father, we love You.

494
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,839
Thank You for loving us.

495
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,559
Thank You for Your Word.

496
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:06,799
We thank You for the many accounts

497
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,799
that we get to read and study through Thy Word

498
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,720
to be encouraged, strengthened, and challenged

499
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:22,160
through the accounts of Your hand at work.

500
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:32,720
Many of these accounts that we would say

501
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,160
are maybe our favorite Bible account

502
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:38,239
or however we would use the terminology.

503
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:42,440
They never would have happened

504
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,639
if someone didn't live what they had proclaimed.

505
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,440
Lord, I pray that You'd help us today in 2020.

506
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,199
It's our hour.

507
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:54,160
It's our turn.

508
00:26:55,799 --> 00:27:00,799
I wonder what the book would say of our lives.

509
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:03,399
What would it say of our lives

510
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:04,959
if someone were to look at us

511
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:09,959
and to chronicle our behavior in our lives?

512
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:16,720
Would someone walk away after reading that

513
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,519
by saying, man, they believed God.

514
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:21,759
They lived what they proclaimed.

515
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,759
Often, as Christians were criticized

516
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:27,160
for being hypocritical.

517
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,519
It's a criticism that comes far too often.

518
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:35,359
And we are to be doers of the Word.

519
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,799
We're to practice what we preach,

520
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,559
practice what we believe.

521
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,239
Paul said, the things that you've heard of me

522
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:45,239
and seen in me do in Philippians chapter number four.

523
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:49,000
Oh God, we pray that You would help us

524
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,600
to have the faith of Ezra,

525
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,759
to declare our dependence upon Thee,

526
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:55,079
to declare our dependence upon Thee,

527
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:58,320
knowing there are dangers that we face.

528
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:01,919
God, I pray that You'd help us to live by faith,

529
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,039
to use the terminology of our study this evening

530
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:06,919
from the life of Ezra,

531
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,799
that You'd help us to leave the river.

532
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:13,440
God, that we take that step of obedience

533
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,039
and step of faith, believing.

534
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,359
And then God, we can see You do what only You can do.

535
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:22,600
You just said revival.

536
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,320
We need revival in our nation.

537
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,039
I pray God that You'd help us to be faithful.

538
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:28,880
We'll thank You for it.

539
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,959
In Christ's name we pray, amen.
