1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,679
10 this evening, as I mentioned, we will have a little shorter of a message this evening.

2
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,600
We have three update videos to have the opportunity to watch.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,260
I want to look really at verses 13 through 17 this evening, and as we look at this passage

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,040
of Scripture, it's a familiar passage.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,600
In fact, a couple of verses from this passage of Scripture are extremely familiar to us

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,459
in verses of Scripture that we hold dear, in fact, verses that we've probably, many

7
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:29,079
of us, committed to memory.

8
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:33,459
And really, as we look at the passage this evening, I would look at those, verse 13 and

9
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:38,979
verse 17, as being really bookends to the message this evening.

10
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:43,900
And two wonderful promises that we find in these two bookends.

11
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:49,659
Notice the Bible says, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

12
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:53,220
How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed?

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,380
And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard?

14
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,180
And how shall they hear without a preacher?

15
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,720
And how shall they preach except they be sent?

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,519
As it is written, how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and

17
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,319
bring glad tidings of good things.

18
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,199
But they have not all obeyed the gospel.

19
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:20,260
For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?

20
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,940
So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

21
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,959
As we think about the passage of Scripture that is before us, of course, the emphasis,

22
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:34,080
the focus this evening, from our perspective, will be that on missions.

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,760
We're gonna look at these mission videos and have the opportunity to see how God is working

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,800
and what God is doing in various parts of the world and the privilege that we have as

25
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,819
a local assembly to be involved in what God is doing globally.

26
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:51,660
We understand that the Great Commission has been given.

27
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,879
We understand that the Lord Jesus Christ, before He ascended up into Heaven, He gave

28
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:59,419
that Great Commission and He said that we're to go into all the world and we're to preach

29
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,699
the gospel to every creature.

30
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:06,540
We find that as you read it in the book of Acts, and very interesting as you look at

31
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,300
the passage there in Acts chapter number one, as Jesus gives that Great Commission and then

32
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:18,660
the ascension is recorded, and you find that no doubt the impact of what the angels said

33
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,699
to those disciples that were there that observed the ascension of Jesus Christ had a great

34
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,720
impact on them fulfilling those last words that they heard from Jesus Christ, and those

35
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,119
words that were to be filled with the Holy Spirit of God and were to be witnesses, and

36
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:42,100
the idea that we're to be witnesses both in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria and unto the

37
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,279
uttermost part of the earth.

38
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:49,119
And the idea of that both, when He uses that terminology, is at the same time.

39
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:53,960
And so as we're reaching our Jerusalem, we are to be engaged in seeing the rest of the

40
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,220
world reached.

41
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:00,779
And I'm thankful for the modern aspect of missions, of course, as you read through the

42
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:06,419
book of Acts and you see the gospel going out, and you find that really until Acts chapter

43
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:11,119
number eight, when you're looking at all of that which is taking place, you see the gospel

44
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:16,419
in Jerusalem, and you see the church in Jerusalem, and it's growing, but the persecution is intensifying.

45
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:21,100
And in Acts chapter number eight, the Bible speaks of a scattering, and when it speaks

46
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,639
of that scattering, it tells us that they went everywhere preaching the Word.

47
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:34,059
And what a blessing to think about the persecution and the intent of the enemy to stop the gospel

48
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:40,779
from going forward, but through that disbursement, if you will, through the group of people there

49
00:03:40,779 --> 00:03:44,660
in Jerusalem being spread abroad, they went everywhere preaching the gospel.

50
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,559
You get to Acts chapter number 13, and you have the opportunity to read of the first

51
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:53,000
missionary journey, and you find that in Acts chapter number 13, the church at Antioch,

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,759
what a great church, and they're ministering and they're serving, and God is using them,

53
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:03,559
and God says through His Holy Spirit to separate unto me Barnabas and Saul for the work that

54
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:04,880
I've called them to.

55
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:10,039
And you find that in Acts chapter number 13 is that first missionary journey, and the

56
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:15,199
men of God that God called for that journey, they went to the region of Galatia.

57
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,559
There were four churches that were established on that first missionary journey, and as those

58
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:24,839
four churches were established, you find that the book of Galatians would later be written

59
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:29,959
to the churches that are in the region of Galatia, and you find that you receive further

60
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:33,600
insight as to what God did and how God worked.

61
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,040
But while they were out doing the work of the ministry, while they were out planting

62
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,079
churches and preaching the gospel, there was a church, the church in Antioch, that was

63
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:47,799
the sending church, if you will, that had the responsibility of reaching Antioch.

64
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:52,760
Yes, one of the regions that was, or cities that was reached in that first missionary

65
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:59,559
journey was Antioch in Pisidia, a different Antioch, and we find that the church is there,

66
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:07,959
and at the end of that journey, Paul returns and they have this great reunion and rejoicing

67
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:11,559
of all that God has done and how God has worked.

68
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:16,279
Now they didn't have the opportunity to send back information and data the way that we

69
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:23,119
do today, and the technology that exists, and just up-to-date updates that we're able

70
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:28,640
to receive and urgent prayer requests, and I mean, I'm thankful for technology, and there's

71
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,679
some things about technology I don't like a whole lot, but I'm thankful for the opportunities

72
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:37,839
to be able to know what's going on, and for these missionaries that we support, they're

73
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,160
not always able to come home and report to us and show us pictures.

74
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,480
Of course, when they come on furlough, we try to get them scheduled in.

75
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,799
We have the opportunity to see these update videos.

76
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:52,660
It's encouraging because you get to see how God is answering your prayers.

77
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,760
You get the opportunity to see how God is using your dollars as we collectively give

78
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,799
to the work of missions.

79
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:04,000
We have the opportunity to support all of these missionaries that God has graciously

80
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,279
enabled us to support, and to see that the work is going forward.

81
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,920
Listen, God is working globally.

82
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,600
It is absolutely exciting to see what God is doing.

83
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,119
I understand sometimes we can get under it here in America, and you can see all of the

84
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:23,279
difficulties that we face, and all of the hardships, and they're trying to stamp out

85
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,200
God and His Word, and all of those things, and the pushback and the opposition, but God

86
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,440
is working.

87
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,839
He's working here in America, and we get to see that, and what a blessing, but man, when

88
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,799
you begin to see what God is doing globally, it's exciting.

89
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:40,279
As we look at this passage of Scripture, I've titled the message this evening, How Shall

90
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,640
They Preach Except They Be Sent?

91
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,279
Of course, you see that in verse number 15.

92
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:50,119
I want to look just for a moment at these bookend promises, if you will, in verse 13

93
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:54,839
and verse number 17, and then I want to look at the questions that are asked in between.

94
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:59,920
Notice this truth in verse number 13, what a precious promise this is, for whosoever

95
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,559
shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

96
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:06,200
Isn't that wonderful?

97
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,519
Are you thankful for that promise?

98
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:13,359
I remember when I first heard the Gospel, I remember when I first was exposed to the

99
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:17,959
truth of God's Word, that somebody showed me this verse of Scripture, and they said,

100
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:23,540
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved, and they said something

101
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,679
like this, and I've said it hundreds of times as I've spoken to people over the years.

102
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,480
I've said that word whosoever, that means anybody.

103
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,480
That means any human being.

104
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,760
If you're alive and breathing, you're a whosoever.

105
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,359
Aren't you thankful for that?

106
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:44,399
And I've encouraged people over the years to put your name in there, take out the whosoever

107
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:51,040
and put your name, because if you, and have the person say their name, if you call upon

108
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,040
the name of the Lord, it says that you shall be saved.

109
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,279
Now we like the word shall.

110
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,600
It's an old English word, but it's a word of certainty.

111
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,480
It doesn't say that you might be saved.

112
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,779
It doesn't say that you could be saved.

113
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:12,660
It says that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

114
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,000
And that's a promise that God Almighty has given us.

115
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,480
And we think about this precious promise of Romans 10 and verse number 13, and we understand

116
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,600
this evening how grateful we are to know that promise.

117
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Many of us, again, have the ability to quote this verse of Scripture.

118
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:36,440
Many of us, someone has encouraged us to hide the word of God in our hearts, perhaps even

119
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,919
we've gone through some outreach classes and they've encouraged us to commit to memory

120
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,619
some verses from the book of Romans, and sometimes we call it the Romans Road, and memorize these

121
00:08:47,619 --> 00:08:51,080
verses of Scripture, and this is one of them.

122
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,840
And again, we have it in our minds and we're familiar with it and we hear it often.

123
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,960
What a precious promise it is.

124
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,840
I'm so thankful that I'm a whosoever, and I'm so thankful that God allowed me to hear

125
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,039
the gospel, and that when I place my faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, He saved

126
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,039
my soul.

127
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,039
What a blessing.

128
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:12,520
But look at verse number 17, another great promise, one, again, that we are very familiar

129
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,679
with, one that we have committed to memory, one that we've often rehearsed and recited.

130
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:24,840
The Bible says, so then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

131
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,039
Have you ever heard somebody say, I just don't have enough faith?

132
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,679
Received a phone call not long ago, just a couple of weeks ago, and the person on the

133
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:38,239
other end of the phone said, I just don't have any faith, preacher.

134
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:42,640
And I asked this question, I said, how's your time in God's word?

135
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,599
I don't ask that to be unkind, but the Bible says that faith cometh by hearing, and hearing

136
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:50,599
by the word of God.

137
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:54,919
And if you have acknowledged and admitted that you have no faith, that your faith is

138
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:59,039
small, that your faith is weak, you need to get into the book, amen?

139
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,039
So that our faith would

140
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,839
would be increased.

141
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,159
We find that the Word of God increases our faith

142
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:09,159
as we go through and read the pages of Scripture,

143
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:12,079
how it encourages us and how it reveals to us

144
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,759
the nature and character of our God,

145
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:17,159
that He is the Lord God omnipotent,

146
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,039
that He rules and that He reigns

147
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,919
and that He is able to do exceeding abundantly

148
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,999
above all that we ask or think.

149
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,659
And when we think about the truth of God's Word

150
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,039
and His nature and character revealed to us,

151
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,579
it increases our faith and it causes us to trust Him

152
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:34,259
and to depend upon Him,

153
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,579
that He is the God of the impossible.

154
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:42,859
The just, the Bible tells us, are to live by faith.

155
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:45,259
The Word of God tells us in Hebrews 11,

156
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:47,579
that great hall of faith chapter,

157
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:48,959
a chapter that we cherish,

158
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,159
a chapter in which you go to and you see,

159
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:53,599
so by faith, you fill in the character,

160
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:55,399
Noah and Abraham and Sarah,

161
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:56,679
and you fill it in and you see

162
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:59,039
all of these great accomplishments

163
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,279
because the people of God took God at His Word.

164
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,559
But in verse number six of Hebrews 11,

165
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,559
it says that without faith, it is impossible to please Him.

166
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,599
For he that cometh to God must believe that He is

167
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:17,599
and that He's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.

168
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:19,439
And so we have to have faith.

169
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:22,879
That faith comes from this precious book.

170
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,519
The Bible tells us for by grace are you saved through

171
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,199
faith, right?

172
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:30,439
Ephesians two and verse number eight.

173
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,439
For by grace are you saved through faith.

174
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:36,399
We understand that it's not a works salvation.

175
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,199
It's not of works lest any man should boast.

176
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,719
I'm thankful for salvation entirely dependent

177
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,679
upon the Lord Jesus Christ.

178
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,439
Because if it was dependent upon you

179
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,319
or if it was dependent upon me, we'd mess it up.

180
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:50,239
Amen?

181
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:52,559
If I could lose it, I'd have lost it.

182
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,479
And so would you.

183
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:58,439
But the reality is that these two precious promises,

184
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:01,679
verse 13, for whosoever shall call upon the name

185
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,999
of the Lord shall be saved.

186
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:06,999
Verse 17, so then faith cometh by hearing

187
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:09,959
and hearing by the Word of God.

188
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:13,279
Precious promises for us as the people of God.

189
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,999
Bookend promises, if you will,

190
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:17,119
for this short passage of scripture.

191
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:18,679
But I want you to notice the questions

192
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,839
that are given in between.

193
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:22,759
The questions that are given in between

194
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,319
are really important questions.

195
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:30,919
Questions that we must not skim over.

196
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:34,879
Questions that we must allow to impact us.

197
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,359
It says in verse number 14,

198
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:42,359
how then shall they call on Him

199
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,679
in whom they have not believed?

200
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,839
But then it says this,

201
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,719
and how shall they believe in Him

202
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:55,559
of whom they have not heard?

203
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:01,079
And how shall they hear without a preacher?

204
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,479
When you look at verse number 14,

205
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:04,519
there are three questions that are asked

206
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,159
in this verse of scripture.

207
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:08,519
And if we take it and look at what's happening,

208
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,599
we understand that they're not going to call on Him

209
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:13,959
in whom they've not believed.

210
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,759
They're not gonna believe in Him

211
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:18,479
of whom they have not heard, right?

212
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:20,399
How are you gonna believe in Jesus

213
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,879
if you've not heard of who Jesus is?

214
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:25,079
Is that fair?

215
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:26,679
We understand that, correct?

216
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,679
We can't expect someone that's never heard

217
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:29,959
the name of Jesus Christ,

218
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:31,599
that does not know the Gospel,

219
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:33,679
that has had their minds blinded

220
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,199
by the God of this world

221
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:39,079
to call out and trust Christ as their Savior.

222
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,799
If we look at this in reverse order

223
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,039
in verse number 14,

224
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,679
the reality is how are they gonna hear

225
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:44,799
without a preacher?

226
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,519
A preacher shows up, a missionary.

227
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:48,479
These missionaries that we're going to look at

228
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:49,759
these videos this evening

229
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,479
and many missionaries that we support.

230
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:55,479
And I was speaking with someone just yesterday actually

231
00:13:55,479 --> 00:13:56,559
about one of our missionaries

232
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:01,559
in a really a field that is a brand new field.

233
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:04,639
And it is a hard work.

234
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,079
I mean, the ground is hard.

235
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,319
It needs to be prepared.

236
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:10,239
It needs to be turned the soil, right?

237
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:14,239
I mean, it is a difficult work

238
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:16,199
and it's a difficult place.

239
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:18,399
But someone needs to go

240
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,919
because how are those people gonna hear

241
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,599
without a preacher?

242
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:24,559
And if they don't hear,

243
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,639
then they can't believe in Him

244
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,839
because they've not heard of Him.

245
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,719
And if they can't believe in Him,

246
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:34,239
then they're not gonna call on Him.

247
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,319
And you read that great precious promise

248
00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:37,719
in verse number 13,

249
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:40,359
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

250
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:41,679
shall be saved.

251
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,839
How many whosoever's aren't calling

252
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,239
because they've never heard?

253
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,759
Right?

254
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:49,439
It continues in verse number 15.

255
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:51,199
Notice it says this,

256
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,199
and how shall they preach except they be sent?

257
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,959
Really as we think about this

258
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,959
and using it as the title this evening

259
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:01,479
and looking at verse number 15

260
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:03,159
and understanding the work of missions

261
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:05,319
and understanding as I've mentioned already

262
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:06,999
in Acts chapter number 13,

263
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:09,719
where they're sent out from that church.

264
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:12,519
And yes, they're called by the Lord

265
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,479
and God Almighty places a call

266
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:17,159
upon the lives of these individuals,

267
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:19,399
but they're sent out.

268
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:23,199
And how shall they preach except they be sent?

269
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,399
The Lord Jesus Christ sent out witnesses, did He not?

270
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,559
He sent them two by two.

271
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,999
And you find that they were sent

272
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:33,319
and you find that in Acts 13, they were sent.

273
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:36,079
And you find that as we look at modern missions,

274
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:36,919
if you will,

275
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:39,959
and you begin to think about the mission work

276
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:40,799
that takes place

277
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,799
and you see how that they are sent

278
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,599
and we desire to hold the ropes

279
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,479
and be behind them and pray for them

280
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,919
and try to encourage them and yes,

281
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:52,839
give so that they can have the financial resources

282
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,559
that are necessary in order to go

283
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,399
and to preach in those particular areas.

284
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,119
You understand in many countries of the world,

285
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:01,239
in fact, many of our missionaries,

286
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:04,239
I've chatted with them personally,

287
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:06,319
the countries in which they serve,

288
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:09,999
not all of them, but a majority of them,

289
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:12,599
you are not permitted to enter into the country

290
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:17,119
unless you can prove that you have enough financial backing

291
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:20,599
that you will not be dependent upon their society.

292
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:24,159
Before you can ever get any entrance into the country,

293
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,999
you must be able to prove

294
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:28,959
that you're not going to take any of the jobs

295
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,999
that are supposed to be for their people of that country.

296
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:34,119
It's how it works.

297
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,639
I know it doesn't work that way in America,

298
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,799
I understand that.

299
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:40,079
But that's how it works in a lot of these countries

300
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,719
where these missionaries serve.

301
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:43,239
Because the countries are saying,

302
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:46,919
no, we don't want you to come here and take a job

303
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:50,959
that could be for someone from a national.

304
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,399
And so the only way we're gonna grant you permission

305
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,559
to come here is if you have the financial wherewithal

306
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,799
to sustain yourself independent

307
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:05,199
of anything that you would receive from our country.

308
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,799
So that's why missionaries go to all these churches

309
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:11,239
and try to raise support.

310
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,079
Brother Michael told us

311
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,479
about a brand new missionary this morning.

312
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:15,319
I don't know the fella, I've never heard of the fella

313
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,679
until I read the email last week from Brother Hamilton.

314
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:22,279
But what a blessing to think about a new servant of the Lord

315
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:25,759
that God called that's gonna go out and raise support.

316
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,639
When we pick these missionaries up for support,

317
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:31,079
it's more than just that we're gonna send them money

318
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,879
monthly, that's part of it.

319
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:36,239
That's how today in our modern society

320
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:40,159
and the cultures and the climate in which we must deal,

321
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,519
that's how they have to go.

322
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,519
But it's so much more than just money.

323
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:45,719
Every missionary that I know,

324
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,799
every missionary that's on our board,

325
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:50,319
they would tell you as they have told me,

326
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,439
and many of them have stood on this platform

327
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,079
and they've said it publicly,

328
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:56,319
more than your money, we need your prayers.

329
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:58,439
Now they need the money.

330
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:00,159
If they don't have the money, they can't go.

331
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:01,919
I've already explained that.

332
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,439
But oh, how they need the prayers of God's people.

333
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,599
That's why we have these missionary directory booklets

334
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,959
that we put together.

335
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:10,199
That's why we update those.

336
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:13,439
That's why Deborah spent time to put the format together

337
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:15,039
and we pay to have them print it,

338
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,839
to get a resource into the hands of the members

339
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:19,599
of our church and the attenders of our church.

340
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,439
Why?

341
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:23,319
So that we can pray for our missionaries.

342
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,239
I sent out that email on Thursday evening

343
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:27,519
about Brother Day Carvalho,

344
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,559
and I got a response from one of our members

345
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:30,479
on Friday morning saying,

346
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:33,880
you know, God put him on my heart yesterday.

347
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,199
And I was praying for him in the afternoon.

348
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:36,519
I don't know why God put him on my heart,

349
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:38,519
but I was praying for him.

350
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,199
They were gonna send an email to Mrs. Day Carvalho

351
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:43,239
to try to encourage her.

352
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:44,599
As soon as I received the email,

353
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:46,440
I responded to Mrs. Day Carvalho.

354
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,599
I wanted to alert the church family.

355
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,440
Why?

356
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,959
So that we can pray.

357
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:51,799
Why?

358
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:52,719
Because God answers prayer.

359
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,199
And we think about the opportunity that we have,

360
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:59,919
we understand how shall they preach except they be sent,

361
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,320
that we have this privilege of being part

362
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,919
of that sending process.

363
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:07,959
Being one of those churches

364
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:11,399
that is partnered together with these missionaries

365
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:15,239
to see them go to the place where God has called them.

366
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:17,000
And then as they go, what do they go to do?

367
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,239
They go to preach.

368
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:20,839
They go to preach the gospel.

369
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:21,839
And then all of a sudden,

370
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,959
people that have never heard,

371
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:26,639
in verse number 14, the last question,

372
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:28,839
they now have a preacher.

373
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:31,479
And the preacher comes in and he begins to preach.

374
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:34,199
They've never heard this message.

375
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:38,239
They've been blinded by the religious world system.

376
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:41,359
They've been blinded by the culture in which they're living.

377
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:44,719
They have state religious organizations

378
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:47,839
and state-run, government-run churches

379
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,639
and all of these fields

380
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:52,639
and all of the darkness and the blindness.

381
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:55,479
And a preacher shows up and begins to preach.

382
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:56,320
Why?

383
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,279
Because he's been sent.

384
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,079
The family's been sent.

385
00:19:59,079 --> 00:19:59,919
And now...

386
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,919
The preaching.

387
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,039
The preaching of let me tell you who God is.

388
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:05,459
Let me tell you who Jesus is.

389
00:20:05,459 --> 00:20:07,719
Let me tell you what Jesus did for you.

390
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:10,019
Let me tell you how much God loves you.

391
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:11,439
They begin to preach,

392
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:13,019
and the Bible tells us

393
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:14,679
that now as you think about them

394
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:15,759
having a preacher,

395
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:18,419
now they can hear.

396
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:19,659
And now that they hear,

397
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:20,999
remember v. 17,

398
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:23,619
so then faith cometh by hearing,

399
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:25,919
and hearing by the Word of God.

400
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,719
So now they're hearing.

401
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,039
The faith is there.

402
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,239
And the Bible tells us in v. 14,

403
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:32,859
how shall they believe in Him

404
00:20:32,859 --> 00:20:35,039
of whom they have not heard?

405
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,159
Well, now they're hearing,

406
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,279
so now they can believe.

407
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,699
What is faith? Believing.

408
00:20:39,699 --> 00:20:41,539
Believing.

409
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:43,199
And so now, obviously,

410
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:44,579
I wish 100% of the people

411
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:46,079
that heard the Gospel got saved.

412
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,239
We know that's not the case.

413
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:51,079
In fact, I told an individual yesterday,

414
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:52,619
I cannot say it in the same way

415
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:53,999
that the Apostle Paul said it

416
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:55,279
in Acts 20,

417
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:57,159
that I'm free from the blood of all men.

418
00:20:57,159 --> 00:20:58,279
I can't say that.

419
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:59,479
And I believe that he looks at that

420
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:00,779
from the parallel truth

421
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:01,979
in the book of Ezekiel,

422
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:03,519
and Ezekiel being a watchman,

423
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:04,639
and so on and so forth,

424
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,639
in chapter 3,

425
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,439
and I think in chapter 33.

426
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:08,779
And you find there,

427
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:10,139
but I told this individual,

428
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:11,139
I said, listen,

429
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:12,139
I just want you to know

430
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:13,639
that personally between you and I,

431
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,639
I can say that your blood

432
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:17,639
is not on my hands.

433
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:18,639
I have given you

434
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:21,019
the truth of the Gospel,

435
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:22,139
and I have explained it to you

436
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:23,399
to the best of my ability,

437
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:24,399
and I've shown you

438
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:25,399
the Word of God.

439
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:26,399
I've answered your questions.

440
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:27,399
The choice is yours.

441
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,519
The decision is yours,

442
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:30,679
but I have a clear conscience.

443
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:37,059
I have done what God has called me to do.

444
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:39,679
They don't always believe

445
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,679
on whom they have heard,

446
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:45,339
but now they have the opportunity to believe.

447
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:47,639
Now the preaching of the Word of God,

448
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,939
now they've heard who Jesus is,

449
00:21:49,939 --> 00:21:50,939
and it says,

450
00:21:50,939 --> 00:21:51,939
how shall they call on Him

451
00:21:51,939 --> 00:21:52,939
in whom they've not believed?

452
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:54,439
But you notice the truth of verse 13,

453
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,559
and what a blessing

454
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:56,559
when these missionaries

455
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:57,719
have the opportunity

456
00:21:57,719 --> 00:21:59,719
to see souls saved.

457
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,719
Lives changed,

458
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,999
because they went to a place

459
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:03,039
because they were sent.

460
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,639
How shall they preach

461
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:06,999
except they be sent?

462
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:08,359
Because God's moved and worked

463
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:10,319
in your heart and my heart

464
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:13,719
to give of our resources,

465
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:16,959
understanding that God has blessed us.

466
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:17,959
All that we have

467
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:19,999
is because of the good hand of God.

468
00:22:19,999 --> 00:22:20,999
Amen?

469
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:21,999
All that we have

470
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:24,239
is because of God,

471
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:25,799
and that He would privilege us,

472
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,319
He would allow us

473
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:29,239
not only to give of our tithes

474
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:30,239
and our offerings,

475
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:32,839
but to give to the work of missions,

476
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:34,719
and to take a portion

477
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:36,039
of what God has blessed us with

478
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:37,039
and say,

479
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,159
I'm going to designate for mission work

480
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:41,039
that these funds,

481
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,359
I'm going to take time

482
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:45,719
and pray for these missionaries.

483
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:46,719
Paul said this

484
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:47,719
in the book of Philippians,

485
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:48,719
turn over there if you will,

486
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:49,719
Philippians chapter number four,

487
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:51,279
and I want you to notice,

488
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:53,079
and I'm going to close with this thought

489
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,479
because we have the opportunity,

490
00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:55,879
how shall they preach

491
00:22:55,879 --> 00:22:56,879
except they be sent,

492
00:22:56,879 --> 00:22:57,879
that we have the opportunity

493
00:22:57,879 --> 00:22:59,279
because of your giving

494
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,999
and because of our giving collectively

495
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:05,359
to support these missionaries.

496
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:06,359
And they're going

497
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,439
and souls are being saved

498
00:23:07,439 --> 00:23:08,439
and lives are being changed,

499
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:09,679
and I want you to notice

500
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,679
that Paul was speaking

501
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:12,159
at the end of the book of Philippians

502
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,159
and he's speaking about

503
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:14,599
how the church at Philippi

504
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,919
had communicated with him,

505
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:18,119
how they had given to him

506
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:20,039
an offering once and again.

507
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,039
Notice in verse number 14,

508
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,199
notwithstanding you have well done

509
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:24,399
that ye did communicate

510
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:25,399
with my affliction.

511
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:27,359
Now ye Philippians know also

512
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:28,759
that in the beginning of the Gospel

513
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:31,039
when I departed from Macedonia,

514
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,599
no church communicated with me

515
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:34,439
as concerning giving and receiving,

516
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:35,799
but ye only.

517
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:36,879
For even in Thessalonica

518
00:23:36,879 --> 00:23:38,159
ye sent once and again

519
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,159
unto my necessity.

520
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:40,919
Isn't that a blessing?

521
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,919
The church at Philippi,

522
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,659
they were investing in something

523
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:46,479
beyond themselves.

524
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:48,039
They said we want to invest in this.

525
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:50,759
We want to be part of this.

526
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:51,759
The Bible tells us

527
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:52,879
that Paul says,

528
00:23:52,879 --> 00:23:55,679
not because I desire a gift,

529
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,279
but notice this,

530
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,479
but I desire fruit

531
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,919
that may abound to your account.

532
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:03,919
You know, there are going to be

533
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,919
some people in heaven

534
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,079
that we're never going to meet

535
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,879
on this earth.

536
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:10,959
But there's a missionary

537
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:12,319
that we pray for,

538
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,199
that we give to,

539
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:16,279
that's preached the word of God

540
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:18,439
because they've been sent.

541
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:20,719
And people have heard.

542
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:22,359
People have believed.

543
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:24,119
And people have called.

544
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:26,039
People have been saved.

545
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,359
And it's fruit.

546
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:31,759
It's fruit on our account.

547
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:34,119
Isn't that amazing?

548
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:36,679
That's how God's designed it to be.

549
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:39,319
And we're co-laborers together

550
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,999
with God.

551
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:42,519
And what a blessing.

552
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,679
Paul continues and says,

553
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:44,999
but I have all and abound

554
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:45,999
in verse 18,

555
00:24:45,999 --> 00:24:46,999
I am full having received

556
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:48,239
of Epaphroditus,

557
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:49,679
the things which were sent from you

558
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:50,679
as an odor of a sweet smell,

559
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:51,879
a sacrifice acceptable

560
00:24:51,879 --> 00:24:53,119
well-pleasingly to God.

561
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,039
God is pleased with this giving

562
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,719
of the church of Philippi.

563
00:24:57,719 --> 00:25:00,239
He's pleased with their investment

564
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:02,279
in the work that God has called Paul to.

565
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,799
And then notice this great promise,

566
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:05,919
but my God shall supply

567
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,159
all your need according to His riches

568
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,759
in glory by Christ Jesus.

569
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:15,319
That's a promise that we can claim.

570
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,519
As we have the opportunity

571
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:18,079
to see these videos this evening,

572
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:19,879
I hope that you're encouraged

573
00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:22,079
about the work of missions,

574
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:23,399
the opportunity that we have

575
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:24,399
as a local church.

576
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:27,119
Yes, we have a missions conference

577
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:28,919
that's coming up in May.

578
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,639
I love missions.

579
00:25:30,639 --> 00:25:32,639
I love missionaries.

580
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:34,119
I love the privilege of being able

581
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:36,159
to receive these reports

582
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,199
and every week having at least four updates,

583
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:41,759
one that Brother Michael provides us with

584
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:43,279
on Sunday morning,

585
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,519
three on Wednesday evenings

586
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:45,679
on our prayer bulletin.

587
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,719
Man, it's encouraging.

588
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,319
I hope that we never get bored

589
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:51,079
with hearing what God is doing

590
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:52,639
and how God is working.

591
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,079
Because how are they gonna preach

592
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,839
except they be sent?

593
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,159
And unless we in churches like ours

594
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:04,719
give and pray, the work's not going on.

595
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:06,079
They're not getting there.

596
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,319
And people aren't calling on

597
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:10,839
because they've not heard of

598
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:12,719
the Lord Jesus Christ.

599
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:14,319
It's a great opportunity, great privilege.

600
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:17,039
So I hope tonight as we watch these videos

601
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,519
that you're encouraged,

602
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:19,479
that you have the privilege

603
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:22,239
of seeing your missions dollars at work.

604
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:23,199
Amen?

605
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:24,119
So let's pray.

606
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,319
And then we're gonna look at these videos.

607
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:26,639
Father, we love you.

608
00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:28,199
We thank you for loving us.

609
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:29,479
Thank you for the privilege

610
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:31,959
of being involved in world missions.

611
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,879
I thank you for our church.

612
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:36,279
Lord, the heart of our church family

613
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,519
to give to the work of missions.

614
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:43,639
God, to pray for our missionaries.

615
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:46,239
Lord, I pray that you'd continue

616
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,839
to use our church.

617
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:51,079
We thank you for the many, many missionaries

618
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:53,759
that you give us the opportunity to support.

619
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:55,399
This evening as we take a few moments

620
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:56,559
to look at these videos,

621
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,359
I pray that you'd encourage us.

622
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:02,279
I pray, God, that if there'd be one

623
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:06,039
that maybe you'd call to the ministry,

624
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:09,919
to the work of missions,

625
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,559
that you'd place your call upon their life,

626
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,479
that, Lord, they'd respond in obedience.

627
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,639
Perhaps, Lord, we've not been

628
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,119
as faithful in giving to missions.

629
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:25,679
Perhaps we've not been as faithful

630
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,519
in praying for our missionaries.

631
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:30,999
God, would you help us to increase more and more

632
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:34,519
in these areas?

633
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,839
Again, we ask that you'd encourage us,

634
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:40,639
help us to rejoice in that which you're doing.

635
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:42,799
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

636
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,679
Amen.
