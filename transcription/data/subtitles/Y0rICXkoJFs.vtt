WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.679
10 this evening, as I mentioned, we will have a little shorter of a message this evening.

00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:09.600
We have three update videos to have the opportunity to watch.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.260
I want to look really at verses 13 through 17 this evening, and as we look at this passage

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.040
of Scripture, it's a familiar passage.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.600
In fact, a couple of verses from this passage of Scripture are extremely familiar to us

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.459
in verses of Scripture that we hold dear, in fact, verses that we've probably, many

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:29.079
of us, committed to memory.

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.459
And really, as we look at the passage this evening, I would look at those, verse 13 and

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:38.979
verse 17, as being really bookends to the message this evening.

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:43.900
And two wonderful promises that we find in these two bookends.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.659
Notice the Bible says, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:53.220
How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed?

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.380
And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard?

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.180
And how shall they hear without a preacher?

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.720
And how shall they preach except they be sent?

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.519
As it is written, how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:12.319
bring glad tidings of good things.

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:15.199
But they have not all obeyed the gospel.

00:01:15.199 --> 00:01:20.260
For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.940
So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.959
As we think about the passage of Scripture that is before us, of course, the emphasis,

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:34.080
the focus this evening, from our perspective, will be that on missions.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.760
We're gonna look at these mission videos and have the opportunity to see how God is working

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.800
and what God is doing in various parts of the world and the privilege that we have as

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.819
a local assembly to be involved in what God is doing globally.

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:51.660
We understand that the Great Commission has been given.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.879
We understand that the Lord Jesus Christ, before He ascended up into Heaven, He gave

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:59.419
that Great Commission and He said that we're to go into all the world and we're to preach

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.699
the gospel to every creature.

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:06.540
We find that as you read it in the book of Acts, and very interesting as you look at

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.300
the passage there in Acts chapter number one, as Jesus gives that Great Commission and then

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.660
the ascension is recorded, and you find that no doubt the impact of what the angels said

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.699
to those disciples that were there that observed the ascension of Jesus Christ had a great

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.720
impact on them fulfilling those last words that they heard from Jesus Christ, and those

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.119
words that were to be filled with the Holy Spirit of God and were to be witnesses, and

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:42.100
the idea that we're to be witnesses both in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria and unto the

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.279
uttermost part of the earth.

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:49.119
And the idea of that both, when He uses that terminology, is at the same time.

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:53.960
And so as we're reaching our Jerusalem, we are to be engaged in seeing the rest of the

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.220
world reached.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.779
And I'm thankful for the modern aspect of missions, of course, as you read through the

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:06.419
book of Acts and you see the gospel going out, and you find that really until Acts chapter

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:11.119
number eight, when you're looking at all of that which is taking place, you see the gospel

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:16.419
in Jerusalem, and you see the church in Jerusalem, and it's growing, but the persecution is intensifying.

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:21.100
And in Acts chapter number eight, the Bible speaks of a scattering, and when it speaks

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.639
of that scattering, it tells us that they went everywhere preaching the Word.

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:34.059
And what a blessing to think about the persecution and the intent of the enemy to stop the gospel

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:40.779
from going forward, but through that disbursement, if you will, through the group of people there

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:44.660
in Jerusalem being spread abroad, they went everywhere preaching the gospel.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.559
You get to Acts chapter number 13, and you have the opportunity to read of the first

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:53.000
missionary journey, and you find that in Acts chapter number 13, the church at Antioch,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.759
what a great church, and they're ministering and they're serving, and God is using them,

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:03.559
and God says through His Holy Spirit to separate unto me Barnabas and Saul for the work that

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:04.880
I've called them to.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.039
And you find that in Acts chapter number 13 is that first missionary journey, and the

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:15.199
men of God that God called for that journey, they went to the region of Galatia.

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:19.559
There were four churches that were established on that first missionary journey, and as those

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:24.839
four churches were established, you find that the book of Galatians would later be written

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:29.959
to the churches that are in the region of Galatia, and you find that you receive further

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:33.600
insight as to what God did and how God worked.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.040
But while they were out doing the work of the ministry, while they were out planting

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.079
churches and preaching the gospel, there was a church, the church in Antioch, that was

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:47.799
the sending church, if you will, that had the responsibility of reaching Antioch.

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:52.760
Yes, one of the regions that was, or cities that was reached in that first missionary

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:59.559
journey was Antioch in Pisidia, a different Antioch, and we find that the church is there,

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:07.959
and at the end of that journey, Paul returns and they have this great reunion and rejoicing

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:11.559
of all that God has done and how God has worked.

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:16.279
Now they didn't have the opportunity to send back information and data the way that we

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:23.119
do today, and the technology that exists, and just up-to-date updates that we're able

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:28.640
to receive and urgent prayer requests, and I mean, I'm thankful for technology, and there's

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.679
some things about technology I don't like a whole lot, but I'm thankful for the opportunities

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:37.839
to be able to know what's going on, and for these missionaries that we support, they're

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:42.160
not always able to come home and report to us and show us pictures.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.480
Of course, when they come on furlough, we try to get them scheduled in.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.799
We have the opportunity to see these update videos.

00:05:47.799 --> 00:05:52.660
It's encouraging because you get to see how God is answering your prayers.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.760
You get the opportunity to see how God is using your dollars as we collectively give

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.799
to the work of missions.

00:05:59.799 --> 00:06:04.000
We have the opportunity to support all of these missionaries that God has graciously

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.279
enabled us to support, and to see that the work is going forward.

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:10.920
Listen, God is working globally.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.600
It is absolutely exciting to see what God is doing.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.119
I understand sometimes we can get under it here in America, and you can see all of the

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:23.279
difficulties that we face, and all of the hardships, and they're trying to stamp out

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:28.200
God and His Word, and all of those things, and the pushback and the opposition, but God

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.440
is working.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.839
He's working here in America, and we get to see that, and what a blessing, but man, when

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:36.799
you begin to see what God is doing globally, it's exciting.

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:40.279
As we look at this passage of Scripture, I've titled the message this evening, How Shall

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:42.640
They Preach Except They Be Sent?

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.279
Of course, you see that in verse number 15.

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:50.119
I want to look just for a moment at these bookend promises, if you will, in verse 13

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:54.839
and verse number 17, and then I want to look at the questions that are asked in between.

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:59.920
Notice this truth in verse number 13, what a precious promise this is, for whosoever

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.559
shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:06.200
Isn't that wonderful?

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.519
Are you thankful for that promise?

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:13.359
I remember when I first heard the Gospel, I remember when I first was exposed to the

00:07:13.359 --> 00:07:17.959
truth of God's Word, that somebody showed me this verse of Scripture, and they said,

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:23.540
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved, and they said something

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.679
like this, and I've said it hundreds of times as I've spoken to people over the years.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.480
I've said that word whosoever, that means anybody.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.480
That means any human being.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.760
If you're alive and breathing, you're a whosoever.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.359
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:07:39.359 --> 00:07:44.399
And I've encouraged people over the years to put your name in there, take out the whosoever

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:51.040
and put your name, because if you, and have the person say their name, if you call upon

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.040
the name of the Lord, it says that you shall be saved.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.279
Now we like the word shall.

00:07:57.279 --> 00:08:01.600
It's an old English word, but it's a word of certainty.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.480
It doesn't say that you might be saved.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.779
It doesn't say that you could be saved.

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:12.660
It says that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.000
And that's a promise that God Almighty has given us.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.480
And we think about this precious promise of Romans 10 and verse number 13, and we understand

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.600
this evening how grateful we are to know that promise.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.600
Many of us, again, have the ability to quote this verse of Scripture.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:36.440
Many of us, someone has encouraged us to hide the word of God in our hearts, perhaps even

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.919
we've gone through some outreach classes and they've encouraged us to commit to memory

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:47.619
some verses from the book of Romans, and sometimes we call it the Romans Road, and memorize these

00:08:47.619 --> 00:08:51.080
verses of Scripture, and this is one of them.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.840
And again, we have it in our minds and we're familiar with it and we hear it often.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.960
What a precious promise it is.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.840
I'm so thankful that I'm a whosoever, and I'm so thankful that God allowed me to hear

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.039
the gospel, and that when I place my faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, He saved

00:09:06.039 --> 00:09:07.039
my soul.

00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:08.039
What a blessing.

00:09:08.039 --> 00:09:12.520
But look at verse number 17, another great promise, one, again, that we are very familiar

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:17.679
with, one that we have committed to memory, one that we've often rehearsed and recited.

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:24.840
The Bible says, so then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.039
Have you ever heard somebody say, I just don't have enough faith?

00:09:29.039 --> 00:09:32.679
Received a phone call not long ago, just a couple of weeks ago, and the person on the

00:09:32.679 --> 00:09:38.239
other end of the phone said, I just don't have any faith, preacher.

00:09:38.239 --> 00:09:42.640
And I asked this question, I said, how's your time in God's word?

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:48.599
I don't ask that to be unkind, but the Bible says that faith cometh by hearing, and hearing

00:09:48.599 --> 00:09:50.599
by the word of God.

00:09:50.599 --> 00:09:54.919
And if you have acknowledged and admitted that you have no faith, that your faith is

00:09:54.919 --> 00:09:59.039
small, that your faith is weak, you need to get into the book, amen?

00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:00.039
So that our faith would

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:01.839
would be increased.

00:10:01.839 --> 00:10:05.159
We find that the Word of God increases our faith

00:10:05.159 --> 00:10:09.159
as we go through and read the pages of Scripture,

00:10:09.159 --> 00:10:12.079
how it encourages us and how it reveals to us

00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:14.759
the nature and character of our God,

00:10:14.759 --> 00:10:17.159
that He is the Lord God omnipotent,

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:19.039
that He rules and that He reigns

00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:21.919
and that He is able to do exceeding abundantly

00:10:21.919 --> 00:10:23.999
above all that we ask or think.

00:10:23.999 --> 00:10:26.659
And when we think about the truth of God's Word

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:29.039
and His nature and character revealed to us,

00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:32.579
it increases our faith and it causes us to trust Him

00:10:32.579 --> 00:10:34.259
and to depend upon Him,

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:36.579
that He is the God of the impossible.

00:10:38.239 --> 00:10:42.859
The just, the Bible tells us, are to live by faith.

00:10:42.859 --> 00:10:45.259
The Word of God tells us in Hebrews 11,

00:10:45.259 --> 00:10:47.579
that great hall of faith chapter,

00:10:47.579 --> 00:10:48.959
a chapter that we cherish,

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:51.159
a chapter in which you go to and you see,

00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:53.599
so by faith, you fill in the character,

00:10:53.599 --> 00:10:55.399
Noah and Abraham and Sarah,

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:56.679
and you fill it in and you see

00:10:56.679 --> 00:10:59.039
all of these great accomplishments

00:10:59.039 --> 00:11:03.279
because the people of God took God at His Word.

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:06.559
But in verse number six of Hebrews 11,

00:11:06.559 --> 00:11:11.559
it says that without faith, it is impossible to please Him.

00:11:12.159 --> 00:11:14.599
For he that cometh to God must believe that He is

00:11:14.599 --> 00:11:17.599
and that He's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.

00:11:17.599 --> 00:11:19.439
And so we have to have faith.

00:11:19.439 --> 00:11:22.879
That faith comes from this precious book.

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:26.519
The Bible tells us for by grace are you saved through

00:11:27.359 --> 00:11:28.199
faith, right?

00:11:28.199 --> 00:11:30.439
Ephesians two and verse number eight.

00:11:30.439 --> 00:11:33.439
For by grace are you saved through faith.

00:11:33.439 --> 00:11:36.399
We understand that it's not a works salvation.

00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:39.199
It's not of works lest any man should boast.

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:42.719
I'm thankful for salvation entirely dependent

00:11:42.719 --> 00:11:44.679
upon the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:11:44.679 --> 00:11:46.439
Because if it was dependent upon you

00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:49.319
or if it was dependent upon me, we'd mess it up.

00:11:49.319 --> 00:11:50.239
Amen?

00:11:50.239 --> 00:11:52.559
If I could lose it, I'd have lost it.

00:11:52.559 --> 00:11:53.479
And so would you.

00:11:54.359 --> 00:11:58.439
But the reality is that these two precious promises,

00:11:58.439 --> 00:12:01.679
verse 13, for whosoever shall call upon the name

00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:03.999
of the Lord shall be saved.

00:12:03.999 --> 00:12:06.999
Verse 17, so then faith cometh by hearing

00:12:06.999 --> 00:12:09.959
and hearing by the Word of God.

00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:13.279
Precious promises for us as the people of God.

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:14.999
Bookend promises, if you will,

00:12:14.999 --> 00:12:17.119
for this short passage of scripture.

00:12:17.119 --> 00:12:18.679
But I want you to notice the questions

00:12:18.679 --> 00:12:20.839
that are given in between.

00:12:20.839 --> 00:12:22.759
The questions that are given in between

00:12:22.839 --> 00:12:26.319
are really important questions.

00:12:27.319 --> 00:12:30.919
Questions that we must not skim over.

00:12:30.919 --> 00:12:34.879
Questions that we must allow to impact us.

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:37.359
It says in verse number 14,

00:12:37.359 --> 00:12:42.359
how then shall they call on Him

00:12:42.559 --> 00:12:45.679
in whom they have not believed?

00:12:46.959 --> 00:12:48.839
But then it says this,

00:12:48.839 --> 00:12:53.719
and how shall they believe in Him

00:12:53.719 --> 00:12:55.559
of whom they have not heard?

00:12:56.919 --> 00:13:01.079
And how shall they hear without a preacher?

00:13:01.079 --> 00:13:02.479
When you look at verse number 14,

00:13:02.479 --> 00:13:04.519
there are three questions that are asked

00:13:04.519 --> 00:13:06.159
in this verse of scripture.

00:13:06.159 --> 00:13:08.519
And if we take it and look at what's happening,

00:13:08.519 --> 00:13:12.599
we understand that they're not going to call on Him

00:13:12.599 --> 00:13:13.959
in whom they've not believed.

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:15.759
They're not gonna believe in Him

00:13:15.759 --> 00:13:18.479
of whom they have not heard, right?

00:13:18.479 --> 00:13:20.399
How are you gonna believe in Jesus

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:23.879
if you've not heard of who Jesus is?

00:13:23.879 --> 00:13:25.079
Is that fair?

00:13:25.079 --> 00:13:26.679
We understand that, correct?

00:13:26.679 --> 00:13:28.679
We can't expect someone that's never heard

00:13:28.679 --> 00:13:29.959
the name of Jesus Christ,

00:13:29.959 --> 00:13:31.599
that does not know the Gospel,

00:13:31.599 --> 00:13:33.679
that has had their minds blinded

00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:35.199
by the God of this world

00:13:35.199 --> 00:13:39.079
to call out and trust Christ as their Savior.

00:13:39.079 --> 00:13:40.799
If we look at this in reverse order

00:13:40.799 --> 00:13:42.039
in verse number 14,

00:13:42.039 --> 00:13:43.679
the reality is how are they gonna hear

00:13:43.679 --> 00:13:44.799
without a preacher?

00:13:44.799 --> 00:13:46.519
A preacher shows up, a missionary.

00:13:46.519 --> 00:13:48.479
These missionaries that we're going to look at

00:13:48.479 --> 00:13:49.759
these videos this evening

00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:51.479
and many missionaries that we support.

00:13:51.479 --> 00:13:55.479
And I was speaking with someone just yesterday actually

00:13:55.479 --> 00:13:56.559
about one of our missionaries

00:13:56.559 --> 00:14:01.559
in a really a field that is a brand new field.

00:14:02.159 --> 00:14:04.639
And it is a hard work.

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:07.079
I mean, the ground is hard.

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:08.319
It needs to be prepared.

00:14:08.319 --> 00:14:10.239
It needs to be turned the soil, right?

00:14:10.239 --> 00:14:14.239
I mean, it is a difficult work

00:14:14.239 --> 00:14:16.199
and it's a difficult place.

00:14:16.199 --> 00:14:18.399
But someone needs to go

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:20.919
because how are those people gonna hear

00:14:20.919 --> 00:14:22.599
without a preacher?

00:14:22.599 --> 00:14:24.559
And if they don't hear,

00:14:24.559 --> 00:14:26.639
then they can't believe in Him

00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:28.839
because they've not heard of Him.

00:14:29.839 --> 00:14:31.719
And if they can't believe in Him,

00:14:31.719 --> 00:14:34.239
then they're not gonna call on Him.

00:14:34.239 --> 00:14:36.319
And you read that great precious promise

00:14:36.319 --> 00:14:37.719
in verse number 13,

00:14:37.719 --> 00:14:40.359
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

00:14:40.359 --> 00:14:41.679
shall be saved.

00:14:41.679 --> 00:14:43.839
How many whosoever's aren't calling

00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:45.239
because they've never heard?

00:14:46.319 --> 00:14:47.759
Right?

00:14:47.759 --> 00:14:49.439
It continues in verse number 15.

00:14:49.439 --> 00:14:51.199
Notice it says this,

00:14:51.199 --> 00:14:56.199
and how shall they preach except they be sent?

00:14:56.639 --> 00:14:57.959
Really as we think about this

00:14:57.959 --> 00:14:59.959
and using it as the title this evening

00:14:59.959 --> 00:15:01.479
and looking at verse number 15

00:15:01.479 --> 00:15:03.159
and understanding the work of missions

00:15:03.159 --> 00:15:05.319
and understanding as I've mentioned already

00:15:05.319 --> 00:15:06.999
in Acts chapter number 13,

00:15:06.999 --> 00:15:09.719
where they're sent out from that church.

00:15:09.719 --> 00:15:12.519
And yes, they're called by the Lord

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:14.479
and God Almighty places a call

00:15:14.479 --> 00:15:17.159
upon the lives of these individuals,

00:15:17.159 --> 00:15:19.399
but they're sent out.

00:15:19.399 --> 00:15:23.199
And how shall they preach except they be sent?

00:15:23.199 --> 00:15:27.399
The Lord Jesus Christ sent out witnesses, did He not?

00:15:27.399 --> 00:15:29.559
He sent them two by two.

00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:30.999
And you find that they were sent

00:15:30.999 --> 00:15:33.319
and you find that in Acts 13, they were sent.

00:15:33.319 --> 00:15:36.079
And you find that as we look at modern missions,

00:15:36.079 --> 00:15:36.919
if you will,

00:15:36.919 --> 00:15:39.959
and you begin to think about the mission work

00:15:39.959 --> 00:15:40.799
that takes place

00:15:40.799 --> 00:15:42.799
and you see how that they are sent

00:15:42.839 --> 00:15:45.599
and we desire to hold the ropes

00:15:45.599 --> 00:15:47.479
and be behind them and pray for them

00:15:47.479 --> 00:15:49.919
and try to encourage them and yes,

00:15:49.919 --> 00:15:52.839
give so that they can have the financial resources

00:15:52.839 --> 00:15:54.559
that are necessary in order to go

00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:57.399
and to preach in those particular areas.

00:15:57.399 --> 00:15:59.119
You understand in many countries of the world,

00:15:59.119 --> 00:16:01.239
in fact, many of our missionaries,

00:16:01.239 --> 00:16:04.239
I've chatted with them personally,

00:16:04.239 --> 00:16:06.319
the countries in which they serve,

00:16:06.319 --> 00:16:09.999
not all of them, but a majority of them,

00:16:09.999 --> 00:16:12.599
you are not permitted to enter into the country

00:16:13.359 --> 00:16:17.119
unless you can prove that you have enough financial backing

00:16:17.119 --> 00:16:20.599
that you will not be dependent upon their society.

00:16:21.719 --> 00:16:24.159
Before you can ever get any entrance into the country,

00:16:24.159 --> 00:16:25.999
you must be able to prove

00:16:25.999 --> 00:16:28.959
that you're not going to take any of the jobs

00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:32.999
that are supposed to be for their people of that country.

00:16:32.999 --> 00:16:34.119
It's how it works.

00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:35.639
I know it doesn't work that way in America,

00:16:35.639 --> 00:16:36.799
I understand that.

00:16:38.199 --> 00:16:40.079
But that's how it works in a lot of these countries

00:16:40.079 --> 00:16:41.719
where these missionaries serve.

00:16:41.719 --> 00:16:43.239
Because the countries are saying,

00:16:43.239 --> 00:16:46.919
no, we don't want you to come here and take a job

00:16:46.919 --> 00:16:50.959
that could be for someone from a national.

00:16:50.959 --> 00:16:53.399
And so the only way we're gonna grant you permission

00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:57.559
to come here is if you have the financial wherewithal

00:16:57.559 --> 00:17:00.799
to sustain yourself independent

00:17:01.879 --> 00:17:05.199
of anything that you would receive from our country.

00:17:05.199 --> 00:17:07.799
So that's why missionaries go to all these churches

00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:11.239
and try to raise support.

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:12.079
Brother Michael told us

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:13.479
about a brand new missionary this morning.

00:17:13.479 --> 00:17:15.319
I don't know the fella, I've never heard of the fella

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:18.679
until I read the email last week from Brother Hamilton.

00:17:18.679 --> 00:17:22.279
But what a blessing to think about a new servant of the Lord

00:17:22.279 --> 00:17:25.759
that God called that's gonna go out and raise support.

00:17:25.759 --> 00:17:27.639
When we pick these missionaries up for support,

00:17:27.639 --> 00:17:31.079
it's more than just that we're gonna send them money

00:17:31.079 --> 00:17:32.879
monthly, that's part of it.

00:17:32.879 --> 00:17:36.239
That's how today in our modern society

00:17:36.239 --> 00:17:40.159
and the cultures and the climate in which we must deal,

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:42.519
that's how they have to go.

00:17:42.519 --> 00:17:44.519
But it's so much more than just money.

00:17:44.519 --> 00:17:45.719
Every missionary that I know,

00:17:45.719 --> 00:17:47.799
every missionary that's on our board,

00:17:47.799 --> 00:17:50.319
they would tell you as they have told me,

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:52.439
and many of them have stood on this platform

00:17:52.439 --> 00:17:54.079
and they've said it publicly,

00:17:54.079 --> 00:17:56.319
more than your money, we need your prayers.

00:17:57.599 --> 00:17:58.439
Now they need the money.

00:17:58.439 --> 00:18:00.159
If they don't have the money, they can't go.

00:18:00.159 --> 00:18:01.919
I've already explained that.

00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:05.439
But oh, how they need the prayers of God's people.

00:18:05.439 --> 00:18:07.599
That's why we have these missionary directory booklets

00:18:07.599 --> 00:18:08.959
that we put together.

00:18:08.959 --> 00:18:10.199
That's why we update those.

00:18:10.199 --> 00:18:13.439
That's why Deborah spent time to put the format together

00:18:13.439 --> 00:18:15.039
and we pay to have them print it,

00:18:15.039 --> 00:18:17.839
to get a resource into the hands of the members

00:18:17.839 --> 00:18:19.599
of our church and the attenders of our church.

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:20.439
Why?

00:18:20.439 --> 00:18:23.319
So that we can pray for our missionaries.

00:18:23.319 --> 00:18:25.239
I sent out that email on Thursday evening

00:18:25.239 --> 00:18:27.519
about Brother Day Carvalho,

00:18:27.519 --> 00:18:29.559
and I got a response from one of our members

00:18:29.559 --> 00:18:30.479
on Friday morning saying,

00:18:30.479 --> 00:18:33.880
you know, God put him on my heart yesterday.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.199
And I was praying for him in the afternoon.

00:18:35.199 --> 00:18:36.519
I don't know why God put him on my heart,

00:18:36.519 --> 00:18:38.519
but I was praying for him.

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:42.199
They were gonna send an email to Mrs. Day Carvalho

00:18:42.199 --> 00:18:43.239
to try to encourage her.

00:18:43.239 --> 00:18:44.599
As soon as I received the email,

00:18:44.599 --> 00:18:46.440
I responded to Mrs. Day Carvalho.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.599
I wanted to alert the church family.

00:18:48.599 --> 00:18:49.440
Why?

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.959
So that we can pray.

00:18:50.959 --> 00:18:51.799
Why?

00:18:51.799 --> 00:18:52.719
Because God answers prayer.

00:18:53.679 --> 00:18:57.199
And we think about the opportunity that we have,

00:18:57.199 --> 00:18:59.919
we understand how shall they preach except they be sent,

00:18:59.919 --> 00:19:03.320
that we have this privilege of being part

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.919
of that sending process.

00:19:05.959 --> 00:19:07.959
Being one of those churches

00:19:07.959 --> 00:19:11.399
that is partnered together with these missionaries

00:19:11.399 --> 00:19:15.239
to see them go to the place where God has called them.

00:19:15.239 --> 00:19:17.000
And then as they go, what do they go to do?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.239
They go to preach.

00:19:19.239 --> 00:19:20.839
They go to preach the gospel.

00:19:20.839 --> 00:19:21.839
And then all of a sudden,

00:19:21.839 --> 00:19:23.959
people that have never heard,

00:19:23.959 --> 00:19:26.639
in verse number 14, the last question,

00:19:26.639 --> 00:19:28.839
they now have a preacher.

00:19:28.839 --> 00:19:31.479
And the preacher comes in and he begins to preach.

00:19:31.479 --> 00:19:34.199
They've never heard this message.

00:19:34.199 --> 00:19:38.239
They've been blinded by the religious world system.

00:19:38.239 --> 00:19:41.359
They've been blinded by the culture in which they're living.

00:19:41.359 --> 00:19:44.719
They have state religious organizations

00:19:44.719 --> 00:19:47.839
and state-run, government-run churches

00:19:47.839 --> 00:19:49.639
and all of these fields

00:19:49.639 --> 00:19:52.639
and all of the darkness and the blindness.

00:19:52.639 --> 00:19:55.479
And a preacher shows up and begins to preach.

00:19:55.479 --> 00:19:56.320
Why?

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.279
Because he's been sent.

00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:59.079
The family's been sent.

00:19:59.079 --> 00:19:59.919
And now...

00:19:59.919 --> 00:20:01.919
The preaching.

00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:04.039
The preaching of let me tell you who God is.

00:20:04.039 --> 00:20:05.459
Let me tell you who Jesus is.

00:20:05.459 --> 00:20:07.719
Let me tell you what Jesus did for you.

00:20:07.719 --> 00:20:10.019
Let me tell you how much God loves you.

00:20:10.019 --> 00:20:11.439
They begin to preach,

00:20:11.439 --> 00:20:13.019
and the Bible tells us

00:20:13.019 --> 00:20:14.679
that now as you think about them

00:20:14.679 --> 00:20:15.759
having a preacher,

00:20:15.759 --> 00:20:18.419
now they can hear.

00:20:18.419 --> 00:20:19.659
And now that they hear,

00:20:19.659 --> 00:20:20.999
remember v. 17,

00:20:20.999 --> 00:20:23.619
so then faith cometh by hearing,

00:20:23.619 --> 00:20:25.919
and hearing by the Word of God.

00:20:25.919 --> 00:20:27.719
So now they're hearing.

00:20:27.719 --> 00:20:29.039
The faith is there.

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:31.239
And the Bible tells us in v. 14,

00:20:31.239 --> 00:20:32.859
how shall they believe in Him

00:20:32.859 --> 00:20:35.039
of whom they have not heard?

00:20:35.039 --> 00:20:36.159
Well, now they're hearing,

00:20:36.159 --> 00:20:37.279
so now they can believe.

00:20:37.279 --> 00:20:39.699
What is faith? Believing.

00:20:39.699 --> 00:20:41.539
Believing.

00:20:41.539 --> 00:20:43.199
And so now, obviously,

00:20:43.199 --> 00:20:44.579
I wish 100% of the people

00:20:44.579 --> 00:20:46.079
that heard the Gospel got saved.

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:48.239
We know that's not the case.

00:20:48.239 --> 00:20:51.079
In fact, I told an individual yesterday,

00:20:51.079 --> 00:20:52.619
I cannot say it in the same way

00:20:52.619 --> 00:20:53.999
that the Apostle Paul said it

00:20:53.999 --> 00:20:55.279
in Acts 20,

00:20:55.279 --> 00:20:57.159
that I'm free from the blood of all men.

00:20:57.159 --> 00:20:58.279
I can't say that.

00:20:58.279 --> 00:20:59.479
And I believe that he looks at that

00:20:59.479 --> 00:21:00.779
from the parallel truth

00:21:00.779 --> 00:21:01.979
in the book of Ezekiel,

00:21:01.979 --> 00:21:03.519
and Ezekiel being a watchman,

00:21:03.519 --> 00:21:04.639
and so on and so forth,

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:05.639
in chapter 3,

00:21:05.639 --> 00:21:07.439
and I think in chapter 33.

00:21:07.439 --> 00:21:08.779
And you find there,

00:21:08.779 --> 00:21:10.139
but I told this individual,

00:21:10.139 --> 00:21:11.139
I said, listen,

00:21:11.139 --> 00:21:12.139
I just want you to know

00:21:12.139 --> 00:21:13.639
that personally between you and I,

00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:15.639
I can say that your blood

00:21:15.639 --> 00:21:17.639
is not on my hands.

00:21:17.639 --> 00:21:18.639
I have given you

00:21:18.639 --> 00:21:21.019
the truth of the Gospel,

00:21:21.019 --> 00:21:22.139
and I have explained it to you

00:21:22.139 --> 00:21:23.399
to the best of my ability,

00:21:23.399 --> 00:21:24.399
and I've shown you

00:21:24.399 --> 00:21:25.399
the Word of God.

00:21:25.399 --> 00:21:26.399
I've answered your questions.

00:21:26.399 --> 00:21:27.399
The choice is yours.

00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:28.519
The decision is yours,

00:21:28.519 --> 00:21:30.679
but I have a clear conscience.

00:21:30.679 --> 00:21:37.059
I have done what God has called me to do.

00:21:37.059 --> 00:21:39.679
They don't always believe

00:21:39.679 --> 00:21:42.679
on whom they have heard,

00:21:42.679 --> 00:21:45.339
but now they have the opportunity to believe.

00:21:45.339 --> 00:21:47.639
Now the preaching of the Word of God,

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:49.939
now they've heard who Jesus is,

00:21:49.939 --> 00:21:50.939
and it says,

00:21:50.939 --> 00:21:51.939
how shall they call on Him

00:21:51.939 --> 00:21:52.939
in whom they've not believed?

00:21:52.939 --> 00:21:54.439
But you notice the truth of verse 13,

00:21:54.439 --> 00:21:55.559
and what a blessing

00:21:55.559 --> 00:21:56.559
when these missionaries

00:21:56.719 --> 00:21:57.719
have the opportunity

00:21:57.719 --> 00:21:59.719
to see souls saved.

00:21:59.719 --> 00:22:00.719
Lives changed,

00:22:00.719 --> 00:22:01.999
because they went to a place

00:22:01.999 --> 00:22:03.039
because they were sent.

00:22:03.039 --> 00:22:04.639
How shall they preach

00:22:04.639 --> 00:22:06.999
except they be sent?

00:22:06.999 --> 00:22:08.359
Because God's moved and worked

00:22:08.359 --> 00:22:10.319
in your heart and my heart

00:22:10.319 --> 00:22:13.719
to give of our resources,

00:22:13.719 --> 00:22:16.959
understanding that God has blessed us.

00:22:16.959 --> 00:22:17.959
All that we have

00:22:17.959 --> 00:22:19.999
is because of the good hand of God.

00:22:19.999 --> 00:22:20.999
Amen?

00:22:20.999 --> 00:22:21.999
All that we have

00:22:21.999 --> 00:22:24.239
is because of God,

00:22:24.239 --> 00:22:25.799
and that He would privilege us,

00:22:25.799 --> 00:22:27.319
He would allow us

00:22:27.319 --> 00:22:29.239
not only to give of our tithes

00:22:29.239 --> 00:22:30.239
and our offerings,

00:22:30.239 --> 00:22:32.839
but to give to the work of missions,

00:22:32.839 --> 00:22:34.719
and to take a portion

00:22:34.719 --> 00:22:36.039
of what God has blessed us with

00:22:36.039 --> 00:22:37.039
and say,

00:22:37.039 --> 00:22:39.159
I'm going to designate for mission work

00:22:39.159 --> 00:22:41.039
that these funds,

00:22:41.039 --> 00:22:42.359
I'm going to take time

00:22:42.359 --> 00:22:45.719
and pray for these missionaries.

00:22:45.719 --> 00:22:46.719
Paul said this

00:22:46.719 --> 00:22:47.719
in the book of Philippians,

00:22:47.719 --> 00:22:48.719
turn over there if you will,

00:22:48.719 --> 00:22:49.719
Philippians chapter number four,

00:22:49.719 --> 00:22:51.279
and I want you to notice,

00:22:51.279 --> 00:22:53.079
and I'm going to close with this thought

00:22:53.079 --> 00:22:54.479
because we have the opportunity,

00:22:54.479 --> 00:22:55.879
how shall they preach

00:22:55.879 --> 00:22:56.879
except they be sent,

00:22:56.879 --> 00:22:57.879
that we have the opportunity

00:22:57.879 --> 00:22:59.279
because of your giving

00:22:59.279 --> 00:23:01.999
and because of our giving collectively

00:23:01.999 --> 00:23:05.359
to support these missionaries.

00:23:05.359 --> 00:23:06.359
And they're going

00:23:06.359 --> 00:23:07.439
and souls are being saved

00:23:07.439 --> 00:23:08.439
and lives are being changed,

00:23:08.439 --> 00:23:09.679
and I want you to notice

00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:10.679
that Paul was speaking

00:23:10.679 --> 00:23:12.159
at the end of the book of Philippians

00:23:12.159 --> 00:23:13.159
and he's speaking about

00:23:13.159 --> 00:23:14.599
how the church at Philippi

00:23:14.599 --> 00:23:16.919
had communicated with him,

00:23:16.919 --> 00:23:18.119
how they had given to him

00:23:18.119 --> 00:23:20.039
an offering once and again.

00:23:20.039 --> 00:23:21.039
Notice in verse number 14,

00:23:21.039 --> 00:23:23.199
notwithstanding you have well done

00:23:23.239 --> 00:23:24.399
that ye did communicate

00:23:24.399 --> 00:23:25.399
with my affliction.

00:23:25.399 --> 00:23:27.359
Now ye Philippians know also

00:23:27.359 --> 00:23:28.759
that in the beginning of the Gospel

00:23:28.759 --> 00:23:31.039
when I departed from Macedonia,

00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:32.599
no church communicated with me

00:23:32.599 --> 00:23:34.439
as concerning giving and receiving,

00:23:34.439 --> 00:23:35.799
but ye only.

00:23:35.799 --> 00:23:36.879
For even in Thessalonica

00:23:36.879 --> 00:23:38.159
ye sent once and again

00:23:38.159 --> 00:23:39.159
unto my necessity.

00:23:39.159 --> 00:23:40.919
Isn't that a blessing?

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:41.919
The church at Philippi,

00:23:41.919 --> 00:23:43.659
they were investing in something

00:23:43.659 --> 00:23:46.479
beyond themselves.

00:23:46.479 --> 00:23:48.039
They said we want to invest in this.

00:23:48.039 --> 00:23:50.759
We want to be part of this.

00:23:50.759 --> 00:23:51.759
The Bible tells us

00:23:51.879 --> 00:23:52.879
that Paul says,

00:23:52.879 --> 00:23:55.679
not because I desire a gift,

00:23:55.679 --> 00:23:57.279
but notice this,

00:23:57.279 --> 00:23:59.479
but I desire fruit

00:23:59.479 --> 00:24:02.919
that may abound to your account.

00:24:02.919 --> 00:24:03.919
You know, there are going to be

00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:05.919
some people in heaven

00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:07.079
that we're never going to meet

00:24:07.079 --> 00:24:08.879
on this earth.

00:24:08.879 --> 00:24:10.959
But there's a missionary

00:24:10.959 --> 00:24:12.319
that we pray for,

00:24:12.319 --> 00:24:15.199
that we give to,

00:24:15.199 --> 00:24:16.279
that's preached the word of God

00:24:16.279 --> 00:24:18.439
because they've been sent.

00:24:18.439 --> 00:24:20.719
And people have heard.

00:24:20.719 --> 00:24:22.359
People have believed.

00:24:22.359 --> 00:24:24.119
And people have called.

00:24:24.119 --> 00:24:26.039
People have been saved.

00:24:26.039 --> 00:24:28.359
And it's fruit.

00:24:28.359 --> 00:24:31.759
It's fruit on our account.

00:24:31.759 --> 00:24:34.119
Isn't that amazing?

00:24:34.119 --> 00:24:36.679
That's how God's designed it to be.

00:24:36.679 --> 00:24:39.319
And we're co-laborers together

00:24:39.319 --> 00:24:40.999
with God.

00:24:40.999 --> 00:24:42.519
And what a blessing.

00:24:42.519 --> 00:24:43.679
Paul continues and says,

00:24:43.679 --> 00:24:44.999
but I have all and abound

00:24:44.999 --> 00:24:45.999
in verse 18,

00:24:45.999 --> 00:24:46.999
I am full having received

00:24:46.999 --> 00:24:48.239
of Epaphroditus,

00:24:48.239 --> 00:24:49.679
the things which were sent from you

00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:50.679
as an odor of a sweet smell,

00:24:50.679 --> 00:24:51.879
a sacrifice acceptable

00:24:51.879 --> 00:24:53.119
well-pleasingly to God.

00:24:53.119 --> 00:24:56.039
God is pleased with this giving

00:24:56.039 --> 00:24:57.719
of the church of Philippi.

00:24:57.719 --> 00:25:00.239
He's pleased with their investment

00:25:00.239 --> 00:25:02.279
in the work that God has called Paul to.

00:25:02.279 --> 00:25:03.799
And then notice this great promise,

00:25:03.799 --> 00:25:05.919
but my God shall supply

00:25:05.919 --> 00:25:08.159
all your need according to His riches

00:25:08.159 --> 00:25:10.759
in glory by Christ Jesus.

00:25:10.759 --> 00:25:15.319
That's a promise that we can claim.

00:25:15.319 --> 00:25:16.519
As we have the opportunity

00:25:16.519 --> 00:25:18.079
to see these videos this evening,

00:25:18.079 --> 00:25:19.879
I hope that you're encouraged

00:25:19.879 --> 00:25:22.079
about the work of missions,

00:25:22.079 --> 00:25:23.399
the opportunity that we have

00:25:23.399 --> 00:25:24.399
as a local church.

00:25:24.399 --> 00:25:27.119
Yes, we have a missions conference

00:25:27.119 --> 00:25:28.919
that's coming up in May.

00:25:28.919 --> 00:25:30.639
I love missions.

00:25:30.639 --> 00:25:32.639
I love missionaries.

00:25:32.639 --> 00:25:34.119
I love the privilege of being able

00:25:34.119 --> 00:25:36.159
to receive these reports

00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:40.199
and every week having at least four updates,

00:25:40.199 --> 00:25:41.759
one that Brother Michael provides us with

00:25:41.759 --> 00:25:43.279
on Sunday morning,

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:44.519
three on Wednesday evenings

00:25:44.519 --> 00:25:45.679
on our prayer bulletin.

00:25:45.679 --> 00:25:47.719
Man, it's encouraging.

00:25:47.719 --> 00:25:49.319
I hope that we never get bored

00:25:49.319 --> 00:25:51.079
with hearing what God is doing

00:25:51.079 --> 00:25:52.639
and how God is working.

00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:56.079
Because how are they gonna preach

00:25:56.079 --> 00:25:57.839
except they be sent?

00:25:57.839 --> 00:26:01.159
And unless we in churches like ours

00:26:01.159 --> 00:26:04.719
give and pray, the work's not going on.

00:26:04.719 --> 00:26:06.079
They're not getting there.

00:26:07.039 --> 00:26:08.319
And people aren't calling on

00:26:08.319 --> 00:26:10.839
because they've not heard of

00:26:10.839 --> 00:26:12.719
the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:26:12.719 --> 00:26:14.319
It's a great opportunity, great privilege.

00:26:14.319 --> 00:26:17.039
So I hope tonight as we watch these videos

00:26:17.039 --> 00:26:18.519
that you're encouraged,

00:26:18.519 --> 00:26:19.479
that you have the privilege

00:26:19.479 --> 00:26:22.239
of seeing your missions dollars at work.

00:26:22.239 --> 00:26:23.199
Amen?

00:26:23.199 --> 00:26:24.119
So let's pray.

00:26:24.119 --> 00:26:25.319
And then we're gonna look at these videos.

00:26:25.319 --> 00:26:26.639
Father, we love you.

00:26:26.639 --> 00:26:28.199
We thank you for loving us.

00:26:28.199 --> 00:26:29.479
Thank you for the privilege

00:26:29.479 --> 00:26:31.959
of being involved in world missions.

00:26:31.959 --> 00:26:33.879
I thank you for our church.

00:26:33.879 --> 00:26:36.279
Lord, the heart of our church family

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:40.519
to give to the work of missions.

00:26:40.519 --> 00:26:43.639
God, to pray for our missionaries.

00:26:44.759 --> 00:26:46.239
Lord, I pray that you'd continue

00:26:46.239 --> 00:26:47.839
to use our church.

00:26:48.919 --> 00:26:51.079
We thank you for the many, many missionaries

00:26:51.079 --> 00:26:53.759
that you give us the opportunity to support.

00:26:53.759 --> 00:26:55.399
This evening as we take a few moments

00:26:55.399 --> 00:26:56.559
to look at these videos,

00:26:56.559 --> 00:26:58.359
I pray that you'd encourage us.

00:27:00.839 --> 00:27:02.279
I pray, God, that if there'd be one

00:27:02.279 --> 00:27:06.039
that maybe you'd call to the ministry,

00:27:08.199 --> 00:27:09.919
to the work of missions,

00:27:11.359 --> 00:27:13.559
that you'd place your call upon their life,

00:27:13.599 --> 00:27:16.479
that, Lord, they'd respond in obedience.

00:27:17.719 --> 00:27:20.639
Perhaps, Lord, we've not been

00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:23.119
as faithful in giving to missions.

00:27:23.959 --> 00:27:25.679
Perhaps we've not been as faithful

00:27:25.679 --> 00:27:28.519
in praying for our missionaries.

00:27:28.519 --> 00:27:30.999
God, would you help us to increase more and more

00:27:32.959 --> 00:27:34.519
in these areas?

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:36.839
Again, we ask that you'd encourage us,

00:27:37.799 --> 00:27:40.639
help us to rejoice in that which you're doing.

00:27:40.639 --> 00:27:42.799
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:43.679
Amen.
