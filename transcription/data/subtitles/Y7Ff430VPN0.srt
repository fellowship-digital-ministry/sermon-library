1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,119
this evening, turn to the book of Acts, if you will,

2
00:00:02,119 --> 00:00:04,000
Acts chapter number 13.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,519
When you find your spot there in Acts chapter number 13,

4
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:09,979
I want you to stick a bookmark or something in there,

5
00:00:09,979 --> 00:00:11,359
your prayer bulletin,

6
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:13,600
because I really wanna begin this evening

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,720
with a passage that's familiar to us

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,680
in Matthew chapter number nine.

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,440
And so we'll be focusing in Acts 13,

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,139
but I wanna, by way of introduction,

11
00:00:22,139 --> 00:00:24,440
look here at Matthew chapter number nine.

12
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,920
So once you've found your place in Acts 13,

13
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,559
turn back to Matthew nine, if you will.

14
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,479
I mentioned during the announcements

15
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:34,240
that our missions conference begins in just 10 days.

16
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,119
I believe that it's a unique privilege

17
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,479
that we have to be involved in world missions,

18
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,279
to be involved in what God is doing globally.

19
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:45,599
I know that we often share with you updates

20
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:46,639
from our missionaries,

21
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:48,560
and on Wednesday evenings,

22
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,919
on the back of our prayer bulletin,

23
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:52,900
we every week have three updates,

24
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,240
and it's a joy to be able to hear what God is doing.

25
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,319
I had the privilege yesterday

26
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:59,560
of being at a pastor's meeting,

27
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,159
and while I was at that pastor's meeting,

28
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:04,739
we got to hear from three church planters,

29
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,839
and then from a fourth man

30
00:01:06,839 --> 00:01:08,959
who's just started a church as well,

31
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:11,000
and he's just moving forward.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,760
We really didn't know him,

33
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,440
just being introduced to him,

34
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,680
and it's exciting to see some young guys

35
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,819
that are going to some new locations and planning churches,

36
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:22,000
and you think about missions,

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,940
not only foreign, but even domestic,

38
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,839
and thinking about the privilege of being involved

39
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:28,360
in what God is doing,

40
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,519
and that is that we're reaching the world with the gospel.

41
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,519
In Matthew chapter number nine,

42
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,680
the passage is familiar to us.

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,720
It's the latter part of this passage of Scripture,

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,680
and I want you to notice in verse number 35

45
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,559
that the Bible says this,

46
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:45,959
that Jesus went about all the cities and villages,

47
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,319
teaching in their synagogues,

48
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:50,260
and preaching the gospel of the kingdom,

49
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,800
and healing every sickness and every disease

50
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,699
among the people.

51
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,739
And then I want you to notice in verse 36,

52
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:00,980
the Bible says, but when he saw the multitudes,

53
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,739
he was moved with compassion on them.

54
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:05,099
Why was it?

55
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:07,699
We see that he's moved with compassion

56
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:08,820
because of what he saw,

57
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,339
and you notice the Scriptures tell us

58
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,179
at the end of verse number 36 what it was.

59
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:16,100
He saw this multitude of people,

60
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,899
the multitudes as it says,

61
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:20,139
and it says because they fainted

62
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:25,139
and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd.

63
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:28,699
So the Lord Jesus Christ, as he's going,

64
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:31,020
it says that he went in all the cities and villages,

65
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,899
as he's going, teaching and preaching and healing,

66
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:35,460
he sees the multitudes

67
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,220
and he's moved with compassion on them.

68
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:42,139
And then he turns to his disciples.

69
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:44,699
In verse 37 and verse 38,

70
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:47,300
we see that he turns to his disciples

71
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,220
and he says something to the disciples

72
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,740
that is very familiar to us.

73
00:02:51,779 --> 00:02:53,779
And first in verse number 37,

74
00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:57,139
he informs his disciples of the condition.

75
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:00,539
Notice the Bible says that then saith he,

76
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:02,619
the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

77
00:03:02,619 --> 00:03:04,139
unto his disciples,

78
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:06,139
notice what he informed them of,

79
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:11,139
the harvest truly is plenteous,

80
00:03:11,619 --> 00:03:13,500
but the laborers are few.

81
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:16,139
This is the condition.

82
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:20,860
And Jesus is informing his disciples of this condition.

83
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,619
And he says that the harvest truly is plenteous,

84
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,860
but the laborers are few.

85
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,940
This was true at this moment

86
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,100
because we know that our Lord is truthful

87
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,380
and it was absolutely accurate

88
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,300
as he made this declaration

89
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,699
and informing the disciples

90
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:43,860
as to the condition of the people.

91
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,979
We find that I believe this evening

92
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:47,259
that we could still,

93
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:48,820
as we look at the condition

94
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,339
that was presented to these disciples,

95
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:54,500
that we still today could say

96
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,699
that the harvest truly is plenteous,

97
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:59,300
but the laborers are few.

98
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:03,740
After Jesus informed,

99
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,500
we find that he then commands them.

100
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,100
Notice what it is in verse 38.

101
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,820
He says, pray ye therefore,

102
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,139
the Lord of the harvest,

103
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:18,619
that he will send forth laborers

104
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:20,739
into his harvest.

105
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:23,140
And I find the instruction that is given,

106
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,980
the information in verse 37,

107
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,459
followed by the instruction

108
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:29,420
and the direction, the command to pray

109
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,540
in verse number 38.

110
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,739
And I wonder this evening

111
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:37,700
how often, if we were to evaluate our prayer lives

112
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,540
and our prayer time,

113
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,899
I wonder how often we are praying

114
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:43,140
that the Lord of the harvest

115
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,260
would send forth laborers into his harvest.

116
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,260
I believe that's a unique privilege of ours

117
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,500
as the people of God to serve God.

118
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,700
And it's extremely rewarding

119
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,019
when you see God call people to the ministry.

120
00:04:58,019 --> 00:04:59,059
And we find that God

121
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:00,940
is still calling people to the ministry.

122
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,579
The harvest is plenteous,

123
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:03,660
but the laborers are few,

124
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,619
but yet we find that he's calling

125
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:09,179
and he's sending forth laborers into his harvest.

126
00:05:09,179 --> 00:05:11,100
As in our minds and in my mind

127
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,859
over the next couple of weeks,

128
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:15,459
10 days as we prepare for our missions conference.

129
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,579
And I think it's always important

130
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:21,380
as we have special events on our calendar

131
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,739
for us to be prepared,

132
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,299
not only mentally and physically,

133
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:26,299
but spiritually prepared

134
00:05:26,299 --> 00:05:28,540
for that which we're embarking upon.

135
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,700
We're gonna have a missions conference.

136
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,339
I wanna preach some messages on missions

137
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:32,420
and Lord willing,

138
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,019
try to get our heart prepared and ready

139
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:36,500
for that which we will receive

140
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,940
during that particular conference.

141
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,940
We have revival meeting in the fall.

142
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,059
I seek the face of the Lord

143
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:43,459
with regard to messages

144
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,700
in advance of those special meetings

145
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,540
that I could preach

146
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,299
so that we could be prepared

147
00:05:48,299 --> 00:05:50,380
for the meeting that is at hand.

148
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,700
And this evening,

149
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,940
we see this instruction

150
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,299
in Matthew chapter number nine.

151
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:57,339
And now I want you to turn to the Acts chapter 13

152
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:00,459
and really the text for our message this evening.

153
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:02,299
And if you're taking notes,

154
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:05,459
I've simply entitled the message this evening,

155
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:09,100
sent forth, sent forth.

156
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,779
We're looking at Acts 13 verses one through 12.

157
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:17,579
Lord willing, unless he gives different direction,

158
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:20,459
I will preach the latter part of Acts chapter number 13

159
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:22,420
next Wednesday evening,

160
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,779
excuse me, of Acts chapter 14,

161
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:26,500
the latter part of Acts chapter number 14

162
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,100
next Wednesday evening.

163
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,899
But as we look at the beginning part

164
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:31,059
of Acts chapter number 13,

165
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:32,459
we know that there's a division

166
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,299
in the book of Acts

167
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:34,380
and all that's taking place.

168
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,019
But really I find

169
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:38,339
that as we look at that passage of scripture

170
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:39,459
in Matthew chapter nine,

171
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:41,179
when the Lord sees the multitudes

172
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:42,700
and he's moved with compassion,

173
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,459
he informs his servants, the disciples,

174
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:48,540
that the harvest truly is plenteous,

175
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,859
the laborers are few.

176
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:50,899
And then he commands them,

177
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:53,299
he instructs them to pray.

178
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:54,299
And he instructs them to pray

179
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:56,739
that he would send forth laborers.

180
00:06:56,739 --> 00:06:58,579
And we find here in Acts chapter number 13

181
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:00,339
that they were sent forth.

182
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:03,019
And what a blessing to see how God is working

183
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:04,579
in and through his church.

184
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:06,260
As we begin Acts 13,

185
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,420
we find that we're dealing with the church in Antioch.

186
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,019
And you notice that the Bible says this

187
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:13,059
in verse number one of Acts 13.

188
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:15,299
Now, there were in the church

189
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:19,540
that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers,

190
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,019
as Barnabas and Simeon,

191
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:22,019
that was called Niger,

192
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:24,420
and Lucius of Cyrene and Manaan,

193
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,980
which had been brought up with Herod the Tetrarch and Saul.

194
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,420
Notice verse two,

195
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:35,059
the Bible says as they ministered to the Lord and fasted.

196
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:37,459
Often we find that throughout the scriptures

197
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:39,619
that in fact, in verse number three,

198
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:41,420
it will mention that they fasted and prayed,

199
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,779
but often we find the connection with fasting and prayer.

200
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:47,500
Some have said of yesteryear

201
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,820
that fasting makes no sense without prayer.

202
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,859
And I think that's a very valid point.

203
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:53,420
And so we find that this church,

204
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,059
the church in Antioch is a church

205
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:57,100
in which they've grown in their ministering.

206
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,339
And you think about the servants of the Lord

207
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:02,540
that God has placed in that particular assembly.

208
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,100
When you look at verse number one

209
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,660
and you find that God is working.

210
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,299
And as we look at this passage of scripture,

211
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:14,059
I find that right away in verses really one through three,

212
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:17,660
then into verse number four, the specifics are given,

213
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,299
but God gives His plan.

214
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,059
If you're taking notes, I would say this,

215
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:23,619
the mission was embraced.

216
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:26,500
We see a church that receives the plan of God.

217
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,980
And as the plan of God is given to this local assembly,

218
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,659
we find that they embrace the mission

219
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,340
that is entrusted to them.

220
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,700
The Bible says in verse number two,

221
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,260
as they ministered to the Lord and fasted,

222
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,099
the Holy Ghost said,

223
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:44,580
notice what is said in verse number two,

224
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,099
separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work

225
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:52,500
whereunto I have called them.

226
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,820
We begin to see in Acts chapter 13

227
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,859
is often referenced and referred to

228
00:08:56,859 --> 00:08:59,179
as being the first missionary journey

229
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:01,659
and appropriately coined as such.

230
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:04,380
And we find that as this first missionary journey

231
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,700
would begin that this church,

232
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,659
they're assembled there in Antioch,

233
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:10,739
they're ministering, they're serving, they're fasting.

234
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:13,979
No doubt they were praying and they were preaching

235
00:09:13,979 --> 00:09:17,020
and the ministry was just thriving.

236
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,780
God was blessing, God was working.

237
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,619
And the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost comes and He says,

238
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:28,460
separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work

239
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,940
whereunto I have called them.

240
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,659
And so we find here right away

241
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:34,659
that God's plan is being revealed.

242
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:37,219
And we find that God's plan is being revealed.

243
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,340
And I said that the mission was embraced

244
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,099
because we see the response in verse number three

245
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:45,059
when the Bible says that when they had fasted and prayed

246
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:47,580
and laid their hands on them,

247
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,460
they sent them away.

248
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,500
There's no discussion with regard

249
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,859
to the place of ministry or leadership

250
00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:58,659
that these individuals had within the church of Antioch

251
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:00,460
and the way in which they needed it.

252
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:07,740
to stay? No, they obeyed the Lord. They obeyed the direction that God is giving. The plan of God is

253
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,940
revealed and we find that it's embraced. We find this evening as we would understand what's

254
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:18,220
happening here in this first missionary journey and you look at the next few verses and see the

255
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,500
places in which they went, you will find that as God's plan is revealed, you will find that God's

256
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:33,900
plan always fulfills God's purpose. Back in Acts 1, in verse 8, you find that the record,

257
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,460
if you will, of the Great Commission is listed for us here in the book of Acts. We find it in

258
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:43,660
all of the Gospels and then here in the book of Acts as well. And you find that Jesus, before he

259
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,940
ascended to heaven, said this, but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon

260
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:54,860
you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and

261
00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:02,140
under the uttermost part of the earth. In Acts 13, when we find that the Holy Spirit of God

262
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:07,980
comes to this body of believers and says, separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work

263
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,500
wherein to have called them, we see God's plan being revealed but it's fulfilling his purpose.

264
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:20,380
We find that God had allowed for the Gospel to, of course, be there in Jerusalem. And as you think

265
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,380
about Acts 1-8, as we just read it, and you think about the divisions that are given,

266
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:31,020
and you think about Acts 2-7 dealing with the Gospel being there in Jerusalem. And then as

267
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:36,940
you go and you move forward and you look at chapters 8-12, I mentioned, I referenced Acts 8-4

268
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,740
on Sunday evening, that then they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the

269
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:49,340
Word. And as we look at Acts 8-12, you begin to see how that they were scattered abroad and the

270
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:59,180
Gospel goes into Judea and into Samaria. And as you enter into Acts 13, and I believe from Acts

271
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:06,380
13 all the way to the present day, we find that God is fulfilling his plan to get the Gospel to

272
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:14,620
the uttermost. It begins, though, really in Acts 13. As they had been in Jerusalem, they'd been in

273
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,980
Judea and Samaria, and now we find that Paul and Barnabas are going to be separated, they're going

274
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:27,820
to be sent out, and the Gospel is going to now be preached to the world. We find that it would begin

275
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,660
and it would spread. We understand that as we read through the missionary journeys that are

276
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,740
recorded in the book of Acts, that there would be churches that would be established in this

277
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:42,060
particular missionary journey. They go to the region of Galatia, and we find that the particular

278
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,060
cities, and we'll look at it in just a few moments, that they go to, and the churches that are

279
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:51,260
established, you read the book of Galatians, and you find that that book is written to the churches

280
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:56,220
that are in Galatia. How did they get there? It's a result of this first missionary journey.

281
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:03,980
It's a result of God sending forth laborers. Somebody, as we look at the pattern and the

282
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,820
blueprint that is given, if you will, in Matthew 9, he said that they were to pray to the Lord of

283
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:16,860
the harvest that he would send forth laborers, and we find that here in Acts 13, they're sent forth.

284
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:22,300
The Holy Spirit of God comes, and he says, separate me, Barnabas, and Saul for the work

285
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,900
wherein to have called them, and you notice at the end of verse number three, it says, and then

286
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:34,940
they sent them away. Verse four, so they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed

287
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:40,780
unto Seleucia, and from thence they sailed to Cyprus, and when they were at Salamis, notice,

288
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:47,100
they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews, and they had also John to their

289
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:54,940
minister, and so we find that they go forth, and the purpose of this mission was no doubt embraced,

290
00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:01,260
and it was to carry forth the gospel, the word of God, and as we would understand God's plan being

291
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:06,940
revealed to the church here in Antioch, and we'd understand the way in which his plan fulfills his

292
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:12,940
purpose, we would easily conclude this evening that it's always best for the people of God

293
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:21,980
to embrace the plan of God. God's plan is perfect. Amen? I've been asked many times over the years

294
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,220
about the individual in some remote part of the world that's never heard the gospel,

295
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:34,620
and what happens to that individual when they die. I'm not sure if you've ever received that

296
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:40,380
question, but on a number of occasions, I have received that question. It is very interesting

297
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,100
if you were to study church history or to study missiology, and you'd understand how that there

298
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:51,660
were many, many references throughout history of missionaries showing up to particular fields and

299
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:57,100
finding of the people there, how that they were praying that if there's a God, would you send

300
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:03,580
somebody so that we'd understand the truth, and you can read wonderful accounts and testimonies

301
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:11,580
of how God has worked and moved. But the reality is that the problem that many people seek to

302
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:19,020
point out in asking that question is they seek to put some sort of blame upon God

303
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,940
for somebody spending eternity in the lake of fire that's in a remote location that never heard

304
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:30,540
the gospel. But really, the responsibility falls squarely on the shoulders of the church,

305
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:39,900
because God's plan has been clearly given. It's that God's plan must be embraced by God's people,

306
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:48,620
and when God's plan is embraced by the people of God, we find that God will work as he promises to

307
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:55,340
do so. And as we look at this passage of Scripture and we begin to think about the progression

308
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,500
through the next several chapters of the book of Acts, and then really looking through all of

309
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:08,940
the history up until even present day, you begin to see how God works and what God does and how

310
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:15,660
God's plan, when it's embraced, is fulfilled in bringing forth his purpose, and churches

311
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:22,140
being established all over the world, and people being saved. And it's a wonderful thing. There's

312
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:29,740
so often that individuals and perhaps groups of individuals would like to sit around and have

313
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,620
discussions, roundtable discussions, on what are we going to do to reach the world, and what are

314
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,500
we going to do to, you know, reach seven and a half billion people, and so on and so forth. And

315
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:45,580
the reality is that we really don't need to have any roundtable discussions. We really just need

316
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:52,300
to do what God told us to do. Amen? Because when we actively, each and every one of us, fulfill

317
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,740
the purpose and the plan that God has for us, and we're all in it together. Listen, the church in

318
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:04,460
Antioch had a vital part in this. And then there were individuals, Paul and Barnabas, and then John

319
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:10,780
has mentioned that was going as their minister. They had a vital part, but each person doing their

320
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:18,380
part, bringing to pass the plan of God, and bringing honor and glory to God. And we find here

321
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:24,460
that it is absolutely imperative that we understand that it is God's plan that must be

322
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:30,940
embraced. I'm not suggesting that we don't share some ideas and deal with some maybe approach and

323
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:37,580
methodology, if you will, but the unfortunate thing is there are times in which we can spend so much

324
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:45,340
time talking about doing something that we never actually do it. And that's not just the fault of a

325
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:51,900
church. That really can be found in any arena of life. People just stand around and talk about doing

326
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,900
something, and it's like, you just need to get busy doing it, you know? And this thing isn't

327
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,620
going to, it's not going to happen on its own. It's not going to just, you know, be fixed. You got to do it.

328
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:07,740
And so we know that God has given a plan, and so we see the mission is embraced.

329
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,380
Number two, if you will, the mission field was evangelized. You find that in verse number five,

330
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,340
and then we'll look at a verse in chapter number 14, but in verse number five, right in the middle

331
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:23,660
of the verse there, it says they preached the Word of God. They preached the Word of God. They understood

332
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,780
what they were being sent forth to do. They understood that they had a purpose, a very specific

333
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:34,619
purpose, and they were being sent forth to preach the Word of God. We find that in Acts chapter

334
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:38,619
number 14, and we'll come back and finish up through verse number 12 of Acts 13, but I want

335
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:43,580
you to just for a moment look at Acts 14 and verse number 7, and here the Bible is telling us about

336
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:50,860
when they were, they fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lyconia, that it says in verse number

337
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:59,740
seven, and there they preached the gospel. If I could quickly go through here this 13th chapter

338
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:04,780
and really understand what's taking place, and we find that in verse number five, the Bible tells us

339
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:10,220
specifically the region at the end of verse number four, and from thence they sailed to Cyprus,

340
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,619
and when they were at Salamis, they preached the Word of God in the synagogues of the Jews,

341
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,540
and they had also John to their minister, and so the Bible begins to tell us here in verses

342
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:25,900
five through twelve about the ministry there on the island of Cyprus, and they preached the Word.

343
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:31,660
It says, when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer,

344
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:38,300
a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bargesas, which was with the deputy of the country,

345
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:44,619
Sergius Paulus, a prudent man. Notice when it says, who called for Barnabas and Saul

346
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:52,220
and desired to hear the Word of God. You wonder why God sent them to where He sent them?

347
00:19:53,900 --> 00:20:00,220
The Bible tells us here that there's a man there that desired to hear the Word of God.

348
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,220
What a blessing.

349
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,220
The Bible says that there's always going to be opposition.

350
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,220
The Bible records the opposition, but here the Bible says in verse 8,

351
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,220
But Elamist, the sorcerer, for so is his name by interpretation,

352
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,220
withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.

353
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,220
There's always opposition.

354
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,220
There is a spiritual battle that is raging.

355
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,220
And as the people of God seek to embrace the plan of God

356
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,220
and fulfill the mission that has been assigned to us,

357
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,220
we find that it will be met with opposition.

358
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,220
Does it mean that we just give up?

359
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,220
Say, well, I guess, you know, we tried.

360
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,220
We did the best we could, didn't we?

361
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,220
Here the Bible says that they were met with opposition,

362
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,220
and then in verse 9,

363
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,220
Then Saul, who also is called Paul,

364
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,220
filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,

365
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,220
and said, O fool of all subtlety and all mischief,

366
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,220
thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness,

367
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,220
hope thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord.

368
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,220
And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee,

369
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,220
and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season.

370
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,220
And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness,

371
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,220
and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.

372
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,220
That's an amazing sight, is it not?

373
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,220
The Bible says, Then the deputy, verse number 12,

374
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,220
When he saw what was done,

375
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,220
believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.

376
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,220
As we begin to look at Acts 13

377
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,220
and kind of break it up very quickly this evening

378
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,220
and just briefly examine this passage of Scripture,

379
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,220
we find that as the mission that was assigned

380
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,220
to the church here in Antioch,

381
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,220
as that plan was embraced,

382
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,220
that really we find the evangelization

383
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,220
of this region of the world in which they are sent to,

384
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,220
and it begins with the island of Cyprus.

385
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,220
But as we go further into the chapter,

386
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,220
beginning in verse number 13

387
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,220
and really going through Acts 14 and verse number 20,

388
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,220
you find that it then goes to the region of Galatia.

389
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,220
And I mentioned that a few moments ago

390
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,220
when you read the book of Galatians,

391
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,220
you find that it says in the beginning,

392
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,220
opening verses unto the churches of Galatia.

393
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,220
It's not written to the church of Galatia

394
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,220
because there were multiple churches there.

395
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,220
And we find that here in Acts 13 and 14,

396
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,220
as you study this first missionary journey,

397
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,220
that you see how the gospel arrived

398
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,220
into those particular regions.

399
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,220
You find that it's there in Acts 13 and verse number 14.

400
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,220
It says, But when they departed from Perga,

401
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,220
they came to Antioch in Pisidia,

402
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,220
and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day,

403
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,220
and sat down.

404
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,220
And as they went in, the Bible says

405
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,220
that they were reading the law,

406
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,220
following the normal process of what would happen.

407
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,220
And then there were some that said,

408
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,220
Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation

409
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,220
for the people, say on.

410
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,220
Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hands,

411
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:50,220
said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.

412
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,220
And Paul begins to preach, and what does he preach?

413
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,220
He preaches the gospel of Jesus Christ.

414
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,220
You can read through, and you can find

415
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,220
that in verse number 28, he deals with the death of Christ.

416
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,220
In verse number 29, he deals with the burial of Christ.

417
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,220
In verse 30, he deals with the resurrection of Christ.

418
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,220
What is the gospel?

419
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,220
It is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

420
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,220
It is the good news. Amen?

421
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,220
We find that's exactly what Paul preaches.

422
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,220
They come to this first city, Antioch and Pisidia,

423
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,220
and we find that he preaches the word of God.

424
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,220
From there, they go to Iconium,

425
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,220
according to what we see in Acts 14.

426
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,220
In verse number 1, it says,

427
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,220
And it came to pass in Iconium.

428
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,220
Why did they leave?

429
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,220
Why was it that they moved on?

430
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,220
Well, in verse number 50 of Acts 13, it says,

431
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,220
But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women

432
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,220
and the chief men of the city,

433
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,220
and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas,

434
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:50,220
and expelled them out of their coast.

435
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,220
But here's the amazing thing.

436
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,220
There were some people that got saved in Antioch and Pisidia.

437
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,220
And as those people got saved,

438
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,220
there was a church that was established there.

439
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,220
We find that Paul and those that were traveling with him,

440
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,220
Paul and Barnabas, we find that they depart,

441
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,220
and they now come to Iconium.

442
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,220
And now, as they would be there in Iconium,

443
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,220
they would have the opportunity,

444
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,220
as God tells us in verse 7,

445
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,220
that there they preached the gospel.

446
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,220
And the Bible tells us in verse number 3,

447
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,220
that they were, look at what it says,

448
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,220
Long time therefore abode they,

449
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,220
speaking boldly in the Lord.

450
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,220
And so they're there preaching the gospel,

451
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,220
and now there's another city, another group of people,

452
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,220
that are being confronted with the gospel

453
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,220
where a church is going to be established.

454
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,220
We find that the people of Iconium,

455
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,220
before long, they wanted to get rid of these guys as well.

456
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,220
We find that the Bible tells us in verse number 17,

457
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,220
Nevertheless, he left not himself without witness,

458
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,220
and that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven,

459
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,220
and fruitful seasons, filling all our hearts

460
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,220
with food and gladness.

461
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,220
And with these sayings, scarce restrained they the people,

462
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,220
that they had not done sacrifice unto them.

463
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,220
But notice in verse number 19,

464
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,220
And there came thither certain Jews from where?

465
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,220
From Antioch and Iconium.

466
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,220
And it says that they came,

467
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,220
and they persuaded the people,

468
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,220
and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city,

469
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,220
supposing he had been dead.

470
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,220
Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him,

471
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,220
he rose up and came into the city,

472
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,220
and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.

473
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,220
And I want you to just think about this for just a moment.

474
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,220
We understand the mission, we understand the focus,

475
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,220
and we understand what's taking place,

476
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,220
and here as we see the progression and what's taking place,

477
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,220
and you understand the persecution

478
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,220
and that which they're dealing with,

479
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,220
and you find that the Bible tells us in verse number 20

480
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,220
that the next day they departed with Barnabas to Derbe,

481
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,220
and it says in verse 21,

482
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,220
And when they had preached the gospel to that city,

483
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,220
and had taught many,

484
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,220
they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch.

485
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,220
I just want you to think here this evening

486
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,220
about this first missionary journey,

487
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,220
and as we consider the truth

488
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,220
of what Jesus said to the disciples in Matthew 9,

489
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,220
and couple it with this passage in Acts 13,

490
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,220
When Jesus said to the disciples,

491
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,220
he was moved with compassion, why?

492
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,220
Because he saw the multitudes,

493
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,220
that they were as sheep scattered without a shepherd.

494
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,220
And he says to them,

495
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:27,220
Truly the harvest is plenteous, but the laborers are few.

496
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,220
Pray ye therefore that the Lord of the harvest

497
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,220
would send forth laborers into his harvest.

498
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,220
And here, they were sent forth.

499
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,220
I believe that beginning here,

500
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,220
all the way to present day,

501
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,220
God is sending forth his laborers.

502
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,220
And we as the people of God need to be praying.

503
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,220
It needs to be part of our daily prayer list, if you will,

504
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:55,220
that we're praying that God would send forth laborers.

505
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:59,220
And then, as God calls, just as he called here

506
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,220
in this passage of scripture, Paul and Barnabas,

507
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,220
the church then has a role in helping

508
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,220
that ministry be fulfilled.

509
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,220
And what a joy.

510
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,220
I understand that God's not going to call all of us.

511
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,220
It would be wonderful if God would call one of us,

512
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,220
some of us, but then those of us

513
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,220
that are still part of this fellowship,

514
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,220
we then can come alongside and assist.

515
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,220
These individuals that will be with us,

516
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,220
that have been with us in the past,

517
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,220
that are missionaries,

518
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:34,220
we find that they are sent out.

519
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,220
They were sitting in a pew, like you are,

520
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,220
at some point in their lives, and God said,

521
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,220
God called them to the ministry, and they prepared,

522
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:47,220
and now they give us an opportunity to partner with them

523
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,220
as they go to the place that they've been assigned to

524
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,220
to carry forth the gospel.

525
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,220
Lord willing, we'll have the opportunity to look

526
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,220
next week at the end of Acts 14.

527
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,220
It's an exciting passage of scripture

528
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,220
because what you find at the end of Acts 14

529
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,220
is the return from this first missionary journey.

530
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,220
And you see as they return,

531
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,220
and just the connection that they have

532
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,220
and all that they discuss,

533
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,220
and what a wonderful blessing it is.

534
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,220
And we find that here, as we would consider

535
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,220
this first missionary journey,

536
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,220
very briefly overviewing chapter 13

537
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,220
and getting into chapter number 14,

538
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:22,220
that really this work was the result

539
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:27,220
of them embracing the mission that was given to them.

540
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:31,220
The assignment, the task that was assigned

541
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,220
there at the beginning of Acts 13.

542
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,220
Because they embraced it,

543
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,220
because they said we're going to fulfill,

544
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,220
we're going to be obedient to the plan

545
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,220
that's been revealed to us,

546
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,220
we then have the privilege of seeing

547
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,220
how the gospel goes forth

548
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,220
and how churches are established.

549
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,220
And it's an absolute blessing to study the word of God

550
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:55,220
and to see how God's plan works.

551
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,220
It shouldn't surprise us, by the way,

552
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,220
that God's plan works, amen?

553
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,220
He's God, of course his plan is going to work.

554
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,220
So we have the privilege of getting in line

555
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,220
and in step with what God has given us to do

556
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,220
and then seeing what only God can do.

557
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,220
Sent forth, he said, pray,

558
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,220
the Lord of the harvest that he would send forth laborers.

559
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,220
I hope that we're praying to that end.

560
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,220
And I hope this evening that as we see

561
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,220
those that would be sent forth,

562
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,220
even as Paul and Barnabas were sent forth,

563
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,220
that we would continue to pray for them

564
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,220
and then be engaged and involved

565
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,220
on how we could support them

566
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,220
in fulfilling the ministry that God has given them specifically.

567
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,220
Let's pray together.

568
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,220
Father, we love you.

569
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,220
We thank you for loving us.

570
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,220
We thank you for the word of God.

571
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,220
What a blessing and privilege it is

572
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:49,220
to read about the instruction

573
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,220
that you gave there to your disciples

574
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,220
in Matthew 9.

575
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,220
We are grateful for the record.

576
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,220
We're moved even as our Savior

577
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,220
was moved with compassion.

578
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:12,420
passion and we are understanding that we're living in a time in which the world is confused

579
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:17,280
and the church has the answers.

580
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,500
God I pray that you would help us even as the church at Antioch there in Acts 13 embraced

581
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,900
the plan that you revealed to them.

582
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,500
I pray God that you would help us.

583
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:33,700
I pray that over the next 10 days as we not only physically and mentally but most importantly

584
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,340
spiritually prepare for our missions conference that it would work in each of our lives.

585
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:46,060
I pray that we would be ready for the meeting that we'll have and that we'll be prepared

586
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:54,300
to receive the challenges that will be delivered.

587
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,220
God we pray that you'd work in our midst and that you alone would be glorified.

588
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,720
We thank you for the privilege of prayer.

589
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,580
We pray that as we now have our time of prayer this evening I pray that you'd bless each

590
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,580
aspect of it.

591
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:11,120
We do thank you for the unique privilege that we have to come boldly before your throne

592
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,220
knowing that you hear and answer.

593
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,620
We pray God that you alone would be glorified for it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
