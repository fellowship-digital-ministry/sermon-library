00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.119
this evening, turn to the book of Acts, if you will,

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:04.000
Acts chapter number 13.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.519
When you find your spot there in Acts chapter number 13,

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:09.979
I want you to stick a bookmark or something in there,

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:11.359
your prayer bulletin,

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:13.600
because I really wanna begin this evening

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.720
with a passage that's familiar to us

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.680
in Matthew chapter number nine.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.440
And so we'll be focusing in Acts 13,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.139
but I wanna, by way of introduction,

00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:24.440
look here at Matthew chapter number nine.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.920
So once you've found your place in Acts 13,

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.559
turn back to Matthew nine, if you will.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.479
I mentioned during the announcements

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:34.240
that our missions conference begins in just 10 days.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.119
I believe that it's a unique privilege

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:39.479
that we have to be involved in world missions,

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:43.279
to be involved in what God is doing globally.

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:45.599
I know that we often share with you updates

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:46.639
from our missionaries,

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:48.560
and on Wednesday evenings,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.919
on the back of our prayer bulletin,

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:52.900
we every week have three updates,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.240
and it's a joy to be able to hear what God is doing.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.319
I had the privilege yesterday

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:59.560
of being at a pastor's meeting,

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.159
and while I was at that pastor's meeting,

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.739
we got to hear from three church planters,

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.839
and then from a fourth man

00:01:06.839 --> 00:01:08.959
who's just started a church as well,

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:11.000
and he's just moving forward.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.760
We really didn't know him,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.440
just being introduced to him,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.680
and it's exciting to see some young guys

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.819
that are going to some new locations and planning churches,

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:22.000
and you think about missions,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.940
not only foreign, but even domestic,

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.839
and thinking about the privilege of being involved

00:01:26.839 --> 00:01:28.360
in what God is doing,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.519
and that is that we're reaching the world with the gospel.

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:33.519
In Matthew chapter number nine,

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:35.680
the passage is familiar to us.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.720
It's the latter part of this passage of Scripture,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.680
and I want you to notice in verse number 35

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.559
that the Bible says this,

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:45.959
that Jesus went about all the cities and villages,

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:47.319
teaching in their synagogues,

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.260
and preaching the gospel of the kingdom,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.800
and healing every sickness and every disease

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.699
among the people.

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:57.739
And then I want you to notice in verse 36,

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:00.980
the Bible says, but when he saw the multitudes,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.739
he was moved with compassion on them.

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:05.099
Why was it?

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:07.699
We see that he's moved with compassion

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:08.820
because of what he saw,

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.339
and you notice the Scriptures tell us

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:14.179
at the end of verse number 36 what it was.

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:16.100
He saw this multitude of people,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.899
the multitudes as it says,

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:20.139
and it says because they fainted

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:25.139
and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd.

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.699
So the Lord Jesus Christ, as he's going,

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:31.020
it says that he went in all the cities and villages,

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.899
as he's going, teaching and preaching and healing,

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:35.460
he sees the multitudes

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.220
and he's moved with compassion on them.

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:42.139
And then he turns to his disciples.

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:44.699
In verse 37 and verse 38,

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:47.300
we see that he turns to his disciples

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.220
and he says something to the disciples

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.740
that is very familiar to us.

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:53.779
And first in verse number 37,

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:57.139
he informs his disciples of the condition.

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.539
Notice the Bible says that then saith he,

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:02.619
the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:04.139
unto his disciples,

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.139
notice what he informed them of,

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:11.139
the harvest truly is plenteous,

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:13.500
but the laborers are few.

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:16.139
This is the condition.

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.860
And Jesus is informing his disciples of this condition.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.619
And he says that the harvest truly is plenteous,

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.860
but the laborers are few.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.940
This was true at this moment

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.100
because we know that our Lord is truthful

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.380
and it was absolutely accurate

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.300
as he made this declaration

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.699
and informing the disciples

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:43.860
as to the condition of the people.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.979
We find that I believe this evening

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:47.259
that we could still,

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:48.820
as we look at the condition

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.339
that was presented to these disciples,

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:54.500
that we still today could say

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.699
that the harvest truly is plenteous,

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.300
but the laborers are few.

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:03.740
After Jesus informed,

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.500
we find that he then commands them.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.100
Notice what it is in verse 38.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.820
He says, pray ye therefore,

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.139
the Lord of the harvest,

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.619
that he will send forth laborers

00:04:18.619 --> 00:04:20.739
into his harvest.

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.140
And I find the instruction that is given,

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.980
the information in verse 37,

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.459
followed by the instruction

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:29.420
and the direction, the command to pray

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.540
in verse number 38.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.739
And I wonder this evening

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:37.700
how often, if we were to evaluate our prayer lives

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.540
and our prayer time,

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.899
I wonder how often we are praying

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:43.140
that the Lord of the harvest

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.260
would send forth laborers into his harvest.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
I believe that's a unique privilege of ours

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.500
as the people of God to serve God.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.700
And it's extremely rewarding

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.019
when you see God call people to the ministry.

00:04:58.019 --> 00:04:59.059
And we find that God

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:00.940
is still calling people to the ministry.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.579
The harvest is plenteous,

00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:03.660
but the laborers are few,

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.619
but yet we find that he's calling

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:09.179
and he's sending forth laborers into his harvest.

00:05:09.179 --> 00:05:11.100
As in our minds and in my mind

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.859
over the next couple of weeks,

00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:15.459
10 days as we prepare for our missions conference.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.579
And I think it's always important

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:21.380
as we have special events on our calendar

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.739
for us to be prepared,

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:24.299
not only mentally and physically,

00:05:24.299 --> 00:05:26.299
but spiritually prepared

00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:28.540
for that which we're embarking upon.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.700
We're gonna have a missions conference.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.339
I wanna preach some messages on missions

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:32.420
and Lord willing,

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.019
try to get our heart prepared and ready

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:36.500
for that which we will receive

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.940
during that particular conference.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.940
We have revival meeting in the fall.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.059
I seek the face of the Lord

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:43.459
with regard to messages

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.700
in advance of those special meetings

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.540
that I could preach

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.299
so that we could be prepared

00:05:48.299 --> 00:05:50.380
for the meeting that is at hand.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.700
And this evening,

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.940
we see this instruction

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.299
in Matthew chapter number nine.

00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:57.339
And now I want you to turn to the Acts chapter 13

00:05:57.339 --> 00:06:00.459
and really the text for our message this evening.

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:02.299
And if you're taking notes,

00:06:02.299 --> 00:06:05.459
I've simply entitled the message this evening,

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:09.100
sent forth, sent forth.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.779
We're looking at Acts 13 verses one through 12.

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:17.579
Lord willing, unless he gives different direction,

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:20.459
I will preach the latter part of Acts chapter number 13

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:22.420
next Wednesday evening,

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.779
excuse me, of Acts chapter 14,

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:26.500
the latter part of Acts chapter number 14

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.100
next Wednesday evening.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.899
But as we look at the beginning part

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:31.059
of Acts chapter number 13,

00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:32.459
we know that there's a division

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:33.299
in the book of Acts

00:06:33.299 --> 00:06:34.380
and all that's taking place.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.019
But really I find

00:06:36.019 --> 00:06:38.339
that as we look at that passage of scripture

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:39.459
in Matthew chapter nine,

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:41.179
when the Lord sees the multitudes

00:06:41.179 --> 00:06:42.700
and he's moved with compassion,

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.459
he informs his servants, the disciples,

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:48.540
that the harvest truly is plenteous,

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.859
the laborers are few.

00:06:49.859 --> 00:06:50.899
And then he commands them,

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:53.299
he instructs them to pray.

00:06:53.299 --> 00:06:54.299
And he instructs them to pray

00:06:54.299 --> 00:06:56.739
that he would send forth laborers.

00:06:56.739 --> 00:06:58.579
And we find here in Acts chapter number 13

00:06:58.579 --> 00:07:00.339
that they were sent forth.

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:03.019
And what a blessing to see how God is working

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:04.579
in and through his church.

00:07:04.579 --> 00:07:06.260
As we begin Acts 13,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.420
we find that we're dealing with the church in Antioch.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.019
And you notice that the Bible says this

00:07:11.019 --> 00:07:13.059
in verse number one of Acts 13.

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:15.299
Now, there were in the church

00:07:15.299 --> 00:07:19.540
that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers,

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.019
as Barnabas and Simeon,

00:07:21.019 --> 00:07:22.019
that was called Niger,

00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:24.420
and Lucius of Cyrene and Manaan,

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.980
which had been brought up with Herod the Tetrarch and Saul.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.420
Notice verse two,

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:35.059
the Bible says as they ministered to the Lord and fasted.

00:07:35.059 --> 00:07:37.459
Often we find that throughout the scriptures

00:07:37.459 --> 00:07:39.619
that in fact, in verse number three,

00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:41.420
it will mention that they fasted and prayed,

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.779
but often we find the connection with fasting and prayer.

00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:47.500
Some have said of yesteryear

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.820
that fasting makes no sense without prayer.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.859
And I think that's a very valid point.

00:07:51.859 --> 00:07:53.420
And so we find that this church,

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.059
the church in Antioch is a church

00:07:55.059 --> 00:07:57.100
in which they've grown in their ministering.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.339
And you think about the servants of the Lord

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:02.540
that God has placed in that particular assembly.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.100
When you look at verse number one

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.660
and you find that God is working.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.299
And as we look at this passage of scripture,

00:08:09.299 --> 00:08:14.059
I find that right away in verses really one through three,

00:08:14.059 --> 00:08:17.660
then into verse number four, the specifics are given,

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.299
but God gives His plan.

00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:22.059
If you're taking notes, I would say this,

00:08:22.059 --> 00:08:23.619
the mission was embraced.

00:08:23.619 --> 00:08:26.500
We see a church that receives the plan of God.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.980
And as the plan of God is given to this local assembly,

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.659
we find that they embrace the mission

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.340
that is entrusted to them.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.700
The Bible says in verse number two,

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.260
as they ministered to the Lord and fasted,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.099
the Holy Ghost said,

00:08:42.099 --> 00:08:44.580
notice what is said in verse number two,

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:49.099
separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work

00:08:49.099 --> 00:08:52.500
whereunto I have called them.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.820
We begin to see in Acts chapter 13

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.859
is often referenced and referred to

00:08:56.859 --> 00:08:59.179
as being the first missionary journey

00:08:59.179 --> 00:09:01.659
and appropriately coined as such.

00:09:01.659 --> 00:09:04.380
And we find that as this first missionary journey

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.700
would begin that this church,

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.659
they're assembled there in Antioch,

00:09:08.659 --> 00:09:10.739
they're ministering, they're serving, they're fasting.

00:09:10.739 --> 00:09:13.979
No doubt they were praying and they were preaching

00:09:13.979 --> 00:09:17.020
and the ministry was just thriving.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.780
God was blessing, God was working.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:24.619
And the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost comes and He says,

00:09:24.619 --> 00:09:28.460
separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:29.940
whereunto I have called them.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.659
And so we find here right away

00:09:31.659 --> 00:09:34.659
that God's plan is being revealed.

00:09:34.659 --> 00:09:37.219
And we find that God's plan is being revealed.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.340
And I said that the mission was embraced

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.099
because we see the response in verse number three

00:09:42.099 --> 00:09:45.059
when the Bible says that when they had fasted and prayed

00:09:45.059 --> 00:09:47.580
and laid their hands on them,

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.460
they sent them away.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.500
There's no discussion with regard

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.859
to the place of ministry or leadership

00:09:55.859 --> 00:09:58.659
that these individuals had within the church of Antioch

00:09:58.659 --> 00:10:00.460
and the way in which they needed it.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:07.740
to stay? No, they obeyed the Lord. They obeyed the direction that God is giving. The plan of God is

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.940
revealed and we find that it's embraced. We find this evening as we would understand what's

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:18.220
happening here in this first missionary journey and you look at the next few verses and see the

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:23.500
places in which they went, you will find that as God's plan is revealed, you will find that God's

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:33.900
plan always fulfills God's purpose. Back in Acts 1, in verse 8, you find that the record,

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:38.460
if you will, of the Great Commission is listed for us here in the book of Acts. We find it in

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:43.660
all of the Gospels and then here in the book of Acts as well. And you find that Jesus, before he

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:48.940
ascended to heaven, said this, but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:54.860
you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and

00:10:54.860 --> 00:11:02.140
under the uttermost part of the earth. In Acts 13, when we find that the Holy Spirit of God

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:07.980
comes to this body of believers and says, separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:13.500
wherein to have called them, we see God's plan being revealed but it's fulfilling his purpose.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:20.380
We find that God had allowed for the Gospel to, of course, be there in Jerusalem. And as you think

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:24.380
about Acts 1-8, as we just read it, and you think about the divisions that are given,

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:31.020
and you think about Acts 2-7 dealing with the Gospel being there in Jerusalem. And then as

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:36.940
you go and you move forward and you look at chapters 8-12, I mentioned, I referenced Acts 8-4

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:41.740
on Sunday evening, that then they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:49.340
Word. And as we look at Acts 8-12, you begin to see how that they were scattered abroad and the

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:59.180
Gospel goes into Judea and into Samaria. And as you enter into Acts 13, and I believe from Acts

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:06.380
13 all the way to the present day, we find that God is fulfilling his plan to get the Gospel to

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:14.620
the uttermost. It begins, though, really in Acts 13. As they had been in Jerusalem, they'd been in

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:19.980
Judea and Samaria, and now we find that Paul and Barnabas are going to be separated, they're going

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:27.820
to be sent out, and the Gospel is going to now be preached to the world. We find that it would begin

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.660
and it would spread. We understand that as we read through the missionary journeys that are

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.740
recorded in the book of Acts, that there would be churches that would be established in this

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:42.060
particular missionary journey. They go to the region of Galatia, and we find that the particular

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:46.060
cities, and we'll look at it in just a few moments, that they go to, and the churches that are

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:51.260
established, you read the book of Galatians, and you find that that book is written to the churches

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:56.220
that are in Galatia. How did they get there? It's a result of this first missionary journey.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:03.980
It's a result of God sending forth laborers. Somebody, as we look at the pattern and the

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:09.820
blueprint that is given, if you will, in Matthew 9, he said that they were to pray to the Lord of

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:16.860
the harvest that he would send forth laborers, and we find that here in Acts 13, they're sent forth.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:22.300
The Holy Spirit of God comes, and he says, separate me, Barnabas, and Saul for the work

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.900
wherein to have called them, and you notice at the end of verse number three, it says, and then

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:34.940
they sent them away. Verse four, so they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:40.780
unto Seleucia, and from thence they sailed to Cyprus, and when they were at Salamis, notice,

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:47.100
they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews, and they had also John to their

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:54.940
minister, and so we find that they go forth, and the purpose of this mission was no doubt embraced,

00:13:54.940 --> 00:14:01.260
and it was to carry forth the gospel, the word of God, and as we would understand God's plan being

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:06.940
revealed to the church here in Antioch, and we'd understand the way in which his plan fulfills his

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:12.940
purpose, we would easily conclude this evening that it's always best for the people of God

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:21.980
to embrace the plan of God. God's plan is perfect. Amen? I've been asked many times over the years

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:28.220
about the individual in some remote part of the world that's never heard the gospel,

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:34.620
and what happens to that individual when they die. I'm not sure if you've ever received that

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:40.380
question, but on a number of occasions, I have received that question. It is very interesting

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:45.100
if you were to study church history or to study missiology, and you'd understand how that there

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:51.660
were many, many references throughout history of missionaries showing up to particular fields and

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:57.100
finding of the people there, how that they were praying that if there's a God, would you send

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:03.580
somebody so that we'd understand the truth, and you can read wonderful accounts and testimonies

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:11.580
of how God has worked and moved. But the reality is that the problem that many people seek to

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:19.020
point out in asking that question is they seek to put some sort of blame upon God

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:24.940
for somebody spending eternity in the lake of fire that's in a remote location that never heard

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:30.540
the gospel. But really, the responsibility falls squarely on the shoulders of the church,

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:39.900
because God's plan has been clearly given. It's that God's plan must be embraced by God's people,

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:48.620
and when God's plan is embraced by the people of God, we find that God will work as he promises to

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:55.340
do so. And as we look at this passage of Scripture and we begin to think about the progression

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:59.500
through the next several chapters of the book of Acts, and then really looking through all of

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:08.940
the history up until even present day, you begin to see how God works and what God does and how

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:15.660
God's plan, when it's embraced, is fulfilled in bringing forth his purpose, and churches

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:22.140
being established all over the world, and people being saved. And it's a wonderful thing. There's

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:29.740
so often that individuals and perhaps groups of individuals would like to sit around and have

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:34.620
discussions, roundtable discussions, on what are we going to do to reach the world, and what are

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:39.500
we going to do to, you know, reach seven and a half billion people, and so on and so forth. And

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:45.580
the reality is that we really don't need to have any roundtable discussions. We really just need

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:52.300
to do what God told us to do. Amen? Because when we actively, each and every one of us, fulfill

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:57.740
the purpose and the plan that God has for us, and we're all in it together. Listen, the church in

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:04.460
Antioch had a vital part in this. And then there were individuals, Paul and Barnabas, and then John

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:10.780
has mentioned that was going as their minister. They had a vital part, but each person doing their

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:18.380
part, bringing to pass the plan of God, and bringing honor and glory to God. And we find here

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:24.460
that it is absolutely imperative that we understand that it is God's plan that must be

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:30.940
embraced. I'm not suggesting that we don't share some ideas and deal with some maybe approach and

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:37.580
methodology, if you will, but the unfortunate thing is there are times in which we can spend so much

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:45.340
time talking about doing something that we never actually do it. And that's not just the fault of a

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:51.900
church. That really can be found in any arena of life. People just stand around and talk about doing

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.900
something, and it's like, you just need to get busy doing it, you know? And this thing isn't

00:17:55.900 --> 00:18:00.620
going to, it's not going to happen on its own. It's not going to just, you know, be fixed. You got to do it.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:07.740
And so we know that God has given a plan, and so we see the mission is embraced.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:12.380
Number two, if you will, the mission field was evangelized. You find that in verse number five,

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:17.340
and then we'll look at a verse in chapter number 14, but in verse number five, right in the middle

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:23.660
of the verse there, it says they preached the Word of God. They preached the Word of God. They understood

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:28.780
what they were being sent forth to do. They understood that they had a purpose, a very specific

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:34.619
purpose, and they were being sent forth to preach the Word of God. We find that in Acts chapter

00:18:34.619 --> 00:18:38.619
number 14, and we'll come back and finish up through verse number 12 of Acts 13, but I want

00:18:38.619 --> 00:18:43.580
you to just for a moment look at Acts 14 and verse number 7, and here the Bible is telling us about

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:50.860
when they were, they fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lyconia, that it says in verse number

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:59.740
seven, and there they preached the gospel. If I could quickly go through here this 13th chapter

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:04.780
and really understand what's taking place, and we find that in verse number five, the Bible tells us

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:10.220
specifically the region at the end of verse number four, and from thence they sailed to Cyprus,

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.619
and when they were at Salamis, they preached the Word of God in the synagogues of the Jews,

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:20.540
and they had also John to their minister, and so the Bible begins to tell us here in verses

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:25.900
five through twelve about the ministry there on the island of Cyprus, and they preached the Word.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:31.660
It says, when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer,

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:38.300
a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bargesas, which was with the deputy of the country,

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:44.619
Sergius Paulus, a prudent man. Notice when it says, who called for Barnabas and Saul

00:19:45.179 --> 00:19:52.220
and desired to hear the Word of God. You wonder why God sent them to where He sent them?

00:19:53.900 --> 00:20:00.220
The Bible tells us here that there's a man there that desired to hear the Word of God.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.220
What a blessing.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.220
The Bible says that there's always going to be opposition.

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.220
The Bible records the opposition, but here the Bible says in verse 8,

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.220
But Elamist, the sorcerer, for so is his name by interpretation,

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.220
withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:17.220
There's always opposition.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:21.220
There is a spiritual battle that is raging.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:25.220
And as the people of God seek to embrace the plan of God

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.220
and fulfill the mission that has been assigned to us,

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.220
we find that it will be met with opposition.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.220
Does it mean that we just give up?

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:36.220
Say, well, I guess, you know, we tried.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.220
We did the best we could, didn't we?

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:43.220
Here the Bible says that they were met with opposition,

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.220
and then in verse 9,

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.220
Then Saul, who also is called Paul,

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.220
filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:52.220
and said, O fool of all subtlety and all mischief,

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.220
thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness,

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.220
hope thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.220
And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee,

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.220
and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.220
And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness,

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:10.220
and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.220
That's an amazing sight, is it not?

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:16.220
The Bible says, Then the deputy, verse number 12,

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.220
When he saw what was done,

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:20.220
believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.220
As we begin to look at Acts 13

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.220
and kind of break it up very quickly this evening

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.220
and just briefly examine this passage of Scripture,

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.220
we find that as the mission that was assigned

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.220
to the church here in Antioch,

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.220
as that plan was embraced,

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.220
that really we find the evangelization

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:40.220
of this region of the world in which they are sent to,

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.220
and it begins with the island of Cyprus.

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.220
But as we go further into the chapter,

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.220
beginning in verse number 13

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:50.220
and really going through Acts 14 and verse number 20,

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.220
you find that it then goes to the region of Galatia.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.220
And I mentioned that a few moments ago

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.220
when you read the book of Galatians,

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:59.220
you find that it says in the beginning,

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:03.220
opening verses unto the churches of Galatia.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.220
It's not written to the church of Galatia

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.220
because there were multiple churches there.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.220
And we find that here in Acts 13 and 14,

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.220
as you study this first missionary journey,

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.220
that you see how the gospel arrived

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.220
into those particular regions.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.220
You find that it's there in Acts 13 and verse number 14.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.220
It says, But when they departed from Perga,

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:25.220
they came to Antioch in Pisidia,

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.220
and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day,

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.220
and sat down.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.220
And as they went in, the Bible says

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.220
that they were reading the law,

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.220
following the normal process of what would happen.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.220
And then there were some that said,

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.220
Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.220
for the people, say on.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.220
Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hands,

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:50.220
said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.220
And Paul begins to preach, and what does he preach?

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:56.220
He preaches the gospel of Jesus Christ.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.220
You can read through, and you can find

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.220
that in verse number 28, he deals with the death of Christ.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.220
In verse number 29, he deals with the burial of Christ.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.220
In verse 30, he deals with the resurrection of Christ.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.220
What is the gospel?

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.220
It is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.220
It is the good news. Amen?

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:17.220
We find that's exactly what Paul preaches.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.220
They come to this first city, Antioch and Pisidia,

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:23.220
and we find that he preaches the word of God.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.220
From there, they go to Iconium,

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.220
according to what we see in Acts 14.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.220
In verse number 1, it says,

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.220
And it came to pass in Iconium.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.220
Why did they leave?

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:36.220
Why was it that they moved on?

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.220
Well, in verse number 50 of Acts 13, it says,

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.220
But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.220
and the chief men of the city,

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.220
and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas,

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:50.220
and expelled them out of their coast.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:52.220
But here's the amazing thing.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:56.220
There were some people that got saved in Antioch and Pisidia.

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.220
And as those people got saved,

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.220
there was a church that was established there.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:04.220
We find that Paul and those that were traveling with him,

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.220
Paul and Barnabas, we find that they depart,

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.220
and they now come to Iconium.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.220
And now, as they would be there in Iconium,

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:14.220
they would have the opportunity,

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.220
as God tells us in verse 7,

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.220
that there they preached the gospel.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.220
And the Bible tells us in verse number 3,

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.220
that they were, look at what it says,

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.220
Long time therefore abode they,

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.220
speaking boldly in the Lord.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.220
And so they're there preaching the gospel,

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.220
and now there's another city, another group of people,

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.220
that are being confronted with the gospel

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:36.220
where a church is going to be established.

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.220
We find that the people of Iconium,

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:41.220
before long, they wanted to get rid of these guys as well.

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:45.220
We find that the Bible tells us in verse number 17,

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.220
Nevertheless, he left not himself without witness,

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.220
and that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven,

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:52.220
and fruitful seasons, filling all our hearts

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:53.220
with food and gladness.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:56.220
And with these sayings, scarce restrained they the people,

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.220
that they had not done sacrifice unto them.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.220
But notice in verse number 19,

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:04.220
And there came thither certain Jews from where?

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.220
From Antioch and Iconium.

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:08.220
And it says that they came,

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.220
and they persuaded the people,

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.220
and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city,

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.220
supposing he had been dead.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.220
Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him,

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.220
he rose up and came into the city,

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:24.220
and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.220
And I want you to just think about this for just a moment.

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:30.220
We understand the mission, we understand the focus,

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.220
and we understand what's taking place,

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:36.220
and here as we see the progression and what's taking place,

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.220
and you understand the persecution

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.220
and that which they're dealing with,

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.220
and you find that the Bible tells us in verse number 20

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:47.220
that the next day they departed with Barnabas to Derbe,

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.220
and it says in verse 21,

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.220
And when they had preached the gospel to that city,

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.220
and had taught many,

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:57.220
they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:00.220
I just want you to think here this evening

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.220
about this first missionary journey,

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.220
and as we consider the truth

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:09.220
of what Jesus said to the disciples in Matthew 9,

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.220
and couple it with this passage in Acts 13,

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:14.220
When Jesus said to the disciples,

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.220
he was moved with compassion, why?

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:17.220
Because he saw the multitudes,

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.220
that they were as sheep scattered without a shepherd.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.220
And he says to them,

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:27.220
Truly the harvest is plenteous, but the laborers are few.

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.220
Pray ye therefore that the Lord of the harvest

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:33.220
would send forth laborers into his harvest.

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:36.220
And here, they were sent forth.

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.220
I believe that beginning here,

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.220
all the way to present day,

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:44.220
God is sending forth his laborers.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.220
And we as the people of God need to be praying.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:51.220
It needs to be part of our daily prayer list, if you will,

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:55.220
that we're praying that God would send forth laborers.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:59.220
And then, as God calls, just as he called here

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.220
in this passage of scripture, Paul and Barnabas,

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.220
the church then has a role in helping

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.220
that ministry be fulfilled.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.220
And what a joy.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.220
I understand that God's not going to call all of us.

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:15.220
It would be wonderful if God would call one of us,

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.220
some of us, but then those of us

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.220
that are still part of this fellowship,

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:24.220
we then can come alongside and assist.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.220
These individuals that will be with us,

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.220
that have been with us in the past,

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.220
that are missionaries,

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:34.220
we find that they are sent out.

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.220
They were sitting in a pew, like you are,

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.220
at some point in their lives, and God said,

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:42.220
God called them to the ministry, and they prepared,

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:47.220
and now they give us an opportunity to partner with them

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.220
as they go to the place that they've been assigned to

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.220
to carry forth the gospel.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:54.220
Lord willing, we'll have the opportunity to look

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.220
next week at the end of Acts 14.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.220
It's an exciting passage of scripture

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.220
because what you find at the end of Acts 14

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.220
is the return from this first missionary journey.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.220
And you see as they return,

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.220
and just the connection that they have

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.220
and all that they discuss,

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.220
and what a wonderful blessing it is.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:13.220
And we find that here, as we would consider

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.220
this first missionary journey,

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.220
very briefly overviewing chapter 13

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.220
and getting into chapter number 14,

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:22.220
that really this work was the result

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:27.220
of them embracing the mission that was given to them.

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:31.220
The assignment, the task that was assigned

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.220
there at the beginning of Acts 13.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.220
Because they embraced it,

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.220
because they said we're going to fulfill,

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.220
we're going to be obedient to the plan

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.220
that's been revealed to us,

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.220
we then have the privilege of seeing

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.220
how the gospel goes forth

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.220
and how churches are established.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:51.220
And it's an absolute blessing to study the word of God

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:55.220
and to see how God's plan works.

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.220
It shouldn't surprise us, by the way,

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.220
that God's plan works, amen?

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.220
He's God, of course his plan is going to work.

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:04.220
So we have the privilege of getting in line

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.220
and in step with what God has given us to do

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:11.220
and then seeing what only God can do.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:15.220
Sent forth, he said, pray,

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:18.220
the Lord of the harvest that he would send forth laborers.

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.220
I hope that we're praying to that end.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:24.220
And I hope this evening that as we see

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.220
those that would be sent forth,

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.220
even as Paul and Barnabas were sent forth,

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:31.220
that we would continue to pray for them

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.220
and then be engaged and involved

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.220
on how we could support them

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.220
in fulfilling the ministry that God has given them specifically.

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.220
Let's pray together.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.220
Father, we love you.

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:41.220
We thank you for loving us.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.220
We thank you for the word of God.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.220
What a blessing and privilege it is

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:49.220
to read about the instruction

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.220
that you gave there to your disciples

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.220
in Matthew 9.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:56.220
We are grateful for the record.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:59.220
We're moved even as our Savior

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:01.220
was moved with compassion.

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:12.420
passion and we are understanding that we're living in a time in which the world is confused

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:17.280
and the church has the answers.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:22.500
God I pray that you would help us even as the church at Antioch there in Acts 13 embraced

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.900
the plan that you revealed to them.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.500
I pray God that you would help us.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:33.700
I pray that over the next 10 days as we not only physically and mentally but most importantly

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:38.340
spiritually prepare for our missions conference that it would work in each of our lives.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:46.060
I pray that we would be ready for the meeting that we'll have and that we'll be prepared

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:54.300
to receive the challenges that will be delivered.

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:58.220
God we pray that you'd work in our midst and that you alone would be glorified.

00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.720
We thank you for the privilege of prayer.

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:04.580
We pray that as we now have our time of prayer this evening I pray that you'd bless each

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:05.580
aspect of it.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:11.120
We do thank you for the unique privilege that we have to come boldly before your throne

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.220
knowing that you hear and answer.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:18.620
We pray God that you alone would be glorified for it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
