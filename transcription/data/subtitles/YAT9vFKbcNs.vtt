00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.599
Hallelujah, we serve a risen Savior. Matthew chapter 28.

00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:07.360
We're going to examine Matthew's Gospel this morning.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.560
We'll be looking at verses 1 through 10.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.239
You find your place there. I want to read for you a portion of Scripture from the

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:15.479
book of Romans in the first chapter.

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:19.559
And so if you'd hold your place in Matthew 28 and Romans chapter number 1,

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:22.200
I just want to read a few verses of Scripture to you

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.719
from this particular portion of Scripture in the book of Romans before we get into

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:26.959
the message

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:29.680
from the Gospel of Matthew this morning.

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:31.239
Matthew 28

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.720
and Romans chapter number 1.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.240
Romans chapter number 1, the Bible begins, the Apostle Paul is writing to those

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.360
that are in Rome.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.479
Notice what he says, Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ. By the way,

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:46.279
that's a great title, isn't it? It's a wonderful thing to be a servant of the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:48.080
Lord Jesus Christ.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.040
The Bible says that he's called to be an apostle, separated, notice, unto the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.560
Gospel

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.799
of God.

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:56.840
I'm so thankful for the Gospel.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.240
The death, the burial, and the resurrection.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.799
Paul outlines it very simply in 1 Corinthians 15.

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:05.120
And he uses this phrase, according

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.519
to the Scriptures

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:10.160
in those portions of Scripture in 1 Corinthians 15. It's interesting

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.519
that here in Romans 1 he mentions that as well. Look at verse number 2,

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:16.160
which he had promised afore

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.599
by his prophets, notice, in the holy

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:21.720
Scriptures.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.800
Concerning his son Jesus Christ our Lord,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.480
which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh, notice verse 4,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.040
and declared

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.680
to be the Son of God with power

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.720
according to the spirit of holiness by

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.319
the resurrection from the dead,

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.400
by whom we have received grace and apostleship

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.279
for obedience to the faith among all nations

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:49.680
for his name,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.040
among whom are ye also

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.519
the called of Jesus Christ to all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:57.599
saints,

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:00.839
grace to you and peace from God our Father

00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:02.000
in the Lord

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.440
Jesus Christ. I'm so thankful

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.680
for the Gospel.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.679
I'm thankful to be a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.160
I'm thankful for the truth of the resurrection.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.240
I'm thankful that we can take this Gospel message

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.320
to all

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.679
nations.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.600
In just a few verses from this portion of Scripture,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.839
Paul will make the statement that I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ,

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:31.279
for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth. Aren't you

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:32.600
thankful for that?

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.000
To the Jew first and also

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.160
to the Greek.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.720
What a wonderful privilege we have to preach the Gospel.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.559
We come to the 28th chapter of the book of Matthew.

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:46.039
We've gone through chapter 26 and 27 and you read

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:50.839
in those portions of Scripture about the arrest of the Lord Jesus Christ. You read

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:53.839
of his trial before Caiaphas and

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:57.320
the religious leaders. You read how that he was delivered

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.000
from the house of Caiaphas after spending the night probably

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.919
in that pit that was there.

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:06.559
We find that he would go and stand before Pilate and there

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:08.039
he would receive

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:10.119
all sorts of things. He'd be

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:14.600
beaten and all that would take place and all that's taking place with those

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.000
that are assembled and

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.080
they cry out about, crucify him and crucify him.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.479
And we find that Jesus is led to Golgotha

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.360
and we find that he goes to that place and

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.279
the place of a skull and he dies upon Calvary's tree.

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:32.559
I'm so thankful

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:36.559
for a place called Calvary.

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:38.199
I'm so thankful

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:40.639
for Calvary.

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.320
After

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.240
he suffered and bled and died as John's gospel records,

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.399
he declared,

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:50.679
it is

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:52.160
finished.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.199
And he gave up the ghost. He died.

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:58.160
He died a real death.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.000
He was buried.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.279
I often say in a borrowed tomb

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:07.360
because we know that he would rise conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.199
I want you to think about the time between the burial

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.240
and the morning of the resurrection

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.040
as we look at Matthew's gospel account this morning in chapter 28

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.320
verses 1 through 10. I'd like for us to take the time really,

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.640
if you would, in our mind's eye to accompany Mary Magdalene and the other Mary

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.079
as they traveled to the tomb

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:28.160
early

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160
on that resurrection morning.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.040
We, of course, we've been singing all morning about the resurrection and

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.119
we've been rejoicing in the fact that we serve a risen Savior and

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:41.200
we understand that it's the cornerstone of our faith. I mentioned during the

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.040
early service this morning that

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.839
if there's no resurrection, if Christ did not rise from the dead, then our

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:50.040
preaching and our faith are vain.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.480
But now is Christ risen.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.440
He's become the first fruits of them

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.839
that have slept, that will die.

00:04:56.839 --> 00:05:00.279
But we notice that as we accompany Mary Magdalene and the other Mary as the

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:02.119
text of scripture refers to them

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:07.160
here, we find that as they travel to the tomb early on resurrection morning, I

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.000
hope

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.679
in your mind's eye, in your sanctified imagination this morning,

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:13.559
that we can travel

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:16.359
to the tomb. I've titled this morning

00:05:16.359 --> 00:05:17.480
the message

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.779
The Empty Tomb.

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:21.019
Aren't you thankful that it was empty?

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:22.320
The Empty Tomb.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.119
Notice with me in verse number one,

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:28.239
the Bible says this. In the end of the Sabbath as it began to dawn

00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:29.920
toward the first day of the week

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.040
came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulcher.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.000
And behold, there was a great earthquake.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.679
The angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:41.959
stone

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:43.480
from the door

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.320
and sat upon it.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.480
His countenance was like lightning,

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.799
and his raiment white as snow.

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:54.600
For fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.160
The angel answered and said unto the women,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.760
Fear not ye,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.320
for I know that ye seek Jesus

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.519
which was crucified.

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:04.640
Verse six,

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.220
He is not here,

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.619
for he is risen,

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:10.739
as he said.

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:11.899
Come,

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:14.820
see the place where the Lord lay,

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.100
and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.820
Behold, he goeth before you into Galilee, there shall you see him.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.079
Lo, I have told you.

00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:29.459
They departed quickly from the sepulcher with fear and great joy and did

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:32.019
run to bring his disciples word.

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:37.459
Notice as they're running to take the message that the angel had instructed

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:38.260
them to take,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.000
the Bible says in verse nine, And as they went to tell his disciples, Behold,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.260
Jesus met them.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.220
That's a great interruption to their plan, wasn't it?

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.420
I mean, they're running

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:54.059
to give the disciples the news that the angel had announced that he's not here,

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:55.940
for he is risen. And the Bible says

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.059
that Jesus met them and said, All hail.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.859
They came and held him by the feet and worshipped him.

00:07:03.859 --> 00:07:07.260
Oh, he's worthy of our worship.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.940
Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.299
Go, tell my brethren that they go into Galilee,

00:07:14.299 --> 00:07:15.739
and there

00:07:15.739 --> 00:07:17.799
shall they see me.

00:07:17.799 --> 00:07:21.540
As I look at this portion of scripture this morning, if you would, if you're

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.739
taking notes, I want you to notice with me

00:07:23.739 --> 00:07:26.100
number one, their approach

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.260
to the tomb.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.980
Their approach to the tomb.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.100
Now again, in the time that has transpired from the burial, the death and

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.980
the burial,

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.299
to this early morning, the Bible says that it began to dawn toward the first

00:07:38.299 --> 00:07:39.179
day of the week

00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:42.940
in verse number one, and they're coming early to the tomb, but we find

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.059
that the gospel tells us in Matthew chapter twenty-seven

00:07:46.059 --> 00:07:48.739
in verse number sixty-one, notice specifically

00:07:48.739 --> 00:07:53.500
as the Bible has given us the record of the burial of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.480
that it tells us, and there was Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sitting

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.399
over against the sepulcher.

00:07:59.399 --> 00:08:00.679
They were there

00:08:00.679 --> 00:08:03.040
at the burial.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.239
They were there during the crucifixion,

00:08:05.239 --> 00:08:10.880
but they're still there as they laid the body of Jesus into that tomb. We know

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.239
as we study the portion of scripture that it was the tomb of Joseph of

00:08:14.239 --> 00:08:15.359
Arimathea.

00:08:15.359 --> 00:08:19.200
We find that it was Joseph of Arimathea along with Nicodemus that

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.640
went and besought Pilate, and they take the body,

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.480
and the Bible tells us that

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.920
they rolled that great stone, notice in verse sixty it says,

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.640
and laid it in his own new tomb which he had hewn out in the rock, and he rolled

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.500
a great stone to the door of the sepulcher and departed.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.320
So Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, they see all that's taken place, and

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.919
they know that the last time they had been at that tomb,

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:50.880
that Jesus' body was placed inside, and there was a great stone

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.059
that was rolled to secure

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:55.380
his place of burial.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:00.260
We find that after they had departed from the sepulcher, as the Bible would

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.099
tell us,

00:09:01.099 --> 00:09:05.940
that the next day there were some religious leaders that came to Pilate,

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.580
and they mentioned about remembering that Jesus had said that he would rise

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.140
again.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.460
And they remembered that he said,

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.659
that destroy this temple and I'll rise it again.

00:09:18.659 --> 00:09:20.859
I'll raise it up.

00:09:20.859 --> 00:09:26.140
So they desired that Pilate would give the opportunity for them to set a

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:31.260
watch and to make it secure, and the Bible tells us that their concern

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:36.900
was that the disciples would come and steal the body by night.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.739
We just sang that song.

00:09:38.739 --> 00:09:41.059
Low in the grave he lay.

00:09:41.059 --> 00:09:44.059
Listen, death could not keep him.

00:09:44.059 --> 00:09:48.419
He tore the bars away, hallelujah. The disciples didn't need to set up some

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.739
covert operation to try to figure out how they could get there and steal the

00:09:52.739 --> 00:09:58.739
body and make it look as if, no, Jesus said, I will rise it up. I will rise

00:09:58.739 --> 00:09:59.539
again.

00:09:59.539 --> 00:10:04.699
When we find the Bible tells us that Pilate said to them in verse 65, ye have a watch,

00:10:04.699 --> 00:10:08.379
go your way, make it as sure as ye can.

00:10:08.379 --> 00:10:12.399
It doesn't matter the length by which they would take it, doesn't matter how many soldiers

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:19.199
they would place at that tomb, Jesus was going to rise again, though from human perspective

00:10:19.199 --> 00:10:22.039
they made it as sure as they could.

00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:27.619
Notice the Bible says they went and made the sepulcher sure, sealing the stone and setting

00:10:27.619 --> 00:10:31.699
a watch.

00:10:31.699 --> 00:10:37.539
Their approach to the tomb, can you imagine what's going through their mind?

00:10:37.539 --> 00:10:45.779
Can you imagine as they're taking that journey from the place where they had slept that night

00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:54.939
before, they're approaching to the tomb, the place where they had laid their Savior.

00:10:54.939 --> 00:11:00.219
We find that as we read the gospel accounts, as you have the opportunity to compare Matthew,

00:11:00.219 --> 00:11:04.819
Mark, Luke, and John, they all record the truth of the resurrection, but it's interesting

00:11:04.819 --> 00:11:11.219
because each gospel account sheds a little more light on different details, on particulars

00:11:11.219 --> 00:11:17.799
with regard to the resurrection and specifically to their arrival at the tomb.

00:11:17.799 --> 00:11:23.059
But as they're approaching the tomb, we know that as they're making their way to the tomb

00:11:23.179 --> 00:11:25.499
that they're going there for a purpose.

00:11:25.499 --> 00:11:29.839
The Bible tells us in Mark's gospel in chapter 16 and verse number 1 that they went there

00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:32.859
to anoint the body of Jesus.

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:38.179
We understand that due to all the circumstances that were taking place surrounding the death

00:11:38.179 --> 00:11:44.499
of Jesus, that they did not have the opportunity to anoint the body for quote-unquote permanent

00:11:44.499 --> 00:11:45.499
burial.

00:11:45.499 --> 00:11:50.679
And so we know that according to Mark's gospel that that was the purpose by which they were

00:11:50.679 --> 00:11:52.099
approaching the tomb.

00:11:52.139 --> 00:11:56.579
We understand that they had the spices and they had the things that they would require

00:11:56.579 --> 00:12:01.899
for that preparation, for that anointing of the body, following with regard to their traditions

00:12:01.899 --> 00:12:03.499
and all of those things.

00:12:03.499 --> 00:12:08.659
And as they're making their way, it's interesting because Mark 16 and verse number 3 provide

00:12:08.659 --> 00:12:13.659
some interesting insight with regard to the conversation between Mary Magdalene and the

00:12:13.659 --> 00:12:17.179
other Mary as they're approaching the tomb.

00:12:17.179 --> 00:12:20.379
By the way, I don't think there was a lot of conversation that was taking place.

00:12:21.379 --> 00:12:25.619
We've been in a situation where there's just no words to really say.

00:12:25.619 --> 00:12:31.419
You can feel the mood of the others that are there with you and we find that I don't think

00:12:31.419 --> 00:12:35.039
there was much conversation that was taking place.

00:12:35.039 --> 00:12:40.299
But yet Mark 16 and verse number 3 tells us that there's this question that is raised,

00:12:40.299 --> 00:12:46.059
who shall roll us away the stone?

00:12:46.059 --> 00:12:52.739
Because when they left the tomb, there was a stone that was placed at its entrance.

00:12:52.739 --> 00:12:59.219
We find that as they're coming with that purpose, their approach, they prepared, they gathered

00:12:59.219 --> 00:13:03.539
the particular elements that they would need for this anointing and as they're approaching

00:13:03.539 --> 00:13:08.779
the tomb, they're recalling the things that have taken place and the question is raised,

00:13:08.779 --> 00:13:13.899
who shall roll us away the stone?

00:13:13.899 --> 00:13:18.739
They knew the size of the stone, they no doubt could imagine the weight of the stone

00:13:18.739 --> 00:13:24.779
and in no way could they remove the stone.

00:13:24.779 --> 00:13:29.579
By the way, it's a question that perhaps you and I would ask if we approach the tomb as

00:13:29.579 --> 00:13:30.579
well.

00:13:30.579 --> 00:13:34.939
How are we going to remove this stone?

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:40.539
We find that as we consider the approach, their approach in verse number 1, I want you

00:13:40.539 --> 00:13:45.119
to consider with me in the next several verses their arrival.

00:13:45.119 --> 00:13:49.299
See as they're approaching, they're making their way to the tomb, there's thoughts in

00:13:49.299 --> 00:13:53.779
their mind, there's question that is raised with regard to the stone, but then they arrive

00:13:53.779 --> 00:13:55.819
to the tomb.

00:13:55.819 --> 00:13:59.859
And the Bible tells us that when they arrive to the tomb, there's something interesting

00:13:59.859 --> 00:14:04.099
that they find that the stone has already been rolled away.

00:14:04.099 --> 00:14:08.619
They come to this tomb, they're early there in the morning and I want you to consider

00:14:08.619 --> 00:14:11.319
with me what they saw and what they heard.

00:14:11.319 --> 00:14:16.259
The Bible tells us in verse number 2, and behold, there was a great earthquake.

00:14:16.259 --> 00:14:20.959
For the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, notice the Bible says, and came and rolled

00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:26.019
back the stone from the door, and it says that he sat upon it.

00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:28.239
His job was finished.

00:14:28.239 --> 00:14:32.359
He sat down, that angel.

00:14:32.359 --> 00:14:38.119
The Bible says that that stone was rolled back and so that's what they see when they

00:14:38.619 --> 00:14:39.619
arrive.

00:14:39.619 --> 00:14:40.619
Can you imagine?

00:14:40.619 --> 00:14:44.419
I mean, they had these thoughts of who's going to roll the stone away?

00:14:44.419 --> 00:14:49.859
Who's going to remove, to move the stone so that we can do what we've come to do?

00:14:49.859 --> 00:14:54.819
But when they arrive, the stone's already rolled away.

00:14:54.819 --> 00:14:59.659
The Bible tells us again as you look at various portions of Scripture that there was a measure

00:14:59.659 --> 00:15:02.419
of perplexity.

00:15:02.419 --> 00:15:04.259
There was some uncertainty.

00:15:04.259 --> 00:15:12.179
We find that there was a thought that someone had stolen the body of Jesus.

00:15:12.179 --> 00:15:18.159
We find that the Bible would record for us here in Matthew's Gospel that the stone is

00:15:18.159 --> 00:15:23.019
rolled back from the door and the Bible says as it describes this angel to us in verse

00:15:23.019 --> 00:15:31.699
number 3, that his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow.

00:15:31.699 --> 00:15:35.899
Can you imagine the scene when they arrive to the tomb that early morning?

00:15:35.899 --> 00:15:40.979
I mean, the Bible says as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week and they

00:15:40.979 --> 00:15:43.139
get there and there's this angel.

00:15:43.139 --> 00:15:49.879
The Bible says that his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow.

00:15:49.879 --> 00:15:54.379
The Bible tells us about those keepers that were placed that they set a watch in verse

00:15:54.379 --> 00:16:00.299
number 66 of chapter 27 and the Bible says that for fear of him, the keepers did shake

00:16:00.299 --> 00:16:06.939
and became as dead men, so much for all of their effort.

00:16:06.939 --> 00:16:09.539
One angel.

00:16:09.539 --> 00:16:14.859
The Bible tells us that the angel answered and said unto the women, notice what the angel

00:16:14.859 --> 00:16:19.499
says, fear not, fear not.

00:16:19.499 --> 00:16:23.879
I'm so thankful that as you study through the pages of Scripture that the Bible tells

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:28.139
us repeatedly that we're to not fear.

00:16:28.139 --> 00:16:32.979
He sang that song this morning, Because He Lives, and one of the references that the

00:16:32.979 --> 00:16:36.379
songwriter makes in that particular song is that I can face tomorrow.

00:16:36.379 --> 00:16:38.699
I don't have to fear the future.

00:16:38.699 --> 00:16:40.819
I don't have to fear tomorrow.

00:16:40.819 --> 00:16:41.819
Why?

00:16:41.819 --> 00:16:44.059
Because I know who holds tomorrow.

00:16:44.059 --> 00:16:50.219
Now we find here that the angel says, fear not ye.

00:16:50.219 --> 00:16:53.219
And then notice what he says, for I know.

00:16:53.219 --> 00:16:54.219
I know.

00:16:54.219 --> 00:16:55.219
I know why you're here.

00:16:55.219 --> 00:17:01.979
I know that you seek Jesus, which was crucified.

00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:07.379
By the way, we understand that Jesus came to this earth for that purpose, to redeem

00:17:07.379 --> 00:17:08.579
mankind.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:14.139
The purpose of Jesus entering into this sin-cursed world was so that man could be reconciled,

00:17:14.139 --> 00:17:18.139
so that man could be redeemed, so that we could be saved from our sin.

00:17:18.739 --> 00:17:25.259
And the only way for that to be accomplished was through His crucifixion and His subsequent

00:17:25.259 --> 00:17:26.979
resurrection.

00:17:26.979 --> 00:17:31.179
Some have asked the question, what's more important?

00:17:31.179 --> 00:17:36.399
The birth, the death, or the resurrection?

00:17:36.399 --> 00:17:39.619
The answer is yes.

00:17:39.619 --> 00:17:42.979
They're all equally important.

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:46.859
Without a birth, you can't have a crucifixion.

00:17:46.859 --> 00:17:50.659
Without a crucifixion, you can't have a resurrection.

00:17:50.659 --> 00:17:58.779
And they're all necessary for you and for me and for anyone else to have our sins forgiven,

00:17:58.779 --> 00:18:03.059
to be able to spend eternity in heaven with the Lord, with our Savior.

00:18:03.059 --> 00:18:09.539
And we find that the Bible says, I know, the angel says to these women, I know that you

00:18:09.539 --> 00:18:12.419
seek Jesus, which was crucified.

00:18:12.419 --> 00:18:22.899
He is not here, for He is risen, and in those three words, as He said.

00:18:22.899 --> 00:18:30.739
See Jesus began to reveal to His disciples, to those that He ministered to during His

00:18:30.739 --> 00:18:34.979
earthly ministry, He revealed to them the plan of going to Jerusalem and that He would

00:18:34.979 --> 00:18:39.179
be betrayed, and that He would go and He would be crucified, but He would rise again.

00:18:39.179 --> 00:18:43.339
He shared that message freely and openly with His disciples and with those to whom

00:18:43.339 --> 00:18:44.339
He ministered.

00:18:44.339 --> 00:18:48.339
We find even as we read the portion of Scripture in Romans chapter number one, that even the

00:18:48.339 --> 00:18:54.659
Old Testament prophecies prophesied not only of the birth of Christ, but of His death and

00:18:54.659 --> 00:18:56.139
of His resurrection.

00:18:56.139 --> 00:19:01.899
And we find here that as we look at this portion of Scripture, we can take those three words

00:19:01.899 --> 00:19:10.699
as He said, and we can rejoice greatly that God always, always does what He says He will

00:19:10.699 --> 00:19:12.380
do.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:17.259
No doubt in your life and in my life, we've said some things that we've not fulfilled.

00:19:17.259 --> 00:19:21.739
Perhaps some people have said some things to you that they failed you.

00:19:21.739 --> 00:19:25.219
You said, but you said, and they didn't deliver.

00:19:25.219 --> 00:19:29.339
But oh, that's not our God.

00:19:29.339 --> 00:19:32.299
He's not a man that He should lie.

00:19:32.299 --> 00:19:34.739
What He says He will do.

00:19:34.739 --> 00:19:39.259
We find that that's the message from the angel.

00:19:39.259 --> 00:19:45.579
He's not here, for He has risen as He said.

00:19:45.579 --> 00:19:49.059
But I want you to notice what He says next in verse number six.

00:19:49.059 --> 00:19:57.979
What a great invitation that is extended, come, see the place where the Lord lay.

00:19:57.979 --> 00:19:59.779
Oh, an invitation to...

00:19:59.779 --> 00:20:04.539
go and see the evidence that He's not here.

00:20:04.539 --> 00:20:08.219
We find that as you look at other portions of Scripture, again, as you look at all of

00:20:08.219 --> 00:20:10.819
the Gospel accounts, there's no contradictions.

00:20:10.819 --> 00:20:15.419
There's just more light that's shed on certain aspects, and it's just like if each of us

00:20:15.419 --> 00:20:20.899
were here this morning and we witnessed a particular situation, we'd all, because of

00:20:20.899 --> 00:20:25.539
our personalities, because of who we are and what our background is, there are certain

00:20:25.539 --> 00:20:29.859
details that some of us might pick up on that somebody else might not pick up on.

00:20:29.859 --> 00:20:33.539
It doesn't mean that there's a contradiction between our testimony.

00:20:33.539 --> 00:20:38.859
It simply means that we've observed certain aspects about that particular event.

00:20:38.859 --> 00:20:45.179
We find such is the case with the Gospel accounts, and as we look here and we see Matthew's testimony,

00:20:45.179 --> 00:20:50.419
he tells us that the angel extends that invitation, come, see the place where the Lord lay.

00:20:50.419 --> 00:20:55.179
As you look at the other portions of Scripture, you find that they went in.

00:20:55.179 --> 00:20:57.419
They saw that the body was not there.

00:20:57.419 --> 00:21:01.419
Indeed, He has risen from the dead.

00:21:01.419 --> 00:21:05.779
We find that as we were to look, as I mentioned, even in the early service this morning, and

00:21:05.779 --> 00:21:09.699
you don't need to turn there, but in Acts chapter number 1 and verse number 3, the Bible

00:21:09.699 --> 00:21:15.059
says this, to whom also He, speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ, showed Himself alive after

00:21:15.059 --> 00:21:22.099
His passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them 40 days and speaking of the things

00:21:22.099 --> 00:21:25.019
pertaining to the kingdom of God.

00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:28.659
This was the first evidence for these ladies.

00:21:28.659 --> 00:21:33.419
The evidence of Christ's resurrection is overwhelming, by the way.

00:21:33.419 --> 00:21:35.219
It's overwhelming.

00:21:35.219 --> 00:21:37.219
Many infallible proofs.

00:21:37.219 --> 00:21:41.819
You read 1 Corinthians 15 and you see, as Paul references, all of those that he had

00:21:41.819 --> 00:21:47.579
been seen by, and yet there were many that still rejected.

00:21:47.579 --> 00:21:54.059
We find here that the invitation is extended, and as we look at this empty tomb and we see

00:21:54.099 --> 00:22:00.579
the end of verse number 6, I want you to just imagine with me the mixed emotions that have

00:22:00.579 --> 00:22:06.499
transpired over just a short period of time as they approached the tomb and the uncertainty

00:22:06.499 --> 00:22:11.339
and all that would flood their mind as they were recalling the events of just a few days

00:22:11.339 --> 00:22:16.659
prior and the crucifixion as they sat there at the place where Jesus was crucified, as

00:22:16.659 --> 00:22:22.019
they saw His body taken off of that cross and placed in that tomb, as they saw that

00:22:22.019 --> 00:22:27.379
stone that was rolled in front of the entrance, as they observed all of those things and now

00:22:27.379 --> 00:22:32.859
they're approaching the tomb for the purpose of anointing the body.

00:22:32.859 --> 00:22:34.939
Who?

00:22:34.939 --> 00:22:37.019
Who shall roll us away the stone?

00:22:37.019 --> 00:22:43.419
But then they get there, they arrive, and the stone's gone, and there's an angel, and

00:22:43.419 --> 00:22:50.419
the angel says, fear not, I know why you're here, I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified,

00:22:50.419 --> 00:22:51.419
but He's not here.

00:22:51.819 --> 00:22:52.819
Why?

00:22:52.819 --> 00:22:53.819
Because He's risen.

00:22:53.819 --> 00:22:59.579
Come and see the place where the Lord lay.

00:22:59.579 --> 00:23:06.419
By the way, I've seen that place, what a wonderful opportunity and experience, but what I'd say

00:23:06.419 --> 00:23:11.539
to you is that our faith is not in a place, it's in a person.

00:23:11.539 --> 00:23:15.659
You don't need to see the place where the Lord lay.

00:23:15.659 --> 00:23:22.499
These ladies on that first early morning of that first Sunday, that resurrection Sunday,

00:23:22.499 --> 00:23:26.179
they saw the evidence that was provided.

00:23:26.179 --> 00:23:33.299
You can travel across the world and you can see in various places of religious leaders

00:23:33.299 --> 00:23:40.219
of particular religions, and you can find a place where they were buried, and the bones

00:23:40.219 --> 00:23:43.499
are still there.

00:23:43.619 --> 00:23:51.979
Not the case with biblical Christianity, for our Savior conquered sin, death, and the grave.

00:23:51.979 --> 00:23:54.939
They arrived and they see all of these things, they hear.

00:23:54.939 --> 00:23:56.859
Can you imagine their emotions?

00:23:56.859 --> 00:23:57.859
Can you imagine?

00:23:57.859 --> 00:24:02.499
Again, we know that He rose, we've read the entirety of it, we understand, but on that

00:24:02.499 --> 00:24:07.939
morning as we're in our mind's eye, as in our sanctified imagination, we're traveling

00:24:07.939 --> 00:24:12.499
with Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to the tomb that morning.

00:24:12.899 --> 00:24:20.739
Oh, the emotions, the joy, the desire to go and tell someone.

00:24:20.739 --> 00:24:26.059
We find that after they've seen the evidence, after they see the place where the Lord lay,

00:24:26.059 --> 00:24:29.779
if you're taking notes, number three, we see their approach, we see their arrival, but

00:24:29.779 --> 00:24:34.819
then I want you to see the assignment that is given.

00:24:34.819 --> 00:24:40.659
In verse number seven, we find that there's an assignment that is given from the angel.

00:24:40.659 --> 00:24:49.579
The Bible says this, and go quickly and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead.

00:24:49.579 --> 00:24:55.499
Another gospel record says, tell His disciples and Peter.

00:24:55.499 --> 00:24:58.179
Brianne and I talked about that in the last couple of nights, actually our family and

00:24:58.179 --> 00:25:05.139
family devotions, and how thankful and impactful those two words, and Peter, have been.

00:25:05.139 --> 00:25:09.219
It's because Peter denied the Lord.

00:25:09.219 --> 00:25:12.219
Tell His disciples and Peter.

00:25:12.219 --> 00:25:19.019
So thankful that the Lord loved Peter, because we fail Him too.

00:25:19.019 --> 00:25:21.019
We fail Him too.

00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:27.779
But we find that the Bible says that the angel tells these ladies, go quickly and tell His

00:25:27.779 --> 00:25:33.099
disciples, what a message, that He is risen from the dead.

00:25:33.099 --> 00:25:38.539
Can you imagine the privilege that they had to deliver that message?

00:25:38.539 --> 00:25:41.899
I mean, they're the first ones at the tomb.

00:25:41.899 --> 00:25:45.739
They're the first ones with the news of the resurrection.

00:25:45.739 --> 00:25:50.379
It reminds me of the shepherds that were abiding in the field when Jesus was born, remember?

00:25:50.379 --> 00:25:55.619
The angels speak and they said, hey, listen, I'm bringing you glad tidings of great joy,

00:25:55.619 --> 00:25:59.499
but it's not just for you, it's to be to all people.

00:25:59.499 --> 00:26:07.299
What an amazing evening that would have been on a hillside somewhere in Bethlehem.

00:26:08.299 --> 00:26:15.819
But I think about these ladies at an empty tomb, and how the angel says, go, and not

00:26:15.819 --> 00:26:19.019
just go, but he says, go quickly.

00:26:19.019 --> 00:26:24.859
You know, there ought to be some urgency, some urgency by God's people.

00:26:24.859 --> 00:26:31.059
Go quickly and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead, notice, and behold,

00:26:31.059 --> 00:26:40.259
He goeth before you into Galilee, there shall ye see Him, lo, I have told you.

00:26:40.259 --> 00:26:46.339
Jesus had told His disciples that He would go and to see them in Galilee, in fact, in

00:26:46.339 --> 00:26:52.219
Matthew's gospel, in Matthew chapter 26, in verse number 32, in verse number 31, I'll

00:26:52.219 --> 00:26:56.179
read with it, in verse 31, the Bible says, then said, Jesus, unto them, all ye shall

00:26:56.179 --> 00:27:00.339
be offended because of me this night, for it is written, I will smite the shepherd and

00:27:00.339 --> 00:27:05.579
the sheep of the flock shall be scoured abroad, but after I am risen again, I will go before

00:27:05.579 --> 00:27:08.059
you into Galilee.

00:27:08.059 --> 00:27:13.579
Again, as you read the gospel accounts, you find John's record giving us the truth that

00:27:13.579 --> 00:27:17.599
he saw Him there in Jerusalem, but eventually he would see Him in Galilee, and Matthew will

00:27:17.599 --> 00:27:20.179
deal with that, as do the other gospels.

00:27:20.179 --> 00:27:25.219
We find here that they receive the assignment in verse number 8, and I want you to notice

00:27:25.219 --> 00:27:29.899
the response as it's recorded for us in verse number, in verse 7, they receive the assignment,

00:27:29.899 --> 00:27:35.699
but in verse number 8, I want you to notice their response, and they departed quickly

00:27:35.699 --> 00:27:44.379
from the sepulcher with fear, notice this, and great joy, and did run to bring His disciples

00:27:44.379 --> 00:27:48.099
word.

00:27:48.099 --> 00:27:55.599
I don't think they ran to the tomb in verse number 1.

00:27:55.599 --> 00:28:02.959
I think verse number 1, the emotions were heavy as they made their approach to the tomb,

00:28:02.959 --> 00:28:08.119
but now as the assignment's been given and they have that wonderful news that Jesus has

00:28:08.119 --> 00:28:14.719
risen from the dead, that the Bible said go quickly, and we find that they departed quickly,

00:28:14.719 --> 00:28:18.819
and the Bible says that they did run to bring His disciples word.

00:28:18.819 --> 00:28:20.479
Can you imagine the excitement?

00:28:20.479 --> 00:28:24.359
Yes, the Bible says that they were, there was a measure of fear, but the Bible also

00:28:24.359 --> 00:28:33.839
says with great joy, this message that they've been entrusted with to deliver to the disciples.

00:28:33.839 --> 00:28:39.359
The Bible says that as they went to tell His disciples in obedience to the message, to

00:28:39.359 --> 00:28:45.639
the assignment that the angel had given, we find that the Bible says that Jesus met them,

00:28:45.639 --> 00:28:53.799
and He says, all hail, they came and held Him by the feet and worshipped Him.

00:28:53.799 --> 00:29:01.139
As you compare, again, the gospel records, this was not a long period of time in which

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:09.319
they would be there and worship Him, but I can just imagine the remembrance of those

00:29:09.319 --> 00:29:14.479
moments when they saw the resurrected Christ.

00:29:14.479 --> 00:29:18.539
They held Him by His feet and they worshipped Him.

00:29:18.539 --> 00:29:25.979
Only one day we're going to see our Savior face-to-face, glory, hallelujah.

00:29:25.979 --> 00:29:27.939
We will see Him.

00:29:27.939 --> 00:29:33.099
It's not just that there's some wonderful songs that we sing about seeing Him face-to-face,

00:29:33.099 --> 00:29:39.419
it is a biblical reality that one day, if you've been born again, if you've been washed

00:29:39.419 --> 00:29:49.979
in the blood of Jesus Christ, you will see the Savior face-to-face, wow.

00:29:49.979 --> 00:29:55.719
If you read the account in the book of Revelation, you will find that there the Bible will give

00:29:55.719 --> 00:29:59.699
us a scene into the throne room of heaven as you read after the...

00:29:59.699 --> 00:30:02.119
the messages to the churches and look over, if you will,

00:30:02.119 --> 00:30:03.999
in Revelation chapter number four.

00:30:03.999 --> 00:30:07.039
And I want you to see what's taking place.

00:30:07.039 --> 00:30:10.199
And we find that we'll just reference a verse or two

00:30:10.199 --> 00:30:13.499
here in chapter four and then go over to chapter number five

00:30:13.499 --> 00:30:16.119
as we see the scene in heaven.

00:30:16.119 --> 00:30:18.079
The Bible says that these messages

00:30:18.079 --> 00:30:20.599
that have been given to the churches in Asia

00:30:20.599 --> 00:30:21.879
in chapters two and three,

00:30:21.879 --> 00:30:24.039
and then the Bible says, beginning in chapter four,

00:30:24.039 --> 00:30:26.999
verse number one, after this, John is speaking,

00:30:26.999 --> 00:30:29.979
I looked and behold, a door was opened in heaven.

00:30:29.979 --> 00:30:31.699
And the first voice, which I heard,

00:30:31.699 --> 00:30:34.199
was as it were of a trumpet talking with me.

00:30:34.199 --> 00:30:37.259
And here's what it said, come up hither.

00:30:37.259 --> 00:30:39.179
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

00:30:39.179 --> 00:30:40.539
I'm listening for the trumpet.

00:30:40.539 --> 00:30:42.199
Amen.

00:30:42.199 --> 00:30:47.199
He says, I will show thee things which must be hereafter.

00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:50.419
And immediately I was in the spirit and behold,

00:30:50.419 --> 00:30:54.579
a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne.

00:30:54.579 --> 00:30:56.579
I want you to skip over to chapter number five

00:30:57.119 --> 00:30:58.839
and actually look at the end of chapter four

00:30:58.839 --> 00:31:00.359
and then we'll get into chapter five.

00:31:00.359 --> 00:31:01.399
At the end of chapter number four,

00:31:01.399 --> 00:31:03.679
the Bible tells us in verse number 11,

00:31:03.679 --> 00:31:04.719
here's what they're saying.

00:31:04.719 --> 00:31:09.639
Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor

00:31:09.639 --> 00:31:12.599
and power for thou hast created all things

00:31:12.599 --> 00:31:16.199
and for thy pleasure they are and were created.

00:31:16.199 --> 00:31:17.919
Verse one of chapter five.

00:31:17.919 --> 00:31:20.399
And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne,

00:31:20.399 --> 00:31:22.879
a book written within and on the backside

00:31:22.879 --> 00:31:24.359
sealed with seven seals.

00:31:24.379 --> 00:31:27.339
And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice,

00:31:27.339 --> 00:31:31.139
who is worthy to open the book

00:31:31.139 --> 00:31:33.059
and to loose the seals thereof?

00:31:33.059 --> 00:31:36.119
And no man in heaven nor in earth,

00:31:36.119 --> 00:31:38.579
neither under the earth was able to open the book,

00:31:38.579 --> 00:31:40.779
neither to look thereon.

00:31:40.779 --> 00:31:44.539
And I wept much because no man was found worthy

00:31:44.539 --> 00:31:47.459
to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.

00:31:48.299 --> 00:31:50.559
One of the elders said unto me, weep not.

00:31:53.059 --> 00:31:54.159
Weep not.

00:31:54.659 --> 00:31:58.419
Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah,

00:31:58.419 --> 00:32:03.419
the root of David hath prevailed to open the book

00:32:04.499 --> 00:32:07.819
and to loose the seven seals thereof.

00:32:07.819 --> 00:32:10.219
And I beheld, verse six, and lo,

00:32:10.219 --> 00:32:12.659
in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts

00:32:12.659 --> 00:32:15.739
and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb

00:32:15.739 --> 00:32:19.699
as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes,

00:32:19.699 --> 00:32:21.459
which are the seven spirits of God,

00:32:21.459 --> 00:32:22.939
sent forth into all the earth.

00:32:22.939 --> 00:32:26.039
And he came and took the book out of the right hand

00:32:26.039 --> 00:32:28.119
of him that sat upon the throne.

00:32:28.119 --> 00:32:29.919
When he had taken the book, the four beasts

00:32:29.919 --> 00:32:32.639
and four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb,

00:32:32.639 --> 00:32:35.199
having every one of them harps and golden vials

00:32:35.199 --> 00:32:37.519
full of odors, which are the prayers of saints.

00:32:37.519 --> 00:32:38.799
And here's the song.

00:32:38.799 --> 00:32:41.759
They sung a new song saying, thou art worthy

00:32:41.759 --> 00:32:43.879
to take the book and to open the seals thereof.

00:32:43.879 --> 00:32:44.719
Why?

00:32:44.719 --> 00:32:48.159
For thou was slain and hast redeemed us to God

00:32:48.159 --> 00:32:52.179
by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue

00:32:52.179 --> 00:32:54.859
and people and nation.

00:32:54.859 --> 00:32:57.939
And has made us unto our God kings and priests

00:32:57.939 --> 00:33:01.319
and we shall reign on the earth.

00:33:02.459 --> 00:33:06.139
Listen, as I think about Mary Magdalene

00:33:06.139 --> 00:33:08.899
and the other Mary in Matthew 28,

00:33:08.899 --> 00:33:12.059
they're running to tell the disciples

00:33:12.059 --> 00:33:15.259
and along the way Jesus meets them.

00:33:16.199 --> 00:33:19.999
The Bible tells us that they held him by the feet

00:33:19.999 --> 00:33:22.119
and they worshiped him.

00:33:22.119 --> 00:33:27.119
Oh, I think that memory stayed with them

00:33:27.479 --> 00:33:28.979
for the rest of their days.

00:33:30.119 --> 00:33:33.959
And though you and I have not had the opportunity

00:33:33.959 --> 00:33:36.399
that Mary Magdalene and the other Mary had

00:33:36.399 --> 00:33:38.879
there on resurrection morning,

00:33:38.879 --> 00:33:42.639
one day we'll see him face to face.

00:33:42.699 --> 00:33:44.939
What a wonderful, glorious day that will be.

00:33:46.699 --> 00:33:48.739
As we continue looking here and we see

00:33:48.739 --> 00:33:52.699
that they worship him, the Bible says that Jesus

00:33:52.699 --> 00:33:55.459
then reiterates the assignment that had been assigned

00:33:55.459 --> 00:33:58.939
to them by the angel in verse number seven

00:33:58.939 --> 00:34:00.499
and notice in verse number 10,

00:34:00.499 --> 00:34:03.179
then said Jesus unto them, be not afraid,

00:34:03.179 --> 00:34:07.839
go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee

00:34:07.839 --> 00:34:10.439
and there shall they see me.

00:34:11.379 --> 00:34:14.339
I want you to think about this assignment

00:34:14.339 --> 00:34:16.179
just for a moment this morning.

00:34:17.719 --> 00:34:20.359
And as we think about the assignment that was given

00:34:20.359 --> 00:34:22.019
to Mary Magdalene and the other Mary,

00:34:22.019 --> 00:34:24.659
we've noted their approach and their arrival,

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:27.539
but then they've been given an assignment.

00:34:29.339 --> 00:34:31.499
And I want you to think about the importance

00:34:31.499 --> 00:34:33.739
of the assignment that had been given to them

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:35.959
and I want you to think about the disciples

00:34:35.959 --> 00:34:37.979
as they're back in their place.

00:34:37.979 --> 00:34:40.339
In fact, as you read, I read this morning

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:43.039
in Luke's gospel as we had our morning service

00:34:43.039 --> 00:34:45.359
and you think about the immediate response

00:34:45.359 --> 00:34:46.679
to them bringing the news.

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:48.479
They thought it was but a tale

00:34:48.479 --> 00:34:51.199
and they didn't have the faith to believe.

00:34:53.099 --> 00:34:54.759
But I want you to think about the significance

00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:56.039
of the assignment.

00:34:58.419 --> 00:35:00.299
The assignment was simply this.

00:35:01.519 --> 00:35:05.319
Tell them that Jesus has risen

00:35:05.319 --> 00:35:08.199
and tell them to go to Galilee.

00:35:09.179 --> 00:35:10.899
That was the assignment.

00:35:10.899 --> 00:35:12.499
Seems pretty simple, doesn't it?

00:35:15.779 --> 00:35:19.739
But I want you to think about what if?

00:35:20.819 --> 00:35:23.159
What if they didn't tell the disciples?

00:35:24.579 --> 00:35:27.539
What if they failed in the duty,

00:35:27.539 --> 00:35:30.159
the assignment that had been given to them?

00:35:30.159 --> 00:35:31.699
What if they decided, you know what,

00:35:31.699 --> 00:35:33.939
they probably really don't want to know that.

00:35:34.779 --> 00:35:36.999
They're probably not going to believe me.

00:35:39.319 --> 00:35:41.159
I would submit to you this morning

00:35:43.639 --> 00:35:47.519
that if these ladies did not go quickly

00:35:47.519 --> 00:35:51.439
and bring the news that Jesus was risen again

00:35:51.439 --> 00:35:52.999
and to go to Galilee,

00:35:54.159 --> 00:35:57.159
that they wouldn't be there to receive the Great Commission.

00:35:59.039 --> 00:36:01.479
They wouldn't be there to receive the Great Commission.

00:36:01.659 --> 00:36:03.659
They wouldn't be there to receive the Great Commission.

00:36:03.659 --> 00:36:05.379
Matthew's gospel ends.

00:36:05.379 --> 00:36:07.179
We'll skip over verse 11 through 15

00:36:07.179 --> 00:36:08.439
and you can read that.

00:36:08.439 --> 00:36:09.799
I'm not saying that it's not important,

00:36:09.799 --> 00:36:12.199
but for sake of the time and the message this morning,

00:36:12.199 --> 00:36:13.879
we find there's some things that take place

00:36:13.879 --> 00:36:16.359
amongst the soldiers and the religious leaders

00:36:16.359 --> 00:36:18.619
with regard to a conspiracy,

00:36:18.619 --> 00:36:21.179
with regard to the body of Jesus and all the money

00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:22.579
and all the things that were taking place.

00:36:22.579 --> 00:36:25.299
But we come to verse number 16 and the Bible says,

00:36:25.299 --> 00:36:30.299
then the 11 disciples went away into Galilee

00:36:32.019 --> 00:36:36.439
into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.

00:36:38.859 --> 00:36:41.459
But it was the responsibility of a simple assignment

00:36:41.459 --> 00:36:43.779
that was given to Mary Magdalene and to Mary

00:36:44.739 --> 00:36:47.579
to tell the disciples, my brethren,

00:36:48.479 --> 00:36:51.379
is what Jesus says, that he's risen again

00:36:51.379 --> 00:36:53.539
and to go into Galilee.

00:36:53.539 --> 00:36:57.119
And we find that as we come to the end of Matthew's gospel,

00:36:57.119 --> 00:36:59.219
that the disciples are in the very place

00:36:59.219 --> 00:37:01.099
that they're supposed to be.

00:37:01.679 --> 00:37:02.739
But the reason that they're there

00:37:02.739 --> 00:37:06.939
is because of the obedience to the assignment.

00:37:08.879 --> 00:37:11.139
It was critical, it was critical.

00:37:13.299 --> 00:37:16.959
And there they receive an assignment.

00:37:16.959 --> 00:37:20.439
The Bible says in verse 17, and when they saw him,

00:37:20.439 --> 00:37:21.839
they worshiped him.

00:37:23.519 --> 00:37:24.579
But some doubted.

00:37:25.579 --> 00:37:29.679
Jesus came and spake unto them, notice what he says.

00:37:29.679 --> 00:37:34.679
All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:37.479
Go ye therefore and teach all nations,

00:37:37.479 --> 00:37:40.099
baptizing them in the name of the Father

00:37:40.099 --> 00:37:43.279
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,

00:37:43.279 --> 00:37:46.319
teaching them to observe all things whatsoever

00:37:46.319 --> 00:37:49.879
I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always,

00:37:50.839 --> 00:37:53.699
even unto the end of the world, amen.

00:37:54.839 --> 00:37:58.479
I'm thankful that the disciples were in the right place

00:37:58.519 --> 00:37:59.959
to receive that message.

00:38:02.439 --> 00:38:06.919
Because in a certain sense, see, God uses people.

00:38:06.919 --> 00:38:07.959
God uses people.

00:38:10.719 --> 00:38:13.199
And he gave the responsibility to Mary Magdalene

00:38:13.199 --> 00:38:15.799
and the other Mary to tell the disciples to go to a place.

00:38:15.799 --> 00:38:17.699
Yes, he's risen, go to this place

00:38:17.699 --> 00:38:19.099
and there you shall see him.

00:38:19.959 --> 00:38:21.039
When they get to that place,

00:38:21.039 --> 00:38:23.199
they receive the great commission.

00:38:24.199 --> 00:38:28.599
Those final words of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:38:28.599 --> 00:38:32.079
the great commission, remains today our mission

00:38:33.399 --> 00:38:36.839
as believers, as followers of Jesus Christ.

00:38:37.879 --> 00:38:40.799
And as we begin to think about the importance

00:38:40.799 --> 00:38:43.519
of the assignment that was given at the tomb

00:38:43.519 --> 00:38:46.299
that morning of Resurrection Sunday,

00:38:47.019 --> 00:38:52.019
their obedience made all the difference.

00:38:55.819 --> 00:38:58.499
See, our assignment is not to go tell someone

00:38:58.499 --> 00:39:01.499
that he's risen and go to Galilee.

00:39:01.499 --> 00:39:04.439
Our assignment is in verses 19 and 20,

00:39:05.459 --> 00:39:08.539
the same assignment that was given to the disciples.

00:39:08.539 --> 00:39:10.619
Had the disciples not been in that place

00:39:10.619 --> 00:39:13.179
because they had received that message

00:39:13.179 --> 00:39:15.459
from Mary Magdalene and the other Mary,

00:39:15.859 --> 00:39:19.319
then what would happen with biblical Christianity?

00:39:19.319 --> 00:39:20.619
What would they have done?

00:39:22.179 --> 00:39:25.219
And this morning, the point that I would like to make

00:39:25.219 --> 00:39:27.539
as we finish the message this morning

00:39:27.539 --> 00:39:29.819
is just as Mary Magdalene and the other Mary

00:39:29.819 --> 00:39:31.019
were given an assignment,

00:39:31.019 --> 00:39:33.499
you and I too have been given an assignment.

00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:38.059
We've been entrusted with a message.

00:39:38.059 --> 00:39:40.899
Oh man, we've been singing about it all morning.

00:39:40.899 --> 00:39:42.459
We've been rejoicing in the fact

00:39:42.459 --> 00:39:44.459
that we serve a risen Savior.

00:39:45.419 --> 00:39:47.879
We've had the opportunity all morning

00:39:47.879 --> 00:39:51.099
to rejoice in knowing that we're saved

00:39:51.099 --> 00:39:52.739
and that we're heaven bound.

00:39:54.539 --> 00:39:56.739
But we've been entrusted with this message

00:39:58.539 --> 00:39:59.939
in your obedience and mine.

00:39:59.939 --> 00:40:04.979
My obedience is critical.

00:40:04.979 --> 00:40:10.539
As the book of Romans tells us, how shall they hear without a preacher?

00:40:10.539 --> 00:40:13.259
How shall they hear without a preacher?

00:40:13.259 --> 00:40:19.179
How will they know the glorious message that we sing?

00:40:19.179 --> 00:40:26.899
How will they know that Jesus saves unless we tell them?

00:40:26.899 --> 00:40:34.379
Actually the disciples knew to go to Galilee because Mary Magdalene and the other Mary

00:40:34.379 --> 00:40:38.299
were obedient to the simple assignment.

00:40:38.299 --> 00:40:49.419
Go, go quickly, tell the disciples that He has risen and go to Galilee and there they

00:40:49.419 --> 00:40:50.419
shall see Him.

00:40:50.419 --> 00:40:55.939
As we begin to think about this portion of Scripture this morning and how we rejoice

00:40:55.939 --> 00:41:01.259
and as we accompany these ladies to the tomb on that early morning, we rejoice in all that

00:41:01.259 --> 00:41:02.259
was taking place.

00:41:02.259 --> 00:41:07.059
But I want you to know this morning that we have been given an assignment.

00:41:07.059 --> 00:41:08.899
We've been given an assignment.

00:41:08.899 --> 00:41:12.379
I'm thankful for those that have been obedient to the assignment over the years.

00:41:12.379 --> 00:41:16.739
I'm thankful for the one that was faithful to give the gospel so that I would hear the

00:41:16.739 --> 00:41:18.099
truth of the gospel.

00:41:18.099 --> 00:41:25.339
No doubt in my mind this morning you're thankful for the one that shared the gospel with you.

00:41:25.339 --> 00:41:28.819
If your parents were saved, there was someone that shared the gospel with them.

00:41:28.819 --> 00:41:31.659
If your grandparents were saved, there was someone that shared the gospel with them.

00:41:31.659 --> 00:41:36.059
You just keep going back and you keep going back and you find that there was a time in

00:41:36.059 --> 00:41:42.419
which the gospel first came to your family.

00:41:42.419 --> 00:41:49.379
There are people this morning that have no idea why we meet the way that we do, of the

00:41:49.379 --> 00:41:52.779
hope that we have, the peace and the joy that we have.

00:41:52.779 --> 00:41:53.779
Why?

00:41:53.779 --> 00:41:56.979
Because we love Jesus in a personal way like we do.

00:41:56.979 --> 00:42:05.179
For many this morning, Easter is a commercial holiday.

00:42:05.179 --> 00:42:12.219
Many as our society continues to change, they just don't even regard it as anything.

00:42:12.219 --> 00:42:17.759
But for us, it's a precious day.

00:42:17.759 --> 00:42:20.739
And every Sunday is a precious day.

00:42:20.739 --> 00:42:26.099
What I pray that God would help us to remember as we think about these ladies on that first

00:42:26.099 --> 00:42:33.419
resurrection morning, that they were given an assignment and we've been given an assignment.

00:42:33.419 --> 00:42:40.899
Go, he says, go quickly and tell them why because it's urgent.

00:42:40.899 --> 00:42:46.299
I think in closing this morning about the truth of the book of Esther, some of you are

00:42:46.299 --> 00:42:55.979
familiar with the book of Esther, Mordecai hated the Jewish people.

00:42:55.979 --> 00:43:05.099
He'd convinced the king to sign a death warrant, sorry, Haman, Mordecai was helpful, sorry.

00:43:05.099 --> 00:43:13.859
Haman hated the Jews and Haman had convinced the king to sign really a death warrant for

00:43:13.859 --> 00:43:15.139
all the Jews.

00:43:15.139 --> 00:43:21.019
And they were under the law of the Medes and Persians and it had been signed and we find

00:43:21.019 --> 00:43:27.419
that after Haman is exposed and Haman is dealt with that Mordecai and Esther come before

00:43:27.419 --> 00:43:28.419
the king Ahasuerus.

00:43:28.419 --> 00:43:34.339
And as they have an opportunity to stand before there, they ask that there be some changes

00:43:34.339 --> 00:43:37.259
and as you read through the eighth chapter of the book of Esther, you find that there's

00:43:37.259 --> 00:43:40.859
a counter decree that is written.

00:43:40.859 --> 00:43:47.779
And it's interesting as you read that counter decree that you'll find that they distributed

00:43:47.779 --> 00:43:51.279
that counter decree with haste.

00:43:51.279 --> 00:43:59.759
That counter decree was given to all those within the kingdom, 127 provinces.

00:43:59.759 --> 00:44:06.779
We find that Mordecai and Esther were instrumental in getting that message distributed.

00:44:06.779 --> 00:44:08.539
Why did they have to make haste?

00:44:08.539 --> 00:44:13.299
Why did they employ the individuals that they did to ensure that the message was scattered

00:44:13.299 --> 00:44:14.299
as it was?

00:44:14.299 --> 00:44:19.939
Because many would die if they weren't aware of that counter decree.

00:44:19.939 --> 00:44:25.539
This morning, there are many that are lost in their sin, they're going to die and go

00:44:25.539 --> 00:44:28.939
to a Christless eternity.

00:44:28.939 --> 00:44:34.499
Maybe they think that they could be a good person, they're following some religious teaching,

00:44:34.499 --> 00:44:38.279
but they don't know the truth of what the Bible says.

00:44:38.279 --> 00:44:44.459
When Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:44:44.459 --> 00:44:48.659
No man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

00:44:48.659 --> 00:44:53.059
I'm thankful that though there was a wicked Haman that sought to destroy the Jews, that

00:44:53.059 --> 00:44:57.939
there were faithful Mordecai and Esther.

00:44:57.939 --> 00:45:01.379
And they got the counter decree distributed.

00:45:02.379 --> 00:45:05.779
Oh, Zion haste is a song that we sing.

00:45:05.779 --> 00:45:11.819
Oh, there'd be some urgency amongst God's people.

00:45:11.819 --> 00:45:19.299
As we've been to the empty tomb, we've accompanied Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, we've considered

00:45:19.299 --> 00:45:23.419
their approach and their arrival, but we see their assignment.

00:45:23.419 --> 00:45:27.739
We say this morning that as we leave, God too has given me an assignment.

00:45:27.739 --> 00:45:34.539
We know that God would help us to be faithful to give the message that Jesus saves.

00:45:34.539 --> 00:45:35.539
Let's pray together.

00:45:35.539 --> 00:45:38.179
Father, how we love you.

00:45:38.179 --> 00:45:39.419
We thank you for loving us.

00:45:39.419 --> 00:45:42.879
We thank you for the truth of your word.

00:45:42.879 --> 00:45:49.979
We thank you, God, for the opportunity that we have to visit the empty tomb in our sanctified

00:45:49.979 --> 00:45:53.219
imaginations this morning.

00:45:53.219 --> 00:46:00.099
We have the opportunity through reading the record that you've provided us with to accompany

00:46:00.099 --> 00:46:08.059
these ladies early on resurrection morning.

00:46:08.059 --> 00:46:15.699
God, I pray you would help us to make some application in our lives, help us to rejoice

00:46:15.699 --> 00:46:19.179
greatly that we serve a risen Savior.

00:46:19.939 --> 00:46:25.779
God, help us to understand that you too have given us an assignment and I pray that you

00:46:25.779 --> 00:46:31.619
would help us to go with urgency, that we'd go in obedience to deliver a message to a

00:46:31.619 --> 00:46:35.859
lost and dying world.

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:46.299
Help us to understand that we've simply been entrusted with the gospel, that we are debtors.

00:46:46.299 --> 00:46:47.859
Help us to be not ashamed.

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:53.819
Father, if there's one here that's never been saved, they've never trusted the Lord Jesus

00:46:53.819 --> 00:47:00.139
Christ as their personal Savior, I pray that you'd move and work as only you can.

00:47:00.139 --> 00:47:03.579
I pray that today would be the day of their salvation.

00:47:03.579 --> 00:47:08.779
Lord, they would not delay, not put it off another moment.

00:47:08.779 --> 00:47:15.659
If there's a measure of uncertainty, oh God, I pray they'd get it settled today.

00:47:15.659 --> 00:47:19.659
Would you move and work in hearts and lives as only you can.

00:47:19.659 --> 00:47:23.679
We'll give you the glory for all that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:47:23.679 --> 00:47:24.679
Would you stand with me?

00:47:24.679 --> 00:47:28.139
Heads are bowed and eyes are closed.

00:47:28.139 --> 00:47:32.299
As our custom is at the end of each of our services, we have the opportunity to have

00:47:32.299 --> 00:47:37.459
an invitation where we invite you, give you the opportunity to respond to the preaching

00:47:37.459 --> 00:47:39.859
of God's precious Word.

00:47:39.859 --> 00:47:42.579
If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how you could know

00:47:42.579 --> 00:47:44.459
for sure that heaven's your home.

00:47:44.779 --> 00:47:52.059
Please, please don't leave this place without knowing for sure, with 100% confidence, that

00:47:52.059 --> 00:47:56.259
if you're to take your final breath today, that heaven is your home.

00:47:56.259 --> 00:48:00.299
Maybe for God's people this morning you need to come and just thank Him for the truth of

00:48:00.299 --> 00:48:02.539
the resurrection.

00:48:02.539 --> 00:48:06.499
Maybe this morning you need to come and make a commitment that you'll be obedient to the

00:48:06.499 --> 00:48:09.459
assignment that we've been given.

00:48:09.459 --> 00:48:11.459
As Kate plays, the altar is open.

00:48:14.459 --> 00:48:15.459
Amen.

00:48:15.459 --> 00:48:16.459
Amen.

00:48:16.459 --> 00:48:17.459
Amen.

00:48:17.459 --> 00:48:17.459
