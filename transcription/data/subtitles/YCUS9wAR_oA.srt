1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,039
But I want you to start in 1 Timothy, chapter number two, if you will, 1 Timothy, chapter

2
00:00:04,039 --> 00:00:05,400
number two.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,640
And of course, we're preaching through the book of 1 and 2 Timothy this year with regard

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,319
to our theme.

5
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:18,540
And this morning we'll be in the Gospel of Luke as we continue with this subject matter

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,079
of prayer.

7
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,280
But let me remind you in 1 Timothy, chapter number two, beginning in verse number one,

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,959
notice the Bible says, I exhort therefore, notice that first of all, supplications, prayers,

9
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:34,200
intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,680
You might remember the memory verse from the month of February, verse number eight, I will

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,180
therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.

12
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,119
And we've dealt with the subject of prayer for a number of weeks now.

13
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:53,880
We dealt with structure in our prayer lives and how important it is to have that structure,

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,240
to have a place and a time.

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,919
And we dealt with the fact that we're to pray for leaders.

16
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:04,519
And I hope that you've been praying for our leaders and they need prayer and we've been

17
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,800
commanded to do so.

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,199
And God says that it pleases Him when we do that.

19
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:15,480
We find that we dealt with the idea of effectual prayer and how can our prayer life, how can

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,680
our prayers be effective?

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,440
He says that we're to lift up holy hands, the necessity of being clean and how sin will

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,239
hinder our prayer lives.

23
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,760
Sin will hinder your prayer life.

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,839
The fact that we must be controlled by the spirit of God, the fact that we must understand

25
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:38,000
that we pray in confidence, that God hears us and that God answers and He is able.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,559
And what a blessing that is.

27
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:44,559
And we looked last week at a praying church, the church, the first century church, the

28
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:45,720
church in the book of Acts.

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,319
We find that every time as you look through their history and as God was using them in

30
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:56,160
the first century, you read repeatedly that they prayed, they were praying, they, they

31
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:02,919
met for prayer and what a blessing to consider the response to many situations that the early

32
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:06,519
church faced was a response of prayer.

33
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:12,240
And we mentioned last week specifically there in Acts chapter number 12 dealing with the

34
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,240
church as they were praying for Peter with the instruction that he soon, or the understanding

35
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:23,160
that he soon would be put to death and how God answered prayer and miraculously delivered.

36
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,800
On Wednesday evening, if you were here, I know we have student ministries, some in other

37
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,399
places of the building, but we dealt with the subject from first Thessalonians five

38
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:35,119
in verse 17, pray without ceasing.

39
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:40,199
And what a blessing to understand from that verse of scripture that we have access to

40
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:43,559
the throne of grace at any time for any reason.

41
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:48,479
And what a blessing that is, our God is able and it should have an influence on our attitude

42
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,880
towards prayer.

43
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,759
This morning as we continue with the thought of prayer from first Thessalonians chapter

44
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,520
two, we make our way to Luke chapter number 11.

45
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:04,440
In Luke chapter number 11, God gives us the record of one disciple making a special request.

46
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,039
The Bible tells us in verse number one that this one disciple, because it says one of

47
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:13,679
his disciples, said unto him this special request.

48
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:14,679
What was it?

49
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:19,679
It was this, Lord, teach us to pray.

50
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:25,240
I often think about those words and I think about the way in which the disciples could

51
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:30,580
have, any one of the disciples could have asked the Lord Jesus Christ to teach them

52
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,759
a multitude of things.

53
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:38,720
But we find recorded for us in the pages of scripture is the disciple going to Jesus,

54
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,720
going to God in the flesh and saying, Lord, teach us to pray.

55
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,800
The next few verses of scripture, we find that the Lord Jesus Christ teaches on the

56
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,399
subject matter of prayer.

57
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:58,759
I would say this, that Jesus provides for us in this text of scripture a model or a

58
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:01,600
pattern for prayer.

59
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,559
He says, by the way, when you pray, not if you pray, the expectation is that we as God's

60
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:09,919
people will be engaged in prayer.

61
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,199
And we find that he provides us with this pattern, this framework, if you will, for

62
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,200
prayer.

63
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,839
This is not the Lord's prayer, although it's often referred to as being the Lord's prayer.

64
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,239
It's a model prayer.

65
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:27,359
The Lord's prayer, I believe you can read in John chapter 17, and what a great prayer

66
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,519
that is.

67
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:33,000
But we find here this model framework, if you will, the pattern.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,679
By the way, it's not a prayer that we should just repeat.

69
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:42,799
It's not a repetitive idea that we memorize the pattern that he establishes here and we

70
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:44,119
just pray that.

71
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:47,799
No, he's just simply providing us with a pattern.

72
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:53,760
Notice with me in verse number two, and he, Jesus, said unto them, the disciples are there,

73
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,440
and we find that one, according to verse number one, says, Lord, teach us to pray, as John

74
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:05,359
also taught his disciples, and he, Jesus, said unto them, when ye pray, say, Our Father

75
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:08,040
which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

76
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,720
By the way, we ought to recognize who we're praying to.

77
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
The God of the universe.

78
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,920
But not only the God of the universe, our Father.

79
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,880
See prayer is a privilege for the children of God, the people of God, those that have

80
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,040
been saved by the grace of God, that know that they're going to heaven to be with God

81
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
for all of eternity.

82
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,359
And he says, when you pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

83
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:30,359
He's holy.

84
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:33,679
We must never forget that our God is holy.

85
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:38,399
Notice the Bible says, Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.

86
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,239
Give us day by day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone

87
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:49,959
that is indebted to us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

88
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:55,200
In verse number two, there are, tucked within the instruction that I've just read in verses

89
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,320
two through four, there are four words that I want to draw our attention to this morning.

90
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,959
These four words, I believe, are critical for us to understand.

91
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:11,000
In fact, these four words, I believe, will have a major impact on your prayer life and

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,640
on my prayer life.

93
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,459
Those four words, if you've already looked at the back of the bulletin, serve as our

94
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:21,339
title for the message this morning, Thy will be done.

95
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,540
Thy will be done.

96
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:30,100
Let me ask you this morning, how strong is your will?

97
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,500
How strong is your will?

98
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,980
You know, for some, we have a stronger will than others.

99
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:41,260
We, if you are a parent, you have had the privilege of raising children.

100
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:47,019
You know at times that some children have a stronger will than other children.

101
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:52,619
Maybe you were the child that your parents said you have a strong will.

102
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:56,100
We understand that terminology.

103
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,339
But I wonder this morning, if you were to evaluate your own life, how strong is your

104
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:01,820
will?

105
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:06,140
And as a follow-up to that question, let me ask this question.

106
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:16,459
How much influence does your will and my will have on our prayer lives?

107
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:23,820
I think if we're not careful, sometimes our prayer lives can be influenced more by our

108
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:29,420
wills than by His will.

109
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,779
And this morning as we look at this text of Scripture, and again, we've looked at a variety

110
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:38,899
of aspects of prayer over the last several weeks, and I very quickly, through introduction

111
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:43,260
this morning, gave you kind of a summary and overview of each of the last messages that

112
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,220
I preached on the subject of prayer.

113
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:55,579
But we find this morning that these four words, I mean they're simple words, thy will be done.

114
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:58,760
But each of us have a will.

115
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,100
Each of us have a will.

116
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:08,140
We believe this morning that as we understand our will, and you know how strong your will

117
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:14,899
is, and you know how submissive you are to the will of God, but if we're not careful,

118
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:21,660
our will influences our prayer lives more than God's will influences our prayer lives.

119
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:30,700
How can we, how can you, how can I this morning, how can we truly say, not my will, but thine?

120
00:08:30,859 --> 00:08:32,859
But thine be done.

121
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:38,020
Because we all have a will, we all have a desire, and this morning we find it tucked

122
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:43,820
within these verses of Scripture, the instruction, thy will be done.

123
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:49,260
As we examine this truth and these four words this morning, this might be one of the most

124
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:55,099
critical aspects of prayer that I've dealt with in the last several weeks.

125
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:57,380
Thy will be done.

126
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,780
How do we determine God's will?

127
00:08:59,859 --> 00:09:02,260
Well, God's will is revealed to us in His Word.

128
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,500
We must be students of the Word.

129
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,260
We're to pray according to His will, according to the truth that we receive in 1 John 5,

130
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,500
14, and 15.

131
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,859
We find that as even looking at the text of Scripture in 1 Timothy 2, verses 1 through

132
00:09:14,859 --> 00:09:20,739
8, tucked, I preached a message on it, God's will for humanity, because tucked within the

133
00:09:20,739 --> 00:09:26,700
instruction of prayer in 1 Timothy 2 is really a parenthetical statement that God gives us

134
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:33,659
and reveals to us what His will is for mankind.

135
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:37,739
How is it that I can align my will with God's will?

136
00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:44,059
Because that's really what it boils down to, is how is it that we can align our will with

137
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:45,059
God's will?

138
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:46,059
Take your Bible quickly, if you will.

139
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:48,380
Turn to the book of Psalm, Psalm 37.

140
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:55,539
I believe in Psalm 37, God gives us some really nuggets of truth, some indicators, if you

141
00:09:55,539 --> 00:10:00,099
will, for how we, as God's people, can align our will.

142
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:07,099
with His will, because Jesus, in responding to the request of the disciple,

143
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:12,099
Lord, teach us to pray, gave this framework, this pattern for prayer,

144
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:15,099
and within the framework, He says,

145
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:18,099
Thy will be done.

146
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:22,099
In Psalm chapter 37, the Bible says this in verse number 3.

147
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:24,099
I'm going to look at verses 3 through 7.

148
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:25,099
Notice what the Bible says.

149
00:10:25,099 --> 00:10:27,099
Trust in the Lord and do good.

150
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:30,099
So shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.

151
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:35,099
Delight thyself also in the Lord, and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart.

152
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:40,099
How many times have you heard verse 4 taken completely out of context?

153
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:43,099
God said He'll give us the desires of our heart.

154
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:46,099
Read the whole verse. Amen?

155
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:49,099
Verse 5, notice, commit thy way unto the Lord.

156
00:10:49,099 --> 00:10:53,099
Trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to pass.

157
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:56,099
And He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light,

158
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:58,099
and thy judgment as the noonday.

159
00:10:58,099 --> 00:11:01,099
Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him.

160
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:05,099
Fret not thyself because of Him, who prospereth in His way

161
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:09,099
because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.

162
00:11:09,099 --> 00:11:14,099
There are four nuggets of truth within these verses of Scripture that God gives us

163
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:17,099
that I believe will help us, they will aid us

164
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:21,099
in having our will aligned with God's will.

165
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:26,099
And notice with me in verses 3 and also in verse number 5,

166
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:30,099
the Bible says, trust in the Lord.

167
00:11:30,099 --> 00:11:32,099
Trust in the Lord.

168
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:35,099
It says in verse number 5, trust also in Him.

169
00:11:35,099 --> 00:11:38,099
You know, it's important that we trust Him.

170
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:42,099
The Bible says, trust in the Lord with all thine heart.

171
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:45,099
Not part of it, not most of it, but with all of it.

172
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:48,099
We find that we sing the song, trust and obey,

173
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:53,099
and there's no other way to be happy in Jesus but to trust and obey.

174
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:55,099
Trusting Jesus, simply trusting.

175
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:59,099
I'm so glad I learned to trust Him, the songwriter said.

176
00:11:59,099 --> 00:12:02,099
And indeed, our God is trustworthy.

177
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:05,099
And He says to His people that we're to trust in the Lord.

178
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:09,099
Notice verse number 4, the instruction, the nugget of truth given to us,

179
00:12:09,099 --> 00:12:13,099
delight thyself also in the Lord.

180
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:16,099
On the front of our bulletins for today,

181
00:12:16,099 --> 00:12:19,099
if you looked at it, is Psalm 1611.

182
00:12:19,099 --> 00:12:22,099
And thy presence is fullness of joy.

183
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:25,099
And what a blessing to enter into the presence of God,

184
00:12:25,099 --> 00:12:28,099
to understand the joy that God gives as we enter into His presence.

185
00:12:28,099 --> 00:12:32,099
But we delight thyself also in the Lord.

186
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:35,099
And as we delight ourselves in the Lord, notice it says,

187
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:39,099
and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart.

188
00:12:39,099 --> 00:12:42,099
I believe this morning as we look at this truth,

189
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:46,099
and we actually see it in Psalm 21 and verse number 2,

190
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,099
thou hast given him his heart's desire,

191
00:12:49,099 --> 00:12:52,099
and hast not withholding the request of his lips.

192
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:55,099
I believe that as we delight ourselves in the Lord,

193
00:12:55,099 --> 00:13:01,099
that our desires are really God's desires.

194
00:13:01,099 --> 00:13:05,099
So what happens is God's desires become our desires.

195
00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:08,099
I wonder this morning, before you got saved,

196
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:11,099
were there certain desires or ambitions that you had,

197
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:13,099
somebody said to you when you were a teenager,

198
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:16,099
if you were not saved at that point in your life,

199
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:18,099
they said, hey, what do you want to do with your life?

200
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:20,099
I mean, what are you going to do?

201
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,099
And we have our desires, our ambitions,

202
00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:25,099
our ideas of what we're going to do.

203
00:13:25,099 --> 00:13:29,099
And then we understand that as we look at the truth of God's word,

204
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,099
that we are His children.

205
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:33,099
And if we delight ourselves in the Lord,

206
00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:37,099
His desires really become our desires.

207
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:40,099
The more time you spend with the Lord,

208
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:42,099
the more that you're in His presence,

209
00:13:42,099 --> 00:13:44,099
the more that you're trusting Him,

210
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:48,099
the more that His will and His desire

211
00:13:48,099 --> 00:13:51,099
becomes your will and your desire.

212
00:13:51,099 --> 00:13:53,099
It's found in His word,

213
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:57,099
how much time we must spend in God's word every day of our lives.

214
00:13:57,099 --> 00:14:01,099
Notice with me in verse number 5,

215
00:14:01,099 --> 00:14:05,099
commit thy way unto the Lord.

216
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:07,099
And then we see again, trust also in Him.

217
00:14:07,099 --> 00:14:09,099
So we are told to trust in the Lord.

218
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,099
We're told to delight thyself also in the Lord.

219
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:15,099
We're told to commit thy way unto the Lord, trusting Him.

220
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:18,099
Listen, because we know who He is,

221
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:22,099
then we can commit our way unto Him.

222
00:14:22,099 --> 00:14:24,099
And then we find in verse number 7,

223
00:14:24,099 --> 00:14:28,099
notice these words, rest in the Lord.

224
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:30,099
Rest in the Lord.

225
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:34,099
You know, when we look at the truth that God gives us here in Psalm 37

226
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:36,099
in verses 3 through 7,

227
00:14:36,099 --> 00:14:40,099
these four nuggets of truth as we seek to answer the question,

228
00:14:40,099 --> 00:14:44,099
how can I align my will with God's will?

229
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:47,099
We find that it's necessary that we're in His presence,

230
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:49,099
that we're trusting Him, that we're delighting in Him,

231
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:51,099
that we're committing our way unto Him,

232
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:55,099
that we're resting in Him.

233
00:14:55,099 --> 00:14:59,099
This morning as we think about the subject of prayer

234
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:01,099
and looking at these four words,

235
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:04,099
thy will be done,

236
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:05,099
two thoughts for you this morning.

237
00:15:05,099 --> 00:15:07,099
When we pray thy will be done,

238
00:15:07,099 --> 00:15:16,099
number one, we recognize that His will or His way is superior.

239
00:15:16,099 --> 00:15:20,099
When we pray, thy will be done.

240
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:24,099
Now understand, that's not just a cliche that we add to the end of a prayer.

241
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:26,099
And when you read James 4,

242
00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:28,099
and the Bible says that we ought to say,

243
00:15:28,099 --> 00:15:29,099
if the Lord is willing,

244
00:15:29,099 --> 00:15:31,099
that's not just a cliche that we say.

245
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:34,099
Now sometimes we'll say, hey, Lord willing, we'll see you,

246
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,099
and we might use that,

247
00:15:35,099 --> 00:15:38,099
and it can become cliche-ish.

248
00:15:38,099 --> 00:15:41,099
But you understand, it's not to be a cliche.

249
00:15:41,099 --> 00:15:42,099
It is the Lord's will.

250
00:15:42,099 --> 00:15:44,099
We desire to know the Lord's will.

251
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:47,099
We understand this morning we are gathered here

252
00:15:47,099 --> 00:15:49,099
because it's God's will.

253
00:15:49,099 --> 00:15:52,099
God says not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together

254
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:53,099
as the manner of some is,

255
00:15:53,099 --> 00:15:55,099
but exhorting one another,

256
00:15:55,099 --> 00:15:57,099
and so much the more as you see the day approaching.

257
00:15:57,099 --> 00:16:00,099
We are gathered together because it's God's will.

258
00:16:00,099 --> 00:16:02,099
I am preaching the word this morning

259
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:04,099
because it's God's will.

260
00:16:04,099 --> 00:16:05,099
He said preach the word,

261
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:07,099
be instant in season, out of season,

262
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,099
reprove, rebuke, exhort,

263
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:11,099
with all longsuffering and doctrine.

264
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:13,099
He says, yes, the time will come.

265
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:14,099
I think we're there,

266
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:17,099
that men will not endorse sound doctrine.

267
00:16:17,099 --> 00:16:19,099
Nevertheless, we are to continue,

268
00:16:19,099 --> 00:16:22,099
and we are to preach the word.

269
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:27,099
We do this at God's will.

270
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:29,099
And when we delight ourselves in the Lord,

271
00:16:29,099 --> 00:16:30,099
when we're trusting Him,

272
00:16:30,099 --> 00:16:31,099
and committing our way to Him,

273
00:16:31,099 --> 00:16:32,099
and we're resting in Him,

274
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:36,099
God's will becomes our will.

275
00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:40,099
I hope no one had to drag you to church this morning.

276
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,099
Honestly.

277
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:44,099
I know sometimes you might think about that

278
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:45,099
with little kids or something,

279
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:46,099
but I hope this morning,

280
00:16:46,099 --> 00:16:48,099
listen, when I wake up on Sunday,

281
00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:51,099
man, I am so excited

282
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:53,099
about the opportunity that God gives us

283
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:56,099
to gather as the people of God

284
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,099
on the Lord's day to celebrate the resurrection

285
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:00,099
because every Sunday that we meet

286
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:02,099
is because we serve a risen Savior,

287
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:05,099
and we get to be in church.

288
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,099
And you say, well, you're the pastor.

289
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,099
Listen, after I got saved,

290
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:12,099
I wanted to be with God's people.

291
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,099
You know how many times I wanted to go to church

292
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,099
before I got saved?

293
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,099
Zero.

294
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:18,099
Honestly.

295
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:20,099
I remember my dad coming home from work,

296
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,099
and he said, we're going to go to church on Sunday.

297
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:24,099
I said, we're doing what?

298
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:25,099
I was almost 13 years old.

299
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:26,099
I was a teenager.

300
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,099
I had other things that I did on Sunday.

301
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,099
I'm just being honest.

302
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:31,099
And dad said, we're going to church.

303
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:32,099
We're doing what?

304
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:34,099
And then my dad got saved,

305
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:36,099
and we're going to church for Sunday school

306
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:37,099
and Sunday morning and Sunday evening

307
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:40,099
and Wednesday night and Saturday bus visitation,

308
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:42,099
and he's all in.

309
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:44,099
My dad never went to church,

310
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:46,099
but he got saved by the grace of God.

311
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:49,099
He's in church.

312
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:51,099
I remember before I got saved,

313
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:53,099
I didn't want to be in church,

314
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:55,099
but some of you can testify.

315
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:57,099
Mickey was testifying this morning in Sunday school.

316
00:17:57,099 --> 00:18:00,099
You know what happens when you can't be in church?

317
00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:02,099
Man, you miss it.

318
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:04,099
Why? Because I want to be with the people of God.

319
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:07,099
With the people of God.

320
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:09,099
And so we're gathered because it's God's will,

321
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:11,099
but we understand this morning

322
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:13,099
that when we pray, thy will be done,

323
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:14,099
when we pray that way,

324
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:17,099
we're recognizing that His will,

325
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:21,099
that His way is superior.

326
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:23,099
You might think that your will is best.

327
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:25,099
You might think that your way is best.

328
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:27,099
I mean, this is the best thing ever,

329
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:29,099
but I guarantee you this morning

330
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:32,099
that God's way is best.

331
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:36,099
God's will, thy will, be done.

332
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:39,099
He is eternal.

333
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:41,099
He is sovereign.

334
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:43,099
He is in control of all things.

335
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:45,099
He alone has all power.

336
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:47,099
He alone has all wisdom.

337
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:49,099
Amen?

338
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:51,099
Wisdom didn't begin with you.

339
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:52,099
It doesn't end with you.

340
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:54,099
Hallelujah.

341
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,099
Our God is the all-wise God.

342
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:59,099
And we find here that the God

343
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:01,099
who alone has all power and all wisdom,

344
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,099
that He is our God.

345
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:04,099
He is our Father.

346
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:05,099
He is holy.

347
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:07,099
And when we look at the instruction

348
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:08,099
that Jesus gives,

349
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:10,099
He says, thy will be done.

350
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:12,099
Why does He say that to the disciples?

351
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:14,099
Why are these four words

352
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:16,099
tucked within the instruction?

353
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:19,099
Because it's so important for God's people,

354
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:22,099
for the children of God to understand

355
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:24,099
that God's will is best,

356
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:26,099
to recognize that,

357
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,099
that God's way is best.

358
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:31,099
And we must pray thy will be done.

359
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:34,099
God always has a plan.

360
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:36,099
Always.

361
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:38,099
Nothing ever surprises God.

362
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:39,099
You ever been in a situation

363
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:41,099
where you were surprised by something?

364
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:42,099
Maybe you said something like this.

365
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:43,099
I didn't see this coming.

366
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,099
I didn't plan for this.

367
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:47,099
But I can guarantee you this morning

368
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:51,099
that that's never happened to God.

369
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:53,099
The start of human history

370
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:56,099
when sin entered into the world.

371
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:58,099
When Satan tempted in the garden Eve

372
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:00,099
and she partook of the fruit,

373
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:02,679
also ate likewise."

374
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:04,519
That was not a surprise to God.

375
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:09,779
For God tells us in His Word that Jesus is the Lamb of God slain before the foundation

376
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:10,779
of the world.

377
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:12,479
Provision had already been made.

378
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:17,599
He already understood because nothing surprises God.

379
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:20,959
Thy will be done.

380
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:26,239
Again, I asked you in the beginning of the message this morning, how strong is your will?

381
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:31,399
I asked you in the beginning of the message this morning, how much does your will influence

382
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:32,859
your prayer life?

383
00:20:32,859 --> 00:20:38,319
How much of our will are we praying versus God's will are we praying?

384
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:43,039
It requires that we do some examination of our prayer lives.

385
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,519
Thy will be done.

386
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:50,399
Notice with me, God's way is perfect.

387
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:53,559
Have you ever met anyone that they thought their way was perfect?

388
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:55,999
I mean, you can't do it any better.

389
00:20:55,999 --> 00:20:59,439
You have to do it their way because it is the only way to do something.

390
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:01,839
I can tell you this morning that God's way is perfect.

391
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,559
That's what the Bible tells us.

392
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:06,159
Turn to the book of 2 Samuel, if you will.

393
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,879
And this is important for us to understand as we go through this understanding of this

394
00:21:10,879 --> 00:21:15,479
critical instruction, these four simple words, thy will be done.

395
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:20,799
In 2 Samuel chapter 22 and verse number 31, we find this is the song of David.

396
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,119
And I want you to see what David says.

397
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:27,199
Now, David had some great triumphs during his life.

398
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:28,479
Would you agree this morning?

399
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:30,799
I mean, David had some great triumphs during his life.

400
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,919
I mean, some amazing things happened during the life of David.

401
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,199
But David also dealt with some great opposition.

402
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:44,359
I'm not simply talking about the opposition and the difficulty that David endured after

403
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:45,799
the sin with Bathsheba.

404
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:51,159
I'm talking about difficulties that he had just as he was seeking to do the will of God.

405
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:53,079
Just as he was seeking to follow the Lord.

406
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:57,319
He didn't ask to be anointed to be the next king of Israel.

407
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:59,159
Amen?

408
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:02,139
God chose him to be the next king of Israel.

409
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:06,799
He simply was ministering to Saul and Saul wanted to kill him.

410
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,519
Saul made it his number one agenda.

411
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:13,399
Most important thing, kill David.

412
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,519
God spared him.

413
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:21,599
We can read on a number of occasions how David was miraculously spared by God and how David

414
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,119
testified even while he's on the run that there's but a step between me and death.

415
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,719
But yet God preserved his life and God did bring him to the place of being king.

416
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:34,199
And I want you to see what David says near the end of his life in 2 Samuel 22 and verse

417
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:43,959
number 31, as for God, his way is perfect.

418
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:44,959
His way is perfect.

419
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:49,879
You say, well, what about that his way is perfect?

420
00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:50,879
I didn't see this coming.

421
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:51,879
I didn't plan for this.

422
00:22:51,879 --> 00:22:52,879
That's not what I...

423
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:54,359
His way is perfect.

424
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:55,879
Why?

425
00:22:55,879 --> 00:22:56,879
Because he has a purpose.

426
00:22:56,879 --> 00:22:58,759
He has a plan.

427
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:00,759
And his way is perfect.

428
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:06,019
And we find that in his plan and in his purpose and understanding this morning that his way

429
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:13,719
is perfect, we understand that he has a purpose ultimately, primarily, his purpose is to bring

430
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:16,519
honor and glory to himself.

431
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:19,999
Ultimately that's the purpose, the plan.

432
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:21,119
How is he going to do that?

433
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:22,959
A variety of ways.

434
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:28,039
But we find this morning that as we look at David and he gives this testimony, his way

435
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,479
is perfect.

436
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:31,919
Notice the word of the Lord is tried.

437
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,519
He is a buckler to all them that trust in him, a shield.

438
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:44,479
Do you remember Psalm 37 twice in those verses of Scripture, trust in the Lord.

439
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:52,359
And we find here this morning that when we understand thy will be done, we are recognizing

440
00:23:52,359 --> 00:24:01,039
when we pray that way, when our prayer life is influenced and impacted by this phrase,

441
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:07,719
we are recognizing that his way, his will is best.

442
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:08,939
It's best.

443
00:24:08,939 --> 00:24:10,799
You say, well, it might not be what I've chosen.

444
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,239
You don't know what God's going to do.

445
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:16,159
You don't know how God is going to work.

446
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,559
The book of Philippians in the first chapter, Paul says to the believers in Philippi, I

447
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,939
want you to understand something.

448
00:24:21,939 --> 00:24:25,399
What I want you to understand is that the things that have happened to me have happened

449
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:29,359
for the furtherance of the gospel.

450
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,679
Praise God.

451
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:35,759
In chapter number four, he speaks about those of Caesar's household that send their greetings.

452
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:40,919
No doubt they heard the gospel because Paul was imprisoned.

453
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:43,819
You say, well, I don't want to be in prison.

454
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:48,919
You can read of many countless that have gone on before us that have suffered.

455
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:56,039
They faced persecution and difficulty and we find that in so doing, God was glorified.

456
00:24:56,039 --> 00:25:04,039
Souls were saved and lives were changed because of their submission to God's plan and God's

457
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:05,039
will.

458
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,739
See, God's way is perfect.

459
00:25:08,739 --> 00:25:13,859
You might think that your way is perfect, but you're mistaken.

460
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:15,619
Our way is not perfect.

461
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:17,299
God's way is perfect.

462
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:27,119
I think this morning about some very new situation, really kind of, you know, overwhelming if

463
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:32,499
you will for the Scholl family, but I think about having communication with Brother Scholl

464
00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:38,179
this week and understanding that his wife has been diagnosed with cancer and they're

465
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:40,739
in Greenland and they can't get medical treatment.

466
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:41,739
What do they do?

467
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:48,659
And they're believing that God can heal her, but they're praying that God's will would

468
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:49,659
be accomplished.

469
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:55,139
You know, it's really exciting when I read the correspondence and had the opportunity

470
00:25:55,139 --> 00:26:01,819
to have some conversation via text and email with the family, understanding that they said

471
00:26:01,819 --> 00:26:02,819
this.

472
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:05,779
They said, you know, there's some people that we've been ministering to for a long time

473
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:06,779
in Greenland.

474
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:08,779
You know what they're doing?

475
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:11,779
They're watching us right now.

476
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:12,779
You know what they want to know?

477
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,279
They want to know if our God's real.

478
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:20,259
They want to know that if the God that we tell them they should trust in, if we're going

479
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:23,819
to trust in Him in our moment of crisis.

480
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:28,379
Have you ever considered that this morning?

481
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,819
We tell people that God is trustworthy.

482
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:36,779
I referenced last week on Wednesday evening when we dealt with that subject of prayer

483
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:41,859
and developing our attitude towards prayer, and we looked at a text of Scripture in Ezra

484
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:47,619
chapter number 8 where Ezra was ashamed to ask for a group of soldiers to come and to

485
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:49,859
help them along the way against the enemy.

486
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:50,859
Why?

487
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:55,119
Because we've already told the king that our God is great, that our God is able.

488
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:57,979
So then I'm not going to go to the king and say, by the way, can we have some soldiers

489
00:26:57,979 --> 00:27:00,699
and some army, some folks to help us along the way?

490
00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:04,699
No, we're trusting our God is going to protect us.

491
00:27:04,699 --> 00:27:06,579
And guess what happened in Ezra?

492
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:08,659
They made it to Jerusalem.

493
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:12,019
They made it to Jerusalem.

494
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:14,619
They said there's going to be some people that are going to be watching us.

495
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:16,459
You know there are people watching you today.

496
00:27:16,459 --> 00:27:24,419
You say, why are we dealing with this, whatever it is, health issue, financial issue, a hardship

497
00:27:25,219 --> 00:27:30,819
with a family situation, whatever it is, God's way.

498
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:34,819
We must align our will with God's will.

499
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,219
We must seek God's face.

500
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:37,219
We must know.

501
00:27:37,219 --> 00:27:40,859
And when we pray, we pray, thy will be done.

502
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,019
You know how the Shoals are praying?

503
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:45,579
They're praying that some of those people they've been trying to reach for years will

504
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:47,479
be saved.

505
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:50,139
Some have already said, we're going to be in church.

506
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:53,699
Now they're not even there right now.

507
00:27:53,699 --> 00:27:55,499
They're going to come to church.

508
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:59,299
That's exciting.

509
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:00,299
Is it okay in your life?

510
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:03,499
Is it okay in my life if we allow God to have His way?

511
00:28:03,499 --> 00:28:07,779
You understand what I mean?

512
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:09,739
I understand that we don't want hardships.

513
00:28:09,739 --> 00:28:13,699
I'm the last person on the face of the earth that wants a difficulty, honestly.

514
00:28:13,699 --> 00:28:16,019
I like it when things go easy, Brother Armando.

515
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:18,819
I really do.

516
00:28:18,939 --> 00:28:26,379
But sometimes in the midst of those hardships, God's proving Himself and God's developing

517
00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:37,899
His children and God's allowing for His glory to be known to those that are watching.

518
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:41,940
If thy strength fail in the day of adversity, if thy faith fail in the day of adversity,

519
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,500
thy strength is small.

520
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,219
See this morning, we understand that His way is perfect.

521
00:28:48,219 --> 00:28:53,859
You can see in Psalm 18, it's the similar passage that we see in 2 Samuel 22, but not

522
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:58,059
only is His way perfect, but He always does right.

523
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:01,219
We cannot say of ourselves that we always do the right thing.

524
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:04,940
In fact, there are many times that we mess things up.

525
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,979
Many of our difficulties are the result of our own doing.

526
00:29:09,979 --> 00:29:12,219
We just mess things up.

527
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:14,539
But the Bible tells us that God always does what's right.

528
00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:22,179
Notice in Genesis 18 and verse 25, in Genesis 18 and verse 25, the Bible tells us in this

529
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:32,539
text of Scripture a great truth.

530
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:39,940
Notice what the Bible says in Genesis 18 and verse 25, that be far from thee to do after

531
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,419
this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous should be as

532
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:45,459
the wicked, that be far from thee.

533
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:52,519
But then notice at the end of the verse, shall not the judge of all the earth do right?

534
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:57,380
Understand that He is the judge of all the earth, and understand that He is righteous.

535
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,699
His way is perfect.

536
00:29:58,699 --> 00:30:00,139
He always does what is right.

537
00:30:00,139 --> 00:30:06,139
It may not be exactly what you desired or you thought was going to be the situation,

538
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:11,139
but as we align ourselves, we commit ourselves, we delight ourselves in the Lord,

539
00:30:11,139 --> 00:30:17,139
commit our way unto Him, and we allow our wills to be influenced by His will,

540
00:30:17,139 --> 00:30:23,139
and our will becomes His will, then we find that we can pray this way,

541
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:26,139
Thy will be done.

542
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:30,139
Not simply a cliche, but sincerely, why?

543
00:30:30,139 --> 00:30:35,139
Because we're recognizing that His will is superior.

544
00:30:35,139 --> 00:30:38,139
His will is superior. His will is best.

545
00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:40,139
And I hope you believe that this morning.

546
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:43,139
I hope this morning, listen, the more time you spend with God,

547
00:30:43,139 --> 00:30:46,139
the more you'll understand it to be the case.

548
00:30:46,139 --> 00:30:51,139
The more time you learn about how sovereign our God is and how powerful our God is

549
00:30:51,139 --> 00:30:55,139
and how He moves and how He works, the more you'll be able to say,

550
00:30:55,139 --> 00:30:59,139
Thy will be done.

551
00:30:59,139 --> 00:31:02,139
Notice with me, not only when we pray, Thy will be done,

552
00:31:02,139 --> 00:31:05,139
does it recognize that His will is superior,

553
00:31:05,139 --> 00:31:10,139
but number two, I believe this, it reveals the submission of God's people.

554
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:15,139
You know, we as the people of God, we are to submit to God.

555
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,139
That's what the Bible says in the book of James, if you will.

556
00:31:17,139 --> 00:31:21,139
And turn over to the book of James, and I want you to see what God tells us.

557
00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:34,139
In James chapter number 4,

558
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:38,139
when we talk about will, we think about submission.

559
00:31:38,139 --> 00:31:40,139
How strong is your will?

560
00:31:40,139 --> 00:31:44,139
I don't know if you ever had, I remember as a kid having an uncle

561
00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:47,139
that wanted to wrestle around.

562
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:51,139
You know what he was trying to do? He was trying to make me submit.

563
00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:54,139
And there were times that he would say something like this to him,

564
00:31:54,139 --> 00:31:57,139
Say uncle.

565
00:31:57,139 --> 00:32:00,139
Anyone ever been in that situation?

566
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:03,139
Any of you struggle to say uncle?

567
00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:07,139
You don't want to surrender. You don't want to submit.

568
00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:10,139
I remember trying with all of my might and all of my strength,

569
00:32:10,139 --> 00:32:16,139
and yet he's several years older than I am, much bigger and stronger than I was at that point as a little child.

570
00:32:16,139 --> 00:32:19,139
And he could do with me whatever he wanted to do.

571
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:22,139
And he was trying to get me to submit.

572
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:25,139
Sometimes it's hard to submit.

573
00:32:25,139 --> 00:32:28,139
Because you have a will. And I have a will.

574
00:32:28,139 --> 00:32:33,139
But when we pray thy will be done, not only are we recognizing that God's will is superior,

575
00:32:33,139 --> 00:32:38,139
but it reveals the submission in our lives to God's will.

576
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:42,139
See, notice in James 4, in verse number 7, notice what the Bible says.

577
00:32:42,139 --> 00:32:49,139
Submit yourselves therefore to God.

578
00:32:49,139 --> 00:32:51,139
Submit yourselves to God.

579
00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:53,139
We see that the Bible continues.

580
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:55,139
Resist the devil and he will flee from you.

581
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,139
Draw nigh to God and he will draw nigh to you.

582
00:32:57,139 --> 00:33:00,139
Cleanse your hands, ye sinners, and purify your hearts, ye double-minded.

583
00:33:00,139 --> 00:33:04,139
In what great truth, in verse 9, be afflicted and mourn and weep.

584
00:33:04,139 --> 00:33:07,139
Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness.

585
00:33:07,139 --> 00:33:11,139
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and he shall lift you up.

586
00:33:11,139 --> 00:33:14,139
You know what is required for submission?

587
00:33:14,139 --> 00:33:16,139
Humility.

588
00:33:16,139 --> 00:33:18,139
Humility.

589
00:33:18,139 --> 00:33:22,139
Without humility, you're never going to submit.

590
00:33:22,139 --> 00:33:24,139
You're just not.

591
00:33:24,139 --> 00:33:26,139
But why should we humble ourselves?

592
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:28,139
Well, we find that God instructs us to.

593
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,139
He says that we're to humble ourselves.

594
00:33:30,139 --> 00:33:33,139
He says that God resisteth the proud, but he gives grace unto the humble.

595
00:33:33,139 --> 00:33:37,139
He says that we're to humble ourselves and that we're to be clothed with humility.

596
00:33:37,139 --> 00:33:41,139
We can read of that as Peter writes in 1 Peter chapter 5.

597
00:33:41,139 --> 00:33:46,139
And by the way, pride.

598
00:33:46,139 --> 00:33:48,139
We said that it requires humility.

599
00:33:48,139 --> 00:33:54,139
Pride is a major issue in many people's lives.

600
00:33:54,139 --> 00:33:56,139
It's my life.

601
00:33:56,139 --> 00:33:58,139
Have you ever heard anyone say that?

602
00:33:58,139 --> 00:34:00,139
I'm going to do what I want to do.

603
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:06,139
Well, there's a problem if you're a Christian because 1 Corinthians 6, 19 and 20 says, what?

604
00:34:06,139 --> 00:34:11,139
Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God?

605
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:15,139
And you're not your own, for you're bought with a price.

606
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:19,139
Therefore, glorify God in your body and your soul, which are his.

607
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,139
See, I'm no longer my own.

608
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:22,139
I've been bought.

609
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,139
You've been bought.

610
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:27,139
With the precious blood of Christ.

611
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:30,139
And therefore, it requires that we have humility in our lives

612
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:33,139
and that that humility leads to submission.

613
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:36,139
And when we pray, thy will be done,

614
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:39,139
what's being evidenced, what's being revealed through that prayer

615
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:43,139
is that we are submitted to God.

616
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:45,139
We're not in rebellion to God.

617
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:51,139
You can read of examples in the Scriptures of those that are in rebellion to God.

618
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:54,139
By the way, it never works out well for them.

619
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,139
Amen?

620
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:58,139
It never works out well for those that are in rebellion to God.

621
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:06,139
Why? Because God's will is going to come to pass.

622
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:14,139
This morning, we recognize, we can speak of the dangers of pride.

623
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:17,139
We can discuss the importance of humility.

624
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:21,139
But I wonder this morning as we examine our prayer lives

625
00:35:21,139 --> 00:35:25,139
and think about these four simple words, thy will be done.

626
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:30,139
Is that submission evidenced in our prayer lives?

627
00:35:30,139 --> 00:35:33,139
I know I've said this before, but I think it's worth repeating.

628
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:39,139
The reality is that there are times in which we bring our petitions before the throne of grace

629
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:41,139
just as we're instructed to do so.

630
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:45,139
And as we're praying, we're going to decide that we're going to help God understand

631
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:54,139
how he can answer our prayers.

632
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:57,139
I've said many times, especially when I worked in the corporate world,

633
00:35:57,139 --> 00:35:59,139
I experienced it on a regular basis.

634
00:35:59,139 --> 00:36:03,139
Those of you that are working in the corporate world probably can identify with this.

635
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:08,139
Many, many times I would find that there's a lot of problem identifiers in the world.

636
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:10,139
Amen? A lot of problem identifiers.

637
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:14,139
But there are a few problem solvers.

638
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:18,139
There are a lot more problem identifiers than there are problem solvers.

639
00:36:18,139 --> 00:36:21,139
And I determined at a young age when I was working in the corporate world

640
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:30,139
that I would never take a problem to a superior without also bringing a solution.

641
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:32,139
Now, it might not be the right solution.

642
00:36:32,139 --> 00:36:38,139
It might not be the one that's incorporated, that's going to be used to fix the problem.

643
00:36:38,139 --> 00:36:42,139
But I did not want to just be a problem identifier.

644
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:47,139
Can I tell you in my Christian walk, that's a little bit of a hindrance.

645
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:52,139
Why? Because sometimes I want to help God on how he can answer my prayers.

646
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:55,139
I'm being transparent with you this morning.

647
00:36:55,139 --> 00:37:01,139
And by the way, I think it's important that each of us would be transparent with God.

648
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:05,139
Because we need to get a grasp of this simple phrase,

649
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:08,139
Thy will be done.

650
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:15,139
And how critical it is in seeing your prayers and my prayers answered.

651
00:37:15,139 --> 00:37:18,139
Thy will be done.

652
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:25,139
It recognizes that his way, his will is superior, but it reveals submission.

653
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:28,139
How submitted are we to God?

654
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:31,139
How much do we resist God's will?

655
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:34,139
God has a plan for the ages, by the way.

656
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:38,139
You understand that. Amen?

657
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:44,139
Right now, God's plan specifically is with the church.

658
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:48,139
We're in what would often be referred to as the church age.

659
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:50,139
You tracking?

660
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:53,139
God has a plan. God has a will.

661
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:56,139
You know what God's plan and God's will is for the church age?

662
00:37:56,139 --> 00:38:00,139
That the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ will be preached to the entire earth.

663
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:03,139
That's God's plan and God's will.

664
00:38:03,139 --> 00:38:06,139
In a summary statement. Amen?

665
00:38:06,139 --> 00:38:10,139
And God tells us in his word that the gospel...

666
00:38:10,139 --> 00:38:12,139
Paul says, I am not ashamed.

667
00:38:12,139 --> 00:38:18,139
We heard the kids last week on Sunday morning do such a wonderful job of quoting the verse in Romans 1.16.

668
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:21,139
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.

669
00:38:21,139 --> 00:38:27,139
Why? For it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth.

670
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:29,139
To the Jew first and also to the Greek.

671
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:30,139
See, because why?

672
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:33,139
Well, because God's plan for the church age is that all people will be saved.

673
00:38:33,139 --> 00:38:36,139
That we proclaim the gospel to all the world.

674
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:38,139
Why do we support missionaries?

675
00:38:38,139 --> 00:38:44,139
Why do we send an offering so that Brother Cottle and his wife can go to Africa to go on a missions trip this summer?

676
00:38:44,139 --> 00:38:52,139
Because we are given the task in this era to preach the gospel to every creature.

677
00:38:52,139 --> 00:38:54,139
God has a plan.

678
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:58,139
The church age is going to end one day.

679
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:00,139
The trumpet of the Lord shall sound.

680
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:02,139
Aren't you looking forward to that?

681
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:05,139
The dead in Christ?

682
00:39:05,139 --> 00:39:07,139
Going to be raised.

683
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:10,139
Then we which are alive and remain, I hope I'm one of those.

684
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,139
So be caught up to meet the Lord in the air.

685
00:39:12,139 --> 00:39:15,139
So shall we ever be with the Lord. Amen?

686
00:39:15,139 --> 00:39:17,139
Hallelujah. The rapture.

687
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:20,139
There's going to be a tribulation.

688
00:39:20,139 --> 00:39:22,139
You know what God's doing in the tribulation?

689
00:39:22,139 --> 00:39:25,139
He's dealing with Israel again.

690
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:27,139
He's dealing with Israel.

691
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:29,139
Because it's God's plan.

692
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:31,139
It's God's plan.

693
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:34,139
You're not going to change God's plan.

694
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:38,139
It doesn't make any sense to resist God's plan.

695
00:39:38,139 --> 00:39:42,139
Because God's plan is going to come to pass.

696
00:39:42,139 --> 00:39:44,139
And so you can resist it.

697
00:39:44,139 --> 00:39:47,139
And you can show your pride.

698
00:39:47,139 --> 00:39:50,139
Or you can submit to it.

699
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:51,139
Amen?

700
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,139
You can submit to it.

701
00:39:53,139 --> 00:39:56,139
You say God has a plan.

702
00:39:56,139 --> 00:40:00,139
God's going to bring His people.

703
00:40:00,139 --> 00:40:08,459
into the land again. It's God's plan. It's God's plan. And we can go on and on and look

704
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:16,099
at God's plan. The problem is that we need to be submissive to God's plan. See, we don't

705
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:22,539
resist God's plan, we submit to God's plan. And when we say, thy will be done, what is

706
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:35,659
God's plan? What is God's will in this moment, in this life, in this day? Thy will be done.

707
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:47,539
Use me, Lord, however you see fit to accomplish your will this day. Submission. Humility.

708
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:57,819
It's on full display. Surrender. We sang this morning, I'll go where you want me to go.

709
00:40:57,819 --> 00:41:03,499
Do what you want me to do. Say what you want me to say. See, that's a song of surrender,

710
00:41:03,499 --> 00:41:09,339
is it not? A song of submission. And this morning when we look at these four simple

711
00:41:09,339 --> 00:41:14,659
words, thy will be done. You know what a lot of problems have been historically? You can

712
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:18,219
look through the Old Testament, you can look through human history. You know what a lot

713
00:41:18,219 --> 00:41:28,219
of problems have been the cause of? Man resisting the will of God. Man resisting the will of

714
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:37,499
God. And it leads to great turmoil. Why? Because you have a strong will. You have a strong

715
00:41:37,499 --> 00:41:46,579
will. And so do I. Therefore, Jesus says, when you pray, yes, there's other pieces of

716
00:41:46,579 --> 00:41:57,859
the framework, but four simple words, thy will be done. I wonder this morning, truly,

717
00:41:57,859 --> 00:42:03,639
I'm not asking you to tell me, I'm asking you to be honest with God. Truly this morning,

718
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:11,919
how much of our will influences our prayer life? If we examine our prayer life, is it

719
00:42:11,919 --> 00:42:16,919
more of, now God, I know that you're sovereign and you can do all things, and so here's my

720
00:42:16,919 --> 00:42:25,399
list of what I want you to do. Because I want you to do what I want you to do. No, that's

721
00:42:25,399 --> 00:42:33,619
not how it works. Thy will be done. And we come to that place of full surrender and submission,

722
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:41,699
say God use me, help me to submit to your plan, to your will, and use me to bring glory

723
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:47,539
to your name. I don't know all that that's going to look like, but can I tell you that

724
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:52,979
it's going to be best? It's going to be perfect. It's going to be right. It's going to accomplish

725
00:42:52,979 --> 00:43:00,099
what it's caused to accomplish. Because we as God's people recognize that His way, His

726
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:07,899
will is superior and we must submit. It reveals submission. I hope this morning, as we kind

727
00:43:07,899 --> 00:43:15,899
of conclude this little mini-series that was born out of 1 Timothy chapter 2, the importance

728
00:43:15,899 --> 00:43:23,659
of prayer, that we would recognize these four simple words. And as you pray today and tomorrow

729
00:43:23,659 --> 00:43:31,499
and this week, that you would be regularly aware of how you're praying. Am I praying

730
00:43:31,499 --> 00:43:40,739
thy will be done? Not as just a cliche, but truly, truly God your will is far superior

731
00:43:40,739 --> 00:43:48,259
than my will. God you know things I could never even begin to comprehend. God I'm just

732
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:52,179
going to submit to you. I'm going to trust you. Thy will be done. Let's pray. Father

733
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:58,059
we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for your word, the truth contained

734
00:43:58,059 --> 00:44:04,219
therein. God I pray this morning that the Holy Spirit of God would take the word of

735
00:44:04,219 --> 00:44:11,899
God and work in the hearts of your people. If there's one that's not sure of heaven,

736
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:15,859
we would love to have an opportunity to take a Bible and show them how they can know for

737
00:44:15,859 --> 00:44:24,059
sure that heaven is their home. God I pray that each of us that are saved, God we truly

738
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:31,539
do some examination this morning of our prayer lives. We all acknowledge that we have a will,

739
00:44:31,539 --> 00:44:36,659
some stronger than others. But the real question this morning is how much influence does our

740
00:44:36,659 --> 00:44:46,419
will have in our prayer lives? How much of our prayer is based on my will and not your

741
00:44:46,419 --> 00:44:59,779
will? How is it that we can truly say not my will, but thine? Lord help us to recognize

742
00:44:59,819 --> 00:45:09,819
that your will is superior. Help us Lord to submit to your will for our lives. Well thank

743
00:45:09,819 --> 00:45:12,859
you for the work that you'll do for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with

744
00:45:12,859 --> 00:45:13,219
me?
