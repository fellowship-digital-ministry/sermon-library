00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.039
But I want you to start in 1 Timothy, chapter number two, if you will, 1 Timothy, chapter

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:05.400
number two.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.640
And of course, we're preaching through the book of 1 and 2 Timothy this year with regard

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.319
to our theme.

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:18.540
And this morning we'll be in the Gospel of Luke as we continue with this subject matter

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.079
of prayer.

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:24.280
But let me remind you in 1 Timothy, chapter number two, beginning in verse number one,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.959
notice the Bible says, I exhort therefore, notice that first of all, supplications, prayers,

00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:34.200
intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.680
You might remember the memory verse from the month of February, verse number eight, I will

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.180
therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.119
And we've dealt with the subject of prayer for a number of weeks now.

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:53.880
We dealt with structure in our prayer lives and how important it is to have that structure,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.240
to have a place and a time.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.919
And we dealt with the fact that we're to pray for leaders.

00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:04.519
And I hope that you've been praying for our leaders and they need prayer and we've been

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.800
commanded to do so.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.199
And God says that it pleases Him when we do that.

00:01:10.199 --> 00:01:15.480
We find that we dealt with the idea of effectual prayer and how can our prayer life, how can

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.680
our prayers be effective?

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.440
He says that we're to lift up holy hands, the necessity of being clean and how sin will

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.239
hinder our prayer lives.

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:25.760
Sin will hinder your prayer life.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.839
The fact that we must be controlled by the spirit of God, the fact that we must understand

00:01:31.839 --> 00:01:38.000
that we pray in confidence, that God hears us and that God answers and He is able.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.559
And what a blessing that is.

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:44.559
And we looked last week at a praying church, the church, the first century church, the

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:45.720
church in the book of Acts.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.319
We find that every time as you look through their history and as God was using them in

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.160
the first century, you read repeatedly that they prayed, they were praying, they, they

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.919
met for prayer and what a blessing to consider the response to many situations that the early

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:06.519
church faced was a response of prayer.

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:12.240
And we mentioned last week specifically there in Acts chapter number 12 dealing with the

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.240
church as they were praying for Peter with the instruction that he soon, or the understanding

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.160
that he soon would be put to death and how God answered prayer and miraculously delivered.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.800
On Wednesday evening, if you were here, I know we have student ministries, some in other

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.399
places of the building, but we dealt with the subject from first Thessalonians five

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:35.119
in verse 17, pray without ceasing.

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:40.199
And what a blessing to understand from that verse of scripture that we have access to

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.559
the throne of grace at any time for any reason.

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:48.479
And what a blessing that is, our God is able and it should have an influence on our attitude

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:49.880
towards prayer.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.759
This morning as we continue with the thought of prayer from first Thessalonians chapter

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:57.520
two, we make our way to Luke chapter number 11.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.440
In Luke chapter number 11, God gives us the record of one disciple making a special request.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.039
The Bible tells us in verse number one that this one disciple, because it says one of

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:13.679
his disciples, said unto him this special request.

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:14.679
What was it?

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:19.679
It was this, Lord, teach us to pray.

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:25.240
I often think about those words and I think about the way in which the disciples could

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.580
have, any one of the disciples could have asked the Lord Jesus Christ to teach them

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.759
a multitude of things.

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:38.720
But we find recorded for us in the pages of scripture is the disciple going to Jesus,

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.720
going to God in the flesh and saying, Lord, teach us to pray.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.800
The next few verses of scripture, we find that the Lord Jesus Christ teaches on the

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.399
subject matter of prayer.

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:58.759
I would say this, that Jesus provides for us in this text of scripture a model or a

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:01.600
pattern for prayer.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.559
He says, by the way, when you pray, not if you pray, the expectation is that we as God's

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:09.919
people will be engaged in prayer.

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:15.199
And we find that he provides us with this pattern, this framework, if you will, for

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:16.200
prayer.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.839
This is not the Lord's prayer, although it's often referred to as being the Lord's prayer.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.239
It's a model prayer.

00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:27.359
The Lord's prayer, I believe you can read in John chapter 17, and what a great prayer

00:04:27.359 --> 00:04:28.519
that is.

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:33.000
But we find here this model framework, if you will, the pattern.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.679
By the way, it's not a prayer that we should just repeat.

00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:42.799
It's not a repetitive idea that we memorize the pattern that he establishes here and we

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:44.119
just pray that.

00:04:44.119 --> 00:04:47.799
No, he's just simply providing us with a pattern.

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:53.760
Notice with me in verse number two, and he, Jesus, said unto them, the disciples are there,

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.440
and we find that one, according to verse number one, says, Lord, teach us to pray, as John

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.359
also taught his disciples, and he, Jesus, said unto them, when ye pray, say, Our Father

00:05:05.359 --> 00:05:08.040
which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.720
By the way, we ought to recognize who we're praying to.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.720
The God of the universe.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.920
But not only the God of the universe, our Father.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.880
See prayer is a privilege for the children of God, the people of God, those that have

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.040
been saved by the grace of God, that know that they're going to heaven to be with God

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.040
for all of eternity.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.359
And he says, when you pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

00:05:29.359 --> 00:05:30.359
He's holy.

00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:33.679
We must never forget that our God is holy.

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:38.399
Notice the Bible says, Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:43.239
Give us day by day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:49.959
that is indebted to us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:55.200
In verse number two, there are, tucked within the instruction that I've just read in verses

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.320
two through four, there are four words that I want to draw our attention to this morning.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.959
These four words, I believe, are critical for us to understand.

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:11.000
In fact, these four words, I believe, will have a major impact on your prayer life and

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.640
on my prayer life.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.459
Those four words, if you've already looked at the back of the bulletin, serve as our

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:21.339
title for the message this morning, Thy will be done.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.540
Thy will be done.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:30.100
Let me ask you this morning, how strong is your will?

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.500
How strong is your will?

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.980
You know, for some, we have a stronger will than others.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:41.260
We, if you are a parent, you have had the privilege of raising children.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:47.019
You know at times that some children have a stronger will than other children.

00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:52.619
Maybe you were the child that your parents said you have a strong will.

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:56.100
We understand that terminology.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.339
But I wonder this morning, if you were to evaluate your own life, how strong is your

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:01.820
will?

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.140
And as a follow-up to that question, let me ask this question.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:16.459
How much influence does your will and my will have on our prayer lives?

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:23.820
I think if we're not careful, sometimes our prayer lives can be influenced more by our

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:29.420
wills than by His will.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.779
And this morning as we look at this text of Scripture, and again, we've looked at a variety

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:38.899
of aspects of prayer over the last several weeks, and I very quickly, through introduction

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:43.260
this morning, gave you kind of a summary and overview of each of the last messages that

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.220
I preached on the subject of prayer.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:55.579
But we find this morning that these four words, I mean they're simple words, thy will be done.

00:07:55.579 --> 00:07:58.760
But each of us have a will.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.100
Each of us have a will.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:08.140
We believe this morning that as we understand our will, and you know how strong your will

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:14.899
is, and you know how submissive you are to the will of God, but if we're not careful,

00:08:14.899 --> 00:08:21.660
our will influences our prayer lives more than God's will influences our prayer lives.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:30.700
How can we, how can you, how can I this morning, how can we truly say, not my will, but thine?

00:08:30.859 --> 00:08:32.859
But thine be done.

00:08:32.859 --> 00:08:38.020
Because we all have a will, we all have a desire, and this morning we find it tucked

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:43.820
within these verses of Scripture, the instruction, thy will be done.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:49.260
As we examine this truth and these four words this morning, this might be one of the most

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:55.099
critical aspects of prayer that I've dealt with in the last several weeks.

00:08:55.099 --> 00:08:57.380
Thy will be done.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.780
How do we determine God's will?

00:08:59.859 --> 00:09:02.260
Well, God's will is revealed to us in His Word.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.500
We must be students of the Word.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.260
We're to pray according to His will, according to the truth that we receive in 1 John 5,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.500
14, and 15.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:14.859
We find that as even looking at the text of Scripture in 1 Timothy 2, verses 1 through

00:09:14.859 --> 00:09:20.739
8, tucked, I preached a message on it, God's will for humanity, because tucked within the

00:09:20.739 --> 00:09:26.700
instruction of prayer in 1 Timothy 2 is really a parenthetical statement that God gives us

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:33.659
and reveals to us what His will is for mankind.

00:09:33.659 --> 00:09:37.739
How is it that I can align my will with God's will?

00:09:37.739 --> 00:09:44.059
Because that's really what it boils down to, is how is it that we can align our will with

00:09:44.059 --> 00:09:45.059
God's will?

00:09:45.059 --> 00:09:46.059
Take your Bible quickly, if you will.

00:09:46.059 --> 00:09:48.380
Turn to the book of Psalm, Psalm 37.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:55.539
I believe in Psalm 37, God gives us some really nuggets of truth, some indicators, if you

00:09:55.539 --> 00:10:00.099
will, for how we, as God's people, can align our will.

00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:07.099
with His will, because Jesus, in responding to the request of the disciple,

00:10:07.099 --> 00:10:12.099
Lord, teach us to pray, gave this framework, this pattern for prayer,

00:10:12.099 --> 00:10:15.099
and within the framework, He says,

00:10:15.099 --> 00:10:18.099
Thy will be done.

00:10:18.099 --> 00:10:22.099
In Psalm chapter 37, the Bible says this in verse number 3.

00:10:22.099 --> 00:10:24.099
I'm going to look at verses 3 through 7.

00:10:24.099 --> 00:10:25.099
Notice what the Bible says.

00:10:25.099 --> 00:10:27.099
Trust in the Lord and do good.

00:10:27.099 --> 00:10:30.099
So shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.

00:10:30.099 --> 00:10:35.099
Delight thyself also in the Lord, and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart.

00:10:35.099 --> 00:10:40.099
How many times have you heard verse 4 taken completely out of context?

00:10:40.099 --> 00:10:43.099
God said He'll give us the desires of our heart.

00:10:43.099 --> 00:10:46.099
Read the whole verse. Amen?

00:10:46.099 --> 00:10:49.099
Verse 5, notice, commit thy way unto the Lord.

00:10:49.099 --> 00:10:53.099
Trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to pass.

00:10:53.099 --> 00:10:56.099
And He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light,

00:10:56.099 --> 00:10:58.099
and thy judgment as the noonday.

00:10:58.099 --> 00:11:01.099
Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him.

00:11:01.099 --> 00:11:05.099
Fret not thyself because of Him, who prospereth in His way

00:11:05.099 --> 00:11:09.099
because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.

00:11:09.099 --> 00:11:14.099
There are four nuggets of truth within these verses of Scripture that God gives us

00:11:14.099 --> 00:11:17.099
that I believe will help us, they will aid us

00:11:17.099 --> 00:11:21.099
in having our will aligned with God's will.

00:11:22.099 --> 00:11:26.099
And notice with me in verses 3 and also in verse number 5,

00:11:26.099 --> 00:11:30.099
the Bible says, trust in the Lord.

00:11:30.099 --> 00:11:32.099
Trust in the Lord.

00:11:32.099 --> 00:11:35.099
It says in verse number 5, trust also in Him.

00:11:35.099 --> 00:11:38.099
You know, it's important that we trust Him.

00:11:38.099 --> 00:11:42.099
The Bible says, trust in the Lord with all thine heart.

00:11:42.099 --> 00:11:45.099
Not part of it, not most of it, but with all of it.

00:11:45.099 --> 00:11:48.099
We find that we sing the song, trust and obey,

00:11:48.099 --> 00:11:53.099
and there's no other way to be happy in Jesus but to trust and obey.

00:11:53.099 --> 00:11:55.099
Trusting Jesus, simply trusting.

00:11:55.099 --> 00:11:59.099
I'm so glad I learned to trust Him, the songwriter said.

00:11:59.099 --> 00:12:02.099
And indeed, our God is trustworthy.

00:12:02.099 --> 00:12:05.099
And He says to His people that we're to trust in the Lord.

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:09.099
Notice verse number 4, the instruction, the nugget of truth given to us,

00:12:09.099 --> 00:12:13.099
delight thyself also in the Lord.

00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:16.099
On the front of our bulletins for today,

00:12:16.099 --> 00:12:19.099
if you looked at it, is Psalm 1611.

00:12:19.099 --> 00:12:22.099
And thy presence is fullness of joy.

00:12:22.099 --> 00:12:25.099
And what a blessing to enter into the presence of God,

00:12:25.099 --> 00:12:28.099
to understand the joy that God gives as we enter into His presence.

00:12:28.099 --> 00:12:32.099
But we delight thyself also in the Lord.

00:12:32.099 --> 00:12:35.099
And as we delight ourselves in the Lord, notice it says,

00:12:35.099 --> 00:12:39.099
and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart.

00:12:39.099 --> 00:12:42.099
I believe this morning as we look at this truth,

00:12:42.099 --> 00:12:46.099
and we actually see it in Psalm 21 and verse number 2,

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:49.099
thou hast given him his heart's desire,

00:12:49.099 --> 00:12:52.099
and hast not withholding the request of his lips.

00:12:52.099 --> 00:12:55.099
I believe that as we delight ourselves in the Lord,

00:12:55.099 --> 00:13:01.099
that our desires are really God's desires.

00:13:01.099 --> 00:13:05.099
So what happens is God's desires become our desires.

00:13:05.099 --> 00:13:08.099
I wonder this morning, before you got saved,

00:13:08.099 --> 00:13:11.099
were there certain desires or ambitions that you had,

00:13:11.099 --> 00:13:13.099
somebody said to you when you were a teenager,

00:13:13.099 --> 00:13:16.099
if you were not saved at that point in your life,

00:13:16.099 --> 00:13:18.099
they said, hey, what do you want to do with your life?

00:13:18.099 --> 00:13:20.099
I mean, what are you going to do?

00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:22.099
And we have our desires, our ambitions,

00:13:22.099 --> 00:13:25.099
our ideas of what we're going to do.

00:13:25.099 --> 00:13:29.099
And then we understand that as we look at the truth of God's word,

00:13:29.099 --> 00:13:31.099
that we are His children.

00:13:31.099 --> 00:13:33.099
And if we delight ourselves in the Lord,

00:13:33.099 --> 00:13:37.099
His desires really become our desires.

00:13:37.099 --> 00:13:40.099
The more time you spend with the Lord,

00:13:40.099 --> 00:13:42.099
the more that you're in His presence,

00:13:42.099 --> 00:13:44.099
the more that you're trusting Him,

00:13:44.099 --> 00:13:48.099
the more that His will and His desire

00:13:48.099 --> 00:13:51.099
becomes your will and your desire.

00:13:51.099 --> 00:13:53.099
It's found in His word,

00:13:53.099 --> 00:13:57.099
how much time we must spend in God's word every day of our lives.

00:13:57.099 --> 00:14:01.099
Notice with me in verse number 5,

00:14:01.099 --> 00:14:05.099
commit thy way unto the Lord.

00:14:05.099 --> 00:14:07.099
And then we see again, trust also in Him.

00:14:07.099 --> 00:14:09.099
So we are told to trust in the Lord.

00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:11.099
We're told to delight thyself also in the Lord.

00:14:11.099 --> 00:14:15.099
We're told to commit thy way unto the Lord, trusting Him.

00:14:15.099 --> 00:14:18.099
Listen, because we know who He is,

00:14:18.099 --> 00:14:22.099
then we can commit our way unto Him.

00:14:22.099 --> 00:14:24.099
And then we find in verse number 7,

00:14:24.099 --> 00:14:28.099
notice these words, rest in the Lord.

00:14:28.099 --> 00:14:30.099
Rest in the Lord.

00:14:30.099 --> 00:14:34.099
You know, when we look at the truth that God gives us here in Psalm 37

00:14:34.099 --> 00:14:36.099
in verses 3 through 7,

00:14:36.099 --> 00:14:40.099
these four nuggets of truth as we seek to answer the question,

00:14:40.099 --> 00:14:44.099
how can I align my will with God's will?

00:14:44.099 --> 00:14:47.099
We find that it's necessary that we're in His presence,

00:14:47.099 --> 00:14:49.099
that we're trusting Him, that we're delighting in Him,

00:14:49.099 --> 00:14:51.099
that we're committing our way unto Him,

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:55.099
that we're resting in Him.

00:14:55.099 --> 00:14:59.099
This morning as we think about the subject of prayer

00:14:59.099 --> 00:15:01.099
and looking at these four words,

00:15:01.099 --> 00:15:04.099
thy will be done,

00:15:04.099 --> 00:15:05.099
two thoughts for you this morning.

00:15:05.099 --> 00:15:07.099
When we pray thy will be done,

00:15:07.099 --> 00:15:16.099
number one, we recognize that His will or His way is superior.

00:15:16.099 --> 00:15:20.099
When we pray, thy will be done.

00:15:20.099 --> 00:15:24.099
Now understand, that's not just a cliche that we add to the end of a prayer.

00:15:24.099 --> 00:15:26.099
And when you read James 4,

00:15:26.099 --> 00:15:28.099
and the Bible says that we ought to say,

00:15:28.099 --> 00:15:29.099
if the Lord is willing,

00:15:29.099 --> 00:15:31.099
that's not just a cliche that we say.

00:15:31.099 --> 00:15:34.099
Now sometimes we'll say, hey, Lord willing, we'll see you,

00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:35.099
and we might use that,

00:15:35.099 --> 00:15:38.099
and it can become cliche-ish.

00:15:38.099 --> 00:15:41.099
But you understand, it's not to be a cliche.

00:15:41.099 --> 00:15:42.099
It is the Lord's will.

00:15:42.099 --> 00:15:44.099
We desire to know the Lord's will.

00:15:44.099 --> 00:15:47.099
We understand this morning we are gathered here

00:15:47.099 --> 00:15:49.099
because it's God's will.

00:15:49.099 --> 00:15:52.099
God says not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together

00:15:52.099 --> 00:15:53.099
as the manner of some is,

00:15:53.099 --> 00:15:55.099
but exhorting one another,

00:15:55.099 --> 00:15:57.099
and so much the more as you see the day approaching.

00:15:57.099 --> 00:16:00.099
We are gathered together because it's God's will.

00:16:00.099 --> 00:16:02.099
I am preaching the word this morning

00:16:02.099 --> 00:16:04.099
because it's God's will.

00:16:04.099 --> 00:16:05.099
He said preach the word,

00:16:05.099 --> 00:16:07.099
be instant in season, out of season,

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:08.099
reprove, rebuke, exhort,

00:16:08.099 --> 00:16:11.099
with all longsuffering and doctrine.

00:16:11.099 --> 00:16:13.099
He says, yes, the time will come.

00:16:13.099 --> 00:16:14.099
I think we're there,

00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:17.099
that men will not endorse sound doctrine.

00:16:17.099 --> 00:16:19.099
Nevertheless, we are to continue,

00:16:19.099 --> 00:16:22.099
and we are to preach the word.

00:16:22.099 --> 00:16:27.099
We do this at God's will.

00:16:27.099 --> 00:16:29.099
And when we delight ourselves in the Lord,

00:16:29.099 --> 00:16:30.099
when we're trusting Him,

00:16:30.099 --> 00:16:31.099
and committing our way to Him,

00:16:31.099 --> 00:16:32.099
and we're resting in Him,

00:16:32.099 --> 00:16:36.099
God's will becomes our will.

00:16:36.099 --> 00:16:40.099
I hope no one had to drag you to church this morning.

00:16:40.099 --> 00:16:42.099
Honestly.

00:16:42.099 --> 00:16:44.099
I know sometimes you might think about that

00:16:44.099 --> 00:16:45.099
with little kids or something,

00:16:45.099 --> 00:16:46.099
but I hope this morning,

00:16:46.099 --> 00:16:48.099
listen, when I wake up on Sunday,

00:16:48.099 --> 00:16:51.099
man, I am so excited

00:16:51.099 --> 00:16:53.099
about the opportunity that God gives us

00:16:53.099 --> 00:16:56.099
to gather as the people of God

00:16:56.099 --> 00:16:58.099
on the Lord's day to celebrate the resurrection

00:16:58.099 --> 00:17:00.099
because every Sunday that we meet

00:17:00.099 --> 00:17:02.099
is because we serve a risen Savior,

00:17:02.099 --> 00:17:05.099
and we get to be in church.

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:07.099
And you say, well, you're the pastor.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:09.099
Listen, after I got saved,

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:12.099
I wanted to be with God's people.

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.099
You know how many times I wanted to go to church

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:15.099
before I got saved?

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:16.099
Zero.

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:18.099
Honestly.

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:20.099
I remember my dad coming home from work,

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:22.099
and he said, we're going to go to church on Sunday.

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:24.099
I said, we're doing what?

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:25.099
I was almost 13 years old.

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:26.099
I was a teenager.

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:28.099
I had other things that I did on Sunday.

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:30.099
I'm just being honest.

00:17:30.099 --> 00:17:31.099
And dad said, we're going to church.

00:17:31.099 --> 00:17:32.099
We're doing what?

00:17:32.099 --> 00:17:34.099
And then my dad got saved,

00:17:34.099 --> 00:17:36.099
and we're going to church for Sunday school

00:17:36.099 --> 00:17:37.099
and Sunday morning and Sunday evening

00:17:37.099 --> 00:17:40.099
and Wednesday night and Saturday bus visitation,

00:17:40.099 --> 00:17:42.099
and he's all in.

00:17:42.099 --> 00:17:44.099
My dad never went to church,

00:17:44.099 --> 00:17:46.099
but he got saved by the grace of God.

00:17:46.099 --> 00:17:49.099
He's in church.

00:17:49.099 --> 00:17:51.099
I remember before I got saved,

00:17:51.099 --> 00:17:53.099
I didn't want to be in church,

00:17:53.099 --> 00:17:55.099
but some of you can testify.

00:17:55.099 --> 00:17:57.099
Mickey was testifying this morning in Sunday school.

00:17:57.099 --> 00:18:00.099
You know what happens when you can't be in church?

00:18:00.099 --> 00:18:02.099
Man, you miss it.

00:18:02.099 --> 00:18:04.099
Why? Because I want to be with the people of God.

00:18:04.099 --> 00:18:07.099
With the people of God.

00:18:07.099 --> 00:18:09.099
And so we're gathered because it's God's will,

00:18:09.099 --> 00:18:11.099
but we understand this morning

00:18:11.099 --> 00:18:13.099
that when we pray, thy will be done,

00:18:13.099 --> 00:18:14.099
when we pray that way,

00:18:14.099 --> 00:18:17.099
we're recognizing that His will,

00:18:17.099 --> 00:18:21.099
that His way is superior.

00:18:21.099 --> 00:18:23.099
You might think that your will is best.

00:18:23.099 --> 00:18:25.099
You might think that your way is best.

00:18:25.099 --> 00:18:27.099
I mean, this is the best thing ever,

00:18:27.099 --> 00:18:29.099
but I guarantee you this morning

00:18:29.099 --> 00:18:32.099
that God's way is best.

00:18:32.099 --> 00:18:36.099
God's will, thy will, be done.

00:18:36.099 --> 00:18:39.099
He is eternal.

00:18:39.099 --> 00:18:41.099
He is sovereign.

00:18:41.099 --> 00:18:43.099
He is in control of all things.

00:18:43.099 --> 00:18:45.099
He alone has all power.

00:18:45.099 --> 00:18:47.099
He alone has all wisdom.

00:18:47.099 --> 00:18:49.099
Amen?

00:18:49.099 --> 00:18:51.099
Wisdom didn't begin with you.

00:18:51.099 --> 00:18:52.099
It doesn't end with you.

00:18:52.099 --> 00:18:54.099
Hallelujah.

00:18:54.099 --> 00:18:56.099
Our God is the all-wise God.

00:18:56.099 --> 00:18:59.099
And we find here that the God

00:18:59.099 --> 00:19:01.099
who alone has all power and all wisdom,

00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:03.099
that He is our God.

00:19:03.099 --> 00:19:04.099
He is our Father.

00:19:04.099 --> 00:19:05.099
He is holy.

00:19:05.099 --> 00:19:07.099
And when we look at the instruction

00:19:07.099 --> 00:19:08.099
that Jesus gives,

00:19:08.099 --> 00:19:10.099
He says, thy will be done.

00:19:10.099 --> 00:19:12.099
Why does He say that to the disciples?

00:19:12.099 --> 00:19:14.099
Why are these four words

00:19:14.099 --> 00:19:16.099
tucked within the instruction?

00:19:16.099 --> 00:19:19.099
Because it's so important for God's people,

00:19:19.099 --> 00:19:22.099
for the children of God to understand

00:19:22.099 --> 00:19:24.099
that God's will is best,

00:19:24.099 --> 00:19:26.099
to recognize that,

00:19:26.099 --> 00:19:28.099
that God's way is best.

00:19:28.099 --> 00:19:31.099
And we must pray thy will be done.

00:19:31.099 --> 00:19:34.099
God always has a plan.

00:19:34.099 --> 00:19:36.099
Always.

00:19:36.099 --> 00:19:38.099
Nothing ever surprises God.

00:19:38.099 --> 00:19:39.099
You ever been in a situation

00:19:39.099 --> 00:19:41.099
where you were surprised by something?

00:19:41.099 --> 00:19:42.099
Maybe you said something like this.

00:19:42.099 --> 00:19:43.099
I didn't see this coming.

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:45.099
I didn't plan for this.

00:19:45.099 --> 00:19:47.099
But I can guarantee you this morning

00:19:47.099 --> 00:19:51.099
that that's never happened to God.

00:19:51.099 --> 00:19:53.099
The start of human history

00:19:53.099 --> 00:19:56.099
when sin entered into the world.

00:19:56.099 --> 00:19:58.099
When Satan tempted in the garden Eve

00:19:58.099 --> 00:20:00.099
and she partook of the fruit,

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:02.679
also ate likewise."

00:20:02.679 --> 00:20:04.519
That was not a surprise to God.

00:20:04.519 --> 00:20:09.779
For God tells us in His Word that Jesus is the Lamb of God slain before the foundation

00:20:09.779 --> 00:20:10.779
of the world.

00:20:10.779 --> 00:20:12.479
Provision had already been made.

00:20:12.479 --> 00:20:17.599
He already understood because nothing surprises God.

00:20:17.599 --> 00:20:20.959
Thy will be done.

00:20:20.959 --> 00:20:26.239
Again, I asked you in the beginning of the message this morning, how strong is your will?

00:20:26.239 --> 00:20:31.399
I asked you in the beginning of the message this morning, how much does your will influence

00:20:31.399 --> 00:20:32.859
your prayer life?

00:20:32.859 --> 00:20:38.319
How much of our will are we praying versus God's will are we praying?

00:20:38.319 --> 00:20:43.039
It requires that we do some examination of our prayer lives.

00:20:43.039 --> 00:20:45.519
Thy will be done.

00:20:45.519 --> 00:20:50.399
Notice with me, God's way is perfect.

00:20:50.399 --> 00:20:53.559
Have you ever met anyone that they thought their way was perfect?

00:20:53.559 --> 00:20:55.999
I mean, you can't do it any better.

00:20:55.999 --> 00:20:59.439
You have to do it their way because it is the only way to do something.

00:20:59.439 --> 00:21:01.839
I can tell you this morning that God's way is perfect.

00:21:01.839 --> 00:21:03.559
That's what the Bible tells us.

00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:06.159
Turn to the book of 2 Samuel, if you will.

00:21:06.159 --> 00:21:10.879
And this is important for us to understand as we go through this understanding of this

00:21:10.879 --> 00:21:15.479
critical instruction, these four simple words, thy will be done.

00:21:15.479 --> 00:21:20.799
In 2 Samuel chapter 22 and verse number 31, we find this is the song of David.

00:21:20.799 --> 00:21:23.119
And I want you to see what David says.

00:21:23.159 --> 00:21:27.199
Now, David had some great triumphs during his life.

00:21:27.199 --> 00:21:28.479
Would you agree this morning?

00:21:28.479 --> 00:21:30.799
I mean, David had some great triumphs during his life.

00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:34.919
I mean, some amazing things happened during the life of David.

00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:39.199
But David also dealt with some great opposition.

00:21:39.199 --> 00:21:44.359
I'm not simply talking about the opposition and the difficulty that David endured after

00:21:44.359 --> 00:21:45.799
the sin with Bathsheba.

00:21:45.799 --> 00:21:51.159
I'm talking about difficulties that he had just as he was seeking to do the will of God.

00:21:51.159 --> 00:21:53.079
Just as he was seeking to follow the Lord.

00:21:53.079 --> 00:21:57.319
He didn't ask to be anointed to be the next king of Israel.

00:21:57.319 --> 00:21:59.159
Amen?

00:21:59.159 --> 00:22:02.139
God chose him to be the next king of Israel.

00:22:02.139 --> 00:22:06.799
He simply was ministering to Saul and Saul wanted to kill him.

00:22:06.799 --> 00:22:10.519
Saul made it his number one agenda.

00:22:10.519 --> 00:22:13.399
Most important thing, kill David.

00:22:13.399 --> 00:22:15.519
God spared him.

00:22:15.519 --> 00:22:21.599
We can read on a number of occasions how David was miraculously spared by God and how David

00:22:21.599 --> 00:22:25.119
testified even while he's on the run that there's but a step between me and death.

00:22:25.119 --> 00:22:29.719
But yet God preserved his life and God did bring him to the place of being king.

00:22:29.719 --> 00:22:34.199
And I want you to see what David says near the end of his life in 2 Samuel 22 and verse

00:22:34.199 --> 00:22:43.959
number 31, as for God, his way is perfect.

00:22:43.959 --> 00:22:44.959
His way is perfect.

00:22:44.959 --> 00:22:49.879
You say, well, what about that his way is perfect?

00:22:49.879 --> 00:22:50.879
I didn't see this coming.

00:22:50.879 --> 00:22:51.879
I didn't plan for this.

00:22:51.879 --> 00:22:52.879
That's not what I...

00:22:52.879 --> 00:22:54.359
His way is perfect.

00:22:54.359 --> 00:22:55.879
Why?

00:22:55.879 --> 00:22:56.879
Because he has a purpose.

00:22:56.879 --> 00:22:58.759
He has a plan.

00:22:58.759 --> 00:23:00.759
And his way is perfect.

00:23:00.759 --> 00:23:06.019
And we find that in his plan and in his purpose and understanding this morning that his way

00:23:06.019 --> 00:23:13.719
is perfect, we understand that he has a purpose ultimately, primarily, his purpose is to bring

00:23:13.719 --> 00:23:16.519
honor and glory to himself.

00:23:16.519 --> 00:23:19.999
Ultimately that's the purpose, the plan.

00:23:20.119 --> 00:23:21.119
How is he going to do that?

00:23:21.119 --> 00:23:22.959
A variety of ways.

00:23:22.959 --> 00:23:28.039
But we find this morning that as we look at David and he gives this testimony, his way

00:23:28.039 --> 00:23:29.479
is perfect.

00:23:29.479 --> 00:23:31.919
Notice the word of the Lord is tried.

00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:37.519
He is a buckler to all them that trust in him, a shield.

00:23:37.519 --> 00:23:44.479
Do you remember Psalm 37 twice in those verses of Scripture, trust in the Lord.

00:23:44.479 --> 00:23:52.359
And we find here this morning that when we understand thy will be done, we are recognizing

00:23:52.359 --> 00:24:01.039
when we pray that way, when our prayer life is influenced and impacted by this phrase,

00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:07.719
we are recognizing that his way, his will is best.

00:24:07.719 --> 00:24:08.939
It's best.

00:24:08.939 --> 00:24:10.799
You say, well, it might not be what I've chosen.

00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:13.239
You don't know what God's going to do.

00:24:13.239 --> 00:24:16.159
You don't know how God is going to work.

00:24:16.159 --> 00:24:20.559
The book of Philippians in the first chapter, Paul says to the believers in Philippi, I

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:21.939
want you to understand something.

00:24:21.939 --> 00:24:25.399
What I want you to understand is that the things that have happened to me have happened

00:24:25.399 --> 00:24:29.359
for the furtherance of the gospel.

00:24:29.359 --> 00:24:30.679
Praise God.

00:24:30.679 --> 00:24:35.759
In chapter number four, he speaks about those of Caesar's household that send their greetings.

00:24:35.759 --> 00:24:40.919
No doubt they heard the gospel because Paul was imprisoned.

00:24:40.919 --> 00:24:43.819
You say, well, I don't want to be in prison.

00:24:43.819 --> 00:24:48.919
You can read of many countless that have gone on before us that have suffered.

00:24:48.919 --> 00:24:56.039
They faced persecution and difficulty and we find that in so doing, God was glorified.

00:24:56.039 --> 00:25:04.039
Souls were saved and lives were changed because of their submission to God's plan and God's

00:25:04.039 --> 00:25:05.039
will.

00:25:05.039 --> 00:25:08.739
See, God's way is perfect.

00:25:08.739 --> 00:25:13.859
You might think that your way is perfect, but you're mistaken.

00:25:13.859 --> 00:25:15.619
Our way is not perfect.

00:25:15.619 --> 00:25:17.299
God's way is perfect.

00:25:17.299 --> 00:25:27.119
I think this morning about some very new situation, really kind of, you know, overwhelming if

00:25:27.119 --> 00:25:32.499
you will for the Scholl family, but I think about having communication with Brother Scholl

00:25:32.499 --> 00:25:38.179
this week and understanding that his wife has been diagnosed with cancer and they're

00:25:38.179 --> 00:25:40.739
in Greenland and they can't get medical treatment.

00:25:40.739 --> 00:25:41.739
What do they do?

00:25:41.739 --> 00:25:48.659
And they're believing that God can heal her, but they're praying that God's will would

00:25:48.659 --> 00:25:49.659
be accomplished.

00:25:49.659 --> 00:25:55.139
You know, it's really exciting when I read the correspondence and had the opportunity

00:25:55.139 --> 00:26:01.819
to have some conversation via text and email with the family, understanding that they said

00:26:01.819 --> 00:26:02.819
this.

00:26:02.819 --> 00:26:05.779
They said, you know, there's some people that we've been ministering to for a long time

00:26:05.779 --> 00:26:06.779
in Greenland.

00:26:07.779 --> 00:26:08.779
You know what they're doing?

00:26:08.779 --> 00:26:11.779
They're watching us right now.

00:26:11.779 --> 00:26:12.779
You know what they want to know?

00:26:12.779 --> 00:26:15.279
They want to know if our God's real.

00:26:15.279 --> 00:26:20.259
They want to know that if the God that we tell them they should trust in, if we're going

00:26:20.259 --> 00:26:23.819
to trust in Him in our moment of crisis.

00:26:23.819 --> 00:26:28.379
Have you ever considered that this morning?

00:26:28.379 --> 00:26:30.819
We tell people that God is trustworthy.

00:26:30.819 --> 00:26:36.779
I referenced last week on Wednesday evening when we dealt with that subject of prayer

00:26:36.779 --> 00:26:41.859
and developing our attitude towards prayer, and we looked at a text of Scripture in Ezra

00:26:41.859 --> 00:26:47.619
chapter number 8 where Ezra was ashamed to ask for a group of soldiers to come and to

00:26:47.619 --> 00:26:49.859
help them along the way against the enemy.

00:26:49.859 --> 00:26:50.859
Why?

00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:55.119
Because we've already told the king that our God is great, that our God is able.

00:26:55.119 --> 00:26:57.979
So then I'm not going to go to the king and say, by the way, can we have some soldiers

00:26:57.979 --> 00:27:00.699
and some army, some folks to help us along the way?

00:27:00.699 --> 00:27:04.699
No, we're trusting our God is going to protect us.

00:27:04.699 --> 00:27:06.579
And guess what happened in Ezra?

00:27:06.579 --> 00:27:08.659
They made it to Jerusalem.

00:27:08.659 --> 00:27:12.019
They made it to Jerusalem.

00:27:12.019 --> 00:27:14.619
They said there's going to be some people that are going to be watching us.

00:27:14.619 --> 00:27:16.459
You know there are people watching you today.

00:27:16.459 --> 00:27:24.419
You say, why are we dealing with this, whatever it is, health issue, financial issue, a hardship

00:27:25.219 --> 00:27:30.819
with a family situation, whatever it is, God's way.

00:27:30.819 --> 00:27:34.819
We must align our will with God's will.

00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:36.219
We must seek God's face.

00:27:36.219 --> 00:27:37.219
We must know.

00:27:37.219 --> 00:27:40.859
And when we pray, we pray, thy will be done.

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:42.019
You know how the Shoals are praying?

00:27:42.019 --> 00:27:45.579
They're praying that some of those people they've been trying to reach for years will

00:27:45.579 --> 00:27:47.479
be saved.

00:27:47.479 --> 00:27:50.139
Some have already said, we're going to be in church.

00:27:50.139 --> 00:27:53.699
Now they're not even there right now.

00:27:53.699 --> 00:27:55.499
They're going to come to church.

00:27:55.499 --> 00:27:59.299
That's exciting.

00:27:59.299 --> 00:28:00.299
Is it okay in your life?

00:28:00.299 --> 00:28:03.499
Is it okay in my life if we allow God to have His way?

00:28:03.499 --> 00:28:07.779
You understand what I mean?

00:28:07.779 --> 00:28:09.739
I understand that we don't want hardships.

00:28:09.739 --> 00:28:13.699
I'm the last person on the face of the earth that wants a difficulty, honestly.

00:28:13.699 --> 00:28:16.019
I like it when things go easy, Brother Armando.

00:28:16.019 --> 00:28:18.819
I really do.

00:28:18.939 --> 00:28:26.379
But sometimes in the midst of those hardships, God's proving Himself and God's developing

00:28:26.379 --> 00:28:37.899
His children and God's allowing for His glory to be known to those that are watching.

00:28:37.899 --> 00:28:41.940
If thy strength fail in the day of adversity, if thy faith fail in the day of adversity,

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.500
thy strength is small.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:48.219
See this morning, we understand that His way is perfect.

00:28:48.219 --> 00:28:53.859
You can see in Psalm 18, it's the similar passage that we see in 2 Samuel 22, but not

00:28:53.859 --> 00:28:58.059
only is His way perfect, but He always does right.

00:28:58.059 --> 00:29:01.219
We cannot say of ourselves that we always do the right thing.

00:29:01.219 --> 00:29:04.940
In fact, there are many times that we mess things up.

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:09.979
Many of our difficulties are the result of our own doing.

00:29:09.979 --> 00:29:12.219
We just mess things up.

00:29:12.219 --> 00:29:14.539
But the Bible tells us that God always does what's right.

00:29:14.539 --> 00:29:22.179
Notice in Genesis 18 and verse 25, in Genesis 18 and verse 25, the Bible tells us in this

00:29:22.179 --> 00:29:32.539
text of Scripture a great truth.

00:29:32.539 --> 00:29:39.940
Notice what the Bible says in Genesis 18 and verse 25, that be far from thee to do after

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:43.419
this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous should be as

00:29:43.419 --> 00:29:45.459
the wicked, that be far from thee.

00:29:45.459 --> 00:29:52.519
But then notice at the end of the verse, shall not the judge of all the earth do right?

00:29:52.519 --> 00:29:57.380
Understand that He is the judge of all the earth, and understand that He is righteous.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.699
His way is perfect.

00:29:58.699 --> 00:30:00.139
He always does what is right.

00:30:00.139 --> 00:30:06.139
It may not be exactly what you desired or you thought was going to be the situation,

00:30:06.139 --> 00:30:11.139
but as we align ourselves, we commit ourselves, we delight ourselves in the Lord,

00:30:11.139 --> 00:30:17.139
commit our way unto Him, and we allow our wills to be influenced by His will,

00:30:17.139 --> 00:30:23.139
and our will becomes His will, then we find that we can pray this way,

00:30:23.139 --> 00:30:26.139
Thy will be done.

00:30:26.139 --> 00:30:30.139
Not simply a cliche, but sincerely, why?

00:30:30.139 --> 00:30:35.139
Because we're recognizing that His will is superior.

00:30:35.139 --> 00:30:38.139
His will is superior. His will is best.

00:30:38.139 --> 00:30:40.139
And I hope you believe that this morning.

00:30:40.139 --> 00:30:43.139
I hope this morning, listen, the more time you spend with God,

00:30:43.139 --> 00:30:46.139
the more you'll understand it to be the case.

00:30:46.139 --> 00:30:51.139
The more time you learn about how sovereign our God is and how powerful our God is

00:30:51.139 --> 00:30:55.139
and how He moves and how He works, the more you'll be able to say,

00:30:55.139 --> 00:30:59.139
Thy will be done.

00:30:59.139 --> 00:31:02.139
Notice with me, not only when we pray, Thy will be done,

00:31:02.139 --> 00:31:05.139
does it recognize that His will is superior,

00:31:05.139 --> 00:31:10.139
but number two, I believe this, it reveals the submission of God's people.

00:31:10.139 --> 00:31:15.139
You know, we as the people of God, we are to submit to God.

00:31:15.139 --> 00:31:17.139
That's what the Bible says in the book of James, if you will.

00:31:17.139 --> 00:31:21.139
And turn over to the book of James, and I want you to see what God tells us.

00:31:21.139 --> 00:31:34.139
In James chapter number 4,

00:31:34.139 --> 00:31:38.139
when we talk about will, we think about submission.

00:31:38.139 --> 00:31:40.139
How strong is your will?

00:31:40.139 --> 00:31:44.139
I don't know if you ever had, I remember as a kid having an uncle

00:31:44.139 --> 00:31:47.139
that wanted to wrestle around.

00:31:47.139 --> 00:31:51.139
You know what he was trying to do? He was trying to make me submit.

00:31:51.139 --> 00:31:54.139
And there were times that he would say something like this to him,

00:31:54.139 --> 00:31:57.139
Say uncle.

00:31:57.139 --> 00:32:00.139
Anyone ever been in that situation?

00:32:00.139 --> 00:32:03.139
Any of you struggle to say uncle?

00:32:03.139 --> 00:32:07.139
You don't want to surrender. You don't want to submit.

00:32:07.139 --> 00:32:10.139
I remember trying with all of my might and all of my strength,

00:32:10.139 --> 00:32:16.139
and yet he's several years older than I am, much bigger and stronger than I was at that point as a little child.

00:32:16.139 --> 00:32:19.139
And he could do with me whatever he wanted to do.

00:32:19.139 --> 00:32:22.139
And he was trying to get me to submit.

00:32:22.139 --> 00:32:25.139
Sometimes it's hard to submit.

00:32:25.139 --> 00:32:28.139
Because you have a will. And I have a will.

00:32:28.139 --> 00:32:33.139
But when we pray thy will be done, not only are we recognizing that God's will is superior,

00:32:33.139 --> 00:32:38.139
but it reveals the submission in our lives to God's will.

00:32:38.139 --> 00:32:42.139
See, notice in James 4, in verse number 7, notice what the Bible says.

00:32:42.139 --> 00:32:49.139
Submit yourselves therefore to God.

00:32:49.139 --> 00:32:51.139
Submit yourselves to God.

00:32:51.139 --> 00:32:53.139
We see that the Bible continues.

00:32:53.139 --> 00:32:55.139
Resist the devil and he will flee from you.

00:32:55.139 --> 00:32:57.139
Draw nigh to God and he will draw nigh to you.

00:32:57.139 --> 00:33:00.139
Cleanse your hands, ye sinners, and purify your hearts, ye double-minded.

00:33:00.139 --> 00:33:04.139
In what great truth, in verse 9, be afflicted and mourn and weep.

00:33:04.139 --> 00:33:07.139
Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness.

00:33:07.139 --> 00:33:11.139
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and he shall lift you up.

00:33:11.139 --> 00:33:14.139
You know what is required for submission?

00:33:14.139 --> 00:33:16.139
Humility.

00:33:16.139 --> 00:33:18.139
Humility.

00:33:18.139 --> 00:33:22.139
Without humility, you're never going to submit.

00:33:22.139 --> 00:33:24.139
You're just not.

00:33:24.139 --> 00:33:26.139
But why should we humble ourselves?

00:33:26.139 --> 00:33:28.139
Well, we find that God instructs us to.

00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:30.139
He says that we're to humble ourselves.

00:33:30.139 --> 00:33:33.139
He says that God resisteth the proud, but he gives grace unto the humble.

00:33:33.139 --> 00:33:37.139
He says that we're to humble ourselves and that we're to be clothed with humility.

00:33:37.139 --> 00:33:41.139
We can read of that as Peter writes in 1 Peter chapter 5.

00:33:41.139 --> 00:33:46.139
And by the way, pride.

00:33:46.139 --> 00:33:48.139
We said that it requires humility.

00:33:48.139 --> 00:33:54.139
Pride is a major issue in many people's lives.

00:33:54.139 --> 00:33:56.139
It's my life.

00:33:56.139 --> 00:33:58.139
Have you ever heard anyone say that?

00:33:58.139 --> 00:34:00.139
I'm going to do what I want to do.

00:34:00.139 --> 00:34:06.139
Well, there's a problem if you're a Christian because 1 Corinthians 6, 19 and 20 says, what?

00:34:06.139 --> 00:34:11.139
Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God?

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:15.139
And you're not your own, for you're bought with a price.

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:19.139
Therefore, glorify God in your body and your soul, which are his.

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:21.139
See, I'm no longer my own.

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:22.139
I've been bought.

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:24.139
You've been bought.

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:27.139
With the precious blood of Christ.

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:30.139
And therefore, it requires that we have humility in our lives

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:33.139
and that that humility leads to submission.

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:36.139
And when we pray, thy will be done,

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:39.139
what's being evidenced, what's being revealed through that prayer

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:43.139
is that we are submitted to God.

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:45.139
We're not in rebellion to God.

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:51.139
You can read of examples in the Scriptures of those that are in rebellion to God.

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:54.139
By the way, it never works out well for them.

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:55.139
Amen?

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:58.139
It never works out well for those that are in rebellion to God.

00:34:58.139 --> 00:35:06.139
Why? Because God's will is going to come to pass.

00:35:06.139 --> 00:35:14.139
This morning, we recognize, we can speak of the dangers of pride.

00:35:14.139 --> 00:35:17.139
We can discuss the importance of humility.

00:35:17.139 --> 00:35:21.139
But I wonder this morning as we examine our prayer lives

00:35:21.139 --> 00:35:25.139
and think about these four simple words, thy will be done.

00:35:25.139 --> 00:35:30.139
Is that submission evidenced in our prayer lives?

00:35:30.139 --> 00:35:33.139
I know I've said this before, but I think it's worth repeating.

00:35:33.139 --> 00:35:39.139
The reality is that there are times in which we bring our petitions before the throne of grace

00:35:39.139 --> 00:35:41.139
just as we're instructed to do so.

00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:45.139
And as we're praying, we're going to decide that we're going to help God understand

00:35:45.139 --> 00:35:54.139
how he can answer our prayers.

00:35:54.139 --> 00:35:57.139
I've said many times, especially when I worked in the corporate world,

00:35:57.139 --> 00:35:59.139
I experienced it on a regular basis.

00:35:59.139 --> 00:36:03.139
Those of you that are working in the corporate world probably can identify with this.

00:36:03.139 --> 00:36:08.139
Many, many times I would find that there's a lot of problem identifiers in the world.

00:36:08.139 --> 00:36:10.139
Amen? A lot of problem identifiers.

00:36:10.139 --> 00:36:14.139
But there are a few problem solvers.

00:36:14.139 --> 00:36:18.139
There are a lot more problem identifiers than there are problem solvers.

00:36:18.139 --> 00:36:21.139
And I determined at a young age when I was working in the corporate world

00:36:21.139 --> 00:36:30.139
that I would never take a problem to a superior without also bringing a solution.

00:36:30.139 --> 00:36:32.139
Now, it might not be the right solution.

00:36:32.139 --> 00:36:38.139
It might not be the one that's incorporated, that's going to be used to fix the problem.

00:36:38.139 --> 00:36:42.139
But I did not want to just be a problem identifier.

00:36:43.139 --> 00:36:47.139
Can I tell you in my Christian walk, that's a little bit of a hindrance.

00:36:47.139 --> 00:36:52.139
Why? Because sometimes I want to help God on how he can answer my prayers.

00:36:52.139 --> 00:36:55.139
I'm being transparent with you this morning.

00:36:55.139 --> 00:37:01.139
And by the way, I think it's important that each of us would be transparent with God.

00:37:01.139 --> 00:37:05.139
Because we need to get a grasp of this simple phrase,

00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:08.139
Thy will be done.

00:37:08.139 --> 00:37:15.139
And how critical it is in seeing your prayers and my prayers answered.

00:37:15.139 --> 00:37:18.139
Thy will be done.

00:37:18.139 --> 00:37:25.139
It recognizes that his way, his will is superior, but it reveals submission.

00:37:25.139 --> 00:37:28.139
How submitted are we to God?

00:37:28.139 --> 00:37:31.139
How much do we resist God's will?

00:37:31.139 --> 00:37:34.139
God has a plan for the ages, by the way.

00:37:34.139 --> 00:37:38.139
You understand that. Amen?

00:37:38.139 --> 00:37:44.139
Right now, God's plan specifically is with the church.

00:37:44.139 --> 00:37:48.139
We're in what would often be referred to as the church age.

00:37:48.139 --> 00:37:50.139
You tracking?

00:37:50.139 --> 00:37:53.139
God has a plan. God has a will.

00:37:53.139 --> 00:37:56.139
You know what God's plan and God's will is for the church age?

00:37:56.139 --> 00:38:00.139
That the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ will be preached to the entire earth.

00:38:00.139 --> 00:38:03.139
That's God's plan and God's will.

00:38:03.139 --> 00:38:06.139
In a summary statement. Amen?

00:38:06.139 --> 00:38:10.139
And God tells us in his word that the gospel...

00:38:10.139 --> 00:38:12.139
Paul says, I am not ashamed.

00:38:12.139 --> 00:38:18.139
We heard the kids last week on Sunday morning do such a wonderful job of quoting the verse in Romans 1.16.

00:38:18.139 --> 00:38:21.139
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.

00:38:21.139 --> 00:38:27.139
Why? For it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth.

00:38:27.139 --> 00:38:29.139
To the Jew first and also to the Greek.

00:38:29.139 --> 00:38:30.139
See, because why?

00:38:30.139 --> 00:38:33.139
Well, because God's plan for the church age is that all people will be saved.

00:38:33.139 --> 00:38:36.139
That we proclaim the gospel to all the world.

00:38:36.139 --> 00:38:38.139
Why do we support missionaries?

00:38:38.139 --> 00:38:44.139
Why do we send an offering so that Brother Cottle and his wife can go to Africa to go on a missions trip this summer?

00:38:44.139 --> 00:38:52.139
Because we are given the task in this era to preach the gospel to every creature.

00:38:52.139 --> 00:38:54.139
God has a plan.

00:38:54.139 --> 00:38:58.139
The church age is going to end one day.

00:38:58.139 --> 00:39:00.139
The trumpet of the Lord shall sound.

00:39:00.139 --> 00:39:02.139
Aren't you looking forward to that?

00:39:02.139 --> 00:39:05.139
The dead in Christ?

00:39:05.139 --> 00:39:07.139
Going to be raised.

00:39:07.139 --> 00:39:10.139
Then we which are alive and remain, I hope I'm one of those.

00:39:10.139 --> 00:39:12.139
So be caught up to meet the Lord in the air.

00:39:12.139 --> 00:39:15.139
So shall we ever be with the Lord. Amen?

00:39:15.139 --> 00:39:17.139
Hallelujah. The rapture.

00:39:17.139 --> 00:39:20.139
There's going to be a tribulation.

00:39:20.139 --> 00:39:22.139
You know what God's doing in the tribulation?

00:39:22.139 --> 00:39:25.139
He's dealing with Israel again.

00:39:25.139 --> 00:39:27.139
He's dealing with Israel.

00:39:27.139 --> 00:39:29.139
Because it's God's plan.

00:39:29.139 --> 00:39:31.139
It's God's plan.

00:39:31.139 --> 00:39:34.139
You're not going to change God's plan.

00:39:34.139 --> 00:39:38.139
It doesn't make any sense to resist God's plan.

00:39:38.139 --> 00:39:42.139
Because God's plan is going to come to pass.

00:39:42.139 --> 00:39:44.139
And so you can resist it.

00:39:44.139 --> 00:39:47.139
And you can show your pride.

00:39:47.139 --> 00:39:50.139
Or you can submit to it.

00:39:50.139 --> 00:39:51.139
Amen?

00:39:51.139 --> 00:39:53.139
You can submit to it.

00:39:53.139 --> 00:39:56.139
You say God has a plan.

00:39:56.139 --> 00:40:00.139
God's going to bring His people.

00:40:00.139 --> 00:40:08.459
into the land again. It's God's plan. It's God's plan. And we can go on and on and look

00:40:08.459 --> 00:40:16.099
at God's plan. The problem is that we need to be submissive to God's plan. See, we don't

00:40:16.099 --> 00:40:22.539
resist God's plan, we submit to God's plan. And when we say, thy will be done, what is

00:40:22.539 --> 00:40:35.659
God's plan? What is God's will in this moment, in this life, in this day? Thy will be done.

00:40:35.659 --> 00:40:47.539
Use me, Lord, however you see fit to accomplish your will this day. Submission. Humility.

00:40:47.539 --> 00:40:57.819
It's on full display. Surrender. We sang this morning, I'll go where you want me to go.

00:40:57.819 --> 00:41:03.499
Do what you want me to do. Say what you want me to say. See, that's a song of surrender,

00:41:03.499 --> 00:41:09.339
is it not? A song of submission. And this morning when we look at these four simple

00:41:09.339 --> 00:41:14.659
words, thy will be done. You know what a lot of problems have been historically? You can

00:41:14.659 --> 00:41:18.219
look through the Old Testament, you can look through human history. You know what a lot

00:41:18.219 --> 00:41:28.219
of problems have been the cause of? Man resisting the will of God. Man resisting the will of

00:41:28.219 --> 00:41:37.499
God. And it leads to great turmoil. Why? Because you have a strong will. You have a strong

00:41:37.499 --> 00:41:46.579
will. And so do I. Therefore, Jesus says, when you pray, yes, there's other pieces of

00:41:46.579 --> 00:41:57.859
the framework, but four simple words, thy will be done. I wonder this morning, truly,

00:41:57.859 --> 00:42:03.639
I'm not asking you to tell me, I'm asking you to be honest with God. Truly this morning,

00:42:03.639 --> 00:42:11.919
how much of our will influences our prayer life? If we examine our prayer life, is it

00:42:11.919 --> 00:42:16.919
more of, now God, I know that you're sovereign and you can do all things, and so here's my

00:42:16.919 --> 00:42:25.399
list of what I want you to do. Because I want you to do what I want you to do. No, that's

00:42:25.399 --> 00:42:33.619
not how it works. Thy will be done. And we come to that place of full surrender and submission,

00:42:33.619 --> 00:42:41.699
say God use me, help me to submit to your plan, to your will, and use me to bring glory

00:42:41.699 --> 00:42:47.539
to your name. I don't know all that that's going to look like, but can I tell you that

00:42:47.539 --> 00:42:52.979
it's going to be best? It's going to be perfect. It's going to be right. It's going to accomplish

00:42:52.979 --> 00:43:00.099
what it's caused to accomplish. Because we as God's people recognize that His way, His

00:43:00.099 --> 00:43:07.899
will is superior and we must submit. It reveals submission. I hope this morning, as we kind

00:43:07.899 --> 00:43:15.899
of conclude this little mini-series that was born out of 1 Timothy chapter 2, the importance

00:43:15.899 --> 00:43:23.659
of prayer, that we would recognize these four simple words. And as you pray today and tomorrow

00:43:23.659 --> 00:43:31.499
and this week, that you would be regularly aware of how you're praying. Am I praying

00:43:31.499 --> 00:43:40.739
thy will be done? Not as just a cliche, but truly, truly God your will is far superior

00:43:40.739 --> 00:43:48.259
than my will. God you know things I could never even begin to comprehend. God I'm just

00:43:48.259 --> 00:43:52.179
going to submit to you. I'm going to trust you. Thy will be done. Let's pray. Father

00:43:52.179 --> 00:43:58.059
we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for your word, the truth contained

00:43:58.059 --> 00:44:04.219
therein. God I pray this morning that the Holy Spirit of God would take the word of

00:44:04.219 --> 00:44:11.899
God and work in the hearts of your people. If there's one that's not sure of heaven,

00:44:11.899 --> 00:44:15.859
we would love to have an opportunity to take a Bible and show them how they can know for

00:44:15.859 --> 00:44:24.059
sure that heaven is their home. God I pray that each of us that are saved, God we truly

00:44:24.059 --> 00:44:31.539
do some examination this morning of our prayer lives. We all acknowledge that we have a will,

00:44:31.539 --> 00:44:36.659
some stronger than others. But the real question this morning is how much influence does our

00:44:36.659 --> 00:44:46.419
will have in our prayer lives? How much of our prayer is based on my will and not your

00:44:46.419 --> 00:44:59.779
will? How is it that we can truly say not my will, but thine? Lord help us to recognize

00:44:59.819 --> 00:45:09.819
that your will is superior. Help us Lord to submit to your will for our lives. Well thank

00:45:09.819 --> 00:45:12.859
you for the work that you'll do for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with

00:45:12.859 --> 00:45:13.219
me?
