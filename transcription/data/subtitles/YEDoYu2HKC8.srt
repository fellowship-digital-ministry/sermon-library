1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,359
so much about the spirit of a church.

2
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:07,360
And I have just so appreciated the music

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,760
and the way that it's been done,

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,100
but also the music that has been done.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,360
I love songs that are theologically correct,

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,719
harmonious in their sound,

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,399
and played by people who understand what they're singing

8
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,479
and playing in living it out.

9
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:27,040
So it's been a real blessing to me.

10
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:30,559
I have enjoyed Fellowship Baptist Church this week.

11
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:31,440
I haven't seen you.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,880
Maybe that's why I've enjoyed you so much.

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,959
I don't know.

14
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:37,759
And maybe you feel the same about me.

15
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,720
All you've had to do is put up with me for,

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,919
I always say 30 minutes a night,

17
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:46,119
and then my wife will hit me with her elbow

18
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:48,840
and say, never 30, always 40.

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,319
And so it's probably been much longer than 30 minutes.

20
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,119
But thank you for tuning in.

21
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:57,599
Thank you for the few that are able to be here

22
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,139
and are here tonight.

23
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:01,619
I just want you to know that it's been a real blessing to me.

24
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:03,560
I love your pastor and his family,

25
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,419
and love the opportunity to be here.

26
00:01:07,419 --> 00:01:08,800
Take your Bible if you would,

27
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,059
and while you're turning to Psalm 63, let me say this.

28
00:01:13,059 --> 00:01:18,059
I'm going to preach a very elementary message tonight.

29
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:20,519
Now, elementary doesn't mean

30
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:23,059
that it's not a much needed message.

31
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,860
And the truth is that as you listen to this message,

32
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,180
you may be tempted to say to yourself,

33
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,300
well, everybody knows that.

34
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,459
I know that.

35
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:38,300
The question isn't, do we know it?

36
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,379
The question is, is it part of our lives?

37
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:44,620
Have we appropriated it?

38
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:49,220
Is it a part of the discipline of our lives?

39
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,559
I hope you'll ask yourself that question

40
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:53,879
as we consider these things tonight.

41
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,480
Notice with me in Psalm 63 and verse one.

42
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,400
Oh God, thou art my God.

43
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,480
Early will I seek thee.

44
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,860
My soul thirsteth for thee.

45
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,479
My flesh longeth for thee

46
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:15,919
in a dry and thirsty land where no water is.

47
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,119
See thy power and thy glory.

48
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:23,199
So as I have seen thee in the sanctuary,

49
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,039
because thy loving kindness is better than life,

50
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:30,720
my lips shall praise thee.

51
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,320
And thus will I bless thee while I live.

52
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,160
I will lift up my hands in thy name.

53
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,100
My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness,

54
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,759
and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips.

55
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,360
When I remember thee upon my bed

56
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,800
and meditate on thee in the night watches,

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,320
because thou has been my help,

58
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,279
therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.

59
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:05,100
My soul followeth hard after thee.

60
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,619
Thy right hand upholdeth me.

61
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:09,460
Let's pray.

62
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,320
Father, we thank you for the beauty of these words

63
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:20,160
and for the meaning of these words for our lives.

64
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,199
Thank you for what you taught David

65
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,520
and what David now teaches us through your Holy Spirit.

66
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,360
And I pray, Lord, that as elementary as this is,

67
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,800
that God, you would convict our hearts

68
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,800
that knowing it is not the same as the discipline of life

69
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:41,080
that accomplishes it.

70
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,119
So convict us.

71
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:48,160
Our desire is to seek you because we want to know you.

72
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,699
The greatest need we have in our lives is to know you more.

73
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,080
And I pray tonight that you would help us to see that.

74
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,600
I pray for those who may be under the sound of my voice

75
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,199
who have never been saved.

76
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Lord, I ask you to convince them of their need, their sin,

77
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:16,519
but also, Lord, would you convince them that you love them

78
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,959
and that you want them.

79
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,799
So Lord, do a work in our hearts.

80
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:23,399
Thank you for this opportunity.

81
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,679
Thank you for this technology that we can be together.

82
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:31,440
If not in the same place, we can be together in your word

83
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,320
and hear this preaching.

84
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,739
Blessed we pray in Jesus' name, amen.

85
00:04:37,739 --> 00:04:40,220
If I could choose a word

86
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,880
that I think describes our generation,

87
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:49,299
that word would be something like stress.

88
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,019
I think pressure might be the thought as well.

89
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:58,660
I've lived a few years, and to be honest with you,

90
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,100
I don't think I've ever lived in a generation

91
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,220
that is under more perceived and real stress

92
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,720
than this generation.

93
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,019
We live in a time where our children feel pressured.

94
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:19,980
Everything from science to soccer, they've got to excel in.

95
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:25,859
We live in a time where it seems like life has speeded up.

96
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,739
If they create one more time-saving device,

97
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:34,299
I'm not buying it because I don't have any more time

98
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:37,339
for time-saving devices.

99
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:40,179
We have family problems, economic problems,

100
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:44,100
political problems, world problems.

101
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,260
Have you noticed that?

102
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,579
And I'm not saying that to try to discourage anyone.

103
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:52,140
They are stressful times,

104
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:57,140
and there is an incredible amount of pressure on every life,

105
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,880
but I'm saying it for this reason.

106
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:06,260
If we're not careful, if we are not purposeful,

107
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:11,540
if we're not intentional, we will let the pressure

108
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:16,579
and the stress that life in this world brings

109
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:19,940
set the direction for our life

110
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,619
instead of intentionally allowing God

111
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:27,859
to set the direction for our lives.

112
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:33,859
We come tonight and we are in a revival meeting.

113
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,540
And I sometimes ask myself, well, what is revival?

114
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,859
Is revival evangelism?

115
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,500
It's certainly an aspect.

116
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,660
We certainly should move towards an evangelistic spirit

117
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,420
if we indeed have revived hearts.

118
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,100
But I would suggest to you that a revival is believers

119
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,859
looking down into their own hearts

120
00:06:58,859 --> 00:07:01,660
and examining their own lives

121
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,420
and answering some very vital questions

122
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,660
from the Lord to us,

123
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:12,420
and that revival can really be understood in this thought.

124
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:17,559
A renewed seeking of the Lord.

125
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,500
A renewed seeking of the Lord.

126
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,500
I wanna do a little exercise here.

127
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,500
244 times in the Bible, the word seek is used.

128
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:33,299
I'm not going to read all 244.

129
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:37,779
And I'll be honest with you, not all 244 times

130
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:42,739
does the word seek refer to seeking the Lord.

131
00:07:42,739 --> 00:07:47,739
But by far the vast majority of times, perhaps 225 to 30,

132
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,579
it is used and it is in reference

133
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:57,579
to God's people seeking the Lord.

134
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:01,100
Let me read just a couple of those to you.

135
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,660
1 Chronicles 16 and verse 10.

136
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,820
Glory ye in his holy name.

137
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,820
Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.

138
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:19,059
Psalm 105 verse four, seek the Lord and his strength.

139
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,440
Seek his face forevermore.

140
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,140
Psalm 40 verse 16, let all those that seek thee

141
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,100
rejoice and be glad in thee.

142
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,140
Let such as love thy salvation say continually,

143
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,979
the Lord be magnified.

144
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,219
Psalm 119 and verse two, blessed are they

145
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:45,760
that keep his testimonies and that seek him

146
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,739
with the whole heart.

147
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,419
Hebrews 11 and verse six, but without faith

148
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:54,539
it is impossible to please him.

149
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:58,619
For he that cometh to God must believe that he is

150
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:03,619
and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

151
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:10,140
Matthew 6.33, but seek ye first the kingdom of God

152
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,900
and his righteousness and all these things

153
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,799
shall be added unto you.

154
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,580
And then a verse that we often consider

155
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,859
during our revival time, 2 Chronicles 7.14.

156
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:28,859
If my people, which are called by my name,

157
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:34,020
shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face

158
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,400
and turn from their wicked ways,

159
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,400
then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin

160
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,400
and heal their land.

161
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,080
I don't think I can overstate tonight

162
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,659
the importance of this thought in reference to revival.

163
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,840
If God's people do not seek him,

164
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,840
then they will not be saved.

165
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,840
If God's people do not seek him,

166
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,840
then they will not be saved.

167
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:20,120
seek Him. If our lives are directed by the pressure and the direction of the

168
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,680
world that the world sends us, no matter what our intentions are, if our direction

169
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,280
is set by the world and we are not intentionally and purposefully seeking

170
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:37,720
the Lord, can I be very honest with you tonight? Revival won't come. Revival will

171
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,960
not come in the halls of Congress. Revival won't come in the Capitol at

172
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:49,200
Richmond. Revival won't come because of an economic resurgence.

173
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:57,360
Revival comes only when God's people are revived. Sometimes I think we look in all

174
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:05,720
the wrong places, and the place to look for revival is in my heart, in your heart.

175
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:15,160
When we set ourselves again to seek the Lord amidst all the pressure of

176
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:22,760
schedules, society, success, you and I must cause ourselves to keep the right

177
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:30,200
things a priority in our lives. When we come to Psalm 63, David gives us a

178
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,840
wonderful example of that. I want you to understand that David was a man who

179
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,600
understood pressure. He understood the pressure of leadership. He was leading a

180
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,200
kingdom, leading armies. David understood the pressure of problems. Goodness, he had

181
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,960
many, many difficult things in his life, some of his own making. And yet one of

182
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:01,480
the things that I so love about David is that in his life he was intentional. He

183
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,120
was purposeful in the thought that he would seek the Lord. The Lord would have

184
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:14,440
priority in his life. When we come to Psalm 63, David is not in the palace.

185
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:23,640
When we come to Psalm 63, David is not in the temple rejoicing as the Levites

186
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:31,040
sing hymns of worship. When we come to Psalm 63, I want you to understand as it says in

187
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:38,040
the inscription in the psalm, he was in the wilderness of Judah. If you've been

188
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,720
to the Holy Land, you know that the wilderness of Judah is an accurate

189
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,800
description of the land of Judah. It is an arid place, hot during the day, cold

190
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,720
at night. And again, there is not, there are certainly places of oasis, but water

191
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:03,200
is far apart, and vegetation is sparse, and it is a difficult place to survive.

192
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:11,520
David is in the wilderness of Judah because just a day before, his own son

193
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:19,480
Absalom has raised rebellion against him and has taken the gates of Jerusalem

194
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:26,480
and as he is proceeding through the city, hunting down his father, David and a few

195
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,760
of his family are able to escape and down over Brook Kidron and out into the

196
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:38,520
wilderness, unprepared, unsupplied. They find themselves in the wilderness of

197
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:45,640
Judea. If I understand strategy of those days, David would have separated himself

198
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:52,240
from Abigail and from Bathsheba and from his children that were out with him. He

199
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,280
would have put them in one place, hoping that if Absalom found him, he would slay

200
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:05,840
him and care not about the kids. And so when we come to Psalm 63, I believe the

201
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:13,200
scene that we have is David awaiting daylight. David with the weight of his

202
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:20,040
world on his shoulders, David with decisions to be made about provision and

203
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,680
about protection, about where to go, where to hide, what to do, who to trust, who not

204
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:36,320
to trust, and in the midst of all those pressing matters, David says, Oh God, thou

205
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:48,000
art my God. Early will I seek thee. And in the midst of this catastrophe, David

206
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,480
says, I know what's important. All the things I have to attend to, I don't have

207
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,600
the wisdom to do until I have sought the mind of God. And I cannot let the urgency

208
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:10,160
of schedule push me away from the necessity of knowing the mind of God. And

209
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:17,120
so in that morning, in that cold place, perhaps the mouth of a cave or under the

210
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,400
outcropping of a rock or maybe finding a sparse tree and lying down beneath it

211
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,080
for the night, in the morning he looks for the sun because he wants to cry out

212
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:35,640
to his God for direction. Oh God, I'm going to seek thee. I want to give you

213
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:45,520
two simple thoughts tonight. Number one, what is it to seek God? Number two, how is

214
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:55,400
it a believer seeks the Lord? Number one, what does it mean to seek after God?

215
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,920
Three thoughts under that. Number one, to seek God first requires that we have a

216
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:09,400
personal relationship with the Lord. Would you hear me tonight? None of us

217
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:18,720
sought the Lord before he sought us. None of us were of such wonderful

218
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:25,200
righteousness. None of us sought the Lord until he sought us. I'm so thankful

219
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:34,920
that in February of 1975, the Lord found me. And the wonderful privilege of

220
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:42,360
knowing that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, loved me, a sinful man, not only by

221
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:49,440
nature but by practice. I inherited my sin nature, but I employed it as well. I'm

222
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:57,880
guilty. And that God so loved a man like me that he would come, a lost sheep,

223
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:04,240
really a life that had no meaning, that he should care about it, but he loved me

224
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:12,000
in such a way that he left heaven and came to sinful earth, and emptied himself

225
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,320
of his right to be worshipped and treated as God, and took upon himself the

226
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:25,080
form of a servant, and was obedient to the will of his Father even unto death,

227
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:33,200
even the death of the cross. And there on that cross, in a transaction that we will

228
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,840
not fully understand until we stand in heaven in front of him, he suffered for

229
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:48,000
me and died and bled for me. And in that moment, if I look to him and confess that

230
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,760
my sin put him on that cross, and I call out to him using my mouth from a heart

231
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:07,160
that believes, and I call upon him, will you save me? He will. And my sin is placed

232
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:14,640
on him and judged in him, and his righteousness is placed on me, and God

233
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,920
sees no longer my sinfulness but the righteousness of his Son. I want to tell

234
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:28,440
you, I've been saved a while now. I've been saved since 1975. That's a long time. I'm

235
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:37,400
not over it yet. I'm not over. You see, I know what I was when God found me. We used

236
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,280
to have a statement, I'm born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, and I've lived

237
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,920
before there were shopping malls, and if you were going to go shopping, you went

238
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,600
downtown. And if you were in Edwards, it meant that you didn't have much money to

239
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,480
go shopping at all. And when we would go to Shillito's, that was the department

240
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,640
store, we would not go in on the first floor. That's where the people that had

241
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:07,040
money bought. No, no, the Edwards is shopped in the bargain basement. And you

242
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:14,400
know where Jesus found me? He found me in the bargain basement and lifted me out

243
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:23,000
of that. And I'm not over it. And whoever you are and wherever you are tonight,

244
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:33,320
Jesus loves you, and he came for you. And it is as effective in 2021 as it was in

245
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,880
1975, as it was in the great revival meetings of the century of

246
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:45,920
the 1800s, the Great Awakening, and as much as it ever has been, it is true

247
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:52,840
today. If you will but admit your sin and call upon Jesus to be your Savior, he

248
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:59,960
will save you. And then an incredible privilege is yours. Because he sought you

249
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:08,960
and found you, you now have the privilege of seeking and knowing and becoming like

250
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,840
him. And it ought to be the passion...

251
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:21,820
pursuit of every believer's life, to desire to know Him, to really know Him. I

252
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:28,020
remember when I first saw my wife, I was eating a, you don't need to know this, but

253
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,380
now I'm telling you, I'm an old man and we're allowed to tell stories. And I

254
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,300
was in the chemistry hall at the University of Cincinnati, I was eating my

255
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,740
lunch sitting on the floor, and she walked in the door a vision of

256
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:45,340
loveliness. And for me it was love at first sight, I'm not kidding about that.

257
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:51,700
It was not for her, I had to work at it, but we got around to it. But my point of

258
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:59,680
telling you that is, is I spent near 50 years now getting to know her, wanting to

259
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:06,540
know her, understanding the things that she loves, and understanding what

260
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:12,140
makes her happy and what makes her sad. And I want to know all about her. Hey,

261
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:21,020
that same pursuit ought to be in the heart of believers. I want to know Him.

262
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:27,820
Several years ago, Dr. Clarence Sexton called me and he said, Mike, I've been

263
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:32,900
invited to the White House. There's a meeting of Christian college presidents,

264
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,260
we're going to meet with President Bush at the White House. I don't know how to

265
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,780
get over to the White House. Will you pick me up at National Airport? Will you

266
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,900
drive me over to the White House and I'll get you into that meeting? And I

267
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,580
said, Preacher, I'll be glad to pick you up. You're not going to get me in that

268
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,500
meeting, but I'll be glad to pick you up, take you to the White House, wait for you,

269
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:56,540
and take you back. Well, lo and behold, he got me in the meeting. And when we

270
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:02,220
came into a room, about 25 seats, they sat me right there in front of the

271
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,540
presidential lectern. And when President Bush came in, I don't know why, but he

272
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:12,060
made eye contact with me and he talked as if he was talking to me the whole

273
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,940
time. I mean, we were just being buddies there. He's looking at me, I'm looking at

274
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:21,660
him. Hour and eight minutes, he talks. When he gets done talking, he comes down

275
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:26,900
around the pleasant presidential lectern, down one step, comes to my seat, takes my

276
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:32,860
hand, lifts me up, and shakes my hand. I am convinced he thought I was Rush Limbaugh.

277
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:42,780
As he's shaking my hand, I see a camera flash. About a week later, my secretary

278
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:47,260
called my office and said, Hey, the White House is on the phone. And I said, Right,

279
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:52,940
sure. I took the call and it was the photographer of the White

280
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:58,500
House. And he said, Were you in a blue suit and a gold tie when you shook

281
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,340
President's hand? I said, Yes, I was. He said, Well, Reverend Edwards, the President

282
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:08,380
wants to send you something. About two weeks after that, I got in the mail a

283
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:15,500
beautifully framed picture of me shaking the hand of President George Bush. And

284
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:21,660
he's written on the photograph, Reverend Edwards, thanks for what you do. Pray for

285
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:26,620
me. Appreciate the opportunity to meet you. Now, I tell you all that to tell you

286
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:35,860
this. President Bush and I are very close friends. We're not close friends. He

287
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:40,980
wouldn't know me if he saw me. If I bumped into him on the street, I would

288
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:48,740
get arrested. No, if I were to know President Bush, it would mean that I

289
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:53,580
would have to sit down with him and converse with him. I would have to hear

290
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:58,860
him say what he thought about things and felt about things. I would have to give

291
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,780
him a view of my heart. I would have to ask him questions. I would have to have

292
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:10,060
lengthy talks with him to know him. You know one of my great fears for our

293
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:18,540
generation of believers? We have become satisfied with a handshake with Jesus.

294
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:24,820
It's all we have time for, because we're stressed and we're pressured and and

295
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,980
we're busy and we've got to be here and we've got to be there, and our intention

296
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:34,100
is always to know him. And we even dedicate a couple hours a week to go to

297
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:42,860
church to learn of him. But there needs to be a passion to sit down and be

298
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:52,140
spoken to and to speak to to know him. Secondly, not only must we have that

299
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,980
passion, there has to be a desire to know more of him, following on with that

300
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:03,940
thought. David had the Lord, but he wanted to know more of the Lord. That

301
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:12,180
phrase in verse 1, early will I seek thee, has the thought of urgently awaiting

302
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:19,620
dawn, because you want something to take place. I have three children, all grown

303
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:25,140
and married and have seven grandkids, but my children were normal children. They

304
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:31,700
were very obedient and pleased us and pleased the Lord. But they didn't always

305
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,740
want to get up early, and I can remember one morning each year where they were

306
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:42,580
always ready to get up. As a matter of fact, I would fool around with them and

307
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,260
I'd say the night before, I'd say, you know, boy I'm not going in the office

308
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:51,700
tomorrow, I'm tired and I'm just gonna sleep till 10 or 11 o'clock. I've never

309
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:57,540
done that in my life, but they'd go, oh dad, don't do that. And I'd hear the

310
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:02,440
pitter-patter of little feet at about 5 or 5.30 or 6, and they would go sit on

311
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,020
the steps and Melissa, our oldest, would say to the boys, don't make noise or

312
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:12,700
he'll never get up. And then we'd get up and man they'd run downstairs. Can I ask

313
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:18,580
you a question? What morning of the year was that? It was Christmas morning. Why were

314
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:24,540
they excited about getting up? Because there was something waiting for them.

315
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:30,980
There was something new, something they desired, there was something that excited

316
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:36,640
them. Can I ask you this question and answer yourself honestly, when was the

317
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:44,300
last time you approached the Word of God with anywhere near that excitement, that

318
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:50,660
desire, that sureness that something new was there and it was going to grip your

319
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:55,300
heart, grip your soul, and it was going to make a difference in what you did that

320
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:01,540
day and in your life as you move forward? Where has that gone? And can I say to you

321
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:09,460
I fear that most believers, because of the pressure and the schedule and the

322
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:19,020
time and the pace, have lost the fervency of seeking the Lord in His Word, in the

323
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:25,500
quiet of His Word. A.W. Tozer said this, and I quote,

324
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:33,940
complacency is a deadly foe of all spiritual growth. Come near to the holy

325
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:40,180
men and women of the past and you will soon feel the heat of their desire after

326
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:46,300
God. They mourned for Him, they prayed and wrestled and sought for Him day and

327
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:52,140
night, in season and out, and when they had found Him the finding was all the

328
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:59,440
sweeter for the long-seeking. You see, we have found so many other avenues to be

329
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:07,280
satisfied in, so many other venues, so much other media, that in truth we don't

330
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:14,600
even consider the absolute wonder of meeting God in quiet and allowing Him to

331
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:25,320
speak to us. There's always more to know. There's always ways that we can grow. May

332
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,120
we never come to the place where we think there is not something

333
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:37,560
else for us to learn, some other way for us to grow and mature. We never arrive,

334
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:46,480
and every morning, every day, should be a passionate search to know Him more and

335
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:53,200
to be more like Him. Here's number three, it's understanding that only God can

336
00:28:53,240 --> 00:29:01,040
fulfill the needs of our heart. Look at verse two a moment. I'm sorry, verse one,

337
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:07,559
O God, thou art my God, early will I seek thee, my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh

338
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:16,200
longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is. Our schedules

339
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,559
push us past our time with God, and we think that in the excitement of the day

340
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:26,800
or the busyness of the day we will find that which satisfies us, and the truth is

341
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:32,180
we arrive home late in the evening exhausted physically and mentally and as

342
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:40,800
unsatisfied as when we left and rushed into the day. David understood something,

343
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:50,280
that if the Lord wasn't in it, it didn't satisfy. Hey, he's lost the palace. He's

344
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:58,160
not in the palace. He's lost his armies. He's lost his servants. He's lost his

345
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:06,720
staff. He has been reduced to nothing, and yet in this place we find him willing to

346
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,840
seek the Lord, because David had made a realization in his life that

347
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,200
satisfaction never was in

348
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,180
having a palace, that it never could be found in leading armies. As a matter of

349
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:25,620
fact, he came to understand that leading armies was really tough work that you

350
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:32,620
didn't want to do. I'm old enough to have lived through several bubbles, I think

351
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:38,180
most people in this room are. You remember the stock bubble, the tech stock

352
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:45,000
bubble, the 1980, 1998? All you got to do is buy a hundred shares of Cisco, Oracle,

353
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,020
or Microsoft, and you will be a millionaire! And I watched people leverage

354
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:57,460
themselves to buy stock, to buy stock, to buy stock, and then the bubble went pop.

355
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:04,380
You remember the housing bubble? Ooh, I was in the DC area in those days, and I

356
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,100
would have people come to me, and they'd say, Preacher, you just don't understand,

357
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:13,920
and we never do, but they would say, I'm gonna buy this $750,000 house, now

358
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,940
I've got $10,000 to put down, and I'm gonna leverage the rest, and I'd say

359
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:24,600
that's not wise, that's not wise, that's not wise, and they'd say, no, it's gonna

360
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:30,540
continue to appreciate, I'm gonna flip it in two years and make a quarter mill!

361
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:39,100
Pop. And the house they bought for $750,000 was worth four. You say, Preacher, does

362
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:45,760
this have a point? Yeah. Stop looking for it in the world. Stop looking for

363
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:51,560
satisfaction in what you have. Stop looking for satisfaction in what you do

364
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:56,400
in your career. I'm not saying be bad at your career, I'm not saying don't be

365
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:04,480
secure, I'm saying to you that's not where your passion ought to lie! Because

366
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,500
satisfaction is in Him, and when you lose the palace, you don't lose Him, and

367
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:18,380
when the stock blows up, you don't lose Him, because He is where satisfaction,

368
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:23,420
that's what our flesh should long for. Very quickly, I've been too long, how does

369
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:30,280
a person seek after God? Okay, Lord, or Preacher, I get it. Seeking after the Lord

370
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:36,380
is to know Him, to desire to know more of Him, and to realize that knowing Him

371
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:40,940
and having Him is where real satisfaction is. Okay, how do I get it

372
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:46,100
done? How do I seek the Lord? Three thoughts, very quickly. Number one, keep a

373
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:57,820
passion for God. Keep a passion for God. I love what David says in verse 8, my soul

374
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:04,560
followeth hard after thee, thy right hand upholdeth me. What does David mean, I

375
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:10,420
follow hard after the Lord? What does that even mean? And can I suggest to you

376
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:15,340
that every person in this room knows what it means? If we were to take a

377
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:20,140
Strong's Concordance and look at it, we would find that that Hebrew word for

378
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:26,860
followeth hard is the exact word that God uses in Genesis chapter 22, or chapter

379
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,760
2 in verse 24, when he talks to a husband and a wife, and he says that we

380
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:40,020
are to cleave unto our wives. To follow hard after God is like a man cleaving

381
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:47,980
after his wife, or for his wife. My wife and I, as you and your wife, love each

382
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:54,100
other. We have a romantic love, but we have something far greater than a

383
00:33:54,140 --> 00:34:00,500
romantic love. We have a committed love. We have a love that goes beyond the ups

384
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:06,940
and downs of life and just is committed. There is no one in my life that I have a

385
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:13,140
closer relationship to on this earth, other than the Lord, than my wife. No one

386
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:20,580
comes before my wife. No hobby, no interest, no work comes before my wife. No

387
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:27,540
child, no grandchild, maybe my puppy Emma.

388
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:38,500
Kidding. I love to fish. My wife does not love to fish. If my wife came to me and

389
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:43,180
said, honey, I know you had this fishing trip planned, but I need you

390
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:48,620
to do this, can I assure you of something? The rods and the reels would be put up

391
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:54,220
immediately. Now I'm not trying to be silly and all that, I'm trying to

392
00:34:54,220 --> 00:35:03,500
illustrate how quickly we set God aside to do everything else. I'd meet with you

393
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,779
in the morning, God, but traffic. I'd meet with you in the morning, God, but I've

394
00:35:07,779 --> 00:35:13,340
got another meeting. I'd meet with you in the morning, God, but I got kids! Kids

395
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:23,380
were never given to us to be an excuse to not know God. What are you saying, preacher? I'm

396
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:29,620
saying he's got to be first, and he's got to take precedence, and I know we talk

397
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:35,340
about knowing the Lord and walking with the Lord. I'm not asking tonight if we

398
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:41,820
know that we ought to, I'm asking have we instituted in our lives the discipline

399
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:49,059
where God is first, and we follow hard after God, and we never put him second.

400
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:57,500
We never put him second. When I pastored for so many years in Woodbridge, Woodbridge,

401
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:02,020
for those of you that know nothing about the south part of this great capital

402
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:08,340
area, is 22 miles from the Washington Monument. Most of my men worked in one of

403
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:12,300
the alphabet parts of the government, or the Pentagon, or Crystal City, somewhere

404
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:18,779
there, and if they had to be at their desk at 8, they had to be on I-95 to go

405
00:36:18,779 --> 00:36:26,140
all of 22 miles. They had to be on 95 at 515, which meant if they wanted to brush

406
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:31,180
their teeth, they had to be up at 430, which means if they wanted to meet with

407
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:39,779
God in the morning. I've had men come to me and say, preacher, do you understand I

408
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:46,340
get up at 430? Do you understand that I have a high-pressure and fast-paced job,

409
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:53,460
and yet you're saying to me that you think I need to get up before 430 to

410
00:36:53,460 --> 00:37:04,220
meet with God? And with no arrogance, no arrogance, and no false bravado, I would

411
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:12,660
say to them, yes, that's what I'm saying to you. Because there's not a day in your

412
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:20,260
life you're wise enough to be your wife's husband without God's leadership.

413
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:25,620
There's not a day in your life where you're good enough to be your children's

414
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:32,620
father without God's leadership. There's not a day that you're strong enough to

415
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:39,420
go into that world place and serve alongside those who are lost and have no

416
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:46,140
vision of your God. There's not a day that you're strong enough without God. I

417
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:53,180
know it's hard, and I take no pleasure in saying it, but yes, that's what I'm saying

418
00:37:53,180 --> 00:38:01,500
to you. Time with God is more important. We have to find time to spend consistent

419
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:12,720
time with him alone, alone. David had provisions to take care of, protection to

420
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:19,200
provide. David no doubt wanted to rush to his family and rush to his children

421
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,440
and hold them. He was frightened for them, but he understood something, that it was

422
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:31,040
time alone with God that would give him the ability to provide for them what he

423
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:37,640
needed. Time alone. Listen, fatherhood in our nation, I'm afraid, has been reduced

424
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,600
to taking our kids to Disney World or standing on the side of a soccer field

425
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,880
and cheering, and I'm glad for that, and I'm not against that, but I'm telling you,

426
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:55,840
time alone with God prepares the heart and gives wisdom. And then I would say

427
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:00,720
that we have to place God in every part of our life and every part of our home. I

428
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:07,320
tell this story to just illustrate it. When we were starting Heritage, it took

429
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,720
everything we had, and it was just my wife and three kids, myself, and back in

430
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:19,280
the 80s, early 80s, and for every mother in here, there were days in America where

431
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,880
your children did not have to be in a car seat. And so we had been out passing

432
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,239
out tracks, and we were coming back into the church parking lot, old ramshackle

433
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:32,679
building, and the two kids were in the back, and our youngest, Josh, maybe two and

434
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:37,720
a half, three years old, was, I think, standing between me and Nancy, and Nancy

435
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:42,040
had her arm around him, and we pulled into the church parking lot, and he

436
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:52,720
said, we home, we home. I looked at Nancy, and at first she was just almost get

437
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,239
ready to cry because she was thinking to herself, he doesn't even know where he

438
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:04,720
lives, not the brightest child. No, you know, we talked about it, we've never

439
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:11,520
regretted, that our kids didn't see the distinction of having to be home to be

440
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,600
comfortable, having to be here to be comfortable. They were as comfortable

441
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,400
with

442
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,800
being at church, in living their life at church, and I don't mean just church, I

443
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:32,680
mean in Jesus. And being passionate about knowing God and seeking God takes us to

444
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:40,120
the places we serve. We've lived in a world, I'll talk about it tomorrow night,

445
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:46,760
where the word self has been served has been replaced with the word self. But you

446
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:54,440
and I, if we're seeking the Lord, it will take us to the places where we serve. And

447
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:59,360
I want you to notice just this, and with this I am done. Would you remind yourself

448
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:06,680
that David is in a cave, he's lost his palace, he's lost his armies, his servants,

449
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:12,560
he has no meal prepared for him this morning, he's probably cold and damp. And

450
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:20,400
yet look at verse 5, my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness.

451
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,880
Satisfied with marrow and fatness. David, you've lost it all. And he would reply to

452
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:34,400
us, I haven't lost God. I want you to notice in verse 7, because thou has been

453
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:41,120
my health, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice. Rejoice? David, you

454
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:46,080
ought to need antidepressant medicine. You're in a cave, dude, you've lost

455
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:51,320
everything, you may well lose your life this day. And David says, huh, you know

456
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:56,680
what? I live in the shadow of his wings, been in scrapes before. I rejoice! Look at

457
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:07,040
verse 11, but the king shall rejoice in God. Notice verse 3, because thy loving

458
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:14,960
kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee. Praise God? David, he's

459
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,320
forsaken you. Don't you understand, David? He must not care about you, you've lost

460
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:27,200
everything. Look at verse 4, thus will I bless thee while I live. I will lift up

461
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:33,360
my hands in thy name. You know what I see? I see David not as a great and grand

462
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:40,600
king, but as a humbled man seeking God's help and protection, and in this cave as

463
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:46,680
the sun is coming up, and maybe shivering and damp, and maybe frightened

464
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:55,120
and worried about what the day holds, and yet I see this man lifting his hands to the Lord,

465
00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:10,320
praising the Lord. I wonder if we don't praise the Lord more because we're not

466
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:20,240
correctly seeking him. I wonder if we lack joy in our lives because we are so

467
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:26,040
exhausted by going the direction this world pushes us. I don't mean worldly

468
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:32,960
stuff, I don't mean carnal stuff, I mean just the absolute necessity sometimes of

469
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,320
life, and we just get our priorities wrong, and we're busy, and we're

470
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:47,360
running, and we're moving, and we're doing, and we're joyless. I wonder if we never

471
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:54,840
feel satisfied, and never have that sense, because in truth what is missing

472
00:43:54,840 --> 00:44:08,480
from our lives is the absolute priority of seeking Him first. I want to go on

473
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,080
forever, but I'm not. I'm going to tell what preacher told me just a few moments

474
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:19,000
ago, just so impressed me. A missionary, Stephen Trell, I'll just give his name,

475
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,680
but not where he's at, had a young man that wanted to walk beside him, wanted to

476
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,240
carry some very small packages, and just was persistent, I want to be by you, I

477
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,200
want to carry that, I want to be around you, I want to be by you, and finally

478
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:39,640
this missionary asked the young man, why do you want to be by me? Because he said,

479
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:46,040
every time I see you, there just seems to be light. I want to get close to that

480
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:53,840
light. Does anybody want to be around you?

481
00:44:54,080 --> 00:45:02,080
Does anybody sniff God on you? Does anybody look at you and say, man, I'm

482
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:06,360
miserable in this pandemic. Look at them, they're all filled with joy. Well, you

483
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:11,240
don't understand, Pastor, I have to wear a mask, I have to get a vaccine, I have to

484
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:19,720
do this, and you just don't understand, and David had lost it all. And he had joy,

485
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:27,760
and he praised God, and he was satisfied, and by the way, people were drawn to him,

486
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:35,240
and people came to help him, and God had never forsaken him, because that king

487
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:44,000
humbled on his knees in a cave. I said, it's early, sun's coming up, I think I'll

488
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:55,240
keep my priorities straight and seek God early. It will make all the difference.

489
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:03,120
Would you pray with me? Father, we're so grateful for your blessing. We just stand

490
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:12,600
amazed at our salvation. Lord, I'm not glad I got saved later in life, but I am

491
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:22,000
glad that I understand the miracle of it, the wonder of it. Lord, I just want more

492
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:29,560
of you. I want to understand your Word, and I want to obey it. I want to be able

493
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:40,480
to share it. I want influence. I want all that, not selfishly, but Lord, the key to

494
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:50,240
all of that is not rushing off into life without you. It is understanding that in

495
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:58,920
our lives, you must always be the priority. You are always number one. You

496
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:05,560
are always to be our passion, and other things have to be put to the side. Other

497
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:10,680
things have to be put second, and third, and fourth, and nothing can take your

498
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:18,480
place. And Lord, if we will discipline our lives that way, we will find what David

499
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:26,080
found, that we can praise you even when our circumstances are dire, that we can

500
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:34,280
rejoice in you even when it seems we've lost everything else. And the deepest

501
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:41,560
satisfaction a life can know, morrow and fatness, we can have joy in the blessings

502
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:49,960
you give because we have you, and we know you. Lord, if there is ever to be revival

503
00:47:50,080 --> 00:48:00,280
in this nation, in this community, it will be when Christians decide to re-establish

504
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:08,640
priorities with you and seeking you first. Would you speak to our hearts

505
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:15,760
about that tonight? And I say to those who are on livestream, listen, God is not

506
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:22,040
mad at us when we realize these things, and we understand that we've mixed up

507
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:27,400
our priorities. God is glad when we make that realization, and I pray that you'll

508
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:33,920
make your chair, your sofa, your kitchen chair, your altar, and take a few

509
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:39,640
moments on your knees before God and say, God, my priorities have gotten mixed up.

510
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:44,800
I'm missing joy. I'm not happy or satisfied, and it's because I've put

511
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:52,440
other things before you. And if there's one under the sound of my voice that

512
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:59,119
doesn't know Jesus, can I assure you that he is seeking you tonight, and he loves

513
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:06,800
you. And if you will but call upon him, confessing and admitting your sin and

514
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:11,760
asking him to be your Savior, whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

515
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:20,360
shall be saved. So Holy Spirit, would you work now and speak to us, I pray, in Jesus

516
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:24,320
name. Amen.
