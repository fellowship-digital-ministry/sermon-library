1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,279
Leviticus chapter number 25, and the thunder is roaring and the skies have gotten dark.

2
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:13,819
If you're watching live stream, Joseph asked me a moment ago, what happens if the power

3
00:00:13,819 --> 00:00:15,939
goes out?

4
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:21,940
It means that you lose your connectivity to our live stream, okay?

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,340
And so we are having some thunderstorms.

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,879
And so we, those that are here, we get to just continue, amen.

7
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:31,319
And praise the Lord for that.

8
00:00:31,319 --> 00:00:35,959
But Leviticus chapter number 25 this evening, and I'll be looking at verses 1 through 7,

9
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:39,720
and then we'll skip down and look at verses 18 through 22.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:46,319
And let me just remind you, last Wednesday evening, we studied the 16th chapter of the

11
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:47,319
book of Exodus.

12
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:52,119
And as we studied Exodus 16, I asked this question, and we used it as the title of the

13
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,119
message.

14
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:58,919
I asked the question many times throughout the message, would you have passed the test?

15
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:03,040
And that was a purpose of evaluating our own selves.

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,319
And I mentioned often throughout that lesson that we could answer quickly and say, yes,

17
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,879
I would have passed, because that's what we'd like to have said.

18
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:13,360
And I asked you to really examine.

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,720
And we know that there were some that did pass, and I'm so thankful for that.

20
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,919
There were some, of course, that did not pass.

21
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:23,779
But as we studied that passage of scripture, we were reminded how the Lord miraculously

22
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:28,279
and graciously provided manna for His people.

23
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:32,599
They had complained earlier about no water, and God provided for them the water that they

24
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,599
needed.

25
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,720
They had now complained about no food, and God provided for them.

26
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,839
And what a blessing.

27
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:44,160
The end of the chapter tells us in Exodus 16 and verse number 35 that they ate manna

28
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,080
for 40 years.

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,379
And what miraculous provision that God gave to His people.

30
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:54,680
And it's interesting, and we mentioned this as we studied through the book of Joshua during

31
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,519
the last several months, as we were studying through that book.

32
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:03,000
In Joshua chapter number 5 and verses 10 through 12, the book of Joshua records for us the

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,919
historical account of when the children of Israel observed the Passover in the land.

34
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,979
And then in verse number 12 tells us that the manna ceased.

35
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:17,320
They no longer had manna, and God had provided them the manna until they would then be sustained

36
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:23,000
from the fruit of the field and the land in which God would provide them with.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,080
And what a blessing to understand that.

38
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,679
As we considered the lesson last Wednesday evening, we mentioned that with the provision

39
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:33,759
came instruction.

40
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,240
And as we consider the instruction that God provided the children of Israel with on how

41
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:44,559
they would gather the manna, and of course we specifically zeroed in on day number 6

42
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:50,479
and dealing with how they were to do that and whether they would obey the instructions.

43
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,919
And the reality is that we said that God really, as you look at the text of Scripture,

44
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,460
it says that He was going to prove them, test them.

45
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,839
And it was a test of faith, and it was a test of obedience.

46
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:04,160
Would they obey God?

47
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,240
Would they exercise faith in that which God said?

48
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,839
This evening as we look at Leviticus chapter number 25, I want to examine the instruction

49
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:16,759
that God gives with regard to the Sabbath year.

50
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:22,800
And let's read just a couple of verses of Scripture and dig into the passage this evening.

51
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,000
In verse number 1 of Leviticus 25, the Bible says,

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,960
And the Lord spake unto Moses in Mount Sinai, saying,

53
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,559
And so we see that this is the word of the Lord.

54
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:33,559
What a blessing to know that God communicates with His people, amen?

55
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:36,360
And I am so thankful this evening that we have a Bible.

56
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:43,279
I'm thankful that God has given me the simple instruction, though it's simple in its instruction.

57
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:47,039
It's a challenging task, but we're to preach the word.

58
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:52,759
We're to live and teach the word of God, and I'm thankful that God has given us His word.

59
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:56,860
This isn't Moses just providing instruction to the people they've been called to lead.

60
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,759
This is God's instruction.

61
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,759
It says,

62
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,559
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them,

63
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:09,559
When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a Sabbath unto the Lord.

64
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:11,419
We'll read down through verse number 7.

65
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:14,820
We'll look over, if you will, though, in verse number 21.

66
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:20,820
I want to give you the title for the message, and I've adopted it here from verse number 21 of Leviticus 25.

67
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,820
The Bible says,

68
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:29,820
Then I will command My blessing upon you in the sixth year,

69
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,820
and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.

70
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,820
I want to preach a message, share a lesson with you this evening that I've simply entitled,

71
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,220
I will command My blessing upon you.

72
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,220
Now, think about that as being the words of God,

73
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,220
and God saying to His people,

74
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,220
I will command My blessing upon you.

75
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,220
That's precious.

76
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,220
And as we look at the passage of Scripture this evening,

77
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,220
and dig here through what God gives us,

78
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,220
I want you to, first of all, if you're taking notes, consider God's plan for the seventh year.

79
00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:11,619
Really, here in Leviticus 25, verses 1 through 7,

80
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:16,619
we have the opportunity to look and to understand the plan of God

81
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:19,619
for His people with regard to the land during this seventh year.

82
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,619
Notice, I've already read verse number 2,

83
00:05:21,619 --> 00:05:25,619
but it is important that we understand and make note of the fact that the Bible says,

84
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:30,619
When ye come into the land which I give you.

85
00:05:30,619 --> 00:05:33,619
It was not a question on whether they would enter into the land.

86
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:36,619
It's not an if you enter into the land.

87
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:40,019
It's a when, because God promised to do that,

88
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:42,019
and God would bring that to pass.

89
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:46,019
And we understand scripturally, as we study the Word of God,

90
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:48,019
that after the wilderness wanderings,

91
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:52,019
Joshua becomes the human leader of the nation of Israel.

92
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,019
They miraculously cross over the Jordan River.

93
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:59,019
They enter into, conquer, and possess the land that God had promised

94
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:01,019
hundreds of years earlier.

95
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:06,019
And so what a blessing to understand that God is saying to the nation of Israel,

96
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,420
at this particular moment in their history,

97
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,420
When ye come into the land which I give you,

98
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,420
then shall the land keep a Sabbath unto the Lord.

99
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,420
So here in Leviticus 25,

100
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,420
we see that God is reminding them that they will enter into the land,

101
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,420
and here's the plan that I have for you.

102
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,420
Here's my plan. Here's my instruction for you.

103
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,420
By the way, aren't you thankful again that God gives us His plan?

104
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,420
He gives us His instruction.

105
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
Notice verse number three.

106
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,820
Six years thou shalt.

107
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,820
So notice, for this period of six years, here's what they're to do.

108
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,820
Number one, sow thy field.

109
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,820
Right? We understand the principle of sowing and reaping.

110
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,820
Many of us probably have never really had a farm,

111
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,820
or lived on a farm, or worked on a farm.

112
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,820
I know my dad, as a young boy, worked on a farm.

113
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,220
But we understand here that the agricultural aspect

114
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,220
of what God is dealing with here

115
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,220
was absolutely essential for their survival.

116
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,220
It says six years, here's what you do.

117
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,220
Thou shalt sow thy field, notice,

118
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,220
and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard.

119
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,220
That's an important aspect.

120
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,220
Again, if we've not been in the field of agriculture

121
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:32,619
and doing those things, we may not understand the full significance,

122
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,619
but we understand that God is giving them good counsel and good direction.

123
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:38,619
He's providing them with this plan for what they do.

124
00:07:38,619 --> 00:07:41,619
And then you notice at the end of verse number three,

125
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:45,619
and gather in the fruit thereof.

126
00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:47,619
The reaping.

127
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:51,619
So for six years, you sow, you prune, and you gather the fruit.

128
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:53,619
But you notice as you come to verse number four

129
00:07:53,619 --> 00:07:55,619
that it begins with this but.

130
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:57,619
This conjunction.

131
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,019
A different plan for that seventh year.

132
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:04,019
But in the seventh year shall be a Sabbath of rest

133
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:06,019
unto the land.

134
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,019
A Sabbath for the Lord.

135
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:10,019
Now we understand that the people of God

136
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:14,019
had already been instructed with regard to the Sabbath day.

137
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:17,019
And we understand that God had set forth that pattern

138
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:21,019
even in creation where He rested on the seventh day.

139
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:23,019
He created all that He created in six days

140
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:25,019
and then He rested on the seventh day.

141
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,420
Thus providing a model for the children of Israel

142
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,420
in Exodus during the giving of the Ten Commandments.

143
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,419
We find that it's referenced to them

144
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:35,419
with regard to the Sabbath and their responsibility.

145
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,419
And now we find that God is dealing with

146
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:40,419
this Sabbath year, this seventh year.

147
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,419
It says at the end of verse number four,

148
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,419
Thou shalt neither sow thy field

149
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:48,419
nor prune thy vineyard.

150
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:50,419
So in the seventh year,

151
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:52,419
you're not going to do what you did

152
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,820
in year one, two, three, four, five, and six.

153
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,820
You're not going to sow.

154
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
You're not going to prune.

155
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
Verse five, that which groweth of its own accord

156
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
of thy harvest thou shalt not reap.

157
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,820
Neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed

158
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
for it is a year of rest unto the Lord.

159
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,820
Excuse me, unto the land.

160
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,820
Notice verse six.

161
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
And the Sabbath of the land shall be meet for you,

162
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
for thee and for thy servant,

163
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
for thy maid and for thy hired servant

164
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,820
and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee.

165
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:23,219
And for thy cattle and for the beasts

166
00:09:23,219 --> 00:09:25,219
that are in thy land,

167
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:29,219
shall all the increase thereof be meet.

168
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:34,219
I find just as it was noted in our last lesson

169
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:37,219
last Wednesday evening in Exodus 16,

170
00:09:37,219 --> 00:09:40,219
that God gave pretty specific instruction.

171
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:41,219
Amen?

172
00:09:41,219 --> 00:09:44,219
Do you feel like as we've read these first seven verses

173
00:09:44,219 --> 00:09:46,219
that there's anything overly complicated

174
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,219
about the instruction, the plan

175
00:09:48,219 --> 00:09:50,219
that God has communicated to His people?

176
00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:51,619
It's not a complicated plan.

177
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:54,619
It's a plan that God communicates to His people

178
00:09:54,619 --> 00:09:57,619
just as the case was for gathering the manna.

179
00:09:57,619 --> 00:09:59,619
You go out and you gather so much on day one.

180
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:05,099
two, three, four, right? This is what you do. If you store up too much, it's

181
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:09,459
gonna spoil, it stinks, and it breeds worms, and therefore you just gather this

182
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:13,699
much. But on day number six, you gather a double portion, right? Days one through

183
00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:17,659
five, a single portion. This was God's plan. Again, not complicated, not difficult,

184
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:23,339
but it was God's plan. And here, with regard to the seventh year, the Sabbath

185
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:30,299
year, God is giving a plan. He reveals His plan to His people, and He tells them

186
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:35,539
that this is what you're to do when you enter into the land which I give you. So

187
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:40,299
this was not a plan to be implemented during the wilderness wanderings, right?

188
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:44,739
This was a plan that they were to incorporate, implement, when they entered

189
00:10:44,739 --> 00:10:49,819
into and possessed the land. Now, I would submit to you that as we go through the

190
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:53,699
passage of Scripture this evening and we consider the plan of God, I would also

191
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:57,539
say this, that I would look at, and if you're taking notes, number two, I would

192
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:02,299
consider the preparation of God's people. It's interesting to me that as we look

193
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:05,859
at the passage of Scripture and we see what God is giving them to do as far as

194
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:10,499
a plan, we would find that through what we studied last Wednesday evening with

195
00:11:10,499 --> 00:11:15,339
regard to the manna that had miraculously and graciously provided

196
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:20,979
for His people for 40 years, that was a process of preparing the people of God.

197
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:28,899
See, God prepares His people. God, I think often as we would consider how God would

198
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:32,419
call us to do certain things and He would lead us in our lives, and we

199
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:34,899
understand the Bible says, so then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the

200
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:38,739
Word of the Lord, by the Word of God, and we understand that as we go through life

201
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:43,299
that we're to exercise and live by faith, and we mentioned last week that it was a

202
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:48,099
test not simply of obedience, it was a test of obedience, but also was a test of

203
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:53,019
faith. Well, this was going to be a test of faith as well. This wasn't just a

204
00:11:53,019 --> 00:12:01,099
single day, this was an entire year. But God had prepared His people. I think

205
00:12:01,099 --> 00:12:06,339
about Gideon. You think about when God first arrives to the angel of the Lord

206
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:10,899
comes to Gideon and he introduces himself and he calls him a mighty man of

207
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:16,699
valor, right? And Gideon kind of has this perspective of like, you got the wrong

208
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:21,899
guy, right? I'm the least of my father's house, and you understand that these

209
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:25,899
things are going on, and it's interesting if we don't have time this evening to go

210
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:30,059
through all of it, but if you look in Judges 6 and even into chapter number

211
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:36,059
7, and you begin to find how that God develops Gideon for the task that He had

212
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:41,659
for him. See, Gideon wasn't ready on that first day when God came to him. Gideon

213
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:45,899
had to have his faith increased. He had to be prepared for that which God had

214
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:51,299
for him, and we find that the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight in

215
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:56,339
verse number 21 of Judges chapter number 6, and we really believe that as you

216
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:01,299
look there in that text of Scripture, in that section, that God is giving

217
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:07,899
faith builder number one to Gideon. But then Gideon's still not ready, and you'll

218
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:14,860
remember that Gideon, his faith was still small, and he says to God in Judges 6

219
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:20,779
in verse 36 and 37, he says this, he says, if thou wilt save Israel by mine hand as

220
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:26,339
thou hast said, behold I will put a fleece of wool in the floor, and if the

221
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:31,179
dew on the fleece only, be on the fleece only, and if it be dry upon all the

222
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:36,619
earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand as

223
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:44,059
thou hast said. What did God do? God increased his faith. It tells us in verse

224
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:50,899
38 of Judges 6, and it was so. For he, Gideon, rose up early on the morrow, and

225
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:56,379
thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of

226
00:13:56,419 --> 00:14:01,860
water. God increased his faith. God was building his faith. He was preparing his

227
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:08,419
servant. See, Gideon had said to God, he said, God, if thou wilt save Israel by

228
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:14,139
mine hand as thou hast said, then do this thing, and if you do this thing, then I

229
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:18,859
will know that thou wilt save Israel. And God did it. You know what Gideon said?

230
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:27,139
Let's try again. Right? In Judges 6, in verse 39, Gideon said unto God, let not

231
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:32,419
thine anger be hot against me. I probably would want to introduce my request in

232
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:36,579
a like manner, amen? Because I'd already said, if you do this, I'm gonna believe

233
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:42,220
you. I'm gonna know that this is what you have for me. He says, let me prove, I pray

234
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,019
thee, but this once with the fleece, and let it now be dry only upon the fleece,

235
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,859
and upon all the ground, let there be dew. So he reverses what he had the night

236
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:58,579
before. What does God do? Verse 40, and God did so that night. For it was dry upon

237
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:02,899
the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground. But do you know that Gideon

238
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:10,220
still wasn't ready? He wasn't. You read Judges chapter number 7, and he's still

239
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,940
reluctant, he's still unsure as to what's really gonna happen. And we find that God

240
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:20,380
comes to him, and he says, in verse number 9 of Judges 7, it says, and it came to

241
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,979
pass the same night that the Lord said unto him, arise, get thee down into the

242
00:15:23,979 --> 00:15:29,100
host, for I have delivered unto thine hand. But if thou fear to go down, go thou

243
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,179
with pure thy servant down to the host, and thou shalt hear what they say, and

244
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:37,699
afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host.

245
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:41,940
You know what he goes and he hears? He hears this dream being told, and they

246
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:47,220
hear the interpretation when they say, this is none other, in verse number 14,

247
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,299
and his fellow answered and said, this is nothing else save the sword of Gideon,

248
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:56,500
the son of Joash, a man of Israel, for into his hand hath God delivered Midian

249
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:02,540
and all the host. What's God doing? He's preparing Gideon. You know God's

250
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:10,619
preparing you. God's preparing me, right? He is. He's preparing us for what's to

251
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:16,100
come down the road. He's preparing us that we would have faith when we are to

252
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,579
have faith, that we'd exercise that faith, and I believe that for the children of

253
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:26,540
Israel during those 25 years of, excuse me, those 40 years of wilderness

254
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,059
wanderings, that when we come to Leviticus 25 and we see the instruction

255
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:35,260
for when you come into the land, this is what you're supposed to do, this is how

256
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:41,380
you're supposed to deal with the land with regard to sowing and pruning, and

257
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:47,419
this is my plan for you, but God had been preparing them. Not only had he prepared

258
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:54,220
them through the miraculous supply and provision of manna, but we find that

259
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,779
he had worked miraculously through many other areas during that period of

260
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:05,699
wilderness wanderings. God's preparing his people. God's, I believe that he's

261
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:09,540
regularly preparing his people if we would allow God to work in our lives that

262
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,779
as we, see that's why it's so important to have a daily walk with him. That's why

263
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:17,899
it's so vital that every day we're in the Bible and we're, because when the

264
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:22,479
crisis comes and we've been neglecting this book and we've been neglecting the

265
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:26,619
house of God and we've been neglecting all of those things, our walk with God,

266
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:32,220
we've become anemic spiritually and that crisis comes, we're not ready for it. And

267
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,339
then all of a sudden it's like, oh I better go get alone with God, I better go

268
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:40,299
find out what he has for me, and you start looking at the Bible like this and

269
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:43,139
you start flipping here and flipping there and you're going because you're

270
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:47,220
trying to find a verse that's going to help you with that particular situation.

271
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:53,899
But if we had that daily consistent walk with God and he's building us up and

272
00:17:53,899 --> 00:18:00,459
he's preparing us for that which will come at some point in our lives, he's

273
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:04,660
preparing us. So then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of the

274
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:09,540
Lord or the Word of God and we find it as we get into the Word of God that when

275
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:15,220
that moment of trial comes, that moment of difficulty comes, that moment of

276
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:20,059
temptation comes, that we have already spent that time in the Word of God and

277
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:24,979
we have some level of preparation, oh it does not mean that we are sufficient in

278
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:30,540
of ourselves, I'm not seeking to suggest that in any way, but I'm simply saying

279
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:41,099
that God prepares us. And I can't help as I look at Leviticus 25 to consider how

280
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:45,700
that the people of God had been adequately prepared during the

281
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:51,179
wilderness wanderings to really be obedient in this area of instruction

282
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:56,500
that God gives in Leviticus 25 verses 1 through 7. I want you to consider with

283
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,539
me that the very next contextually in Leviticus 25 begins to deal with the

284
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:05,619
the year of Jubilee, the 50th year and all of the things that would happen and

285
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:09,419
all of that and that's not really part of the message this evening so I'm going

286
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:13,779
to skip down to verse number 18 as we consider and keep in thought with the

287
00:19:13,979 --> 00:19:20,260
subject matter before us with regard to the seventh year. We see the plan of God,

288
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:25,020
we see the preparation of God and we find in verse number 18 the Bible says

289
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:30,580
this, wherefore ye shall do my statutes and keep my judgments and do them and

290
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:36,179
ye shall dwell in the land in safety and the land shall yield her fruit and ye

291
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:41,219
shall eat your fill and dwell therein in safety. And notice this in verse number

292
00:19:41,219 --> 00:19:50,700
20, and if you shall say, what shall we eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not

293
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:56,779
sow nor gather in our increase. Now honestly I believe that as you look at

294
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:01,739
verse number 20 God is preemptively answering a question

295
00:20:01,739 --> 00:20:03,959
that they'd not even asked yet.

296
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:06,159
Because God knows everything.

297
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,139
But I can't help but understand this evening

298
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:11,319
that it would be a natural question

299
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,199
that would arise.

300
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:13,919
Right?

301
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,659
You're not going to sow. You're not going to prune.

302
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:17,459
So what am I going to eat?

303
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:19,579
Right?

304
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:22,319
And we find that as we look at these verses

305
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,039
in Leviticus 25, verses 18-22,

306
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,119
if you're taking notes,

307
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:29,239
number 3, embrace the promise of God.

308
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:31,079
Embrace the promise of God.

309
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:33,219
What shall we eat the seventh year?

310
00:20:33,219 --> 00:20:35,479
Let me ask you this as we consider

311
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:38,359
the teachings of Jesus in Matthew 6.

312
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:40,659
Is it not adequately revealed to us

313
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:44,819
that God knows what our needs are?

314
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:46,459
He's the One that designed us.

315
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:47,859
He's the One that created us.

316
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:50,499
He knows that we need food

317
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:54,179
and water, raiment, shelter.

318
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:55,979
But what does He finish there

319
00:20:55,979 --> 00:20:57,899
in Matthew 6?

320
00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:01,299
Seek ye first the Kingdom of God.

321
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:03,419
And all these things shall be added unto thee.

322
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:04,219
Right?

323
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:05,599
And so we understand here

324
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,319
that there's a question from a human perspective

325
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:10,519
even as we've understood in our lesson

326
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,039
from last week in Exodus 16,

327
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,159
we have no food.

328
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,879
God knew that they needed food.

329
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:18,259
He created them.

330
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:21,419
He made us that way.

331
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:24,879
So we find here

332
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:27,219
where we looked at and gave our title

333
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,699
for our message this evening in v. 21.

334
00:21:29,699 --> 00:21:31,139
Embrace the promise of God.

335
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:35,379
Notice v. 21.

336
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:38,499
Then I will command

337
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:42,419
My blessing upon you in the sixth year.

338
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:44,819
I want God's blessing.

339
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:47,939
Don't you?

340
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:51,079
He tells them in v. 18 and 19

341
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,379
that if you do these things,

342
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:55,179
if you do My statutes,

343
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:56,179
keep My judgments,

344
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:57,259
if you do them,

345
00:21:57,259 --> 00:21:59,019
you shall dwell in the land in safety.

346
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:01,939
The land will yield her fruit.

347
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:03,859
You shall eat your fill

348
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:07,179
and dwell therein in safety.

349
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:09,699
And God then says in v. 21,

350
00:22:09,699 --> 00:22:14,699
then I will command My blessing upon you.

351
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:17,979
I just love the imagery that I see in my mind

352
00:22:17,979 --> 00:22:19,979
as my sanctified imagination

353
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:21,379
as God Almighty,

354
00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:23,859
the Creator of the universe,

355
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:25,099
saying to His people,

356
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:30,179
I am going to command My blessing upon you.

357
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:33,459
That's pretty awesome.

358
00:22:33,459 --> 00:22:37,059
Notice what He says.

359
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:40,419
He's going to command it in the sixth year.

360
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:44,859
And it, the land, shall.

361
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:47,619
I like the word shall.

362
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:52,379
Bring forth fruit for how long?

363
00:22:52,419 --> 00:22:55,939
For three years.

364
00:22:55,939 --> 00:22:58,419
It's not going to be because of your creative

365
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,059
agricultural abilities.

366
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:04,299
No, no, I'm going to command My blessing upon you.

367
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,339
If you do what I'm telling you to do,

368
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:07,659
if you follow the plan

369
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:09,299
that I'm giving you to follow,

370
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:11,899
again, we've already settled the fact

371
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:15,179
that it's not a complicated plan.

372
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:19,179
But it is a plan that requires faith.

373
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:20,499
Right?

374
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:24,939
Just like on day number six with the manna,

375
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:28,259
it required faith that it wasn't going to stink

376
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:31,259
when you got that double portion in breed worms.

377
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:33,179
Just like on day number three,

378
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,179
or if you just say day number one,

379
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:36,419
you see all this manna,

380
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:37,579
you didn't have any food.

381
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:39,099
You were complaining about food.

382
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:40,859
And you understand that Moses said,

383
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:42,419
hey, only take a single portion.

384
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:45,259
Don't take more than what you need.

385
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:47,059
And you're like, I don't know if this stuff's

386
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,339
going to come back tomorrow,

387
00:23:48,339 --> 00:23:50,019
so I go ahead and gather as much as I can

388
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:51,339
to fit in my basket.

389
00:23:51,339 --> 00:23:54,539
You know what I mean?

390
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,899
And then all of a sudden,

391
00:23:56,899 --> 00:24:00,219
it stinks and it's bred worms.

392
00:24:00,219 --> 00:24:02,579
It requires faith.

393
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:04,379
This plan that God gives with regard

394
00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:07,819
to the seventh year, it requires faith.

395
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:09,539
That God is going to do what He said

396
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:10,859
He was going to do.

397
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:13,499
By the way, when you really consider

398
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:16,059
the introduction to this instruction,

399
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:19,220
when God says when

400
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:21,539
you come into the land which I give you,

401
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:23,660
again, it was God that brought them there.

402
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,660
And this is the plan that you're supposed to follow.

403
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,299
And here's what I'm going to do.

404
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,699
I'm going to command my blessing upon you,

405
00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:31,500
and in that sixth year, the land,

406
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,979
it shall bring forth fruit for three years.

407
00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:39,979
Notice, it says in verse number 22,

408
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:43,819
and ye shall sow the eighth year.

409
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:45,500
You're not sowing the seventh year, remember?

410
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,380
That's the plan.

411
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:48,579
In verse number four and five,

412
00:24:48,579 --> 00:24:51,579
we understood that God said this is what

413
00:24:51,579 --> 00:24:53,739
you're going to do in this seventh year.

414
00:24:53,739 --> 00:24:55,660
Thou shalt neither sow thy field

415
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,459
nor prune thy vineyard.

416
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:59,459
So here we find in verse 22,

417
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:02,059
and ye shall sow the eighth year

418
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:05,819
and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year.

419
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:07,339
Until her fruits come in,

420
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,979
ye shall eat of the old store.

421
00:25:09,979 --> 00:25:13,419
So when you sow in that eighth year,

422
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:15,179
you will take that harvest

423
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:16,819
and eat in that ninth year,

424
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:19,779
but because I'm going to bless in that sixth year,

425
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:22,179
because I'm going to command

426
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:24,779
that my blessing will be upon you

427
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:28,259
and that the land shall bring forth fruit for three years,

428
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:31,539
then in year six, seven, and eight,

429
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:34,299
you're going to have enough.

430
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:39,459
Because I'm going to command my blessing upon you.

431
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:41,699
Here's the question.

432
00:25:41,699 --> 00:25:43,619
What would they do?

433
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,660
Would they believe God?

434
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,899
Would they exercise faith?

435
00:25:47,899 --> 00:25:50,500
Unfortunately, the answer is no.

436
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,139
There's absolutely no record

437
00:25:52,139 --> 00:25:53,419
in the Old Testament account

438
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:55,779
that they ever did what God told them to do

439
00:25:55,779 --> 00:25:58,940
with regard to this Sabbath year.

440
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,220
However, 2 Chronicles 36,

441
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,699
if you want to turn there quickly.

442
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:09,019
And just before,

443
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:12,819
or just at the end of the text of Scripture

444
00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:20,500
that records for us the Babylonian captivity of Judah,

445
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,339
of course, we understand that Jeremiah

446
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:24,220
had been prophesying.

447
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,380
You remember much of Jeremiah's prophecy

448
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,299
with regard to the Babylonian captivity

449
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:31,819
and that a remnant would return after 70 years.

450
00:26:31,819 --> 00:26:35,019
There's significance to that number

451
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:37,299
with regard to their violation

452
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:40,419
of this instruction that we're studying this evening.

453
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:41,979
And you read in verse 21,

454
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:42,819
the Bible says,

455
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:45,380
"...to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah

456
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:51,059
until the land had enjoyed her Sabbaths.

457
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:53,139
For as long as she lay desolate,

458
00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:56,019
she kept Sabbath to fulfill

459
00:26:56,019 --> 00:27:00,859
threescore and ten years."

460
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:03,299
So for 490 years, if you do the math,

461
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:07,339
there'd have been one year of Sabbath each seven.

462
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:09,500
They didn't do it.

463
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,959
They didn't follow the plan.

464
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:13,919
Was it a lack of faith?

465
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,959
Was it just flat-out disobedience?

466
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:18,799
I think it's a couple of both.

467
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,000
Amen?

468
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,880
It's a combination.

469
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,759
Not a couple of both,

470
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:24,559
it's a combination of both.

471
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,000
And this evening, when we think about this

472
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,599
and we think about this simple instruction,

473
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:28,839
I understand, listen,

474
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:31,119
I am in absolutely no way trying to tell you

475
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:33,119
that the text of Leviticus 25

476
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:35,279
is to be applied in our lives today

477
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,079
from a perspective of agriculture.

478
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:40,799
I'm showing you a principle that God gives.

479
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:43,119
If you just follow His plan,

480
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,359
He'll bless.

481
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,440
And He'll always do what He says He will do.

482
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,519
And the reality is that

483
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:53,319
the subject matter in which we studied

484
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:55,160
last Wednesday evening,

485
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,479
that as they would weekly, daily,

486
00:27:57,479 --> 00:28:00,559
as they would collect that manna

487
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,160
every day that they would go out,

488
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,720
I understand they didn't stand in awe of it.

489
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,000
I understand every day,

490
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,440
they didn't come out of their tents

491
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,519
and say, oh, there's manna again.

492
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:11,239
Honey, it's here again.

493
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:13,679
God did it.

494
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,959
No, they said we hate this bread.

495
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:19,079
Is that not what they said?

496
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:22,720
But can you imagine if they had that perspective?

497
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,440
Can you imagine if every day

498
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,880
they understood God did it again?

499
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,559
He rained bread from heaven.

500
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,359
He gave us this manna.

501
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:33,479
He's providing for us.

502
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:35,959
We collected a double portion again this week

503
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:36,959
on day number six,

504
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:40,520
and it didn't spoil.

505
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,399
God was preparing it.

506
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:45,959
God prepares us.

507
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:48,719
And we see that here in Leviticus 25,

508
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:51,760
this truth is given.

509
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,719
And there's just a lack of faith and obedience

510
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:57,000
on the part of the nation of Israel

511
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,039
with regard to these things.

512
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,320
But can I tell you that God wants to prove Himself

513
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,559
real in our lives?

514
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:08,080
I believe Ephesians 3.20.

515
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,239
I believe that He is able to do exceeding abundantly

516
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:12,359
above all that we ask or think.

517
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:14,399
Do you believe that this evening?

518
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,359
He is.

519
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:18,279
You know, you think about the truth

520
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:21,359
of Philippians chapter number four

521
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,119
when Paul is commending the believers in Philippi

522
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:27,320
for their regular communication with Him.

523
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,320
And if you understand contextually

524
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,159
what he's dealing with,

525
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,880
how that they gave to help him financially

526
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,320
in that ministry in which he was engaged in.

527
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,959
And he says to them with regard

528
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:41,080
to his commendation of them,

529
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,640
he says that he had received these things

530
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,399
and that it was an odor of a sweet smell,

531
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:48,279
a sacrifice acceptable and well-pleasing to God.

532
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,359
And he then tells them,

533
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:51,119
he gives them this wonderful promise

534
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,479
in verse number 19.

535
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:55,119
He says, but my God shall supply all your need

536
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,679
according to His riches and glory

537
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,919
by Christ Jesus.

538
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,479
Is he still able to do that today?

539
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:05,659
Absolutely.

540
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:07,919
He's God.

541
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,259
He's on His throne.

542
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:11,179
He's able.

543
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:16,099
I read it recently.

544
00:30:16,099 --> 00:30:18,419
It took place many generations ago.

545
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:20,499
So it's not a current event story

546
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:22,759
from a missionary.

547
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:25,859
It's a historical record

548
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:28,459
from a missionary.

549
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,959
And it was such an encouraging

550
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:33,899
little truth that I thought it would be appropriate

551
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:35,399
to share it with you this evening

552
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:37,479
with regard to the subject matter

553
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:38,819
which we're dealing with

554
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:41,399
of trusting God and believing God.

555
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:44,599
That God said, I will command My blessing upon you.

556
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:46,219
You do what I'm telling you to do.

557
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:49,479
You follow My plan and I'll bless.

558
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:51,559
In any case, this missionary is teaching

559
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:54,239
and he'd been laboring in the field

560
00:30:54,239 --> 00:30:56,359
and he'd been teaching the people.

561
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:58,239
And he began to teach them

562
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:01,639
about the importance of giving.

563
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:03,899
And we understand that's a biblical truth.

564
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:05,739
We understand the Bible truth

565
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:08,359
with regard to giving.

566
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:11,599
God loveth a cheerful giver. Amen?

567
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:13,299
And we understand those principles

568
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:15,119
and those truths that God has given.

569
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:17,679
I'm not going to teach a message on that this evening,

570
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,759
but we understand that.

571
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:22,819
To participate in the contribution

572
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:25,159
for the work of the Lord.

573
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:27,519
And he had been teaching this truth

574
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,419
to the people that he'd been reaching

575
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:32,259
as they'd established a church there

576
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:33,419
on that mission field

577
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:35,659
and teaching them how they need

578
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:38,199
to participate in giving.

579
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:40,899
Now, one particular day,

580
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,599
he was just going around his business

581
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,959
and he was at his home

582
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:46,919
and a little boy from the church

583
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:49,279
came to his house.

584
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,759
A little boy came to the house

585
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:53,159
and he said, Pastor,

586
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:56,799
I'm bringing my tithe.

587
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,439
Because of the particulars

588
00:31:58,439 --> 00:32:00,159
and the area in which they were,

589
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,839
it wasn't that he was bringing a monetary tithe.

590
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,939
He was bringing a fish.

591
00:32:04,939 --> 00:32:06,239
There's some mission fields

592
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:07,939
that still have those types of things

593
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:10,439
where they'll bring of the grain offering

594
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:11,939
and they'll bring those things.

595
00:32:11,939 --> 00:32:13,779
That's what they have as their tithe.

596
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:16,519
I mean, that's what they bring.

597
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:20,479
And this young boy brings a fish.

598
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:22,119
And he says, Pastor,

599
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:24,079
you've been teaching us

600
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:26,039
about tithing and about giving

601
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:28,439
and about trusting God.

602
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:31,519
And here's my offering.

603
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,679
The pastor was excited.

604
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:33,719
He was encouraged.

605
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:35,839
This little boy's getting it.

606
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,459
And he says to the little boy,

607
00:32:37,459 --> 00:32:39,739
and he's not from America,

608
00:32:39,739 --> 00:32:41,159
so his name wasn't Johnny,

609
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,239
but he says to the little boy,

610
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:45,839
he says, so where are the other nine?

611
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,479
Because if you brought me one fish

612
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:48,439
and it's a tithe,

613
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:50,039
then that means you caught ten.

614
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:52,279
You understand how that math works.

615
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:53,439
He said, oh, Pastor,

616
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:54,739
they're still in the river.

617
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:59,299
I'm going to catch them.

618
00:32:59,299 --> 00:33:02,779
That's pretty awesome.

619
00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:10,459
That missionary pastor sat back and thought,

620
00:33:10,459 --> 00:33:12,699
he understands a principle

621
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,299
of believing God.

622
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:18,899
And that little boy had full confidence

623
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:20,979
that he's going to go back to the river

624
00:33:20,979 --> 00:33:24,179
and he's going to catch himself nine more fish.

625
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:29,499
Because he just believed God.

626
00:33:29,499 --> 00:33:33,059
And sometimes in our lives,

627
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:35,059
we just need to get back to the simple truth

628
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:36,899
of just believing God.

629
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:38,939
Sometimes we try to get too analytical.

630
00:33:38,939 --> 00:33:40,179
I'm guilty, right?

631
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:42,659
I'm an analytical kind of person.

632
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:47,019
We try to make everything make sense.

633
00:33:47,019 --> 00:33:49,299
But God is God.

634
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:51,219
He didn't tell him He was going to make

635
00:33:51,219 --> 00:33:53,219
the land produced for three years

636
00:33:53,219 --> 00:33:55,699
bring forth a fruit in the second year.

637
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:58,579
He told him in the sixth year.

638
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:00,699
And it would last for that time

639
00:34:00,699 --> 00:34:05,419
because I will command My blessing upon you.

640
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:07,379
Then I will command My blessing upon you

641
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,379
in the sixth year,

642
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,819
and it shall bring forth fruit

643
00:34:10,819 --> 00:34:12,979
for three years.

644
00:34:12,979 --> 00:34:15,939
This evening,

645
00:34:15,939 --> 00:34:17,819
as we think about the nation of Israel

646
00:34:17,819 --> 00:34:19,539
and we think about these two lessons,

647
00:34:19,539 --> 00:34:22,419
and I did not initially intend

648
00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:23,499
to teach these two lessons

649
00:34:23,499 --> 00:34:25,699
these past two Wednesday nights,

650
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:27,619
but the reality is that

651
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:29,059
God was teaching His people

652
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:30,139
a very important lesson.

653
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:32,339
And as we can study the history of it

654
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:34,299
and the account that is given,

655
00:34:34,299 --> 00:34:36,899
we can gain profitable principles

656
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:38,979
about how God works

657
00:34:38,979 --> 00:34:41,659
and how God expects us still today,

658
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:44,099
the just shall live by faith, right?

659
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:46,059
We're to live by faith.

660
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:47,539
We understand Hebrews 11, six,

661
00:34:47,539 --> 00:34:51,099
without faith, it's impossible to please Him.

662
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:53,179
So this evening,

663
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:55,739
I want God's blessing.

664
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:58,179
God's given us a plan.

665
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,779
I believe that He's prepared us.

666
00:35:00,779 --> 00:35:01,739
He's given us all things

667
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:03,219
that pertain unto life and godliness

668
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:05,059
is what the Word of God says.

669
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:07,179
And so He's prepared us adequately,

670
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:09,059
and we just need to believe Him

671
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:11,779
to test of faith and obedience.

672
00:35:11,779 --> 00:35:14,099
This evening, God said to His people,

673
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:17,659
I will command My blessing upon you.

674
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:19,059
That's encouraging.

675
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:19,899
Let's pray together.

676
00:35:19,939 --> 00:35:21,259
We love You.

677
00:35:21,259 --> 00:35:22,539
We thank You so much for loving us.

678
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:23,499
We thank You for Your Word,

679
00:35:23,499 --> 00:35:24,619
the truth contained therein.

680
00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:29,619
We thank You for the opportunity to study it.

681
00:35:30,499 --> 00:35:33,659
Lord, we are saddened by the disobedience

682
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:34,939
of the nation of Israel,

683
00:35:34,939 --> 00:35:36,779
historically as it's been recorded.

684
00:35:38,779 --> 00:35:39,979
God, I pray that You'd help us

685
00:35:39,979 --> 00:35:42,299
to be obedient to the plan

686
00:35:42,299 --> 00:35:43,939
that You have for our lives.

687
00:35:44,779 --> 00:35:47,739
Help us to understand that the Gospel still works.

688
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:50,659
It never stopped working.

689
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:54,859
You said in Your Word that the Gospel

690
00:35:54,859 --> 00:35:57,019
is the power of God unto salvation.

691
00:35:57,979 --> 00:35:59,459
You said in Your Word that we're to go

692
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:02,139
and preach the Gospel to every creature.

693
00:36:02,139 --> 00:36:04,259
Help us to just have faith.

694
00:36:04,259 --> 00:36:06,619
Help us to simply obey

695
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:08,339
the instruction that You've given.

696
00:36:10,659 --> 00:36:12,779
That we would see souls saved,

697
00:36:12,779 --> 00:36:15,619
lives changed,

698
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:16,939
folks discipled.

699
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:21,259
Ultimately, that You would be glorified.

700
00:36:23,259 --> 00:36:24,859
Lord, we pray that You'd bless our time of prayer.

701
00:36:24,859 --> 00:36:26,979
We thank You for the privilege.

702
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:30,099
We thank You for the power and prayer,

703
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:31,699
the invitation that You've given us.

704
00:36:31,699 --> 00:36:33,699
We pray that You'd work mightily.

705
00:36:33,699 --> 00:36:34,979
And we'll thank You for all that You'll do.

706
00:36:34,979 --> 00:36:37,539
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
