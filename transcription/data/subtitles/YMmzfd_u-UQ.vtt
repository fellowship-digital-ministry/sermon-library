00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.279
Leviticus chapter number 25, and the thunder is roaring and the skies have gotten dark.

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:13.819
If you're watching live stream, Joseph asked me a moment ago, what happens if the power

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:15.939
goes out?

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:21.940
It means that you lose your connectivity to our live stream, okay?

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.340
And so we are having some thunderstorms.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.879
And so we, those that are here, we get to just continue, amen.

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:31.319
And praise the Lord for that.

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:35.959
But Leviticus chapter number 25 this evening, and I'll be looking at verses 1 through 7,

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:39.720
and then we'll skip down and look at verses 18 through 22.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.319
And let me just remind you, last Wednesday evening, we studied the 16th chapter of the

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:47.319
book of Exodus.

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:52.119
And as we studied Exodus 16, I asked this question, and we used it as the title of the

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:53.119
message.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:58.919
I asked the question many times throughout the message, would you have passed the test?

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:03.040
And that was a purpose of evaluating our own selves.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.319
And I mentioned often throughout that lesson that we could answer quickly and say, yes,

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:11.879
I would have passed, because that's what we'd like to have said.

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:13.360
And I asked you to really examine.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.720
And we know that there were some that did pass, and I'm so thankful for that.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.919
There were some, of course, that did not pass.

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:23.779
But as we studied that passage of scripture, we were reminded how the Lord miraculously

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:28.279
and graciously provided manna for His people.

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:32.599
They had complained earlier about no water, and God provided for them the water that they

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:33.599
needed.

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:37.720
They had now complained about no food, and God provided for them.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.839
And what a blessing.

00:01:38.839 --> 00:01:44.160
The end of the chapter tells us in Exodus 16 and verse number 35 that they ate manna

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.080
for 40 years.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.379
And what miraculous provision that God gave to His people.

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:54.680
And it's interesting, and we mentioned this as we studied through the book of Joshua during

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.519
the last several months, as we were studying through that book.

00:01:57.519 --> 00:02:03.000
In Joshua chapter number 5 and verses 10 through 12, the book of Joshua records for us the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.919
historical account of when the children of Israel observed the Passover in the land.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.979
And then in verse number 12 tells us that the manna ceased.

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:17.320
They no longer had manna, and God had provided them the manna until they would then be sustained

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.000
from the fruit of the field and the land in which God would provide them with.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.080
And what a blessing to understand that.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.679
As we considered the lesson last Wednesday evening, we mentioned that with the provision

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:33.759
came instruction.

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:38.240
And as we consider the instruction that God provided the children of Israel with on how

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.559
they would gather the manna, and of course we specifically zeroed in on day number 6

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:50.479
and dealing with how they were to do that and whether they would obey the instructions.

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:55.919
And the reality is that we said that God really, as you look at the text of Scripture,

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.460
it says that He was going to prove them, test them.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.839
And it was a test of faith, and it was a test of obedience.

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:04.160
Would they obey God?

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.240
Would they exercise faith in that which God said?

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.839
This evening as we look at Leviticus chapter number 25, I want to examine the instruction

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:16.759
that God gives with regard to the Sabbath year.

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:22.800
And let's read just a couple of verses of Scripture and dig into the passage this evening.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.000
In verse number 1 of Leviticus 25, the Bible says,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.960
And the Lord spake unto Moses in Mount Sinai, saying,

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.559
And so we see that this is the word of the Lord.

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:33.559
What a blessing to know that God communicates with His people, amen?

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:36.360
And I am so thankful this evening that we have a Bible.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:43.279
I'm thankful that God has given me the simple instruction, though it's simple in its instruction.

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:47.039
It's a challenging task, but we're to preach the word.

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:52.759
We're to live and teach the word of God, and I'm thankful that God has given us His word.

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:56.860
This isn't Moses just providing instruction to the people they've been called to lead.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.759
This is God's instruction.

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:59.759
It says,

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:03.559
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them,

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:09.559
When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a Sabbath unto the Lord.

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:11.419
We'll read down through verse number 7.

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.820
We'll look over, if you will, though, in verse number 21.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.820
I want to give you the title for the message, and I've adopted it here from verse number 21 of Leviticus 25.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.820
The Bible says,

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:29.820
Then I will command My blessing upon you in the sixth year,

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.820
and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.820
I want to preach a message, share a lesson with you this evening that I've simply entitled,

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.220
I will command My blessing upon you.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.220
Now, think about that as being the words of God,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.220
and God saying to His people,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.220
I will command My blessing upon you.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.220
That's precious.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.220
And as we look at the passage of Scripture this evening,

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.220
and dig here through what God gives us,

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.220
I want you to, first of all, if you're taking notes, consider God's plan for the seventh year.

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:11.619
Really, here in Leviticus 25, verses 1 through 7,

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:16.619
we have the opportunity to look and to understand the plan of God

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:19.619
for His people with regard to the land during this seventh year.

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:21.619
Notice, I've already read verse number 2,

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:25.619
but it is important that we understand and make note of the fact that the Bible says,

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:30.619
When ye come into the land which I give you.

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:33.619
It was not a question on whether they would enter into the land.

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:36.619
It's not an if you enter into the land.

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:40.019
It's a when, because God promised to do that,

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:42.019
and God would bring that to pass.

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:46.019
And we understand scripturally, as we study the Word of God,

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:48.019
that after the wilderness wanderings,

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:52.019
Joshua becomes the human leader of the nation of Israel.

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:54.019
They miraculously cross over the Jordan River.

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:59.019
They enter into, conquer, and possess the land that God had promised

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:01.019
hundreds of years earlier.

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:06.019
And so what a blessing to understand that God is saying to the nation of Israel,

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.420
at this particular moment in their history,

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.420
When ye come into the land which I give you,

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.420
then shall the land keep a Sabbath unto the Lord.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.420
So here in Leviticus 25,

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.420
we see that God is reminding them that they will enter into the land,

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.420
and here's the plan that I have for you.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.420
Here's my plan. Here's my instruction for you.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.420
By the way, aren't you thankful again that God gives us His plan?

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.420
He gives us His instruction.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.820
Notice verse number three.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.820
Six years thou shalt.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.820
So notice, for this period of six years, here's what they're to do.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.820
Number one, sow thy field.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.820
Right? We understand the principle of sowing and reaping.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.820
Many of us probably have never really had a farm,

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.820
or lived on a farm, or worked on a farm.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.820
I know my dad, as a young boy, worked on a farm.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.220
But we understand here that the agricultural aspect

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.220
of what God is dealing with here

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.220
was absolutely essential for their survival.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.220
It says six years, here's what you do.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.220
Thou shalt sow thy field, notice,

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.220
and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.220
That's an important aspect.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.220
Again, if we've not been in the field of agriculture

00:07:28.619 --> 00:07:32.619
and doing those things, we may not understand the full significance,

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:36.619
but we understand that God is giving them good counsel and good direction.

00:07:36.619 --> 00:07:38.619
He's providing them with this plan for what they do.

00:07:38.619 --> 00:07:41.619
And then you notice at the end of verse number three,

00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:45.619
and gather in the fruit thereof.

00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:47.619
The reaping.

00:07:47.619 --> 00:07:51.619
So for six years, you sow, you prune, and you gather the fruit.

00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:53.619
But you notice as you come to verse number four

00:07:53.619 --> 00:07:55.619
that it begins with this but.

00:07:55.619 --> 00:07:57.619
This conjunction.

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:00.019
A different plan for that seventh year.

00:08:00.019 --> 00:08:04.019
But in the seventh year shall be a Sabbath of rest

00:08:04.019 --> 00:08:06.019
unto the land.

00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:08.019
A Sabbath for the Lord.

00:08:08.019 --> 00:08:10.019
Now we understand that the people of God

00:08:10.019 --> 00:08:14.019
had already been instructed with regard to the Sabbath day.

00:08:14.019 --> 00:08:17.019
And we understand that God had set forth that pattern

00:08:17.019 --> 00:08:21.019
even in creation where He rested on the seventh day.

00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:23.019
He created all that He created in six days

00:08:23.019 --> 00:08:25.019
and then He rested on the seventh day.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.420
Thus providing a model for the children of Israel

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.420
in Exodus during the giving of the Ten Commandments.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.419
We find that it's referenced to them

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:35.419
with regard to the Sabbath and their responsibility.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:37.419
And now we find that God is dealing with

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:40.419
this Sabbath year, this seventh year.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.419
It says at the end of verse number four,

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:45.419
Thou shalt neither sow thy field

00:08:45.419 --> 00:08:48.419
nor prune thy vineyard.

00:08:48.419 --> 00:08:50.419
So in the seventh year,

00:08:50.419 --> 00:08:52.419
you're not going to do what you did

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.820
in year one, two, three, four, five, and six.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.820
You're not going to sow.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.820
You're not going to prune.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.820
Verse five, that which groweth of its own accord

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.820
of thy harvest thou shalt not reap.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.820
Neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.820
for it is a year of rest unto the Lord.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.820
Excuse me, unto the land.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:11.820
Notice verse six.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.820
And the Sabbath of the land shall be meet for you,

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.820
for thee and for thy servant,

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.820
for thy maid and for thy hired servant

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.820
and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee.

00:09:21.219 --> 00:09:23.219
And for thy cattle and for the beasts

00:09:23.219 --> 00:09:25.219
that are in thy land,

00:09:25.219 --> 00:09:29.219
shall all the increase thereof be meet.

00:09:29.219 --> 00:09:34.219
I find just as it was noted in our last lesson

00:09:34.219 --> 00:09:37.219
last Wednesday evening in Exodus 16,

00:09:37.219 --> 00:09:40.219
that God gave pretty specific instruction.

00:09:40.219 --> 00:09:41.219
Amen?

00:09:41.219 --> 00:09:44.219
Do you feel like as we've read these first seven verses

00:09:44.219 --> 00:09:46.219
that there's anything overly complicated

00:09:46.219 --> 00:09:48.219
about the instruction, the plan

00:09:48.219 --> 00:09:50.219
that God has communicated to His people?

00:09:50.619 --> 00:09:51.619
It's not a complicated plan.

00:09:51.619 --> 00:09:54.619
It's a plan that God communicates to His people

00:09:54.619 --> 00:09:57.619
just as the case was for gathering the manna.

00:09:57.619 --> 00:09:59.619
You go out and you gather so much on day one.

00:09:59.619 --> 00:10:05.099
two, three, four, right? This is what you do. If you store up too much, it's

00:10:05.099 --> 00:10:09.459
gonna spoil, it stinks, and it breeds worms, and therefore you just gather this

00:10:09.459 --> 00:10:13.699
much. But on day number six, you gather a double portion, right? Days one through

00:10:13.699 --> 00:10:17.659
five, a single portion. This was God's plan. Again, not complicated, not difficult,

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:23.339
but it was God's plan. And here, with regard to the seventh year, the Sabbath

00:10:23.339 --> 00:10:30.299
year, God is giving a plan. He reveals His plan to His people, and He tells them

00:10:30.299 --> 00:10:35.539
that this is what you're to do when you enter into the land which I give you. So

00:10:35.539 --> 00:10:40.299
this was not a plan to be implemented during the wilderness wanderings, right?

00:10:40.299 --> 00:10:44.739
This was a plan that they were to incorporate, implement, when they entered

00:10:44.739 --> 00:10:49.819
into and possessed the land. Now, I would submit to you that as we go through the

00:10:49.819 --> 00:10:53.699
passage of Scripture this evening and we consider the plan of God, I would also

00:10:53.699 --> 00:10:57.539
say this, that I would look at, and if you're taking notes, number two, I would

00:10:57.539 --> 00:11:02.299
consider the preparation of God's people. It's interesting to me that as we look

00:11:02.299 --> 00:11:05.859
at the passage of Scripture and we see what God is giving them to do as far as

00:11:05.859 --> 00:11:10.499
a plan, we would find that through what we studied last Wednesday evening with

00:11:10.499 --> 00:11:15.339
regard to the manna that had miraculously and graciously provided

00:11:15.339 --> 00:11:20.979
for His people for 40 years, that was a process of preparing the people of God.

00:11:20.979 --> 00:11:28.899
See, God prepares His people. God, I think often as we would consider how God would

00:11:28.899 --> 00:11:32.419
call us to do certain things and He would lead us in our lives, and we

00:11:32.419 --> 00:11:34.899
understand the Bible says, so then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the

00:11:34.899 --> 00:11:38.739
Word of the Lord, by the Word of God, and we understand that as we go through life

00:11:38.739 --> 00:11:43.299
that we're to exercise and live by faith, and we mentioned last week that it was a

00:11:43.379 --> 00:11:48.099
test not simply of obedience, it was a test of obedience, but also was a test of

00:11:48.099 --> 00:11:53.019
faith. Well, this was going to be a test of faith as well. This wasn't just a

00:11:53.019 --> 00:12:01.099
single day, this was an entire year. But God had prepared His people. I think

00:12:01.099 --> 00:12:06.339
about Gideon. You think about when God first arrives to the angel of the Lord

00:12:06.339 --> 00:12:10.899
comes to Gideon and he introduces himself and he calls him a mighty man of

00:12:10.899 --> 00:12:16.699
valor, right? And Gideon kind of has this perspective of like, you got the wrong

00:12:16.699 --> 00:12:21.899
guy, right? I'm the least of my father's house, and you understand that these

00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:25.899
things are going on, and it's interesting if we don't have time this evening to go

00:12:25.899 --> 00:12:30.059
through all of it, but if you look in Judges 6 and even into chapter number

00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:36.059
7, and you begin to find how that God develops Gideon for the task that He had

00:12:36.179 --> 00:12:41.659
for him. See, Gideon wasn't ready on that first day when God came to him. Gideon

00:12:41.659 --> 00:12:45.899
had to have his faith increased. He had to be prepared for that which God had

00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:51.299
for him, and we find that the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight in

00:12:51.299 --> 00:12:56.339
verse number 21 of Judges chapter number 6, and we really believe that as you

00:12:56.339 --> 00:13:01.299
look there in that text of Scripture, in that section, that God is giving

00:13:01.299 --> 00:13:07.899
faith builder number one to Gideon. But then Gideon's still not ready, and you'll

00:13:07.899 --> 00:13:14.860
remember that Gideon, his faith was still small, and he says to God in Judges 6

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:20.779
in verse 36 and 37, he says this, he says, if thou wilt save Israel by mine hand as

00:13:20.779 --> 00:13:26.339
thou hast said, behold I will put a fleece of wool in the floor, and if the

00:13:26.339 --> 00:13:31.179
dew on the fleece only, be on the fleece only, and if it be dry upon all the

00:13:31.179 --> 00:13:36.619
earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand as

00:13:36.619 --> 00:13:44.059
thou hast said. What did God do? God increased his faith. It tells us in verse

00:13:44.059 --> 00:13:50.899
38 of Judges 6, and it was so. For he, Gideon, rose up early on the morrow, and

00:13:50.899 --> 00:13:56.379
thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of

00:13:56.419 --> 00:14:01.860
water. God increased his faith. God was building his faith. He was preparing his

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:08.419
servant. See, Gideon had said to God, he said, God, if thou wilt save Israel by

00:14:08.419 --> 00:14:14.139
mine hand as thou hast said, then do this thing, and if you do this thing, then I

00:14:14.139 --> 00:14:18.859
will know that thou wilt save Israel. And God did it. You know what Gideon said?

00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:27.139
Let's try again. Right? In Judges 6, in verse 39, Gideon said unto God, let not

00:14:27.139 --> 00:14:32.419
thine anger be hot against me. I probably would want to introduce my request in

00:14:32.419 --> 00:14:36.579
a like manner, amen? Because I'd already said, if you do this, I'm gonna believe

00:14:36.579 --> 00:14:42.220
you. I'm gonna know that this is what you have for me. He says, let me prove, I pray

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:47.019
thee, but this once with the fleece, and let it now be dry only upon the fleece,

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:50.859
and upon all the ground, let there be dew. So he reverses what he had the night

00:14:50.859 --> 00:14:58.579
before. What does God do? Verse 40, and God did so that night. For it was dry upon

00:14:58.579 --> 00:15:02.899
the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground. But do you know that Gideon

00:15:02.899 --> 00:15:10.220
still wasn't ready? He wasn't. You read Judges chapter number 7, and he's still

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:14.940
reluctant, he's still unsure as to what's really gonna happen. And we find that God

00:15:15.299 --> 00:15:20.380
comes to him, and he says, in verse number 9 of Judges 7, it says, and it came to

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:23.979
pass the same night that the Lord said unto him, arise, get thee down into the

00:15:23.979 --> 00:15:29.100
host, for I have delivered unto thine hand. But if thou fear to go down, go thou

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:34.179
with pure thy servant down to the host, and thou shalt hear what they say, and

00:15:34.179 --> 00:15:37.699
afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host.

00:15:37.699 --> 00:15:41.940
You know what he goes and he hears? He hears this dream being told, and they

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:47.220
hear the interpretation when they say, this is none other, in verse number 14,

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:51.299
and his fellow answered and said, this is nothing else save the sword of Gideon,

00:15:51.299 --> 00:15:56.500
the son of Joash, a man of Israel, for into his hand hath God delivered Midian

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:02.540
and all the host. What's God doing? He's preparing Gideon. You know God's

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:10.619
preparing you. God's preparing me, right? He is. He's preparing us for what's to

00:16:10.619 --> 00:16:16.100
come down the road. He's preparing us that we would have faith when we are to

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:20.579
have faith, that we'd exercise that faith, and I believe that for the children of

00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:26.540
Israel during those 25 years of, excuse me, those 40 years of wilderness

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.059
wanderings, that when we come to Leviticus 25 and we see the instruction

00:16:30.059 --> 00:16:35.260
for when you come into the land, this is what you're supposed to do, this is how

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:41.380
you're supposed to deal with the land with regard to sowing and pruning, and

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:47.419
this is my plan for you, but God had been preparing them. Not only had he prepared

00:16:47.419 --> 00:16:54.220
them through the miraculous supply and provision of manna, but we find that

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:58.779
he had worked miraculously through many other areas during that period of

00:16:58.779 --> 00:17:05.699
wilderness wanderings. God's preparing his people. God's, I believe that he's

00:17:05.699 --> 00:17:09.540
regularly preparing his people if we would allow God to work in our lives that

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:13.779
as we, see that's why it's so important to have a daily walk with him. That's why

00:17:13.779 --> 00:17:17.899
it's so vital that every day we're in the Bible and we're, because when the

00:17:17.899 --> 00:17:22.479
crisis comes and we've been neglecting this book and we've been neglecting the

00:17:22.479 --> 00:17:26.619
house of God and we've been neglecting all of those things, our walk with God,

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:32.220
we've become anemic spiritually and that crisis comes, we're not ready for it. And

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:36.339
then all of a sudden it's like, oh I better go get alone with God, I better go

00:17:36.339 --> 00:17:40.299
find out what he has for me, and you start looking at the Bible like this and

00:17:40.299 --> 00:17:43.139
you start flipping here and flipping there and you're going because you're

00:17:43.139 --> 00:17:47.220
trying to find a verse that's going to help you with that particular situation.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:53.899
But if we had that daily consistent walk with God and he's building us up and

00:17:53.899 --> 00:18:00.459
he's preparing us for that which will come at some point in our lives, he's

00:18:00.459 --> 00:18:04.660
preparing us. So then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of the

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:09.540
Lord or the Word of God and we find it as we get into the Word of God that when

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:15.220
that moment of trial comes, that moment of difficulty comes, that moment of

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:20.059
temptation comes, that we have already spent that time in the Word of God and

00:18:20.059 --> 00:18:24.979
we have some level of preparation, oh it does not mean that we are sufficient in

00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:30.540
of ourselves, I'm not seeking to suggest that in any way, but I'm simply saying

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:41.099
that God prepares us. And I can't help as I look at Leviticus 25 to consider how

00:18:41.099 --> 00:18:45.700
that the people of God had been adequately prepared during the

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:51.179
wilderness wanderings to really be obedient in this area of instruction

00:18:51.179 --> 00:18:56.500
that God gives in Leviticus 25 verses 1 through 7. I want you to consider with

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:00.539
me that the very next contextually in Leviticus 25 begins to deal with the

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:05.619
the year of Jubilee, the 50th year and all of the things that would happen and

00:19:05.619 --> 00:19:09.419
all of that and that's not really part of the message this evening so I'm going

00:19:09.419 --> 00:19:13.779
to skip down to verse number 18 as we consider and keep in thought with the

00:19:13.979 --> 00:19:20.260
subject matter before us with regard to the seventh year. We see the plan of God,

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:25.020
we see the preparation of God and we find in verse number 18 the Bible says

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:30.580
this, wherefore ye shall do my statutes and keep my judgments and do them and

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:36.179
ye shall dwell in the land in safety and the land shall yield her fruit and ye

00:19:36.179 --> 00:19:41.219
shall eat your fill and dwell therein in safety. And notice this in verse number

00:19:41.219 --> 00:19:50.700
20, and if you shall say, what shall we eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:56.779
sow nor gather in our increase. Now honestly I believe that as you look at

00:19:56.779 --> 00:20:01.739
verse number 20 God is preemptively answering a question

00:20:01.739 --> 00:20:03.959
that they'd not even asked yet.

00:20:03.959 --> 00:20:06.159
Because God knows everything.

00:20:06.159 --> 00:20:09.139
But I can't help but understand this evening

00:20:09.139 --> 00:20:11.319
that it would be a natural question

00:20:11.319 --> 00:20:13.199
that would arise.

00:20:13.199 --> 00:20:13.919
Right?

00:20:13.919 --> 00:20:15.659
You're not going to sow. You're not going to prune.

00:20:15.659 --> 00:20:17.459
So what am I going to eat?

00:20:17.459 --> 00:20:19.579
Right?

00:20:19.579 --> 00:20:22.319
And we find that as we look at these verses

00:20:22.319 --> 00:20:25.039
in Leviticus 25, verses 18-22,

00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:26.119
if you're taking notes,

00:20:26.119 --> 00:20:29.239
number 3, embrace the promise of God.

00:20:29.239 --> 00:20:31.079
Embrace the promise of God.

00:20:31.079 --> 00:20:33.219
What shall we eat the seventh year?

00:20:33.219 --> 00:20:35.479
Let me ask you this as we consider

00:20:35.479 --> 00:20:38.359
the teachings of Jesus in Matthew 6.

00:20:38.359 --> 00:20:40.659
Is it not adequately revealed to us

00:20:40.659 --> 00:20:44.819
that God knows what our needs are?

00:20:44.819 --> 00:20:46.459
He's the One that designed us.

00:20:46.459 --> 00:20:47.859
He's the One that created us.

00:20:47.859 --> 00:20:50.499
He knows that we need food

00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:54.179
and water, raiment, shelter.

00:20:54.179 --> 00:20:55.979
But what does He finish there

00:20:55.979 --> 00:20:57.899
in Matthew 6?

00:20:57.899 --> 00:21:01.299
Seek ye first the Kingdom of God.

00:21:01.299 --> 00:21:03.419
And all these things shall be added unto thee.

00:21:03.419 --> 00:21:04.219
Right?

00:21:04.219 --> 00:21:05.599
And so we understand here

00:21:05.599 --> 00:21:08.319
that there's a question from a human perspective

00:21:08.319 --> 00:21:10.519
even as we've understood in our lesson

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:13.039
from last week in Exodus 16,

00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:14.159
we have no food.

00:21:14.159 --> 00:21:16.879
God knew that they needed food.

00:21:16.879 --> 00:21:18.259
He created them.

00:21:18.259 --> 00:21:21.419
He made us that way.

00:21:21.419 --> 00:21:24.879
So we find here

00:21:24.879 --> 00:21:27.219
where we looked at and gave our title

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:29.699
for our message this evening in v. 21.

00:21:29.699 --> 00:21:31.139
Embrace the promise of God.

00:21:31.139 --> 00:21:35.379
Notice v. 21.

00:21:35.379 --> 00:21:38.499
Then I will command

00:21:38.499 --> 00:21:42.419
My blessing upon you in the sixth year.

00:21:42.419 --> 00:21:44.819
I want God's blessing.

00:21:44.819 --> 00:21:47.939
Don't you?

00:21:47.939 --> 00:21:51.079
He tells them in v. 18 and 19

00:21:51.079 --> 00:21:52.379
that if you do these things,

00:21:52.379 --> 00:21:55.179
if you do My statutes,

00:21:55.179 --> 00:21:56.179
keep My judgments,

00:21:56.179 --> 00:21:57.259
if you do them,

00:21:57.259 --> 00:21:59.019
you shall dwell in the land in safety.

00:21:59.019 --> 00:22:01.939
The land will yield her fruit.

00:22:01.939 --> 00:22:03.859
You shall eat your fill

00:22:03.859 --> 00:22:07.179
and dwell therein in safety.

00:22:07.179 --> 00:22:09.699
And God then says in v. 21,

00:22:09.699 --> 00:22:14.699
then I will command My blessing upon you.

00:22:14.699 --> 00:22:17.979
I just love the imagery that I see in my mind

00:22:17.979 --> 00:22:19.979
as my sanctified imagination

00:22:19.979 --> 00:22:21.379
as God Almighty,

00:22:21.379 --> 00:22:23.859
the Creator of the universe,

00:22:23.859 --> 00:22:25.099
saying to His people,

00:22:25.099 --> 00:22:30.179
I am going to command My blessing upon you.

00:22:30.179 --> 00:22:33.459
That's pretty awesome.

00:22:33.459 --> 00:22:37.059
Notice what He says.

00:22:37.059 --> 00:22:40.419
He's going to command it in the sixth year.

00:22:40.419 --> 00:22:44.859
And it, the land, shall.

00:22:44.859 --> 00:22:47.619
I like the word shall.

00:22:47.619 --> 00:22:52.379
Bring forth fruit for how long?

00:22:52.419 --> 00:22:55.939
For three years.

00:22:55.939 --> 00:22:58.419
It's not going to be because of your creative

00:22:58.419 --> 00:23:00.059
agricultural abilities.

00:23:00.059 --> 00:23:04.299
No, no, I'm going to command My blessing upon you.

00:23:04.299 --> 00:23:06.339
If you do what I'm telling you to do,

00:23:06.339 --> 00:23:07.659
if you follow the plan

00:23:07.659 --> 00:23:09.299
that I'm giving you to follow,

00:23:09.299 --> 00:23:11.899
again, we've already settled the fact

00:23:11.899 --> 00:23:15.179
that it's not a complicated plan.

00:23:15.179 --> 00:23:19.179
But it is a plan that requires faith.

00:23:19.179 --> 00:23:20.499
Right?

00:23:20.579 --> 00:23:24.939
Just like on day number six with the manna,

00:23:24.939 --> 00:23:28.259
it required faith that it wasn't going to stink

00:23:28.259 --> 00:23:31.259
when you got that double portion in breed worms.

00:23:31.259 --> 00:23:33.179
Just like on day number three,

00:23:33.179 --> 00:23:35.179
or if you just say day number one,

00:23:35.179 --> 00:23:36.419
you see all this manna,

00:23:36.419 --> 00:23:37.579
you didn't have any food.

00:23:37.579 --> 00:23:39.099
You were complaining about food.

00:23:39.099 --> 00:23:40.859
And you understand that Moses said,

00:23:40.859 --> 00:23:42.419
hey, only take a single portion.

00:23:42.419 --> 00:23:45.259
Don't take more than what you need.

00:23:45.259 --> 00:23:47.059
And you're like, I don't know if this stuff's

00:23:47.059 --> 00:23:48.339
going to come back tomorrow,

00:23:48.339 --> 00:23:50.019
so I go ahead and gather as much as I can

00:23:50.019 --> 00:23:51.339
to fit in my basket.

00:23:51.339 --> 00:23:54.539
You know what I mean?

00:23:54.539 --> 00:23:56.899
And then all of a sudden,

00:23:56.899 --> 00:24:00.219
it stinks and it's bred worms.

00:24:00.219 --> 00:24:02.579
It requires faith.

00:24:02.579 --> 00:24:04.379
This plan that God gives with regard

00:24:04.379 --> 00:24:07.819
to the seventh year, it requires faith.

00:24:07.819 --> 00:24:09.539
That God is going to do what He said

00:24:09.539 --> 00:24:10.859
He was going to do.

00:24:10.859 --> 00:24:13.499
By the way, when you really consider

00:24:13.499 --> 00:24:16.059
the introduction to this instruction,

00:24:16.059 --> 00:24:19.220
when God says when

00:24:19.259 --> 00:24:21.539
you come into the land which I give you,

00:24:21.539 --> 00:24:23.660
again, it was God that brought them there.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.660
And this is the plan that you're supposed to follow.

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.299
And here's what I'm going to do.

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:29.699
I'm going to command my blessing upon you,

00:24:29.699 --> 00:24:31.500
and in that sixth year, the land,

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:35.979
it shall bring forth fruit for three years.

00:24:35.979 --> 00:24:39.979
Notice, it says in verse number 22,

00:24:39.979 --> 00:24:43.819
and ye shall sow the eighth year.

00:24:43.819 --> 00:24:45.500
You're not sowing the seventh year, remember?

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.380
That's the plan.

00:24:46.419 --> 00:24:48.579
In verse number four and five,

00:24:48.579 --> 00:24:51.579
we understood that God said this is what

00:24:51.579 --> 00:24:53.739
you're going to do in this seventh year.

00:24:53.739 --> 00:24:55.660
Thou shalt neither sow thy field

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.459
nor prune thy vineyard.

00:24:57.459 --> 00:24:59.459
So here we find in verse 22,

00:24:59.459 --> 00:25:02.059
and ye shall sow the eighth year

00:25:02.059 --> 00:25:05.819
and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year.

00:25:05.819 --> 00:25:07.339
Until her fruits come in,

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:09.979
ye shall eat of the old store.

00:25:09.979 --> 00:25:13.419
So when you sow in that eighth year,

00:25:13.419 --> 00:25:15.179
you will take that harvest

00:25:15.179 --> 00:25:16.819
and eat in that ninth year,

00:25:16.819 --> 00:25:19.779
but because I'm going to bless in that sixth year,

00:25:19.779 --> 00:25:22.179
because I'm going to command

00:25:22.179 --> 00:25:24.779
that my blessing will be upon you

00:25:24.779 --> 00:25:28.259
and that the land shall bring forth fruit for three years,

00:25:28.259 --> 00:25:31.539
then in year six, seven, and eight,

00:25:31.539 --> 00:25:34.299
you're going to have enough.

00:25:34.299 --> 00:25:39.459
Because I'm going to command my blessing upon you.

00:25:39.459 --> 00:25:41.699
Here's the question.

00:25:41.699 --> 00:25:43.619
What would they do?

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.660
Would they believe God?

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.899
Would they exercise faith?

00:25:47.899 --> 00:25:50.500
Unfortunately, the answer is no.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.139
There's absolutely no record

00:25:52.139 --> 00:25:53.419
in the Old Testament account

00:25:53.419 --> 00:25:55.779
that they ever did what God told them to do

00:25:55.779 --> 00:25:58.940
with regard to this Sabbath year.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.220
However, 2 Chronicles 36,

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:06.699
if you want to turn there quickly.

00:26:06.699 --> 00:26:09.019
And just before,

00:26:09.019 --> 00:26:12.819
or just at the end of the text of Scripture

00:26:12.859 --> 00:26:20.500
that records for us the Babylonian captivity of Judah,

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.339
of course, we understand that Jeremiah

00:26:22.339 --> 00:26:24.220
had been prophesying.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.380
You remember much of Jeremiah's prophecy

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.299
with regard to the Babylonian captivity

00:26:28.299 --> 00:26:31.819
and that a remnant would return after 70 years.

00:26:31.819 --> 00:26:35.019
There's significance to that number

00:26:35.019 --> 00:26:37.299
with regard to their violation

00:26:37.299 --> 00:26:40.419
of this instruction that we're studying this evening.

00:26:40.419 --> 00:26:41.979
And you read in verse 21,

00:26:42.019 --> 00:26:42.819
the Bible says,

00:26:42.819 --> 00:26:45.380
"...to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:51.059
until the land had enjoyed her Sabbaths.

00:26:51.059 --> 00:26:53.139
For as long as she lay desolate,

00:26:53.139 --> 00:26:56.019
she kept Sabbath to fulfill

00:26:56.019 --> 00:27:00.859
threescore and ten years."

00:27:00.859 --> 00:27:03.299
So for 490 years, if you do the math,

00:27:03.299 --> 00:27:07.339
there'd have been one year of Sabbath each seven.

00:27:07.339 --> 00:27:09.500
They didn't do it.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.959
They didn't follow the plan.

00:27:11.959 --> 00:27:13.919
Was it a lack of faith?

00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:16.959
Was it just flat-out disobedience?

00:27:16.959 --> 00:27:18.799
I think it's a couple of both.

00:27:18.799 --> 00:27:20.000
Amen?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:20.880
It's a combination.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.759
Not a couple of both,

00:27:21.759 --> 00:27:24.559
it's a combination of both.

00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:26.000
And this evening, when we think about this

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.599
and we think about this simple instruction,

00:27:27.599 --> 00:27:28.839
I understand, listen,

00:27:28.839 --> 00:27:31.119
I am in absolutely no way trying to tell you

00:27:31.119 --> 00:27:33.119
that the text of Leviticus 25

00:27:33.119 --> 00:27:35.279
is to be applied in our lives today

00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:38.079
from a perspective of agriculture.

00:27:38.079 --> 00:27:40.799
I'm showing you a principle that God gives.

00:27:40.839 --> 00:27:43.119
If you just follow His plan,

00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:45.359
He'll bless.

00:27:45.359 --> 00:27:48.440
And He'll always do what He says He will do.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.519
And the reality is that

00:27:50.519 --> 00:27:53.319
the subject matter in which we studied

00:27:53.319 --> 00:27:55.160
last Wednesday evening,

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.479
that as they would weekly, daily,

00:27:57.479 --> 00:28:00.559
as they would collect that manna

00:28:00.559 --> 00:28:02.160
every day that they would go out,

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.720
I understand they didn't stand in awe of it.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.000
I understand every day,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.440
they didn't come out of their tents

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.519
and say, oh, there's manna again.

00:28:09.559 --> 00:28:11.239
Honey, it's here again.

00:28:11.239 --> 00:28:13.679
God did it.

00:28:13.679 --> 00:28:16.959
No, they said we hate this bread.

00:28:16.959 --> 00:28:19.079
Is that not what they said?

00:28:19.079 --> 00:28:22.720
But can you imagine if they had that perspective?

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.440
Can you imagine if every day

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.880
they understood God did it again?

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.559
He rained bread from heaven.

00:28:28.559 --> 00:28:30.359
He gave us this manna.

00:28:30.359 --> 00:28:33.479
He's providing for us.

00:28:33.479 --> 00:28:35.959
We collected a double portion again this week

00:28:35.959 --> 00:28:36.959
on day number six,

00:28:36.959 --> 00:28:40.520
and it didn't spoil.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.399
God was preparing it.

00:28:43.399 --> 00:28:45.959
God prepares us.

00:28:45.959 --> 00:28:48.719
And we see that here in Leviticus 25,

00:28:48.719 --> 00:28:51.760
this truth is given.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.719
And there's just a lack of faith and obedience

00:28:54.719 --> 00:28:57.000
on the part of the nation of Israel

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.039
with regard to these things.

00:28:59.039 --> 00:29:01.320
But can I tell you that God wants to prove Himself

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.559
real in our lives?

00:29:03.559 --> 00:29:08.080
I believe Ephesians 3.20.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.239
I believe that He is able to do exceeding abundantly

00:29:10.239 --> 00:29:12.359
above all that we ask or think.

00:29:12.359 --> 00:29:14.399
Do you believe that this evening?

00:29:14.399 --> 00:29:16.359
He is.

00:29:16.359 --> 00:29:18.279
You know, you think about the truth

00:29:18.279 --> 00:29:21.359
of Philippians chapter number four

00:29:21.359 --> 00:29:24.119
when Paul is commending the believers in Philippi

00:29:24.119 --> 00:29:27.320
for their regular communication with Him.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.320
And if you understand contextually

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.159
what he's dealing with,

00:29:30.159 --> 00:29:33.880
how that they gave to help him financially

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.320
in that ministry in which he was engaged in.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.959
And he says to them with regard

00:29:38.959 --> 00:29:41.080
to his commendation of them,

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.640
he says that he had received these things

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.399
and that it was an odor of a sweet smell,

00:29:45.399 --> 00:29:48.279
a sacrifice acceptable and well-pleasing to God.

00:29:48.279 --> 00:29:49.359
And he then tells them,

00:29:49.359 --> 00:29:51.119
he gives them this wonderful promise

00:29:51.119 --> 00:29:52.479
in verse number 19.

00:29:52.479 --> 00:29:55.119
He says, but my God shall supply all your need

00:29:55.119 --> 00:29:57.679
according to His riches and glory

00:29:57.679 --> 00:29:59.919
by Christ Jesus.

00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:02.479
Is he still able to do that today?

00:30:02.479 --> 00:30:05.659
Absolutely.

00:30:05.659 --> 00:30:07.919
He's God.

00:30:07.919 --> 00:30:09.259
He's on His throne.

00:30:09.259 --> 00:30:11.179
He's able.

00:30:11.179 --> 00:30:16.099
I read it recently.

00:30:16.099 --> 00:30:18.419
It took place many generations ago.

00:30:18.419 --> 00:30:20.499
So it's not a current event story

00:30:20.499 --> 00:30:22.759
from a missionary.

00:30:22.759 --> 00:30:25.859
It's a historical record

00:30:25.859 --> 00:30:28.459
from a missionary.

00:30:28.459 --> 00:30:30.959
And it was such an encouraging

00:30:30.959 --> 00:30:33.899
little truth that I thought it would be appropriate

00:30:33.899 --> 00:30:35.399
to share it with you this evening

00:30:35.399 --> 00:30:37.479
with regard to the subject matter

00:30:37.479 --> 00:30:38.819
which we're dealing with

00:30:38.819 --> 00:30:41.399
of trusting God and believing God.

00:30:41.399 --> 00:30:44.599
That God said, I will command My blessing upon you.

00:30:44.599 --> 00:30:46.219
You do what I'm telling you to do.

00:30:46.219 --> 00:30:49.479
You follow My plan and I'll bless.

00:30:49.479 --> 00:30:51.559
In any case, this missionary is teaching

00:30:51.559 --> 00:30:54.239
and he'd been laboring in the field

00:30:54.239 --> 00:30:56.359
and he'd been teaching the people.

00:30:56.359 --> 00:30:58.239
And he began to teach them

00:30:58.239 --> 00:31:01.639
about the importance of giving.

00:31:01.639 --> 00:31:03.899
And we understand that's a biblical truth.

00:31:03.899 --> 00:31:05.739
We understand the Bible truth

00:31:05.739 --> 00:31:08.359
with regard to giving.

00:31:08.359 --> 00:31:11.599
God loveth a cheerful giver. Amen?

00:31:11.599 --> 00:31:13.299
And we understand those principles

00:31:13.299 --> 00:31:15.119
and those truths that God has given.

00:31:15.119 --> 00:31:17.679
I'm not going to teach a message on that this evening,

00:31:17.679 --> 00:31:19.759
but we understand that.

00:31:19.759 --> 00:31:22.819
To participate in the contribution

00:31:22.819 --> 00:31:25.159
for the work of the Lord.

00:31:25.159 --> 00:31:27.519
And he had been teaching this truth

00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:30.419
to the people that he'd been reaching

00:31:30.419 --> 00:31:32.259
as they'd established a church there

00:31:32.259 --> 00:31:33.419
on that mission field

00:31:33.419 --> 00:31:35.659
and teaching them how they need

00:31:35.659 --> 00:31:38.199
to participate in giving.

00:31:38.199 --> 00:31:40.899
Now, one particular day,

00:31:40.899 --> 00:31:42.599
he was just going around his business

00:31:42.599 --> 00:31:43.959
and he was at his home

00:31:43.959 --> 00:31:46.919
and a little boy from the church

00:31:46.919 --> 00:31:49.279
came to his house.

00:31:49.279 --> 00:31:50.759
A little boy came to the house

00:31:50.759 --> 00:31:53.159
and he said, Pastor,

00:31:53.159 --> 00:31:56.799
I'm bringing my tithe.

00:31:56.799 --> 00:31:58.439
Because of the particulars

00:31:58.439 --> 00:32:00.159
and the area in which they were,

00:32:00.159 --> 00:32:02.839
it wasn't that he was bringing a monetary tithe.

00:32:02.839 --> 00:32:04.939
He was bringing a fish.

00:32:04.939 --> 00:32:06.239
There's some mission fields

00:32:06.239 --> 00:32:07.939
that still have those types of things

00:32:07.939 --> 00:32:10.439
where they'll bring of the grain offering

00:32:10.439 --> 00:32:11.939
and they'll bring those things.

00:32:11.939 --> 00:32:13.779
That's what they have as their tithe.

00:32:13.779 --> 00:32:16.519
I mean, that's what they bring.

00:32:16.519 --> 00:32:20.479
And this young boy brings a fish.

00:32:20.479 --> 00:32:22.119
And he says, Pastor,

00:32:22.119 --> 00:32:24.079
you've been teaching us

00:32:24.079 --> 00:32:26.039
about tithing and about giving

00:32:26.039 --> 00:32:28.439
and about trusting God.

00:32:28.439 --> 00:32:31.519
And here's my offering.

00:32:31.519 --> 00:32:32.679
The pastor was excited.

00:32:32.679 --> 00:32:33.719
He was encouraged.

00:32:33.719 --> 00:32:35.839
This little boy's getting it.

00:32:35.839 --> 00:32:37.459
And he says to the little boy,

00:32:37.459 --> 00:32:39.739
and he's not from America,

00:32:39.739 --> 00:32:41.159
so his name wasn't Johnny,

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:43.239
but he says to the little boy,

00:32:43.239 --> 00:32:45.839
he says, so where are the other nine?

00:32:45.839 --> 00:32:47.479
Because if you brought me one fish

00:32:47.479 --> 00:32:48.439
and it's a tithe,

00:32:48.439 --> 00:32:50.039
then that means you caught ten.

00:32:50.039 --> 00:32:52.279
You understand how that math works.

00:32:52.279 --> 00:32:53.439
He said, oh, Pastor,

00:32:53.439 --> 00:32:54.739
they're still in the river.

00:32:54.739 --> 00:32:59.299
I'm going to catch them.

00:32:59.299 --> 00:33:02.779
That's pretty awesome.

00:33:02.779 --> 00:33:10.459
That missionary pastor sat back and thought,

00:33:10.459 --> 00:33:12.699
he understands a principle

00:33:12.699 --> 00:33:15.299
of believing God.

00:33:15.299 --> 00:33:18.899
And that little boy had full confidence

00:33:18.899 --> 00:33:20.979
that he's going to go back to the river

00:33:20.979 --> 00:33:24.179
and he's going to catch himself nine more fish.

00:33:24.179 --> 00:33:29.499
Because he just believed God.

00:33:29.499 --> 00:33:33.059
And sometimes in our lives,

00:33:33.059 --> 00:33:35.059
we just need to get back to the simple truth

00:33:35.059 --> 00:33:36.899
of just believing God.

00:33:36.899 --> 00:33:38.939
Sometimes we try to get too analytical.

00:33:38.939 --> 00:33:40.179
I'm guilty, right?

00:33:40.179 --> 00:33:42.659
I'm an analytical kind of person.

00:33:42.659 --> 00:33:47.019
We try to make everything make sense.

00:33:47.019 --> 00:33:49.299
But God is God.

00:33:49.299 --> 00:33:51.219
He didn't tell him He was going to make

00:33:51.219 --> 00:33:53.219
the land produced for three years

00:33:53.219 --> 00:33:55.699
bring forth a fruit in the second year.

00:33:55.699 --> 00:33:58.579
He told him in the sixth year.

00:33:58.579 --> 00:34:00.699
And it would last for that time

00:34:00.699 --> 00:34:05.419
because I will command My blessing upon you.

00:34:05.419 --> 00:34:07.379
Then I will command My blessing upon you

00:34:07.379 --> 00:34:08.379
in the sixth year,

00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:10.819
and it shall bring forth fruit

00:34:10.819 --> 00:34:12.979
for three years.

00:34:12.979 --> 00:34:15.939
This evening,

00:34:15.939 --> 00:34:17.819
as we think about the nation of Israel

00:34:17.819 --> 00:34:19.539
and we think about these two lessons,

00:34:19.539 --> 00:34:22.419
and I did not initially intend

00:34:22.419 --> 00:34:23.499
to teach these two lessons

00:34:23.499 --> 00:34:25.699
these past two Wednesday nights,

00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:27.619
but the reality is that

00:34:27.619 --> 00:34:29.059
God was teaching His people

00:34:29.059 --> 00:34:30.139
a very important lesson.

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:32.339
And as we can study the history of it

00:34:32.339 --> 00:34:34.299
and the account that is given,

00:34:34.299 --> 00:34:36.899
we can gain profitable principles

00:34:36.899 --> 00:34:38.979
about how God works

00:34:38.979 --> 00:34:41.659
and how God expects us still today,

00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:44.099
the just shall live by faith, right?

00:34:44.099 --> 00:34:46.059
We're to live by faith.

00:34:46.059 --> 00:34:47.539
We understand Hebrews 11, six,

00:34:47.539 --> 00:34:51.099
without faith, it's impossible to please Him.

00:34:51.099 --> 00:34:53.179
So this evening,

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:55.739
I want God's blessing.

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:58.179
God's given us a plan.

00:34:58.179 --> 00:35:00.779
I believe that He's prepared us.

00:35:00.779 --> 00:35:01.739
He's given us all things

00:35:01.739 --> 00:35:03.219
that pertain unto life and godliness

00:35:03.219 --> 00:35:05.059
is what the Word of God says.

00:35:05.059 --> 00:35:07.179
And so He's prepared us adequately,

00:35:07.179 --> 00:35:09.059
and we just need to believe Him

00:35:09.059 --> 00:35:11.779
to test of faith and obedience.

00:35:11.779 --> 00:35:14.099
This evening, God said to His people,

00:35:14.099 --> 00:35:17.659
I will command My blessing upon you.

00:35:17.659 --> 00:35:19.059
That's encouraging.

00:35:19.059 --> 00:35:19.899
Let's pray together.

00:35:19.939 --> 00:35:21.259
We love You.

00:35:21.259 --> 00:35:22.539
We thank You so much for loving us.

00:35:22.539 --> 00:35:23.499
We thank You for Your Word,

00:35:23.499 --> 00:35:24.619
the truth contained therein.

00:35:24.619 --> 00:35:29.619
We thank You for the opportunity to study it.

00:35:30.499 --> 00:35:33.659
Lord, we are saddened by the disobedience

00:35:33.659 --> 00:35:34.939
of the nation of Israel,

00:35:34.939 --> 00:35:36.779
historically as it's been recorded.

00:35:38.779 --> 00:35:39.979
God, I pray that You'd help us

00:35:39.979 --> 00:35:42.299
to be obedient to the plan

00:35:42.299 --> 00:35:43.939
that You have for our lives.

00:35:44.779 --> 00:35:47.739
Help us to understand that the Gospel still works.

00:35:48.739 --> 00:35:50.659
It never stopped working.

00:35:51.859 --> 00:35:54.859
You said in Your Word that the Gospel

00:35:54.859 --> 00:35:57.019
is the power of God unto salvation.

00:35:57.979 --> 00:35:59.459
You said in Your Word that we're to go

00:35:59.459 --> 00:36:02.139
and preach the Gospel to every creature.

00:36:02.139 --> 00:36:04.259
Help us to just have faith.

00:36:04.259 --> 00:36:06.619
Help us to simply obey

00:36:06.619 --> 00:36:08.339
the instruction that You've given.

00:36:10.659 --> 00:36:12.779
That we would see souls saved,

00:36:12.779 --> 00:36:15.619
lives changed,

00:36:15.619 --> 00:36:16.939
folks discipled.

00:36:18.739 --> 00:36:21.259
Ultimately, that You would be glorified.

00:36:23.259 --> 00:36:24.859
Lord, we pray that You'd bless our time of prayer.

00:36:24.859 --> 00:36:26.979
We thank You for the privilege.

00:36:26.979 --> 00:36:30.099
We thank You for the power and prayer,

00:36:30.099 --> 00:36:31.699
the invitation that You've given us.

00:36:31.699 --> 00:36:33.699
We pray that You'd work mightily.

00:36:33.699 --> 00:36:34.979
And we'll thank You for all that You'll do.

00:36:34.979 --> 00:36:37.539
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
