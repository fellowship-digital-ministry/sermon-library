1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,119
Well, amen, I hope you're enjoying that theme song for the year.

2
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:14,140
And I was just reminded as we're singing it, I appreciate it, but just reminded, even when

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,319
life is hard, you ever experienced those days?

4
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,479
Maybe you say, it's not just days, it's a season.

5
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:24,680
It seems like I'm stuck in a life is hard.

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,540
But even when life is hard, and you say, well, my strength is gone as well, I'm thankful

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,119
for God's grace, and I'm thankful for His enabling, amen.

8
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:42,080
And even in that time with God's help and with God's grace, we will continue.

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:48,639
And I'm thankful that God gives us the strength, the help, the grace that we need in those

10
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:50,119
times.

11
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:54,400
And there are times in our lives, no doubt, that things enter into our life to help us

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,319
be dependent upon Him.

13
00:00:57,319 --> 00:01:04,160
We have this crazy tendency of becoming independent and thinking we can do things on our own.

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,919
And I'm thankful that God gives us the strength that we need.

15
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:14,040
1 Thessalonians 5, 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 this evening, I'll be looking at a familiar

16
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,480
verse of Scripture, looking at verse number 18 this evening.

17
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:23,519
And the Bible says, and everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus

18
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:24,639
concerning you.

19
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:27,239
I've titled the message, and everything give thanks.

20
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,360
And as I think about this verse of Scripture, I would say tonight that most of us are quite

21
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,400
familiar with this verse.

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,400
In fact, many of us could probably quote the verse of Scripture as I read it here and kind

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,040
of quoted it myself and was watching.

24
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,819
Some of you were saying some of the words, and we're familiar with the verse of Scripture.

25
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:51,559
But the reality is that being familiar with the verse or even being able to quote the

26
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:54,680
verse is not really enough.

27
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,360
The Bible is given to us.

28
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,779
I'm thankful that as God has given us the Scripture, that He tells us that it's profitable

29
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:02,879
for us.

30
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,959
But when is it profitable to us?

31
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,039
It is profitable to us when we apply it in our lives.

32
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,160
Not that we just have a head knowledge, that we have a working knowledge, that we can quote

33
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,679
a number of verses of Scripture, but know that we've applied these principles in our

34
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:24,919
lives truly, that we could say, as James says, that we're doers of the Word and not

35
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,720
hearers only.

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,820
I will readily admit to you this evening that the text of Scripture that is before us, this

37
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:37,000
single verse of Scripture, really steps on all of our toes and really kind of gets our

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
attention.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,899
The conviction of the Holy Spirit ought to be evidenced in our life.

40
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:45,639
In fact, I believe it's quite interesting that as we go through these three verses that

41
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:51,000
we've looked at in the last two weeks and then tonight, rejoice evermore, pray without

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,759
ceasing, in everything give thanks for this is the will of God and Christ Jesus concerning

43
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,759
you.

44
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,839
You know what the next one is?

45
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:59,399
Quench not the spirit.

46
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:01,080
You know why I think it's there?

47
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,500
Because we can quench the spirit when we read verse 16, 17, and 18.

48
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,919
And so we'll deal with that next week in its entirety and really looking at verse number

49
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,919
19.

50
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,360
But tonight when we think about this text of Scripture and this admonition, this piece

51
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,559
of instruction that is given to the church at Thessalonica, but then preserved for every

52
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:23,160
church throughout church history.

53
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,199
We've titled the series, the overall series of this Wednesday night Bible study, To Walk

54
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,639
Worthy and Please God.

55
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:36,279
I've said repeatedly that as we look at these concise instructional statements that are

56
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:41,720
given, these principles that are given, we find that in each of them there's action that

57
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,600
is required.

58
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,240
And such is the case again this evening.

59
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,320
We're familiar with this verse, I want you to look at a couple of other passages with

60
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
me this evening.

61
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,520
Go over to Psalm 100, if you will.

62
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,479
The 100th Psalm is a familiar Psalm as well.

63
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,880
Many of us this evening are familiar with this Psalm.

64
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:05,000
In fact, many would be able to quote, if not all of it, much of it.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,440
And we find that in Psalm 100, we find various principles that are so applicable.

66
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,279
But right in the midst of the text, we find a truth that's related to our subject this

67
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,279
evening.

68
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,600
Beginning in verse number 1 of Psalm 100, the psalmist says,

69
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,160
Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands.

70
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,359
Serve the Lord with gladness.

71
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:35,640
Come before his presence with singing.

72
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:41,559
Know ye that the Lord, he is God.

73
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:46,739
It is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves.

74
00:04:46,739 --> 00:04:52,079
We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.

75
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,279
Enter into his gates with what?

76
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:56,440
With thanksgiving.

77
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,079
And into his courts with praise.

78
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:05,920
Be thankful unto him and bless his name.

79
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
Why?

80
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,799
For the Lord is good.

81
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:13,119
The Lord is good.

82
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:15,760
The Lord is good.

83
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:22,760
All the time, no matter the circumstances, the Lord is good.

84
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,559
Amen?

85
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,679
Notice, his mercy is everlasting.

86
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:36,480
You might be dealing with a situation, you might be dealing with a storm, a trial, a

87
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:42,200
moment of being overwhelmed, but God's mercy is everlasting.

88
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,359
And his truth, his truth endureth to all generations.

89
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:49,640
You know, I'm thankful that God's given us his word.

90
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,119
His word is truth.

91
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:56,279
And contained within his word, he reveals so many wonderful things to us.

92
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:59,279
He reveals to us who he is.

93
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:06,000
And really when we understand and we get into the presence of God, again, on Sunday morning,

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,880
our bulletin said, the verse from Psalm 1611, in his presence there is fullness of joy.

95
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,420
And no doubt this evening that as we get into the presence of God and understand who he

96
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:27,779
is and understand how he operates and understand his control over the affairs of man, that

97
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:35,660
we can come to a verse of Scripture like 1 Thessalonians 5.18 and we can obey in everything

98
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,179
give thanks.

99
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:42,619
I want you to understand this evening that this verse of Scripture is not a verse of

100
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:49,140
Scripture, it's not a principle that is going to be obeyed by a lost person.

101
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,859
It's really not a principle that's going to be obeyed by a carnal Christian.

102
00:06:53,859 --> 00:06:57,179
You know the kind of Christian that's going to be able to give thanks and everything?

103
00:06:57,179 --> 00:07:00,459
A Christian that is filled with the Spirit of God.

104
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:04,420
A Christian who is living daily in the presence of God.

105
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:12,100
A Christian that understands who God is and the fact that he is good regardless of your

106
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,420
circumstances or mine.

107
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,059
God is good.

108
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:21,019
And we look at this principle and we look at this passage in Psalm 100 and we see this

109
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:28,100
wonderful psalm of praise but we find, enter into his gates with thanksgiving.

110
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:34,019
You know, the psalmist tells us that God daily loatheth us with benefits.

111
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:36,299
That's a truth, amen?

112
00:07:36,299 --> 00:07:42,459
And we understand that it's been often said and we can be mindful of the fact that we

113
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:46,179
are heaven bound and nothing can change that.

114
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:50,019
Our names, if you're saved by the blood of Christ, your names are written in the Lamb's

115
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:54,500
book of life and heaven is your home and what glory that is.

116
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:00,500
But you know, here on earth, God gives us so many benefits and blessings.

117
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,980
He promises to be with us.

118
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,140
He said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.

119
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:12,260
You know, there are so many promises, hundreds of promises that are contained within God's

120
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,160
Word.

121
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,980
Why did he give us all those promises?

122
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:21,500
Why did he reveal to us all that he did with regard to his character and who he is and

123
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,179
how he operates?

124
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:28,739
Why are the pages of Scripture filled with so many accounts of those that have gone before

125
00:08:28,739 --> 00:08:35,739
us that have enjoyed the presence of God, that have experienced the power of God?

126
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:43,900
So that today we could sit here and we could rejoice and give thanks knowing who God is,

127
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,239
knowing who God is.

128
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:49,020
We find this evening this passage in Psalm 100.

129
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:54,460
Look at Ephesians 5 and then I'm going to get into a couple of thoughts tonight.

130
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:00,380
But in Ephesians chapter 5, really a sister verse, if you will, to what we're looking

131
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,299
at here in 1 Thessalonians 5 verse 18.

132
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:10,780
Look in Ephesians 5, if you will, and I'm going to begin reading in verse 18.

133
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,359
Ephesians 5 and verse 18.

134
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:16,059
Notice the Bible says, and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess.

135
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:19,500
Notice this, but be filled with the Spirit.

136
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,859
Now most of us understand this evening that the moment of salvation you are indwelled

137
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:26,099
with the Spirit of God.

138
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:30,640
But understand with me this evening that that does not mean you are filled with the Spirit

139
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,679
of God at this moment.

140
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:39,119
You can be indwelled with the Spirit of God but not filled with the Spirit of God.

141
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:41,359
They're two distinct things.

142
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:46,159
I am thankful that I'm indwelled, that my body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, that

143
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,520
that is the earnest of our inheritance.

144
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,679
Praise God.

145
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:58,219
At the moment of salvation I got all of the Holy Spirit that I'm ever going to get.

146
00:09:58,219 --> 00:09:59,280
But day by day?

147
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,760
How much of the Holy Spirit does He have of you?

148
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,520
How much of us does He have?

149
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,440
That's being filled with the Spirit,

150
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,720
being controlled by the Spirit.

151
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,520
See, we can be filled with self, can we not?

152
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,600
You think about the message from Sunday morning,

153
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,960
how much of your will influences your prayer life.

154
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,240
We're to pray, thy will be done,

155
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,240
but I have a will and you have a will,

156
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,040
and if we're not careful, it gets all in the way.

157
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,640
And so I can be filled with self,

158
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,480
or we can take the admonition

159
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,680
that's given here in Ephesians 5.18,

160
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,400
that we're to be filled with the Spirit.

161
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,800
Understand that this is present passive imperative.

162
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,720
In other words, it's a continuous command

163
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,360
that's given to us.

164
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,040
It's not something that on one day,

165
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,480
we say, man, I was filled with the Spirit,

166
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,020
and I'm always gonna be filled with the Spirit.

167
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,680
No, because self continues to wanna sit

168
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,460
on the throne of your heart.

169
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:59,020
The old man wants to be in charge.

170
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,980
And so every day, we have to be crucified with Christ.

171
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,940
I die daily.

172
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,060
We have to be filled with the Spirit.

173
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:09,860
Notice, as we notice here in Ephesians 5, verse 18,

174
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,100
says to be filled with the Spirit.

175
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,940
Verse 19 and 20 and 21, I believe, are evidences.

176
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,740
Here's the evidence, the proof, if you will,

177
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,260
that you're filled with the Spirit.

178
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,100
Anyone can say whatever they want.

179
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,900
You read 1 John, and it talks all about saying versus being.

180
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,680
You can say what you want,

181
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,220
but what does the evidence conclude?

182
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,980
Well, here in Ephesians 5, it says,

183
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,980
be filled with the Spirit, and then it says this.

184
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,980
Here's the evidence.

185
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,100
Here's what it looks like if you're filled with the Spirit.

186
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,520
Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns

187
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,720
and spiritual songs.

188
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,820
Singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.

189
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,900
What does it say in verse 20?

190
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,740
Giving thanks always for all things.

191
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:05,460
Unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

192
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,060
Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.

193
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,480
The next verses go on to describe the home

194
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,060
and the roles and what have you,

195
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,220
and no doubt it's imperative

196
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,300
that we're filled with the Spirit

197
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,620
if we're gonna fulfill our duties

198
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,280
and our responsibilities that God has given us,

199
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,340
but we notice in verse 20, again, a cross-reference,

200
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,620
a sister verse, if you will,

201
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,740
with what we're looking at in 1 Thessalonians 5,

202
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,940
that here the Bible says giving thanks always

203
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,620
for all things unto God and the Father

204
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,700
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

205
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,740
So we find that the admonition, the instruction,

206
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,060
as Paul is giving this charge,

207
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,740
again, remember, to a good church, a model church,

208
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,380
a church that was walking with the Lord,

209
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,860
but we find that Paul, he says we beseech you in verse 12,

210
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,580
in verse 14 we exhort you

211
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,340
and all of these instructions are given,

212
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,900
and he says to the church in Thessalonica,

213
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,460
in everything give thanks,

214
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,160
for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.

215
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,340
This evening as we look at this verse of scripture,

216
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,660
I want you to just consider two thoughts tonight.

217
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,180
Number one, notice how we are instructed to behave.

218
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,980
Notice how we are instructed to behave.

219
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,620
We find that as we look at this verse of scripture,

220
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,340
it's already obvious through means

221
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,060
of our introduction this evening,

222
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,220
but we are to be a thankful people.

223
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,220
God's people are to be the most thankful people

224
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,720
on the face of the earth.

225
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,220
I believe that.

226
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,540
I believe that we ought to be a thankful people.

227
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,220
Listen, it is a shame when you read in the Old Testament

228
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,380
of the children of Israel,

229
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,860
that almost every time you turn around,

230
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,180
they're murmuring and they're complaining.

231
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,180
No, we are to be a thankful people.

232
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,740
In everything give thanks.

233
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,580
Why?

234
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,740
Because God has revealed to us who he is,

235
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,940
and we are able to take,

236
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,700
as we're filled with the spirit of God,

237
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,740
this instruction and we're to give thanks.

238
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,620
Give thanks.

239
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,580
Understanding this evening that God is sovereign,

240
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,140
and God has a purpose.

241
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,820
You know, in every circumstance of your life and my life,

242
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,780
God has a purpose.

243
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,260
I believe that tonight.

244
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,100
I believe that God has a purpose.

245
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,260
I don't believe that God is messing with your life

246
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,100
or my life.

247
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,660
I don't think that God,

248
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,540
God is a good God.

249
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,060
God is a loving God.

250
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,380
God is a God who moves with purpose.

251
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,860
In this evening when we understand that he's sovereign

252
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,560
and we understand that he moves with purpose,

253
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,500
then we would understand that in my life

254
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,500
that God has the right to do what he wants to do.

255
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,740
Now that's easier said than done.

256
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,340
Amen?

257
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,540
It's a whole lot easier to say than to do it.

258
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,940
But this evening,

259
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,620
the experiences that you have,

260
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,660
the experiences that I have,

261
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,660
whether you would categorize those experiences

262
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,500
as being good or bad

263
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,500
or whatever heading of those titles you want to use,

264
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,860
I believe this evening that our experiences

265
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,680
lead to opportunities.

266
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,660
If we face life in a biblical way.

267
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,420
See, this evening we look at a text of scripture like this,

268
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,980
when we look at an admonition, a charge,

269
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,060
an instruction to be a thankful people in everything,

270
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,260
give thanks,

271
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,820
that we would understand this evening

272
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,440
that it requires that we have a biblical perspective

273
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,100
and a biblical worldview

274
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,220
that we must see God in his right place,

275
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,340
his rightful place,

276
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,080
high, holy, and lifted up being,

277
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,380
the omnipotent God

278
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,860
who not only creates all things,

279
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,940
he's created all things,

280
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,700
but he sustains all things,

281
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,140
and we find this evening

282
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,620
that as we have experiences in life,

283
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,140
that it leads to opportunities,

284
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,260
I believe ministry opportunities.

285
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,740
I want you to consider with me this evening

286
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,220
that we can minister through the experiences of life,

287
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,100
we can minister to lost people.

288
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,520
We can minister to lost people.

289
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,340
You know, there are times in which God might

290
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,420
allow something in your life and my life

291
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,140
that leads me into direct contact with a lost person

292
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,480
that needs to hear the gospel of Jesus Christ.

293
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,180
I believe that tonight.

294
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,060
I believe this evening that as we go through life,

295
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,940
that you have people that you're praying for.

296
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,260
You have people that are on your prayer list

297
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,860
that are lost family members,

298
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,740
lost relatives,

299
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,700
lost neighbors that you pray for,

300
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,300
and if you pray like I pray,

301
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,140
there are many times that when I pray

302
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,060
for lost family members and lost loved ones,

303
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,700
lost acquaintances, friends,

304
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,040
those on our prayer list,

305
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,140
I pray something like this often.

306
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,180
God, would you bring somebody into their path

307
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,100
that would share the gospel with them?

308
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,740
But I don't always know the means by which God will use

309
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,120
in order to bring somebody in their path.

310
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,620
And I wonder this evening

311
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,960
if we are truly surrendered to the Lord

312
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,880
that we can allow God

313
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,480
to do whatever he sees fit to do in our lives

314
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,360
to bring us into that place where we can minister,

315
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,640
where we can minister to lost people.

316
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,360
They can hear the gospel.

317
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,520
I think about the Apostle Paul, Philippians chapter one.

318
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,160
I referenced it on Sunday,

319
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,820
but in Philippians chapter one in verse number 12,

320
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,500
Paul understood something very important,

321
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,060
but he wanted the believers at Philippi

322
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,040
to also understand this truth, this principle.

323
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,880
Why?

324
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,760
Because it should mold and shape their lives as well.

325
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,760
It was great for Paul to understand this,

326
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,440
but he wanted the believers in Philippi

327
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,280
to understand this.

328
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,120
Why?

329
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,680
Because they too would have things

330
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,120
that would happen in their life.

331
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,160
And so Paul says,

332
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,780
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

333
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,480
in verse 12 of Philippians one,

334
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,480
but I would, ye should understand brethren,

335
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,540
that the things which happened unto me

336
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:12,540
have fallen out rather under the furtherance of the gospel.

337
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,140
If that was true in Paul's life,

338
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,860
I would say tonight it could be true in any of our lives.

339
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,520
That the things that happened to me,

340
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,120
by the way, if you're keeping track

341
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,620
and having a categorized list

342
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,420
of whether things are good or bad,

343
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,460
a lot of the things that happened to Paul

344
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,020
would find themselves on a list called bad.

345
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,460
Amen?

346
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,020
But Paul says those things that happened unto me,

347
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,540
well those things,

348
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,060
they have fallen out rather

349
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:47,220
under the furtherance of the gospel.

350
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,600
And so how is it that Paul,

351
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,760
in that circumstance,

352
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,860
we are instructed to behave that in everything,

353
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,980
we are to give thanks.

354
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,940
Why?

355
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,060
Because we understand that God is sovereign,

356
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,380
that God has a purpose,

357
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,300
and though we look at this event,

358
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,340
this circumstance,

359
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,060
this experience that we have,

360
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,780
that God might be leading me into a place

361
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,380
where I can have an encounter,

362
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,460
a divine appointment,

363
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,780
to better share the gospel with a lost person.

364
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,540
I remember reading a missionary letter,

365
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,620
it was probably within the first couple of months

366
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,140
of being here as the pastor,

367
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,860
and I don't even remember who the missionary was

368
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,060
at this point,

369
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,140
but the missionary was in a place

370
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,500
where they were far from really civilization,

371
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,340
if you will,

372
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,660
with regard to the conveniences of modern technology

373
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,100
and sort resources,

374
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,180
and they couldn't just run down to Home Depot

375
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,940
and get a new appliance and that sort of thing,

376
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,300
and they were dealing with a problem

377
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,580
with a washing machine,

378
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,580
and there were just no one there

379
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,620
within the region where they were,

380
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,780
no technicians,

381
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,620
there's no place to just replace it,

382
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,580
so they had to wait an extended period of time

383
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,180
to have someone come

384
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,820
in order to be able to handle it.

385
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,320
and to deal with this problem.

386
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,520
When the technician finally arrived,

387
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,320
the missionary, thankfully the missionary,

388
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,320
not only told him about the issue with the appliance

389
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,820
that they were dealing with and sought to get that resolved,

390
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,820
but the missionary took the opportunity to share the gospel.

391
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,520
And through a period of conversation

392
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,820
and I think a follow-up visit

393
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,820
where they had to come back with some parts to be able to fix it,

394
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,820
the missionary found out that this technician that came

395
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,320
had a saved mother that had been praying for over 20 years

396
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,820
that he'd get saved.

397
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,820
So when I look at that account and I read that letter,

398
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,820
I kind of took this and here's how I concluded it.

399
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:49,820
So God allowed for someone's washing machine to break

400
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,820
so that a technician would come

401
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,820
not just to fix a washing machine,

402
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,320
but to hear the gospel, to hear the gospel.

403
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,320
See, if you're like me, I don't like it when things break.

404
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,320
That's just not naturally how we think.

405
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,820
But we're not to think naturally.

406
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,320
We're to think spiritually, supernaturally.

407
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,320
We're to understand that God is a God that moves with purpose.

408
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,320
And we're to understand that, listen,

409
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,320
if the children of Israel could wander through the wilderness

410
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,820
for all those years and their shoes didn't wear out and all that,

411
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,820
God could take care of it, amen?

412
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,820
God can let your washing machine last until you don't last, amen?

413
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,820
I mean, that's just what He could do.

414
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,820
But there are times in which God will allow.

415
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,820
You say, this is a brand new, it shouldn't.

416
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,820
Hold on a minute. What is God doing?

417
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,820
How is God working?

418
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,820
And we can be thankful in those times.

419
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,820
Why? Because God has a purpose.

420
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,320
God has a plan.

421
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,320
It might not be that you lead the technician or the whoever, the doctor.

422
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,320
There's a man that came here several years ago to do an inspection.

423
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,320
Never came to our church one time as an attender for a service.

424
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,320
He came here to do an inspection.

425
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:19,320
And I'll abbreviate the story significantly to just get to the point and move on.

426
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,320
But he had, several years prior to the time that he came here for an inspection,

427
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,820
his brother-in-law inadvertently caught him on fire.

428
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,820
The man was covered with second and third degree burns.

429
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,820
It was absolutely brutal.

430
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,820
He ended up being careflighted, burn center, the whole nine yards, skin graft.

431
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,820
I mean, you name it, he dealt with it.

432
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,820
ICU, I mean, the whole deal.

433
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,820
He said it was the worst pain he ever had.

434
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,820
He stood, Bart, we were three feet from where you're sitting.

435
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,320
And we stood right there.

436
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,320
Ms. Jennifer, almost right where you are, actually.

437
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,320
We just stood right there.

438
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,320
And here's what he said to me.

439
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
He said, you know, through that process,

440
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,320
I got to see one doctor trust Christ as their Savior and two nurses got saved.

441
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,320
It was the worst physical experience I've ever had in my life.

442
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:15,320
I would do it again tomorrow if it meant that I could share the gospel with people and they'd get saved.

443
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
That's amazing.

444
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,820
We can, listen, in everything give thanks.

445
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,820
Why? Because God has a purpose.

446
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,820
God moves with purpose.

447
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,820
Sometimes it may be.

448
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,820
I had an experience where I didn't have one flat tire, I had two.

449
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,820
Isn't that exciting?

450
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,820
How many spare tires do you have?

451
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,820
Well, most have one.

452
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,820
I don't have two.

453
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,820
I had two flat tires at the same time.

454
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,820
That was a situation, right?

455
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,820
And I end up at a place getting them fixed.

456
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,320
I end up being able to share the gospel for an extensive period of time with the,

457
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,320
not the technician that was working on it,

458
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,320
but the person that was at the desk, working the cashier, if you will.

459
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,320
I didn't get saved that night, but they heard the gospel.

460
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:08,320
Not only can these experiences lead to opportunities of ministering toward lost people,

461
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
but I think also of saved people.

462
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,320
2 Corinthians chapter number 1 gives us some great truth

463
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,320
with regard to the God of all comfort and how he works.

464
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:21,820
In 2 Corinthians chapter 1, the Bible says this in verse number 3.

465
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,820
Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

466
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,820
the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort.

467
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,820
Do you believe that this evening?

468
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,820
He is the God of all comfort.

469
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,820
The Holy Spirit, one of the names that's ascribed to him is Comforter.

470
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,820
You're dealing with a difficulty.

471
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,820
He is the Comforter.

472
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,820
He is the God of all comfort.

473
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,320
But notice what it says in verse number 4.

474
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,320
God might allow you to go through an experience today in your life,

475
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,320
and it may not be for a number of years

476
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,820
that you understand why God was allowing you to go through that experience

477
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,820
and how God comforted you in that situation,

478
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,820
and then God would use you to be able to help someone else.

479
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,820
It's amazing how God works.

480
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,820
But it requires that we maintain a proper perspective.

481
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,820
It requires that we're filled with the Spirit of God,

482
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,820
that we're walking in the Spirit,

483
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,820
and God will enable us,

484
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,820
and we see in this text of Scripture,

485
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,820
we notice how we are instructed to behave,

486
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,320
but I want you to see not only how we're instructed to behave,

487
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,320
number two, I want you to notice what we are informed of.

488
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,320
Notice what God informs us of in this verse of Scripture.

489
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
He says, in everything give thanks,

490
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,320
but then he informs us of something.

491
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,320
He instructs us in the first part of the verse,

492
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,320
but then he informs us in the latter part of the verse,

493
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,320
and here's what he informs us of.

494
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:07,320
This is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.

495
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,320
Now that's pretty powerful.

496
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:16,820
God specifically says, this is the will of God.

497
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,820
It is imperative that we do the will of God.

498
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,820
It is pleasing to God when we do the will of God.

499
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,820
Amen?

500
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,820
I mean, that seems to be obvious,

501
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,820
not even needing to be stated,

502
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,820
but we understand this evening that this is the will of God,

503
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,820
and God informs us.

504
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,820
He says, in everything give thanks.

505
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,320
It would have been sufficient if that's where he ended,

506
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:46,320
but he lets us know that this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.

507
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
It is God's will for you and for me,

508
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,320
for all of his children, to be thankful.

509
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,320
You know, there are times in which we understand

510
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,320
we've lived life long enough, all of us here this evening,

511
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,320
we've lived life long enough to know that there are times,

512
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,320
there are circumstances that we have faced,

513
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:10,320
that we will face, where it's easier to be thankful than at other times.

514
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:16,320
There are some times in which it's not easy.

515
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,320
Does it change the will of God? No.

516
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,320
It doesn't change the will of God, because God still has a purpose.

517
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
God still has a plan.

518
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,320
And this evening, as I think about this portion of Scripture,

519
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,320
this concise piece of instruction that we're also informed of,

520
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,320
this being the will of God,

521
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,320
we must understand this evening that the Holy Spirit of God

522
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:43,320
is working within us to enable us to do the will of God.

523
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:49,320
I cannot, you cannot, in our own flesh, in everything, give thanks.

524
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,320
I guarantee you, in your flesh, you will fail.

525
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,320
It's just going to happen.

526
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,320
We are much more prone to complain and murmur than we are to give thanks.

527
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,320
But we understand this wonderful principle in God's Word

528
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,320
that the Holy Spirit of God, God, is working within us

529
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,320
so that we can do the will of God.

530
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,320
Turn to the book of Philippians, if you will.

531
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,320
And I'm going to close here with this portion of Scripture this evening.

532
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,320
And it's very interesting. God brought this to my mind, actually, this afternoon.

533
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,320
I wasn't planning to go to Philippians 2 as I was preparing this message,

534
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,320
but God brought this to my mind this afternoon.

535
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,320
And it's interesting because within the text of Scripture,

536
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,320
it doesn't specifically say anything about giving thanks.

537
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,320
It does, however, say that we're not to murmur.

538
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,320
So it's quite interesting. I want you to look at it with me in verse 14.

539
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,320
Notice what the Bible says in Philippians 2, in verse 14.

540
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,320
Do all things...

541
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,320
How many things?

542
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,320
All things. How many things are we to give thanks for?

543
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Right? In everything, give thanks.

544
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,320
Giving thanks always for all things, Ephesians 5.20.

545
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,320
And so now we see in Philippians 2.14,

546
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:14,320
do all things without murmurings and disputings.

547
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
You say, Pastor, this is a hard lesson.

548
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
I understand.

549
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,320
In our flesh, it is hard.

550
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,320
Notice what it says in verse 15.

551
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,320
That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke.

552
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,320
Notice, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation,

553
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:41,320
among whom ye shine as lights in the world.

554
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,320
You know, God told us that we're to let our light shine.

555
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,320
I know that there's advancements in technology.

556
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,320
There was a time, and they still use them in various places,

557
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,320
but there was a time in which lighthouses were absolutely critical.

558
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,160
Now there's navigation assistance that goes beyond.

559
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,400
In fact, several of the lighthouses

560
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,580
within those that maybe you've visited,

561
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,100
they're not even necessary for operational.

562
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,980
They're just nice landmarks to be able to go and visit

563
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,060
and what have you.

564
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,340
Some still operate and are still needed.

565
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,340
But we understand this evening that if we can think back

566
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:22,140
to the time of that light and how important that light was

567
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,320
and how necessary it was that the lens not get dirty.

568
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,540
Because when the lens gets dirty,

569
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,680
the light can't shine like it needs to, right?

570
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,520
We understand that.

571
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,120
And this evening, as we look at this,

572
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,160
it says that we are in the midst

573
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,880
of a crooked and perverse nation,

574
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,400
but we are to shine as lights in the world.

575
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,520
You know, when we do all things with thanksgiving,

576
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,760
when we do all things without murmurings and disputings,

577
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,740
it keeps our lens clean.

578
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,380
Does that make sense tonight?

579
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,700
See, because all of a sudden, if we're to be lights

580
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,180
and we're supposed to be shining,

581
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,020
but we're murmuring and complaining

582
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,980
and therefore we're not giving thanks

583
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,660
and we're acting just like the lost person acts

584
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,960
when they get the bad news,

585
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,860
when they deal with the adversity

586
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,940
and we're behaving in like fashion,

587
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,500
guess what's happening to our light?

588
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,400
It's dim.

589
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,340
It's dim.

590
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,700
It's not shining like it should.

591
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,220
But I purposefully began in verse 14

592
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,380
so that we could circle back to verse 13.

593
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,180
Because here's what God tells us in verse number 13,

594
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,960
the key that would enable you and I

595
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,360
to do all things without murmurings and disputings,

596
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,140
thus I believe akin to in everything give thanks,

597
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,540
notice in verse 13,

598
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:44,540
for it is God which worketh in you

599
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:49,660
both to will and to do of his good pleasure.

600
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:54,660
When we look at a principle like this one tonight,

601
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,660
in everything give thanks,

602
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,020
you can't just try harder

603
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,980
to implement this principle in your life.

604
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:11,020
You can't decide I'm gonna turn a page

605
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,540
and I'm going to stop complaining,

606
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:18,140
I'm gonna, no, no, no, it's not in your own ability.

607
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:23,980
You must allow God to work in and through you.

608
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,140
You must come to the place where you're surrendered

609
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,420
and yielded and say, God, this,

610
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,100
I'm bought with a price, I'm yours, Lord,

611
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,860
and whatever you see fit, I'm going to give thanks,

612
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,860
I'm not gonna murmur and I'm not gonna complain,

613
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,140
I'm going to shine brightly.

614
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,980
Why?

615
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,540
Because you're working in and through me,

616
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,580
not because I'm some great person,

617
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,900
no, because I serve a great God

618
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:56,260
and God can work in you and through you

619
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,900
and we have the promise here in this text of scripture

620
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,460
for it is God which worketh in you

621
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:07,020
both to will and to do of his good pleasure

622
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,700
and then it says do all things

623
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,340
without murmurings and disputings.

624
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:13,220
When we look there in Ephesians five,

625
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,460
before he says in verse 20

626
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,620
that we're to give thanks for all things,

627
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,660
giving thanks always for all things,

628
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:24,380
he says be filled with the spirit in verse 18.

629
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,020
And this evening, it's not a matter,

630
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,580
you know, sometimes we live life

631
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,980
and we get so influenced by the world's philosophies.

632
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,380
The world's philosophies, just try harder,

633
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,380
just do better, just lift your,

634
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:42,180
no, it's surrender and yield and let God work through you

635
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:47,780
and allow the scripture to control

636
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,420
how you think and how you behave.

637
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,140
Because it's only as I spend time with God,

638
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,180
it's only when I get in this book

639
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,900
that I yield myself, that I surrender myself,

640
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,660
that truly in everything I will be able to give thanks.

641
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,500
This is not an easy piece of instruction

642
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,940
but as we look at the scriptures,

643
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,460
we find that God enables us.

644
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,700
God has never instructed us to do something

645
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,660
that he won't also enable us to do.

646
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:25,779
And for that, we ought to be thankful for his enabling.

647
00:34:25,779 --> 00:34:28,179
And we come to a text of scripture like this tonight

648
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:31,740
and say, you know, tonight, truly as an individual,

649
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,220
truly collectively, corporately as a church,

650
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,779
we want to walk worthy and please God

651
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,619
in everything, give thanks.

652
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:45,619
For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.

653
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:49,940
God gives us an instruction, but then he informs us,

654
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:54,339
this is my will for you, this is what pleases me

655
00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:56,980
and I will enable you to do it.

656
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:01,420
This evening, I hope you see God in his rightful place.

657
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:04,540
I hope you understand that he is a sovereign God,

658
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,899
that he has a purpose and a plan.

659
00:35:07,779 --> 00:35:10,619
And that he'll take your experiences in mind

660
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:13,619
and it doesn't matter how you try to categorize them

661
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,100
when we just simply understand God is in control

662
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,059
and God has a purpose.

663
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:21,220
We say, God, through this circumstance,

664
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:25,260
through this situation, would you allow me to be used of thee

665
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,020
and so often, I'm guilty.

666
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:33,140
So often, we can be so busy murmuring and complaining

667
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:38,140
and griping that we miss the very divine appointments

668
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:42,980
that God has right in front of us.

669
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,820
Why?

670
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,179
Because we're not giving thanks,

671
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:47,179
we're complaining and we're murmuring.

672
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:51,660
So this evening, it's a verse that many of us could quote

673
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,779
we're familiar with, but that's just simply not enough.

674
00:35:54,779 --> 00:35:58,059
We must be doers of the word and not hearers only.

675
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:01,059
Father, we love you, we thank you for loving us,

676
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:05,899
we thank you for your word, the truth contained therein.

677
00:36:05,899 --> 00:36:07,740
God, I pray that you would help us,

678
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,460
Lord, help us to understand tonight

679
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,339
that it's not just I have to do better at this,

680
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:15,779
no, I must be controlled by the spirit of God,

681
00:36:15,779 --> 00:36:19,260
I must allow you to work in and through me,

682
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,980
I must be crucified with Christ.

683
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:29,500
That's the pathway to being able to give thanks always.

684
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,020
Lord, I pray that you'd bless our time

685
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,940
that through the time of corporate prayer,

686
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,940
Lord, that our hearts would be knit together,

687
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,179
that you'd be glorified,

688
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:40,980
that, Lord, we'd see you work in a distinct way.

689
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,500
We'll thank you for it in Christ's name we pray, amen.
