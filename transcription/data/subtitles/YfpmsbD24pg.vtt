00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.719
The other Sunday school classes that are now becoming Wednesday evening classes will resume

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:08.279
next week.

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:13.479
And at that same time, I plan to return to what we were studying in our adult Sunday

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:16.719
school class back in March, and that's the book of Titus.

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:19.459
And so I plan to return to Titus chapter number two.

00:00:19.459 --> 00:00:23.040
That's where we left off dealing with the subject matter of sound doctrine.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.340
And we'll be looking at that for a number of weeks.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.700
And so that will begin, or I should say resume next Wednesday evening, tonight, Mark chapter

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.979
number nine.

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:36.299
It's a passage of scripture that really the first portion of Mark chapter nine begins

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:38.880
with the record of the Mount of Transfiguration.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.220
What an amazing event that this is, that God records for us in the gospels.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.740
And we know that Peter, James, and John had the opportunity to follow the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.860
the Bible says, into a high mountain apart by themselves.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.020
And it was there that he, the Lord Jesus Christ, was transfigured before them.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:05.379
What an impact this must have had upon the disciples, Peter, James, and John, the experience

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.059
that this must have been for them.

00:01:07.059 --> 00:01:12.139
We know that Peter would later discuss this very event when he's speaking about the fact

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:15.379
that we have a more sure word of prophecy.

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:20.540
But what he references prior to giving us that truth is that when he heard the voice

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.059
of God, that Mount of Transfiguration, and how powerful that must have been, how impactful

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:28.580
that must have been.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.419
As you go through the passage of scripture, you find in verses 14 through 16 that they,

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:37.500
Jesus, and Peter, James, and John, they come down off of the mountain.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.260
They're having some discussion.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.459
They ask Jesus about Elijah first coming and so on and so forth.

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:51.220
And as they return, the Bible tells us in verses 14 through 16 that they now have this

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.260
great multitude has gathered together.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.739
The scribes were there, the disciples were there, and the Bible tells us that the scribes

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:05.819
were questioning, really, the idea, as we look at the passages, they were disputing

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.459
with the disciples.

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.860
And that kind of leads us into the passage that we're going to study this evening.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.300
We're going to be looking at verses 17 through 29, and I want to let you look at a phrase

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.300
here in verse number 28.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.380
I'll give you the title, and then we'll go through the message this evening.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.660
In verse number 28, the Bible says this, and when he was come into the house, this is speaking

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.259
of Jesus, and it says here that his disciples asked him privately.

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:39.940
Look at the question at the end of verse number 28, why could not we cast him out?

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.259
I've titled the message this evening, why couldn't we cast him out?

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:49.179
Why couldn't we cast him out?

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:53.419
I believe that as we examine this passage of Scripture, that we have the opportunity

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:56.300
to learn valuable lessons that we can implement in our lives.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.179
In fact, we understand that truth with regard to any time we approach the Word of God, any

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:03.020
time we open the Scriptures.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.220
I mentioned on Sunday how that we have that attitude of, Lord, speak to me.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.139
We speak about Abraham and how that there in Genesis 13, and of course, on a number

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:15.020
of occasions, the Bible says that the Lord spoke or spake unto Abram.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.779
Well, God wants to speak to us as we open his Word, and what a privilege and what a

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:26.619
blessing it is to hear the voice of God through the Word of God, and we come with that expectation

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.860
anticipating, Lord, what do you have for me?

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.220
And so as we look at the passage of Scripture, I want you to notice with me, first of all,

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.119
if you're taking notes, the inability of the disciples.

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:41.520
In verses 17 and 18, look at the passage that says here that Jesus comes and He says

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.639
in verse number 16, what question you with them?

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:50.679
And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son which

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:58.279
hath a dumb spirit, and wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him, and he foameth and gnasheth

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:05.559
with his teeth and pineth away, and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:10.600
out, and they could not.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.559
We see the inability of the disciples here in these first couple of verses of the text

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:17.019
in which we're studying this evening.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:23.040
We find the father of this son brings his son to the disciples, and why does he bring

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.260
his son to the disciples of Jesus?

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.239
He has every expectation that the disciples are able to do something about the situation.

00:04:30.239 --> 00:04:35.040
He brings his son to the disciples expecting that they're going to do something, that they're

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.279
going to be able to assist, that this, his son has this spirit that the Bible says here

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:43.859
that as he goes through here, he says he hath a dumb spirit.

00:04:43.859 --> 00:04:48.200
We understand that as we get through the passage of Scripture how the Lord will work, but you

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.239
see here the inability of the disciples.

00:04:52.239 --> 00:04:56.739
However, as we look at the inability of the disciples, it's important that we go back

00:04:56.739 --> 00:04:57.739
a few chapters.

00:04:57.739 --> 00:05:01.279
Turn back, keep your place here in Mark 9, but go back to Mark chapter number 6 if you

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:02.279
will.

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:08.079
In Mark chapter number 6, the Lord gives us some interesting insight as to the work of

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:11.000
his servants, the work of his disciples.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.200
In verse number 7, notice what the Bible says, and he, Jesus, called unto him the twelve.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.799
Who are the twelve?

00:05:19.799 --> 00:05:20.799
The disciples, right?

00:05:20.799 --> 00:05:25.359
We often refer to them as the disciples, and so we find over here in Mark chapter number

00:05:25.359 --> 00:05:31.920
9, it's these disciples that this man has brought his son to, and they were unable,

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.760
the Bible tells us that they could not, the inability of the disciples.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.760
But here in Mark 6 and verse number 7, that Jesus called the twelve, and he began to send

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.959
them forth by two and two.

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:48.559
Notice what the Bible says at the end of verse number 7, and gave them power over unclean

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:51.700
spirits.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.440
Verse number 8, and commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.200
a staff only, no strip, no bread, no money in their purse, but be shod with sandals and

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.799
not put on two coats.

00:06:00.799 --> 00:06:05.760
Sit down and look at verse number 13, the Bible says, and they, who's they?

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.760
The disciples, right?

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.040
We follow along, we see what's happening, and they, the disciples, they cast out many

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:18.119
devils and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them.

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:24.320
But now all of a sudden, we find in Mark chapter number 9, that this man brings his son to

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.320
the disciples of Jesus, expecting that they're going to be able to do something, and the

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:36.440
Bible tells us that I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out, and they could

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.320
not.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.679
The inability of the disciples.

00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:45.480
As I think about this passage of Scripture, and I find what Jesus will say in verse number

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.119
19, when he says, oh, faithless generation.

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:51.440
You understand that he's speaking to his disciples there.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.279
He's not speaking to this man, for the man has great faith.

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:59.959
He's speaking to the disciples, and he uses the phrase faithless, and so as I begin to

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:04.720
look at the inability of the disciples, I think the first lesson that we can learn from

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:10.959
this passage of Scripture is that we need to stop thinking that we can do anything apart

00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:14.160
from the help of God.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.320
Sometimes what happens, see there's a danger that in Mark chapter number 6, they went out

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:24.200
and God gave them power, and they cast out some devils.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.880
And then all of a sudden, they think they can do it in of themselves, without relying

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.000
upon the Lord.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.320
Listen, we've all been there.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.640
If you've raised children, if you are raising children, you've taught your children how

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.320
to do something, and then they say, I can do it.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:46.559
Joseph used to say all of the time as a toddler, he would say, I can do it.

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:51.559
He would say it like that, and he would, man, he wanted to do it, he wanted to try it, and

00:07:51.559 --> 00:07:56.040
you knew as a parent, he wasn't ready, he couldn't do it.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.239
And you helped him do it that first time, and that second time, and then what?

00:08:00.239 --> 00:08:03.160
He wants to, I got it, I'm good.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.160
And then what happens?

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.519
They fail.

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:06.519
Why?

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:09.640
Because you were there helping them.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.880
You were there steadying their hand, or holding that bike, or whatever it was, right?

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:20.279
Now eventually, they may be able to, the analogy falls apart obviously at some point, but I

00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:25.480
want you to understand this evening that there is a danger in the lives of God's people,

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:31.559
in the lives of us as His followers, to think that we can do the work of God without the

00:08:31.559 --> 00:08:33.719
help of God.

00:08:33.719 --> 00:08:36.320
We must be mindful of John 15.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:43.840
When Jesus said to the disciples, I am the vine, ye are the branches, without Me, ye

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.559
can do nothing.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.520
Sometimes we think, well, there's some things we can do.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.239
I want to see what God can do through us.

00:08:57.239 --> 00:09:01.599
And we find that we must work and serve in agreement with God, and we've got to come

00:09:01.599 --> 00:09:06.840
to the place where we stop thinking that we can do anything apart from the help of God.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.719
We see here the inability of the disciples.

00:09:09.719 --> 00:09:13.520
I want you to notice as we continue through the passage, number two, the interaction that's

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.520
recorded.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.440
The Bible begins to give us this interaction, and we find that, first of all, if I were

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:26.280
to take three parts of this interaction really that's captured for us between verses 19-27,

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.400
and really we could include verses 17 and 18 in there as well, I want you to notice

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.599
first of all the disappointed Savior.

00:09:32.599 --> 00:09:34.440
Why do I say the disappointed Savior?

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.359
Notice what He says in verse number 19.

00:09:36.359 --> 00:09:42.000
He answereth him and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you?

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.159
How long shall I suffer you?

00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:45.960
Bring him unto me.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:52.359
I believe that as Jesus is speaking here in verse number 19 that He's really disappointed

00:09:52.359 --> 00:09:56.039
not with this man, but He's disappointed with the disciples.

00:09:56.039 --> 00:10:00.039
I want you to think about how many times the Lord had been teaching the disciples.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:02.679
and how He had demonstrated His power

00:10:02.679 --> 00:10:05.659
over and over in the lives of the disciples.

00:10:05.659 --> 00:10:08.439
And He says, how is it that you do not remember?

00:10:08.439 --> 00:10:11.319
How is it that you have no faith?

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:12.719
And, oh ye of little faith.

00:10:12.719 --> 00:10:14.619
He uses those phraseologies

00:10:14.619 --> 00:10:17.659
with the disciples on a number of occasions

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:18.879
throughout the Scriptures.

00:10:18.879 --> 00:10:20.119
Why?

00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:21.399
He's trying to teach them.

00:10:21.399 --> 00:10:22.779
He's trying to prepare them.

00:10:22.779 --> 00:10:24.659
He is investing in them,

00:10:24.659 --> 00:10:27.179
understanding that they are going to be

00:10:27.179 --> 00:10:29.639
the leaders of the church in the first century,

00:10:29.659 --> 00:10:32.019
and He's preparing them for such a work.

00:10:32.019 --> 00:10:35.419
And we find here that He's continuously instructing them,

00:10:35.419 --> 00:10:36.979
and yet there are times,

00:10:36.979 --> 00:10:39.579
just like there are times in our lives,

00:10:39.579 --> 00:10:42.499
where we kind of go backwards, if you will.

00:10:42.499 --> 00:10:44.639
We kind of forget some of the lessons

00:10:44.639 --> 00:10:45.539
that we've been taught.

00:10:45.539 --> 00:10:48.139
We forget to follow the instructions

00:10:48.139 --> 00:10:49.539
that we have been given.

00:10:49.539 --> 00:10:53.379
And so we see that the Lord here responds,

00:10:53.379 --> 00:10:55.919
and then notice the distraught father.

00:10:55.919 --> 00:10:57.979
We read in verses 17 and 18

00:10:57.979 --> 00:11:00.519
how as there was this group that was there,

00:11:00.519 --> 00:11:02.599
the Bible tells us in v. 14

00:11:02.599 --> 00:11:04.919
that there was a great multitude about them

00:11:04.919 --> 00:11:06.699
that the scribes were questioning,

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:07.839
disputing with them.

00:11:07.839 --> 00:11:09.439
And you find that the Bible tells us

00:11:09.439 --> 00:11:11.999
in v. 17 that one of the multitude

00:11:11.999 --> 00:11:12.979
answered and said,

00:11:12.979 --> 00:11:15.719
Master, I have brought unto Thee My Son

00:11:15.719 --> 00:11:16.919
which hath a dumb spirit.

00:11:16.919 --> 00:11:19.559
You see the intensity

00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:22.159
and the seriousness of this man

00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:24.399
on wanting to have some type of help

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:25.439
for his son.

00:11:25.439 --> 00:11:27.739
He is distraught with the circumstances

00:11:27.739 --> 00:11:28.799
that he's living with,

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:29.879
that he's dealing with.

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:31.399
It says in v. 20,

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.879
and they brought him unto Him,

00:11:33.879 --> 00:11:35.959
that's this son that's possessed,

00:11:35.959 --> 00:11:37.319
they bring to Jesus.

00:11:37.319 --> 00:11:39.599
And when He, Jesus, saw him straightway,

00:11:39.599 --> 00:11:41.079
the spirit tear Him,

00:11:41.079 --> 00:11:42.739
and He fell on the ground

00:11:42.739 --> 00:11:45.719
and wallowed foaming.

00:11:45.719 --> 00:11:47.779
What a sight.

00:11:47.779 --> 00:11:50.319
Can you as not only a father,

00:11:50.319 --> 00:11:52.439
but just as an individual this evening,

00:11:52.439 --> 00:11:54.559
can you imagine the heartache

00:11:54.559 --> 00:11:56.559
that this father must have experienced

00:11:56.579 --> 00:11:58.019
knowing that his son

00:11:58.019 --> 00:11:59.819
was dealing with this situation.

00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:01.139
And as we go through the passage,

00:12:01.139 --> 00:12:03.339
we find that this was not just something

00:12:03.339 --> 00:12:04.819
that happened yesterday.

00:12:04.819 --> 00:12:05.659
Look at the Bible.

00:12:05.659 --> 00:12:08.499
It tells us here that Jesus asked His Father,

00:12:08.499 --> 00:12:13.179
how long is it ago since this came unto Him?

00:12:13.179 --> 00:12:16.379
And the dad said, of a child.

00:12:16.379 --> 00:12:17.939
Of a child.

00:12:17.939 --> 00:12:19.899
This is a long-term situation.

00:12:22.299 --> 00:12:25.379
Can't imagine the difficulty

00:12:25.439 --> 00:12:28.119
the father goes on to explain in v. 22

00:12:28.119 --> 00:12:30.359
some of what they endured.

00:12:30.359 --> 00:12:35.479
And oft times, it hath cast Him into the fire

00:12:35.479 --> 00:12:37.199
and into the waters.

00:12:37.199 --> 00:12:38.559
Why?

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:41.099
To destroy Him.

00:12:41.099 --> 00:12:42.599
But if thou canst do anything,

00:12:42.599 --> 00:12:46.239
have compassion on us and help us.

00:12:46.239 --> 00:12:48.759
You see, He's desperate.

00:12:48.759 --> 00:12:51.359
You find here that the Bible tells us

00:12:51.359 --> 00:12:53.959
that He was cast into the fire at times,

00:12:53.979 --> 00:12:55.619
He was cast into the water at times

00:12:55.619 --> 00:12:57.139
for the purpose of destroying.

00:12:57.139 --> 00:13:00.579
We know that the Bible tells us about Satan

00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:03.739
and we know that this is a fallen spirit,

00:13:03.739 --> 00:13:06.179
an evil spirit, but it tells us this.

00:13:06.179 --> 00:13:08.659
Jesus says in John 8 v. 44,

00:13:08.659 --> 00:13:10.139
Year of your father the devil

00:13:10.139 --> 00:13:11.699
and the lust of your father you will do.

00:13:11.699 --> 00:13:13.819
He was a murderer from the beginning

00:13:13.819 --> 00:13:14.979
and abode not in the truth

00:13:14.979 --> 00:13:17.099
because there is no truth in him.

00:13:17.099 --> 00:13:19.219
When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own

00:13:19.219 --> 00:13:21.619
for he's a liar and the father of it.

00:13:21.679 --> 00:13:25.239
Everything that Satan wants to do is to destroy.

00:13:25.239 --> 00:13:26.919
To destroy.

00:13:26.919 --> 00:13:29.639
And here, this unclean spirit

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:32.839
has entered into this boy at a child

00:13:32.839 --> 00:13:33.879
and now he's a son.

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:35.279
We don't know his age exactly,

00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:37.879
but the Bible tells us that oft times,

00:13:37.879 --> 00:13:39.039
this is what happened.

00:13:39.039 --> 00:13:42.479
Can you imagine?

00:13:42.479 --> 00:13:44.399
What a terrible situation.

00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:45.719
The father is distraught.

00:13:45.719 --> 00:13:48.119
The father is desperate.

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:51.779
And he says, if thou canst do anything,

00:13:51.779 --> 00:13:55.419
have compassion on us and help us.

00:13:55.419 --> 00:13:56.459
Notice v. 23,

00:13:56.459 --> 00:13:58.639
Jesus said unto him,

00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:01.559
if thou canst believe,

00:14:01.559 --> 00:14:05.039
all things are possible to him that believeth.

00:14:05.039 --> 00:14:07.099
I love the response of this individual

00:14:07.099 --> 00:14:08.519
in v. 24,

00:14:08.519 --> 00:14:10.199
in straightway the father of the child

00:14:10.199 --> 00:14:11.599
cried out and said with tears,

00:14:11.599 --> 00:14:14.299
Lord, I believe!

00:14:14.299 --> 00:14:18.439
Help thou mine unbelief.

00:14:18.439 --> 00:14:20.479
He's saying everything within me,

00:14:20.479 --> 00:14:22.199
I'm believing that You're able,

00:14:22.199 --> 00:14:25.699
but Lord, help that part that's unbelief

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:27.239
and give me more faith.

00:14:27.239 --> 00:14:30.079
Help me to believe more.

00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:31.839
And we look at the situation

00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:33.599
and we look at this interaction

00:14:33.599 --> 00:14:35.139
that is recorded for us,

00:14:35.139 --> 00:14:36.759
I believe that a second lesson

00:14:36.759 --> 00:14:38.579
that we learn from the passage of Scripture

00:14:38.579 --> 00:14:41.079
is this, and it's a lesson that we've all heard before,

00:14:41.079 --> 00:14:42.279
and it's simply this,

00:14:42.279 --> 00:14:47.359
our God is able to do anything.

00:14:47.359 --> 00:14:49.959
Anything.

00:14:49.959 --> 00:14:52.299
In Genesis 18 and v. 14,

00:14:52.299 --> 00:14:54.399
God says to Abraham,

00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:59.559
is anything too hard for the Lord?

00:14:59.559 --> 00:15:02.199
We find that Jeremiah would declare

00:15:02.199 --> 00:15:05.859
in Jeremiah 32 and v. 17,

00:15:05.859 --> 00:15:06.719
he declares,

00:15:06.719 --> 00:15:09.339
O Lord God, Thou hast made the heavens

00:15:09.339 --> 00:15:11.479
and the earth by Thine outstretched hand

00:15:11.499 --> 00:15:15.759
and nothing is too difficult for Thee.

00:15:15.759 --> 00:15:17.699
Luke 1 and v. 37 says,

00:15:17.699 --> 00:15:20.519
With God, all things are possible.

00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:22.939
Paul says in Ephesians 3 and v. 20,

00:15:22.939 --> 00:15:24.739
Now unto Him which is able to do

00:15:24.739 --> 00:15:26.239
exceeding abundantly above

00:15:26.239 --> 00:15:29.079
all that we ask or think.

00:15:29.079 --> 00:15:31.059
And we learn this lesson this evening

00:15:31.059 --> 00:15:32.699
from this passage of Scripture.

00:15:32.699 --> 00:15:34.659
Number one, we learn from the inability

00:15:34.659 --> 00:15:37.419
of the disciples that we better stop thinking

00:15:37.419 --> 00:15:40.359
that we can do anything apart from the help of God.

00:15:40.379 --> 00:15:42.559
We learn from the interaction that's recorded

00:15:42.559 --> 00:15:44.939
between Jesus and the disciples

00:15:44.939 --> 00:15:46.939
and this man and the Son.

00:15:46.939 --> 00:15:49.199
We learn this valuable lesson

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:53.419
that nothing is too difficult for our God.

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:57.279
Our God is the God of the impossible.

00:15:57.279 --> 00:15:59.899
And we find that throughout the Scriptures,

00:15:59.899 --> 00:16:03.259
we have found various testimonies

00:16:03.259 --> 00:16:06.459
and declarations of God's ability,

00:16:06.459 --> 00:16:09.339
but we've not just seen the declarations of it,

00:16:09.359 --> 00:16:11.819
we've seen the demonstrations of it.

00:16:11.819 --> 00:16:14.239
We've seen where God has led His people

00:16:14.239 --> 00:16:16.039
directly into difficulties

00:16:16.039 --> 00:16:17.959
just so that He could show

00:16:17.959 --> 00:16:22.599
that He is the God of the impossible.

00:16:22.599 --> 00:16:24.399
God could have led the children of Israel

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:27.439
out of Egypt any way He wanted to,

00:16:27.439 --> 00:16:32.559
but He led them directly to the banks of the Red Sea.

00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:33.759
Why?

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:35.839
So that He could part it

00:16:35.839 --> 00:16:38.799
and they could go over on dry ground.

00:16:38.819 --> 00:16:41.539
That's the God that we serve.

00:16:41.539 --> 00:16:44.439
That's amazing.

00:16:44.439 --> 00:16:47.859
We find this evening

00:16:47.859 --> 00:16:50.659
that just as this individual

00:16:50.659 --> 00:16:54.859
and these characters within this particular account of Scripture,

00:16:54.859 --> 00:16:57.819
they had to deal with some difficulties in their life.

00:16:57.819 --> 00:17:00.379
And I don't know the number of years.

00:17:00.379 --> 00:17:01.859
I don't know how bad it was.

00:17:01.859 --> 00:17:04.259
I can only relate to some of what he said here.

00:17:04.259 --> 00:17:06.899
I've never experienced any of this sort of thing.

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:09.519
But I find that he goes to the Lord.

00:17:09.519 --> 00:17:11.279
He knows that God is able.

00:17:11.279 --> 00:17:15.119
And Jesus tells him that if thou canst believe,

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:19.719
all things are possible to him that believeth.

00:17:19.719 --> 00:17:20.879
Wow!

00:17:20.879 --> 00:17:24.639
All things are God is able.

00:17:24.639 --> 00:17:26.119
Number three, if you're taking notes,

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:29.919
I want you to notice the inquiry of the disciples.

00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:31.239
Actually, let me stop.

00:17:31.239 --> 00:17:33.439
Let me back up a moment.

00:17:33.439 --> 00:17:34.999
We'll get to number three in a moment.

00:17:34.999 --> 00:17:36.799
We mentioned the disappointed Savior,

00:17:36.799 --> 00:17:37.819
the distraught Father.

00:17:37.819 --> 00:17:40.739
I want you to notice the delivered Son.

00:17:40.739 --> 00:17:43.539
We skipped over reading v. 25-27.

00:17:43.539 --> 00:17:45.899
I got a little excited.

00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:47.979
Notice what happens in v. 25.

00:17:47.979 --> 00:17:50.499
When Jesus saw that the people came running together,

00:17:50.499 --> 00:17:52.899
He rebuked the foul spirit saying unto Him,

00:17:52.899 --> 00:17:55.899
Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee,

00:17:55.899 --> 00:18:01.419
come out of him and enter no more into him.

00:18:01.419 --> 00:18:04.259
V. 26, And the spirit cried and rent him sore

00:18:04.279 --> 00:18:07.319
and came out of him, and he was as one dead,

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:09.219
insomuch that many said, He is dead.

00:18:09.219 --> 00:18:10.739
But Jesus took him by the hand

00:18:10.739 --> 00:18:13.259
and lifted him up and he arose.

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:14.399
You see the delivered Son.

00:18:14.399 --> 00:18:16.339
You see the power of God.

00:18:16.339 --> 00:18:18.419
You see here in these verses of Scripture

00:18:18.419 --> 00:18:20.419
that God has authority.

00:18:20.419 --> 00:18:22.179
He has power over Satan

00:18:22.179 --> 00:18:26.259
and all of the evil spirits that exist.

00:18:26.259 --> 00:18:28.219
We find that in Job's account,

00:18:28.219 --> 00:18:30.059
as we look at the passage of Scripture

00:18:30.059 --> 00:18:32.139
in the first few chapters of the book of Job,

00:18:32.359 --> 00:18:35.119
that you find there that Satan comes

00:18:35.119 --> 00:18:36.859
and he says the things that he says

00:18:36.859 --> 00:18:38.239
and he's going to go through

00:18:38.239 --> 00:18:40.279
and he's accusing and so on and so forth,

00:18:40.279 --> 00:18:45.320
and God says, have you considered My servant Job?

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.880
He says, well, he serves you

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.739
because you've blessed him.

00:18:49.739 --> 00:18:52.839
He says, well, you can do this, but you can't do this.

00:18:52.839 --> 00:18:55.559
See, God has all power.

00:18:55.559 --> 00:18:58.440
We understand the truth of 1 John 4,

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.719
for greater is He that is in you

00:18:59.719 --> 00:19:02.399
than he that is in the world.

00:19:02.399 --> 00:19:04.299
And this evening when we look at the interaction

00:19:04.299 --> 00:19:05.899
and we find these great lessons

00:19:05.899 --> 00:19:10.099
and we see the healing of this Son

00:19:10.099 --> 00:19:11.940
that He's delivered,

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.320
I can't imagine the joy

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.739
that must have filled the heart

00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:19.699
of this Father and this Son.

00:19:19.699 --> 00:19:21.339
And you think about the influence

00:19:21.339 --> 00:19:24.299
upon those that were gathered.

00:19:24.299 --> 00:19:26.440
We find that the interaction is recorded for us.

00:19:26.459 --> 00:19:27.380
Let's get to number three.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.659
I mentioned already,

00:19:28.659 --> 00:19:30.059
you notice in verse 28,

00:19:30.059 --> 00:19:32.979
the inquiry of the disciples.

00:19:32.979 --> 00:19:34.820
We've seen the inability of the disciples.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.779
We've seen the interaction that's recorded.

00:19:36.779 --> 00:19:38.820
Now we see the inquiry of the disciples.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.739
I believe that verse 28

00:19:40.739 --> 00:19:44.139
is both noteworthy and exemplary.

00:19:44.139 --> 00:19:46.059
I'm actually taken back

00:19:46.059 --> 00:19:48.500
by what happens in verse 28.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.019
Because we find that as we follow the account

00:19:51.019 --> 00:19:52.859
and see what's taking place,

00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:54.859
that this man, he comes

00:19:54.859 --> 00:19:56.359
and Jesus appears

00:19:56.359 --> 00:19:58.119
after the Mount of Transfiguration.

00:19:58.119 --> 00:20:00.119
They come. There's this great multitude.

00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:01.239
This is what's going on.

00:20:01.239 --> 00:20:02.999
What's the situation with the scribes

00:20:02.999 --> 00:20:04.399
disputing so on and so forth.

00:20:04.399 --> 00:20:05.459
This man comes and says,

00:20:05.459 --> 00:20:07.139
hey, I brought my son to your disciples.

00:20:07.139 --> 00:20:08.859
They couldn't do anything about it.

00:20:08.859 --> 00:20:10.699
And he goes through this whole process.

00:20:10.699 --> 00:20:12.039
He heals this boy.

00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:13.859
And now they go to the home.

00:20:13.859 --> 00:20:15.699
It appears, if you look in v. 28,

00:20:15.699 --> 00:20:18.079
and he was coming to the house.

00:20:18.079 --> 00:20:20.839
Notice, the Bible says that his disciples

00:20:20.839 --> 00:20:23.479
asked him privately,

00:20:23.479 --> 00:20:27.979
why could not we cast him out?

00:20:27.979 --> 00:20:29.879
That's the inquiry of the disciples.

00:20:30.099 --> 00:20:32.859
Why do I say it's noteworthy and exemplary?

00:20:32.859 --> 00:20:34.539
Well, see, here's the deal.

00:20:34.539 --> 00:20:37.019
They desired to know.

00:20:37.019 --> 00:20:39.219
They desired to find out

00:20:39.219 --> 00:20:41.899
why couldn't we do that?

00:20:41.899 --> 00:20:44.019
Why is it that we were not able

00:20:44.019 --> 00:20:46.779
to cast this demon, this foul spirit,

00:20:46.779 --> 00:20:50.479
out of this man?

00:20:50.479 --> 00:20:52.519
I think about this this evening,

00:20:52.519 --> 00:20:55.679
that if you don't ask, you don't get an answer.

00:20:55.679 --> 00:20:59.019
Have you ever attempted to do something in life and failed?

00:20:59.019 --> 00:21:00.899
I'm sure you have.

00:21:00.899 --> 00:21:03.579
And maybe we attempt to do something and we fail,

00:21:03.579 --> 00:21:05.159
and we have too much pride

00:21:05.159 --> 00:21:08.439
to ask somebody that knows,

00:21:08.439 --> 00:21:10.879
why wasn't I able to do that?

00:21:10.879 --> 00:21:12.279
Why were you able to do that,

00:21:12.279 --> 00:21:14.919
but I wasn't able to do that?

00:21:14.919 --> 00:21:17.159
Now, we understand on the spiritual realm here

00:21:17.159 --> 00:21:18.359
what's happening,

00:21:18.359 --> 00:21:19.919
and we look at what's taking place,

00:21:19.919 --> 00:21:25.999
and notice, if the disciples did not ask the question,

00:21:25.999 --> 00:21:31.179
I don't think they'd have gotten an answer.

00:21:31.179 --> 00:21:33.699
We find here this evening that they ask this question.

00:21:33.699 --> 00:21:35.539
They inquire.

00:21:35.539 --> 00:21:39.159
And I think it's so important for us to understand

00:21:39.159 --> 00:21:41.019
the approach of the disciples.

00:21:41.019 --> 00:21:42.699
In fact, I would challenge you

00:21:42.699 --> 00:21:44.479
as you read through the Gospel accounts,

00:21:44.479 --> 00:21:46.179
you'll find on some occasions

00:21:46.179 --> 00:21:47.699
where the disciples are there

00:21:47.699 --> 00:21:48.899
and they have a question,

00:21:48.899 --> 00:21:51.099
but they don't ask Jesus.

00:21:51.099 --> 00:21:52.819
They don't ask Him.

00:21:52.819 --> 00:21:55.899
But here, they say why?

00:21:55.899 --> 00:22:01.119
Why could not we cast Him out?

00:22:01.119 --> 00:22:02.639
Lesson number three this evening.

00:22:02.639 --> 00:22:05.999
Lesson number one, we must stop thinking

00:22:05.999 --> 00:22:08.039
we can do anything apart from the help of God.

00:22:08.039 --> 00:22:09.319
Lesson number two,

00:22:09.319 --> 00:22:11.519
that we understand that our God is able to do anything.

00:22:11.519 --> 00:22:13.239
Lesson number three,

00:22:13.239 --> 00:22:17.399
develop a teachable spirit.

00:22:17.399 --> 00:22:19.559
Come to a place where we are willing

00:22:19.559 --> 00:22:21.919
to come to God and say,

00:22:21.919 --> 00:22:23.919
God, would You teach me?

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.139
Be willing to learn.

00:22:26.139 --> 00:22:27.979
See, we're to have that teachable spirit.

00:22:27.979 --> 00:22:30.619
Have you ever dealt with somebody in life?

00:22:30.619 --> 00:22:32.419
Don't tell me who they are if you have.

00:22:32.419 --> 00:22:33.500
But have you ever dealt with somebody

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:38.000
that just seems to know how to do everything already?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.500
You say, hey, we're going to go do this.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:40.959
Oh, I know how to do it.

00:22:40.959 --> 00:22:41.799
Have you ever done it before?

00:22:41.799 --> 00:22:44.860
No, but I know how to do it.

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.059
So I've done it a few times.

00:22:46.059 --> 00:22:46.899
Can I show you?

00:22:46.899 --> 00:22:48.539
No, I know how to do it.

00:22:48.539 --> 00:22:49.860
And then you go back and find out

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:52.299
it's not done right.

00:22:52.479 --> 00:22:54.759
See, we just got to have a teachable spirit.

00:22:54.759 --> 00:22:56.959
What prevents me from having a teachable spirit?

00:22:56.959 --> 00:22:59.019
Pride.

00:22:59.019 --> 00:23:00.799
Pride.

00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:02.119
And so I find that the disciples,

00:23:02.119 --> 00:23:04.119
they say, why could not we cast Him out?

00:23:04.119 --> 00:23:06.759
Notice number four this evening.

00:23:06.759 --> 00:23:08.759
Finally, the instruction of Jesus.

00:23:08.759 --> 00:23:09.959
What good instruction it is.

00:23:09.959 --> 00:23:11.479
I mean, it's only one verse of Scripture,

00:23:11.479 --> 00:23:13.039
but wow!

00:23:13.039 --> 00:23:15.559
The power of verse number 29.

00:23:15.559 --> 00:23:17.879
The Lord answers the question of the disciples

00:23:17.879 --> 00:23:20.720
when they say, why could not we cast Him out?

00:23:20.739 --> 00:23:22.259
And He says to them,

00:23:22.259 --> 00:23:26.339
this kind can come forth by nothing,

00:23:26.339 --> 00:23:30.500
but by prayer and fasting.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.539
We find that Jesus in answering

00:23:32.539 --> 00:23:33.899
the question of the disciples

00:23:33.899 --> 00:23:36.220
places an emphasis upon

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:39.659
and importance upon this subject matter

00:23:39.659 --> 00:23:41.899
of prayer and fasting.

00:23:41.899 --> 00:23:45.059
We find that today in the church of God

00:23:45.059 --> 00:23:48.059
as we would look at the opportunity

00:23:48.059 --> 00:23:49.059
that we have to pray,

00:23:49.059 --> 00:23:50.459
what a great privilege it is,

00:23:50.479 --> 00:23:52.000
but far too often,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.399
prayer is neglected by the people of God.

00:23:55.399 --> 00:23:56.839
It really is.

00:23:56.839 --> 00:23:58.159
It's neglected.

00:23:58.159 --> 00:24:00.239
But there's power in prayer.

00:24:00.239 --> 00:24:02.919
I believe it was John R. Rice that said,

00:24:02.919 --> 00:24:05.119
no prayer, no power.

00:24:05.119 --> 00:24:07.239
Little prayer, little power.

00:24:07.239 --> 00:24:09.959
Much prayer, much power.

00:24:09.959 --> 00:24:11.279
It's a simple little quote

00:24:11.279 --> 00:24:13.839
that he used to use all of the time

00:24:13.839 --> 00:24:15.799
as he would preach on prayer.

00:24:15.799 --> 00:24:17.639
And actually, John R. Rice wrote

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:21.220
a number of books on prayer.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.699
And he's known as being a prayer warrior.

00:24:23.699 --> 00:24:26.260
We find here that Jesus places

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.339
this emphasis upon the subject of prayer

00:24:29.339 --> 00:24:31.260
and fasting, and we find that prayer

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.459
is too often neglected by the people of God.

00:24:33.459 --> 00:24:35.579
And really, the reality this evening

00:24:35.579 --> 00:24:38.179
is that rarely, if ever,

00:24:38.179 --> 00:24:47.059
is the subject of fasting even discussed.

00:24:47.079 --> 00:24:48.600
I believe this evening that as we look

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.880
at what's taking place,

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:56.220
we find that faith leads to prayer.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.479
And then you see the coupling here

00:24:58.479 --> 00:25:00.579
with fasting.

00:25:00.579 --> 00:25:02.639
See, because I believe God

00:25:02.639 --> 00:25:04.399
and because I believe that He's able,

00:25:04.399 --> 00:25:06.320
because I learned that second lesson

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.279
that there's nothing too hard for Him,

00:25:08.279 --> 00:25:10.500
then I go to Him in prayer.

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.600
Asking in faith.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.079
Believing that He is able.

00:25:14.079 --> 00:25:16.440
We find that we understand this evening

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.619
this truth of how our faith

00:25:19.619 --> 00:25:21.820
would impact the way in which we pray.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.500
I've often said that prayer

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.979
is the greatest expression of dependence

00:25:25.979 --> 00:25:27.660
upon the Lord.

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.699
When I'm praying, I'm demonstrating

00:25:29.699 --> 00:25:32.500
that I'm dependent upon Him.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.699
And I'm believing that He's able.

00:25:34.699 --> 00:25:36.299
Listen, we don't believe in praying

00:25:36.299 --> 00:25:37.779
vain repetitions.

00:25:37.779 --> 00:25:40.459
We're not just memorizing some prayer book

00:25:40.459 --> 00:25:42.179
and just praying through these things.

00:25:42.179 --> 00:25:44.459
No, we're communing with the God

00:25:44.459 --> 00:25:47.199
of the universe.

00:25:47.199 --> 00:25:49.119
We think about the subject of fasting,

00:25:49.119 --> 00:25:51.359
I believe that fasting demonstrates

00:25:51.359 --> 00:25:53.919
the seriousness of the individual.

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:56.639
The fact that the individual

00:25:56.639 --> 00:25:58.399
would be willing to deny themselves

00:25:58.399 --> 00:26:01.359
of something in order to seek God.

00:26:01.359 --> 00:26:02.919
In order to seek Him.

00:26:02.919 --> 00:26:03.919
You understand that often

00:26:03.919 --> 00:26:05.000
when we speak about fasting,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.880
we speak about it in the context of food.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.399
We think about the subject of fasting

00:26:09.399 --> 00:26:11.119
and it's not the idea that we're just,

00:26:11.119 --> 00:26:12.959
I'm not going to eat for seven days

00:26:13.019 --> 00:26:15.100
or for seven whatever,

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.059
or however long the period of time is.

00:26:17.059 --> 00:26:18.820
No, the purpose of fasting

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.100
is not just to stop doing something,

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.979
but to seek God.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.899
And we're seeking Him with a higher level

00:26:27.899 --> 00:26:29.779
of seriousness and urgency

00:26:29.779 --> 00:26:31.579
and we find here that Jesus

00:26:31.579 --> 00:26:33.859
in responding to these disciples

00:26:33.859 --> 00:26:35.500
and of course as it's been preserved

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.339
for us this evening,

00:26:37.339 --> 00:26:38.699
we find that He says,

00:26:38.699 --> 00:26:40.339
as they asked the question,

00:26:40.359 --> 00:26:43.519
why could not we cast Him out?

00:26:43.519 --> 00:26:45.519
And Jesus said to them,

00:26:45.519 --> 00:26:48.839
this kind can come forth by nothing,

00:26:48.839 --> 00:26:50.679
but by prayer and fasting.

00:26:50.679 --> 00:26:52.040
He said in verse 19,

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.940
O faithless generation.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:54.820
We find that He says,

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:56.359
this kind come forth by nothing,

00:26:56.359 --> 00:26:57.799
but by prayer and fasting.

00:26:57.799 --> 00:27:00.339
Remember as we've looked at the passage of Scripture,

00:27:00.339 --> 00:27:01.359
we've understood some things

00:27:01.359 --> 00:27:03.399
about the disciples this evening

00:27:03.399 --> 00:27:05.919
with regard to this particular account.

00:27:05.919 --> 00:27:09.440
Oh, how we need to be dependent upon the Lord

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.859
and not self-dependent.

00:27:11.859 --> 00:27:13.320
When I'm self-dependent,

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:18.160
I will see its impact in my prayer life.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.179
Because I just go through life

00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:20.220
thinking I got it all.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.559
I can handle it all.

00:27:22.559 --> 00:27:25.519
But oh, how we need Him.

00:27:25.519 --> 00:27:28.880
This evening as we've sought to look at a lesson

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.579
from each of our points this evening,

00:27:30.579 --> 00:27:32.940
lesson one, that we would stop thinking

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.779
that we can do anything apart from God.

00:27:34.779 --> 00:27:36.779
Lesson two, that we realize that our God

00:27:36.779 --> 00:27:37.979
is able to do all things.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:38.880
Lesson number three,

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.199
a lesson that we learn is that

00:27:41.199 --> 00:27:42.519
here in the text of Scripture,

00:27:42.519 --> 00:27:44.760
that we are to develop a teachable spirit.

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.199
In lesson number four,

00:27:46.199 --> 00:27:49.720
that we recognize the importance of prayer and fasting,

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.959
but not simply to recognize the importance of it,

00:27:52.959 --> 00:27:56.760
but to develop a consistent prayer life

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.459
and to practice fasting.

00:27:59.459 --> 00:28:02.000
That we would understand the importance of this.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.239
That we would see how the Lord is placing

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.699
this emphasis upon prayer and fasting this evening.

00:28:08.699 --> 00:28:10.459
Again, as I mentioned,

00:28:10.459 --> 00:28:12.820
prayer is often neglected by the people of God

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:16.820
and the subject matter of fasting is rarely discussed.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.779
And yet Jesus said,

00:28:18.779 --> 00:28:20.779
this kind can come forth by nothing

00:28:20.779 --> 00:28:22.940
but by prayer and fasting.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:27.899
This evening as we look at a passage of Scripture

00:28:27.899 --> 00:28:30.699
and interaction between Jesus' disciples

00:28:30.699 --> 00:28:33.059
and this man and his son,

00:28:34.059 --> 00:28:35.640
I believe that we have the opportunity

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.960
to learn some valuable lessons.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.359
And I trust that as we would seek

00:28:40.359 --> 00:28:42.559
to learn valuable lessons from the Word of God,

00:28:42.559 --> 00:28:44.539
that we would seek to implement those lessons

00:28:44.539 --> 00:28:45.880
in our own lives.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.359
That we would have our faith increase.

00:28:50.359 --> 00:28:54.719
That we would recognize that man, our God is able.

00:28:54.719 --> 00:28:57.479
If thou canst believe all things are possible

00:28:57.479 --> 00:28:59.640
to him that believeth.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.279
I believe this evening that our God is able

00:29:01.339 --> 00:29:04.619
to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:29:04.619 --> 00:29:07.000
I believe that he answers specific prayer.

00:29:08.539 --> 00:29:11.299
I believe that there are times in which

00:29:11.299 --> 00:29:14.380
we may shy away from praying specific prayers

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.200
because our faith is small.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.500
We pray specific prayers,

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.500
we get to see God answer specifically.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.739
And oh, how that increases our faith.

00:29:24.739 --> 00:29:27.820
Lord bless them, I mean bless them good, Lord.

00:29:29.159 --> 00:29:30.159
What does that mean?

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.179
You know what I mean?

00:29:33.179 --> 00:29:36.900
And we pray specifically and we see God answer

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.059
and our faith is increased.

00:29:39.059 --> 00:29:40.700
Oh, that we'd understand this evening

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.659
as these disciples inquired,

00:29:43.739 --> 00:29:45.260
why couldn't we cast them out?

00:29:46.219 --> 00:29:48.919
I know the text says, why could not we cast them out?

00:29:51.419 --> 00:29:52.839
I'm glad they inquired.

00:29:54.099 --> 00:29:55.739
Because we get to learn a lesson.

00:29:56.619 --> 00:29:59.020
And I believe it's a valuable lesson.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.219
This evening as we look

00:30:00.219 --> 00:30:01.059
Look at this.

00:30:01.059 --> 00:30:04.799
I hope that we'd apply these lessons in our lives.

00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:05.639
Let's pray together.

00:30:05.639 --> 00:30:07.419
Father, we love You.

00:30:07.419 --> 00:30:09.899
We thank You so much for loving us.

00:30:09.899 --> 00:30:10.979
We thank You for Thy Word

00:30:10.979 --> 00:30:13.839
and the truth contained therein.

00:30:13.839 --> 00:30:15.699
We thank You for this interaction,

00:30:15.699 --> 00:30:17.459
this account that You've given us

00:30:17.459 --> 00:30:23.179
of Mark 9.

00:30:23.179 --> 00:30:26.999
Lord, we thank You for demonstrating Your power

00:30:26.999 --> 00:30:28.459
over this unclean spirit

00:30:28.459 --> 00:30:30.859
and healing this boy, this son.

00:30:30.859 --> 00:30:31.759
We don't know his age.

00:30:31.759 --> 00:30:34.059
We know that he had this unclean spirit

00:30:34.059 --> 00:30:38.859
from a child.

00:30:38.859 --> 00:30:42.479
Lord, we thank You for the inquiry of the disciples

00:30:42.479 --> 00:30:44.399
and for the lesson that they were taught

00:30:44.399 --> 00:30:48.199
and that we've been taught this evening.

00:30:48.199 --> 00:30:50.719
Lord, we thank You that You are able.

00:30:50.719 --> 00:30:55.239
I pray that as we live our lives,

00:30:55.239 --> 00:30:58.899
as we seek Your face through prayer,

00:30:58.899 --> 00:31:03.339
that God, we would trust You and believe You.

00:31:03.339 --> 00:31:07.779
That we'd see You do great and mighty things.

00:31:07.779 --> 00:31:09.419
We thank You for loving us.

00:31:09.419 --> 00:31:11.739
We pray that You'd bless our time of prayer,

00:31:11.739 --> 00:31:12.579
that all that's said and done,

00:31:12.579 --> 00:31:13.979
that You alone would be glorified.

00:31:13.979 --> 00:31:15.979
For it's in Christ's name we pray,

00:31:15.979 --> 00:31:17.659
Amen.

00:31:17.659 --> 00:31:19.659
If you do not have a prayer bulletin,

00:31:19.659 --> 00:31:21.179
I could encourage you to go in the back

00:31:21.179 --> 00:31:24.179
and grab one if you would like one.
