1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,039
five, Lamentations, chapter number five, and Jeremiah and then Lamentations.

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,760
And I'll be looking at the fifth chapter this evening,

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,220
really looking at the last several verses of Lamentations, chapter number five.

4
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,799
As you know, contextually or historically,

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,719
if you were to consider the time of the writing of the Book of Lamentations,

6
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,440
you would understand that God allowed the prophet Jeremiah

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,100
to not only pen the words to the Book of Jeremiah,

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,940
but also to this book of Lamentations.

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,020
The nation of Judah had been taken captive.

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,479
We understand that he had used Jeremiah, along with a number of other prophets,

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,540
in order to prophesy about the impending judgment,

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,819
the Babylonian captivity because of the sin, the wickedness of God's people.

13
00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:53,500
And we find that Jeremiah was warning of that impending judgment.

14
00:00:53,779 --> 00:00:56,400
And the Book of Lamentations, obviously,

15
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:59,360
it's made obvious by the title of the book.

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,860
It is a book of mourning and the word lamentation or lamentations here.

17
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,080
It means to cry aloud.

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,800
And you think about lamenting and you think about the just the destruction,

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,919
utter destruction in Jerusalem and Judah because of the the sin of the people

20
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:23,099
and how God had raised up the Babylonians and just utter destruction

21
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,000
and reason to cry aloud, reason to lament.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,040
And thus we read of lamentations.

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,720
And we'll look at these last few verses of Lamentations five

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,099
and make a few comments about three of the verses.

25
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:38,519
And then we'll fix our attention on verse number 21 this evening.

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,059
But notice what the Bible says.

27
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:42,220
Really, the book ends with a prayer.

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,680
It says this in verse 19, Thou, O Lord,

29
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:51,279
remainest forever thy throne from generation to generation.

30
00:01:51,699 --> 00:01:57,000
Wherefore, dost thou forget us forever and forsake us so long time?

31
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:02,959
Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned.

32
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:06,720
Renew our days as of old.

33
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,220
But thou hast utterly rejected us.

34
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,360
Thou art very wroth against us.

35
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,479
If we look at verse number 19, we find

36
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:21,679
that there is recognition on the part of Jeremiah

37
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,059
with regard to the eternality of God.

38
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:30,559
I'm thankful that our God is eternal, that thou remainest forever

39
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,160
thy throne from generation to generation.

40
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,539
He will never be dethroned.

41
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:38,820
No one's ever going to conquer him.

42
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:41,320
He is king of kings, lord of lords.

43
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,740
The great I am. He is eternal.

44
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,580
And what a blessed thought.

45
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,059
In verse number 19, we find it as we get to verse number 20

46
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:53,160
that really we are gaining insight as to the condition

47
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:57,059
of these that have just suffered greatly.

48
00:02:57,059 --> 00:03:00,160
And as Jeremiah is lamenting, he says, Wherefore,

49
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,199
dost thou forget us forever and forsake us so long time?

50
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:09,619
Do you remember the psalmist as he would cry out, Lord, how long will you forget me?

51
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,419
And there are times, no doubt, as we deal with adversity

52
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:18,220
that we can feel just as the psalmist or just as Jeremiah would reference here.

53
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,839
We'll look at 21 in more detail.

54
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:24,600
But notice in verse number 22, the Bible says, But thou hast utterly rejected us.

55
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,940
Thou art very wroth against us.

56
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:32,100
I find here that there's a recognition of God's judgment

57
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:35,979
as a result of the sin of the people of God.

58
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:40,559
And it's interesting, as you were to look at this last few verses

59
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,500
of this passage of scripture, it ends really on a negative note

60
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,639
in verse number 22 about the judgment.

61
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,720
And so oftentimes when the Jewish people would read

62
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,899
the book of Lamentations out loud and they would read it as a gathering,

63
00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:00,600
they would repeat verse number 21 after verse number 22

64
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:03,979
and they would read it, they would conclude with verse number 22.

65
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:07,100
And then again, they would read verse number 21.

66
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,660
And I think that's quite interesting to think about that perspective

67
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,119
and that they would do that.

68
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:15,779
And it really helps us to see the the impact

69
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:17,660
and the importance of verse number 21.

70
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,920
Notice it says, Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord,

71
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,679
and we shall be turned.

72
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,920
Renew our days as of old.

73
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,380
If you're taking notes, I've titled the message tonight.

74
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,140
Turn thou us unto thee.

75
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:40,019
Turn thou us unto thee.

76
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:46,640
A.W. Tozer said this, Oh, God, I have tasted thy goodness

77
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,679
and it has both satisfied me

78
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:53,239
and made me thirsty for more.

79
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:57,700
I am painfully aware of my need of further grace.

80
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,040
I am ashamed of my lack of desire.

81
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh, God, I want to want thee.

82
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,679
I long to be filled with longing.

83
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:15,760
I thirst to be made more thirsty still.

84
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:17,459
Isn't that wonderful?

85
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:21,519
You see a man that is so desiring of the presence of God

86
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,220
and so interested in having that sweet communion.

87
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:28,940
We spoke of that on Sunday morning, of that communion that we can enjoy.

88
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,899
And we find that he says, I've tasted the goodness, A.W. Tozer.

89
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,160
And he says, it satisfied me, but it's made me thirsty for more.

90
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,959
And when you get into the presence of God and you enjoy that presence,

91
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,000
you say, I want more of this.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,040
I'm enjoying this, no doubt, as the psalmist said in Psalm 16,

93
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,100
in his presence, his fullness of joy.

94
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,299
He says. I want to want thee.

95
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,519
I long to be filled with longing.

96
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,760
I thirst to be more thirsty still.

97
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,959
I wonder tonight if we would agree with A.W.

98
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,000
Tozer and say, that's my prayer.

99
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,559
I don't want just a little bit.

100
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:13,720
I want to have my cup filled and I want my cup to be running over.

101
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,220
Amen. With the blessings of God, as we think about this statement

102
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,679
in verse number 21, turn thou us unto thee.

103
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,359
And we look at the entirety of this verse as we notice here.

104
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:29,359
I believe that Jeremiah acknowledges that was the people of God

105
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,959
who had gone astray.

106
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,100
God did not move.

107
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,880
God is constant.

108
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,100
God is always the same, right?

109
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,260
He's never changes.

110
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,640
He says that he is immutable.

111
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,519
We find that he says, I am the Lord.

112
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,519
I change not in Malachi.

113
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:52,359
We find that Hebrews reminds us Jesus Christ the same yesterday

114
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:54,320
and today and forever.

115
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,359
Our God changes not.

116
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:58,959
God did not move.

117
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,160
But we find that the children of Israel think about what Jeremiah says

118
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,799
when the indictment against the nation of Judah is given

119
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,799
really on a number of occasion throughout the book.

120
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:13,239
But you find specifically as you read the opening chapters

121
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:17,619
of the book of Jeremiah, you begin to read about this forgetting of God

122
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:20,959
and this forsaking of God and this following of idols.

123
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,299
And so if you think about the nation of Judah

124
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:26,600
and you think about the people of God, the children of Israel

125
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:30,720
and how they had gone astray, they forgot their maker.

126
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,440
They forgot the one that had done so much for them.

127
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,119
And they forgot him.

128
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:40,679
The question is asked of how is it that this is kind of made

129
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:42,959
forget her ornaments or a bride, her attire.

130
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,760
Yet my people have forgotten me days without number in Jeremiah two

131
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,200
in verse number thirty two.

132
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,559
And they forgot the Lord.

133
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:54,600
And as a result of forgetting God, they forsook the Lord

134
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:59,519
and they were forsaking the Lord and they followed after these idols.

135
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,839
We understand that idolatry was a common problem for Israel.

136
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:07,079
And then, of course, in Judah as well.

137
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:10,519
And we find that many times throughout the book of Jeremiah,

138
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:16,079
the Bible will use the word about return or turning to it says this

139
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,959
in Jeremiah three in verse number twelve, go and proclaim these words

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,359
toward the north and say, return now backsliding Israel,

141
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:29,239
sayeth the Lord, and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you.

142
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:33,359
Notice this, for I am merciful, sayeth the Lord,

143
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,559
and I will not keep anger forever.

144
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,559
Aren't you thankful that God is merciful?

145
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,640
And the reality is that as we see this prayer

146
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,599
that ends the book of lamentations in this statement in verse number

147
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:50,799
twenty one, turn thou us unto thee, O Lord,

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,960
and we shall be turned, renew our days as of old.

149
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,479
And so I believe that as we know that Jeremiah acknowledges

150
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:00,919
that it was the people of God that had gone astray

151
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,440
and therefore he has this prayer here.

152
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,799
And we notice, I would say from verse twenty one,

153
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:08,039
that really there's a twofold aspect of it.

154
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:12,320
First, as we see in the title, turn thou us unto thee.

155
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,520
But then we find that the verse ends with this statement.

156
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,719
Renew our days as of old.

157
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,760
I believe that the thought that would be given to us here,

158
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,640
this idea of renewing, we speak about revival

159
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,479
and we speak about this need for us to have revival

160
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:32,479
and this revival meeting that is coming up on our calendar.

161
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:36,960
And I spent time on Sunday preaching about revival and how to be prepared,

162
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:41,400
how to be ready for revival and dealing with the importance

163
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,880
and looking at that subject on Sunday evening.

164
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,280
Joy is withered away and how that sin will rob us of our joy

165
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:53,359
and how we need to forsake and confess and we need to have God,

166
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:56,799
as David said, restore unto me the joy of thy salvation.

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,119
I think about this prayer when he says renew our days.

168
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:02,219
as of old, you can think back

169
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:04,479
into the history of the nation of Israel

170
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:08,519
when they were enjoying the blessing of God.

171
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,519
When they were enjoying the fellowship

172
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:12,319
with their Maker.

173
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:15,179
When they were enjoying that fellowship

174
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:17,479
that God had designed for them to have.

175
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:19,439
And so I think if we could take

176
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:22,279
the prayer of Jeremiah here

177
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,359
in Lamentations 5 and verse 21

178
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:27,679
and perhaps make some application

179
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,039
for us this evening,

180
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,519
and we find that we are to turn unto Thee.

181
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,959
Turn Thou us unto Thee.

182
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:40,999
But then he says renew our days as of old.

183
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:42,639
If we can find in our minds

184
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:44,799
a time in our lives in which we enjoyed

185
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,719
that sweet communion with the Lord,

186
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:48,759
that sweet fellowship with God,

187
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:50,479
and we say that's what I long for.

188
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:52,119
That's what I thirst for.

189
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,839
And maybe things have gotten stale

190
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,319
in your life and my life.

191
00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:57,959
Maybe the monotony of life

192
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,519
has just kind of crept in

193
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,439
and we say no, I wanna have like it was

194
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:04,319
in those days of old.

195
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,119
I want you to think about what Hosea says.

196
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:08,639
Turn over if you will to the book of Hosea.

197
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,479
Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea.

198
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:12,879
Look over there to Hosea if you will.

199
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,039
And I wanna just share a few verses of scripture

200
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:17,039
and then we're gonna run to the New Testament

201
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,659
and then finish up this evening.

202
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:21,519
I had planned to preach a shorter message tonight

203
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,919
so that we could spend an extended time of prayer.

204
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,999
And the message will still be

205
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:29,199
about as short as it was going to be,

206
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:31,359
maybe a few minutes longer.

207
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:32,839
But you don't have to drive home

208
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:34,239
and so therefore you can spend

209
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:36,479
a real extended amount of time in prayer.

210
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:38,479
And so that is a blessing.

211
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:41,159
But I want you to notice in Hosea chapter five,

212
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,039
I'm gonna read four verses throughout the book of Hosea

213
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:47,399
just with this idea of turning or returning.

214
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,639
Notice what it says in Hosea five in verse 15.

215
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,199
I will go and return to my place

216
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:56,879
till they acknowledge their offense and seek my face.

217
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:59,159
And in their affliction they will seek me early.

218
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:01,839
See the idea, remember we talked about on Sunday night

219
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,399
about all of that affliction

220
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,159
and all of that stuff that was happening

221
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:08,279
and how for all of this they did not turn.

222
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,259
Yet for all of this they return not.

223
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:13,619
Remember as I mentioned in the book of Amos

224
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:16,339
in the fourth chapter after famine and drought

225
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:18,720
and blight and pestilence and destruction

226
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,239
that God says, yet have ye not returned unto me,

227
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:23,479
saith the Lord.

228
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,720
And so we find that the end of verse number 15

229
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,080
says that in their affliction they will seek me early.

230
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,839
And really that's the design.

231
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,299
God is a gracious, loving God.

232
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:35,639
We understand the Bible says

233
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,559
whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth.

234
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:40,199
And we find that he's trying to bring us back

235
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:43,159
into that loving fellowship with him,

236
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:45,659
that sweet communion with him.

237
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:48,419
We find that the beginning of chapter number six,

238
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:49,679
look at verse number one.

239
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,239
Come and let us return unto the Lord.

240
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,159
For he hath torn and he will heal us.

241
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:59,679
And he hath smitten and he will bind us up.

242
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,259
Aren't you thankful that we can return to the Lord?

243
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:05,879
Turn thou us unto thee.

244
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:08,159
Notice in chapter number 12,

245
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,799
just a few more pages over

246
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:13,319
and look at the sixth verse.

247
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:15,919
The remedy for all this turmoil

248
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,879
that they're dealing with.

249
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:21,519
The Bible says this in verse number six of Hosea 12,

250
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,599
Therefore, turn thou to thy God.

251
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:28,759
Keep mercy and judgment

252
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:32,559
and wait on thy God continually.

253
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:35,000
It seems pretty simple, doesn't it?

254
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,919
I mean, you just notice the remedy

255
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:38,319
for all that's taken place

256
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:40,679
and all the desolation

257
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,599
and all the distress.

258
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:44,839
And he says, therefore,

259
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:47,799
turn thou to thy God.

260
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,440
Keep mercy and judgment

261
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,319
and wait on thy God continually.

262
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:54,440
It's interesting as you study

263
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,239
through the book of Hosea,

264
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:58,759
and I know I went over there

265
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:59,879
to chapter number 12,

266
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,679
but if you look back just for a moment

267
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,080
to chapter number 7,

268
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,239
and there's not really mention here

269
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:07,399
about returning except for it says

270
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,720
that they do not return to the Lord their God,

271
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,279
but it really is a situation

272
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,319
where they don't even know

273
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:17,079
how bad their condition is.

274
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:19,559
So there's this thing of self-deception.

275
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,040
The Bible says that we're to be doers of the Word,

276
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,839
not hearers only, deceiving our own selves.

277
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,359
The Bible says the deceitfulness of sin

278
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,760
in the book of Hebrews,

279
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,359
and so we notice that deceit.

280
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:31,799
But notice in verse number 9,

281
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:35,919
it says, strangers have devoured His strength,

282
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,479
and He knoweth it not.

283
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:40,519
Yea, gray hairs are here and there upon Him,

284
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:43,760
yet He knoweth not.

285
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,199
And the pride of Israel testifieth to His face.

286
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:47,320
Notice this,

287
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,440
and they do not return to the Lord their God,

288
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,239
nor seek Him for all this.

289
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:59,119
After the destruction,

290
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:01,559
the hand of the Babylonians,

291
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:04,160
as Jerusalem lay waste,

292
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,000
we read the book of Lamentations,

293
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,679
and you read the crying aloud.

294
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:11,639
You read the lamenting of Jeremiah.

295
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,119
And as you end the book

296
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:14,880
and you come to that fifth chapter

297
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,639
and you read that plea,

298
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:20,559
that petition, that prayer,

299
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,720
you find that He says,

300
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,239
turn thou us unto Thee, O Lord.

301
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:28,239
And He says this,

302
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:30,440
and we shall be turned.

303
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,399
And then He says renew our days as of old.

304
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,160
One last verse in the book of Hosea,

305
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,880
chapter 14 and verse 1,

306
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,919
it says, O Israel,

307
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:41,799
return unto the Lord thy God,

308
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:49,600
for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.

309
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,519
We find that in life,

310
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,839
there are many things that will pull us

311
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,399
in many different directions.

312
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,799
We may just get off just a degree or two,

313
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,359
but after a while of being off

314
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:04,479
just a degree or two

315
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:05,600
and going far enough,

316
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,440
you find that that distance of separation

317
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:12,679
has increased exponentially.

318
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,440
And I find this need for us

319
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,799
even as the prophets would cry out

320
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,880
for this turning to God.

321
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,559
It's interesting that the first song

322
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,839
that we sang this evening,

323
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:25,720
Draw Me Nearer,

324
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,679
this idea of being near to God,

325
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,959
this fellowship with God.

326
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,880
I want you to turn to the book of Revelation

327
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,000
as we close tonight.

328
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,079
I want you to think about

329
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:34,519
this New Testament principle.

330
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,519
Revelation 2.

331
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,679
The book of Revelation,

332
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:41,919
these couple of chapters,

333
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:42,919
chapters 2 and 3,

334
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,000
we read of course of the letters

335
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,239
to the churches in Asia.

336
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,160
And we read about the many things

337
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,639
that God has to say about these churches.

338
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,279
And it's interesting that

339
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,639
these are real churches that exist.

340
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,399
They're real churches.

341
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,600
And we find the first one

342
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,959
is the church at Ephesus.

343
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,519
We of course are mindful

344
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:05,600
as you read the book of Acts

345
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,279
of being able to read through

346
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:09,040
and see the time and ministry

347
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,959
that Paul spent in Ephesus.

348
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,880
And then, you also have the privilege

349
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,559
of reading the book of Ephesians

350
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,040
and being able to get insight

351
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,760
as to the instruction that was provided.

352
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,239
And we find that the church at Ephesus

353
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:23,959
is the first church that's addressed here

354
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,359
out of these seven letters.

355
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,959
And it says this in verse 1,

356
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,760
unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write,

357
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,839
these things saith he that holdeth

358
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:35,399
the seven stars in his right hand,

359
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:36,839
who walketh in the midst

360
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:39,559
of the seven golden candlesticks.

361
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,720
Notice, he says, I know thy works.

362
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,799
You know, God knows everything about us.

363
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:45,799
He knows everything.

364
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,839
He's the omniscient God.

365
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:52,559
I know thy works and thy labor

366
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,000
and thy patience,

367
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,239
and how thou canst not bear them

368
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:59,079
which are evil.

369
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,359
And thou hast tried them

370
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:03,040
which say they are apostles and are not,

371
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,160
and hast found them liars.

372
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,880
I mean, that's commendable, is it not?

373
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,279
They can't bear evil.

374
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:12,839
They don't have any interest in corruption

375
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:14,799
within the house of God.

376
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,600
And we're going to separate.

377
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,399
We're going to walk and live wholly.

378
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,519
It's important.

379
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:22,839
He says, thou hast tried them

380
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,160
which say they are apostles.

381
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,199
You understand that in the first century,

382
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:29,079
they had difficulties with people coming in

383
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:30,479
and these false teachers.

384
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:33,119
And we still have that today.

385
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,200
I'm thankful that we have the whole canon of Scripture.

386
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,559
We have the whole Word of God.

387
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,359
And as we're told in the book of 1 John,

388
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,119
that we're to try the spirits.

389
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,080
And we have the Scriptures

390
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,200
that are the authority that we can use

391
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,279
and we can evaluate the message

392
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:48,599
that the individual would live and proclaim.

393
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:50,679
And we can say, no, no, that doesn't line up

394
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:51,679
with the Word of God.

395
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,719
Or, that does line up with the Word of God

396
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:55,479
and amen, so be it.

397
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:56,919
But we find that it says here

398
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,320
that they tried them which say they are apostles

399
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,039
and are not.

400
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,400
And has found them liars.

401
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,559
Commendable.

402
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,520
And has borne and has patience.

403
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,880
And for My name's sake has labored

404
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,520
and has not fainted.

405
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,880
It's good to work for God, isn't it?

406
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
I mean, honestly.

407
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,400
Work for the night is coming.

408
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,520
I mean, we sing songs about working

409
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,119
and doing our best and serving God

410
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:27,520
with our talents and using our talents

411
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,799
for His honor and for His glory.

412
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:32,119
And it says that for My name's sake

413
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:36,239
thou hast labored and hast not fainted.

414
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:38,880
But notice the first word of v. 4.

415
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,799
Nevertheless, nevertheless,

416
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,919
I have somewhat against thee.

417
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,400
What does it say?

418
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,440
It says thou hast left thy first love.

419
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:59,119
Thou hast left thy first love.

420
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,119
God didn't leave them.

421
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:04,399
For them, they were busy about the work.

422
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:06,019
See, there are times in which

423
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:08,479
we can be more busy about the work

424
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:13,279
than being concerned about our time with God.

425
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,719
We get so busy doing and serving

426
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:19,119
and these things going on,

427
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:21,279
but we forget about that precious time

428
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,999
with our Savior.

429
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:30,099
And we forget the Master to Whom we serve.

430
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:33,099
Do you remember the account of Mary and Martha?

431
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:36,219
Martha is cumbered about with much serving.

432
00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:39,459
But Mary, she's at the feet of Jesus.

433
00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:43,739
And we find here that the Lord,

434
00:20:43,739 --> 00:20:47,099
as this first letter is given to the church at Ephesus,

435
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:49,419
He says, I have somewhat against thee.

436
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:53,819
Thou hast left thy first love.

437
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:54,879
And then it says this,

438
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,659
Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen

439
00:20:57,659 --> 00:21:01,019
and repent and do the first works

440
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:02,939
or else I will come unto thee quickly

441
00:21:02,939 --> 00:21:05,459
and will remove thy candlestick out of his place

442
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:08,159
except thou repent.

443
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,599
So we see the word here in verse number five

444
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:12,179
is repent, not return,

445
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,459
as we found there in Jeremiah

446
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:17,459
and in Lamentations and in Hosea.

447
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:20,659
But no doubt they're similar in their understanding.

448
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:22,979
A repentance carries with it

449
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:24,939
that idea of a turning away,

450
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:28,179
a turning from something to something,

451
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:30,779
turning from our ways to God's ways,

452
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:34,579
this change of mind which results in a change of direction.

453
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:38,459
And so we see that God says to the church at Ephesus,

454
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:42,339
you've left thy first love and therefore repent.

455
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:46,419
Jeremiah in Lamentations,

456
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:50,539
he says, turn thou us unto thee.

457
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:54,759
God didn't leave them and God doesn't leave us.

458
00:21:55,939 --> 00:22:00,939
It is the people of God that go astray.

459
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:05,779
My dad spent time over the summer

460
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:08,299
teaching from Psalm 23.

461
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:10,699
The Lord is my shepherd.

462
00:22:10,699 --> 00:22:14,139
And I'm so thankful that He's my shepherd.

463
00:22:14,139 --> 00:22:16,699
We know there's something about sheep.

464
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:20,259
Sometimes we wander astray.

465
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:23,899
We kind of see the pasture over yonder

466
00:22:23,899 --> 00:22:26,699
that seems to be appealing.

467
00:22:26,699 --> 00:22:28,739
We kind of get out of the fold, so to speak,

468
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:31,139
not understanding the dangers that lurk

469
00:22:31,139 --> 00:22:36,139
and understanding all that is needful for our survival.

470
00:22:36,139 --> 00:22:38,899
And we find at times,

471
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,099
the shepherd, physically speaking,

472
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:44,659
when you think about a shepherd and his sheep physically,

473
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:47,019
there are times in which a wandering sheep,

474
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:48,139
if they wander enough,

475
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:51,299
the shepherd sometimes will break a leg.

476
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:56,259
In order to prevent the continuous wandering.

477
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:58,619
And there are times in our lives

478
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:00,059
where God is just so gracious

479
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:01,979
to bring us back into the fold.

480
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:05,299
But we see that we have to turn thou us unto thee.

481
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:06,739
What a prayer.

482
00:23:06,739 --> 00:23:09,099
What a desire on the part of Jeremiah.

483
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:10,860
I hope that it would be our desire

484
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,940
that we'd say, God, I just want you.

485
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,379
Like we see with this quote from A.W. Tozer,

486
00:23:17,379 --> 00:23:19,220
I've tasted, remember David said,

487
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,539
taste and see that the Lord is good.

488
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:24,379
You're not gonna be disappointed.

489
00:23:24,379 --> 00:23:26,459
But we think about this turning

490
00:23:26,459 --> 00:23:28,419
that Jeremiah speaks of in Lamentations

491
00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:29,659
and he ends it with saying,

492
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:34,459
renew our days as of old.

493
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:38,580
That time of sweet fellowship and communion and blessing.

494
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,940
That's what we desire.

495
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,940
We desire Him, right?

496
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,819
The communion with Him.

497
00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:46,659
And then as we have in the fullness of His presence,

498
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:48,739
or in His presence, His fullness of joy,

499
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:50,659
that we have that joy and no doubt

500
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:52,619
the blessings will flow.

501
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:55,659
But just a desire, a thirst for God.

502
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:58,619
I want to want thee.

503
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:00,220
Man, that's powerful.

504
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,940
This evening, we think about the church in Ephesus.

505
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:09,739
Thou hast left thy first love.

506
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,940
You're busy about doing the work.

507
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,739
They're commended for a whole host of things.

508
00:24:14,739 --> 00:24:17,019
But you left your first love.

509
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:19,779
Sometimes it's interesting when you think about

510
00:24:19,779 --> 00:24:21,299
when we first got saved.

511
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,739
And maybe the excitement and the freshness of everything.

512
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,459
And again, if we're not careful,

513
00:24:29,459 --> 00:24:32,940
the pools of life, all of the various things

514
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,179
that would pull us in all sorts of directions,

515
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:40,619
we can just, without meaning to,

516
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:42,820
kind of drift away.

517
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:48,820
And oh, that we'd say, Lord, I don't want to drift.

518
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,699
I want to be in your presence.

519
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,899
Turn thou us unto thee.

520
00:24:54,899 --> 00:24:59,899
Help me to draw nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,

521
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:02,380
to thy precious bleeding side.

522
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,699
Oh, to be in the presence of God.

523
00:25:04,699 --> 00:25:05,540
What a blessing.

524
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,859
What a challenge from Lamentations chapter five.

525
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:11,419
I hope this evening we'll close in prayer in just a moment.

526
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:12,979
We'll go off of live stream.

527
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:16,660
And I hope that you'll spend some time in prayer tonight.

528
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,579
Not only praying over those things in the prayer list

529
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:22,500
and being mindful to pray one for another.

530
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,699
And I'm thankful that the Bible tells us

531
00:25:24,699 --> 00:25:27,579
that the effectual prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

532
00:25:27,579 --> 00:25:29,899
I'm thankful that God says, call unto me,

533
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:32,540
and I will answer thee and show thee great and mighty things

534
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,179
which thou knowest not.

535
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:36,139
And I want to encourage you tonight.

536
00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:37,660
When the live stream goes off,

537
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,940
if you would take some time, it's only 20 minutes to eight.

538
00:25:40,979 --> 00:25:43,699
You're normally here at least until 8.15 or 8.30

539
00:25:43,699 --> 00:25:45,820
before you leave and then you gotta drive home.

540
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,179
And I'm not suggesting that you need

541
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,579
to spend an hour in prayer,

542
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:51,380
but it wouldn't hurt you if you spent an hour in prayer.

543
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:00,139
The songwriter said, the sweet hour of prayer.

544
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:05,940
And someone noted that in 21st century Christianity,

545
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,220
we have exchanged the sweet hour of prayer

546
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,380
with just a little talk with Jesus.

547
00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:14,540
So I want to encourage you and challenge you tonight

548
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,579
to spend some time in prayer as a family.

549
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,299
If you're an individual, just by yourself,

550
00:26:19,299 --> 00:26:21,380
just get alone with God.

551
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,899
Yes, pray over the items in the prayer list,

552
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:26,380
but really if you would pray specifically

553
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,579
about this revival meeting,

554
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:29,260
pray that God does a work in your heart.

555
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,299
Maybe there's something specific that you want to pray about

556
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,739
that God would do in your heart and your life.

557
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:35,779
Pray that God would move in our midst.

558
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,739
I mentioned as I preached a couple of Sundays ago,

559
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:42,019
before you ever have a revival in the church,

560
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:43,179
you have a revival in the home.

561
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:45,179
How to have a home that honors the Lord.

562
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:47,459
Before you have a revival in the home,

563
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:48,899
you have a revival as an individual.

564
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,260
We want revival in our land,

565
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,019
but it starts with the individual.

566
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:54,779
And then the home and then the church

567
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,339
and then, man, it just spreads.

568
00:26:58,459 --> 00:26:59,660
And so I want to encourage you tonight.

569
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,619
We're going to close in prayer.

570
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,739
And if you would spend some extended period of time

571
00:27:03,739 --> 00:27:05,419
in prayer, I believe that God,

572
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:09,019
the Lord of heaven will honor that.

573
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:12,619
His hand is moved by the prayers of his people.

574
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:15,500
Father, we love you and we thank you for loving us.

575
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,820
Thank you for the opportunity to have a brief challenge

576
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,380
from your word tonight with regard to this prayer,

577
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:26,220
this plea of Jeremiah at the end of the book of Lamentations.

578
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,739
I'm thankful to be reminded of the eternality of God,

579
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:36,419
the holiness of God, the judgment that we see there,

580
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:38,380
but I'm thankful to be reminded of the mercy

581
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,139
and grace and loving kindness.

582
00:27:41,139 --> 00:27:46,139
Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned.

583
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,019
He asked for renewal as of the days of old.

584
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:55,019
God, I pray that you'd help us,

585
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,179
perhaps one, perhaps many,

586
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:03,019
if they would honestly evaluate their lives.

587
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:04,979
They've strayed, they've wandered.

588
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:09,459
We need to be drawn closer to thee.

589
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:14,100
It is good for me to draw near to thee, O God.

590
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,339
Return.

591
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:21,540
I pray that as we engage in prayer,

592
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,419
though we cannot all be here at the church house,

593
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:30,380
as we're in our locations, our homes, wherever we are,

594
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:35,020
we just spend some time seeking the face of God.

595
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:39,859
And we pray that you'd be pleased, honored, and glorified.

596
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:43,179
We pray that you'd work mightily in our midst

597
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:47,500
so that we would stand and simply be able to declare,

598
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,700
look what God did.

599
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:53,539
We'll be careful to give you the honor and glory

600
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:55,059
for all that you'll do.

601
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:57,859
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
