00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.039
five, Lamentations, chapter number five, and Jeremiah and then Lamentations.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.760
And I'll be looking at the fifth chapter this evening,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.220
really looking at the last several verses of Lamentations, chapter number five.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.799
As you know, contextually or historically,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.719
if you were to consider the time of the writing of the Book of Lamentations,

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:26.440
you would understand that God allowed the prophet Jeremiah

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.100
to not only pen the words to the Book of Jeremiah,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.940
but also to this book of Lamentations.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.020
The nation of Judah had been taken captive.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.479
We understand that he had used Jeremiah, along with a number of other prophets,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.540
in order to prophesy about the impending judgment,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.819
the Babylonian captivity because of the sin, the wickedness of God's people.

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:53.500
And we find that Jeremiah was warning of that impending judgment.

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:56.400
And the Book of Lamentations, obviously,

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:59.360
it's made obvious by the title of the book.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.860
It is a book of mourning and the word lamentation or lamentations here.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.080
It means to cry aloud.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.800
And you think about lamenting and you think about the just the destruction,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.919
utter destruction in Jerusalem and Judah because of the the sin of the people

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:23.099
and how God had raised up the Babylonians and just utter destruction

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.000
and reason to cry aloud, reason to lament.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.040
And thus we read of lamentations.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.720
And we'll look at these last few verses of Lamentations five

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.099
and make a few comments about three of the verses.

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:38.519
And then we'll fix our attention on verse number 21 this evening.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.059
But notice what the Bible says.

00:01:40.059 --> 00:01:42.220
Really, the book ends with a prayer.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.680
It says this in verse 19, Thou, O Lord,

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.279
remainest forever thy throne from generation to generation.

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:57.000
Wherefore, dost thou forget us forever and forsake us so long time?

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:02.959
Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned.

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:06.720
Renew our days as of old.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.220
But thou hast utterly rejected us.

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.360
Thou art very wroth against us.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.479
If we look at verse number 19, we find

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:21.679
that there is recognition on the part of Jeremiah

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.059
with regard to the eternality of God.

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:30.559
I'm thankful that our God is eternal, that thou remainest forever

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.160
thy throne from generation to generation.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.539
He will never be dethroned.

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:38.820
No one's ever going to conquer him.

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.320
He is king of kings, lord of lords.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.740
The great I am. He is eternal.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.580
And what a blessed thought.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.059
In verse number 19, we find it as we get to verse number 20

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:53.160
that really we are gaining insight as to the condition

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:57.059
of these that have just suffered greatly.

00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:00.160
And as Jeremiah is lamenting, he says, Wherefore,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.199
dost thou forget us forever and forsake us so long time?

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.619
Do you remember the psalmist as he would cry out, Lord, how long will you forget me?

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.419
And there are times, no doubt, as we deal with adversity

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:18.220
that we can feel just as the psalmist or just as Jeremiah would reference here.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.839
We'll look at 21 in more detail.

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:24.600
But notice in verse number 22, the Bible says, But thou hast utterly rejected us.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.940
Thou art very wroth against us.

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:32.100
I find here that there's a recognition of God's judgment

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:35.979
as a result of the sin of the people of God.

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:40.559
And it's interesting, as you were to look at this last few verses

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.500
of this passage of scripture, it ends really on a negative note

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.639
in verse number 22 about the judgment.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.720
And so oftentimes when the Jewish people would read

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.899
the book of Lamentations out loud and they would read it as a gathering,

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:00.600
they would repeat verse number 21 after verse number 22

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:03.979
and they would read it, they would conclude with verse number 22.

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:07.100
And then again, they would read verse number 21.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.660
And I think that's quite interesting to think about that perspective

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.119
and that they would do that.

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:15.779
And it really helps us to see the the impact

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:17.660
and the importance of verse number 21.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.920
Notice it says, Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord,

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.679
and we shall be turned.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.920
Renew our days as of old.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.380
If you're taking notes, I've titled the message tonight.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.140
Turn thou us unto thee.

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:40.019
Turn thou us unto thee.

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:46.640
A.W. Tozer said this, Oh, God, I have tasted thy goodness

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:49.679
and it has both satisfied me

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:53.239
and made me thirsty for more.

00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:57.700
I am painfully aware of my need of further grace.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.040
I am ashamed of my lack of desire.

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:06.000
Oh, God, I want to want thee.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.679
I long to be filled with longing.

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:15.760
I thirst to be made more thirsty still.

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:17.459
Isn't that wonderful?

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:21.519
You see a man that is so desiring of the presence of God

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.220
and so interested in having that sweet communion.

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:28.940
We spoke of that on Sunday morning, of that communion that we can enjoy.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.899
And we find that he says, I've tasted the goodness, A.W. Tozer.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.160
And he says, it satisfied me, but it's made me thirsty for more.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.959
And when you get into the presence of God and you enjoy that presence,

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:43.000
you say, I want more of this.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.040
I'm enjoying this, no doubt, as the psalmist said in Psalm 16,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.100
in his presence, his fullness of joy.

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:54.299
He says. I want to want thee.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.519
I long to be filled with longing.

00:05:57.519 --> 00:06:00.760
I thirst to be more thirsty still.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.959
I wonder tonight if we would agree with A.W.

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:07.000
Tozer and say, that's my prayer.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.559
I don't want just a little bit.

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:13.720
I want to have my cup filled and I want my cup to be running over.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.220
Amen. With the blessings of God, as we think about this statement

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.679
in verse number 21, turn thou us unto thee.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.359
And we look at the entirety of this verse as we notice here.

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:29.359
I believe that Jeremiah acknowledges that was the people of God

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.959
who had gone astray.

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:34.100
God did not move.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.880
God is constant.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.100
God is always the same, right?

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.260
He's never changes.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.640
He says that he is immutable.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.519
We find that he says, I am the Lord.

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:48.519
I change not in Malachi.

00:06:48.739 --> 00:06:52.359
We find that Hebrews reminds us Jesus Christ the same yesterday

00:06:52.359 --> 00:06:54.320
and today and forever.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.359
Our God changes not.

00:06:56.359 --> 00:06:58.959
God did not move.

00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:02.160
But we find that the children of Israel think about what Jeremiah says

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.799
when the indictment against the nation of Judah is given

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.799
really on a number of occasion throughout the book.

00:07:08.799 --> 00:07:13.239
But you find specifically as you read the opening chapters

00:07:13.239 --> 00:07:17.619
of the book of Jeremiah, you begin to read about this forgetting of God

00:07:17.619 --> 00:07:20.959
and this forsaking of God and this following of idols.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.299
And so if you think about the nation of Judah

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:26.600
and you think about the people of God, the children of Israel

00:07:26.799 --> 00:07:30.720
and how they had gone astray, they forgot their maker.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.440
They forgot the one that had done so much for them.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.119
And they forgot him.

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:40.679
The question is asked of how is it that this is kind of made

00:07:40.679 --> 00:07:42.959
forget her ornaments or a bride, her attire.

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:47.760
Yet my people have forgotten me days without number in Jeremiah two

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.200
in verse number thirty two.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.559
And they forgot the Lord.

00:07:50.559 --> 00:07:54.600
And as a result of forgetting God, they forsook the Lord

00:07:54.799 --> 00:07:59.519
and they were forsaking the Lord and they followed after these idols.

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:04.839
We understand that idolatry was a common problem for Israel.

00:08:04.839 --> 00:08:07.079
And then, of course, in Judah as well.

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:10.519
And we find that many times throughout the book of Jeremiah,

00:08:11.119 --> 00:08:16.079
the Bible will use the word about return or turning to it says this

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:19.959
in Jeremiah three in verse number twelve, go and proclaim these words

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.359
toward the north and say, return now backsliding Israel,

00:08:25.359 --> 00:08:29.239
sayeth the Lord, and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you.

00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:33.359
Notice this, for I am merciful, sayeth the Lord,

00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:36.559
and I will not keep anger forever.

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.559
Aren't you thankful that God is merciful?

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.640
And the reality is that as we see this prayer

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.599
that ends the book of lamentations in this statement in verse number

00:08:46.599 --> 00:08:50.799
twenty one, turn thou us unto thee, O Lord,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.960
and we shall be turned, renew our days as of old.

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:58.479
And so I believe that as we know that Jeremiah acknowledges

00:08:58.479 --> 00:09:00.919
that it was the people of God that had gone astray

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.440
and therefore he has this prayer here.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.799
And we notice, I would say from verse twenty one,

00:09:05.799 --> 00:09:08.039
that really there's a twofold aspect of it.

00:09:08.039 --> 00:09:12.320
First, as we see in the title, turn thou us unto thee.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.520
But then we find that the verse ends with this statement.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.719
Renew our days as of old.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.760
I believe that the thought that would be given to us here,

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.640
this idea of renewing, we speak about revival

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.479
and we speak about this need for us to have revival

00:09:29.479 --> 00:09:32.479
and this revival meeting that is coming up on our calendar.

00:09:32.479 --> 00:09:36.960
And I spent time on Sunday preaching about revival and how to be prepared,

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:41.400
how to be ready for revival and dealing with the importance

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.880
and looking at that subject on Sunday evening.

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:49.280
Joy is withered away and how that sin will rob us of our joy

00:09:49.479 --> 00:09:53.359
and how we need to forsake and confess and we need to have God,

00:09:53.359 --> 00:09:56.799
as David said, restore unto me the joy of thy salvation.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.119
I think about this prayer when he says renew our days.

00:10:00.119 --> 00:10:02.219
as of old, you can think back

00:10:02.219 --> 00:10:04.479
into the history of the nation of Israel

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:08.519
when they were enjoying the blessing of God.

00:10:08.519 --> 00:10:10.519
When they were enjoying the fellowship

00:10:10.519 --> 00:10:12.319
with their Maker.

00:10:12.319 --> 00:10:15.179
When they were enjoying that fellowship

00:10:15.179 --> 00:10:17.479
that God had designed for them to have.

00:10:17.479 --> 00:10:19.439
And so I think if we could take

00:10:19.439 --> 00:10:22.279
the prayer of Jeremiah here

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:24.359
in Lamentations 5 and verse 21

00:10:24.359 --> 00:10:27.679
and perhaps make some application

00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:29.039
for us this evening,

00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:32.519
and we find that we are to turn unto Thee.

00:10:32.519 --> 00:10:35.959
Turn Thou us unto Thee.

00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:40.999
But then he says renew our days as of old.

00:10:40.999 --> 00:10:42.639
If we can find in our minds

00:10:42.639 --> 00:10:44.799
a time in our lives in which we enjoyed

00:10:44.799 --> 00:10:46.719
that sweet communion with the Lord,

00:10:46.719 --> 00:10:48.759
that sweet fellowship with God,

00:10:48.759 --> 00:10:50.479
and we say that's what I long for.

00:10:50.479 --> 00:10:52.119
That's what I thirst for.

00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:53.839
And maybe things have gotten stale

00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:55.319
in your life and my life.

00:10:55.319 --> 00:10:57.959
Maybe the monotony of life

00:10:58.079 --> 00:10:59.519
has just kind of crept in

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:02.439
and we say no, I wanna have like it was

00:11:02.439 --> 00:11:04.319
in those days of old.

00:11:04.319 --> 00:11:06.119
I want you to think about what Hosea says.

00:11:06.119 --> 00:11:08.639
Turn over if you will to the book of Hosea.

00:11:08.639 --> 00:11:10.479
Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea.

00:11:10.479 --> 00:11:12.879
Look over there to Hosea if you will.

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:15.039
And I wanna just share a few verses of scripture

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:17.039
and then we're gonna run to the New Testament

00:11:17.039 --> 00:11:18.659
and then finish up this evening.

00:11:18.659 --> 00:11:21.519
I had planned to preach a shorter message tonight

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:24.919
so that we could spend an extended time of prayer.

00:11:24.919 --> 00:11:26.999
And the message will still be

00:11:26.999 --> 00:11:29.199
about as short as it was going to be,

00:11:29.199 --> 00:11:31.359
maybe a few minutes longer.

00:11:31.359 --> 00:11:32.839
But you don't have to drive home

00:11:32.839 --> 00:11:34.239
and so therefore you can spend

00:11:34.239 --> 00:11:36.479
a real extended amount of time in prayer.

00:11:36.479 --> 00:11:38.479
And so that is a blessing.

00:11:38.479 --> 00:11:41.159
But I want you to notice in Hosea chapter five,

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:44.039
I'm gonna read four verses throughout the book of Hosea

00:11:44.039 --> 00:11:47.399
just with this idea of turning or returning.

00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:50.639
Notice what it says in Hosea five in verse 15.

00:11:50.639 --> 00:11:54.199
I will go and return to my place

00:11:54.199 --> 00:11:56.879
till they acknowledge their offense and seek my face.

00:11:57.719 --> 00:11:59.159
And in their affliction they will seek me early.

00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:01.839
See the idea, remember we talked about on Sunday night

00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:03.399
about all of that affliction

00:12:03.399 --> 00:12:05.159
and all of that stuff that was happening

00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:08.279
and how for all of this they did not turn.

00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:10.259
Yet for all of this they return not.

00:12:10.259 --> 00:12:13.619
Remember as I mentioned in the book of Amos

00:12:13.619 --> 00:12:16.339
in the fourth chapter after famine and drought

00:12:16.339 --> 00:12:18.720
and blight and pestilence and destruction

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.239
that God says, yet have ye not returned unto me,

00:12:22.239 --> 00:12:23.479
saith the Lord.

00:12:23.479 --> 00:12:25.720
And so we find that the end of verse number 15

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:30.080
says that in their affliction they will seek me early.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.839
And really that's the design.

00:12:31.839 --> 00:12:34.299
God is a gracious, loving God.

00:12:34.299 --> 00:12:35.639
We understand the Bible says

00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:37.559
whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth.

00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:40.199
And we find that he's trying to bring us back

00:12:40.199 --> 00:12:43.159
into that loving fellowship with him,

00:12:43.159 --> 00:12:45.659
that sweet communion with him.

00:12:45.659 --> 00:12:48.419
We find that the beginning of chapter number six,

00:12:48.419 --> 00:12:49.679
look at verse number one.

00:12:49.679 --> 00:12:53.239
Come and let us return unto the Lord.

00:12:53.239 --> 00:12:55.159
For he hath torn and he will heal us.

00:12:55.159 --> 00:12:59.679
And he hath smitten and he will bind us up.

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:03.259
Aren't you thankful that we can return to the Lord?

00:13:03.259 --> 00:13:05.879
Turn thou us unto thee.

00:13:05.879 --> 00:13:08.159
Notice in chapter number 12,

00:13:08.159 --> 00:13:09.799
just a few more pages over

00:13:09.799 --> 00:13:13.319
and look at the sixth verse.

00:13:13.319 --> 00:13:15.919
The remedy for all this turmoil

00:13:15.919 --> 00:13:17.879
that they're dealing with.

00:13:17.879 --> 00:13:21.519
The Bible says this in verse number six of Hosea 12,

00:13:21.679 --> 00:13:26.599
Therefore, turn thou to thy God.

00:13:26.599 --> 00:13:28.759
Keep mercy and judgment

00:13:28.759 --> 00:13:32.559
and wait on thy God continually.

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:35.000
It seems pretty simple, doesn't it?

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.919
I mean, you just notice the remedy

00:13:36.919 --> 00:13:38.319
for all that's taken place

00:13:38.319 --> 00:13:40.679
and all the desolation

00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:42.599
and all the distress.

00:13:42.599 --> 00:13:44.839
And he says, therefore,

00:13:44.839 --> 00:13:47.799
turn thou to thy God.

00:13:47.799 --> 00:13:49.440
Keep mercy and judgment

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.319
and wait on thy God continually.

00:13:52.319 --> 00:13:54.440
It's interesting as you study

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.239
through the book of Hosea,

00:13:57.239 --> 00:13:58.759
and I know I went over there

00:13:58.759 --> 00:13:59.879
to chapter number 12,

00:13:59.879 --> 00:14:01.679
but if you look back just for a moment

00:14:01.679 --> 00:14:03.080
to chapter number 7,

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.239
and there's not really mention here

00:14:05.239 --> 00:14:07.399
about returning except for it says

00:14:07.399 --> 00:14:09.720
that they do not return to the Lord their God,

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.279
but it really is a situation

00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:13.319
where they don't even know

00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:17.079
how bad their condition is.

00:14:17.079 --> 00:14:19.559
So there's this thing of self-deception.

00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:22.040
The Bible says that we're to be doers of the Word,

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.839
not hearers only, deceiving our own selves.

00:14:24.839 --> 00:14:27.359
The Bible says the deceitfulness of sin

00:14:27.359 --> 00:14:28.760
in the book of Hebrews,

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.359
and so we notice that deceit.

00:14:30.359 --> 00:14:31.799
But notice in verse number 9,

00:14:31.799 --> 00:14:35.919
it says, strangers have devoured His strength,

00:14:35.919 --> 00:14:37.479
and He knoweth it not.

00:14:37.479 --> 00:14:40.519
Yea, gray hairs are here and there upon Him,

00:14:40.519 --> 00:14:43.760
yet He knoweth not.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.199
And the pride of Israel testifieth to His face.

00:14:46.279 --> 00:14:47.320
Notice this,

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.440
and they do not return to the Lord their God,

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:56.239
nor seek Him for all this.

00:14:56.239 --> 00:14:59.119
After the destruction,

00:14:59.119 --> 00:15:01.559
the hand of the Babylonians,

00:15:01.559 --> 00:15:04.160
as Jerusalem lay waste,

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.000
we read the book of Lamentations,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.679
and you read the crying aloud.

00:15:08.679 --> 00:15:11.639
You read the lamenting of Jeremiah.

00:15:11.639 --> 00:15:13.119
And as you end the book

00:15:13.119 --> 00:15:14.880
and you come to that fifth chapter

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.639
and you read that plea,

00:15:17.639 --> 00:15:20.559
that petition, that prayer,

00:15:20.559 --> 00:15:21.720
you find that He says,

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:27.239
turn thou us unto Thee, O Lord.

00:15:27.239 --> 00:15:28.239
And He says this,

00:15:28.239 --> 00:15:30.440
and we shall be turned.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.399
And then He says renew our days as of old.

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:35.160
One last verse in the book of Hosea,

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.880
chapter 14 and verse 1,

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.919
it says, O Israel,

00:15:38.919 --> 00:15:41.799
return unto the Lord thy God,

00:15:41.799 --> 00:15:49.600
for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.519
We find that in life,

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:53.839
there are many things that will pull us

00:15:53.839 --> 00:15:58.399
in many different directions.

00:15:58.399 --> 00:16:01.799
We may just get off just a degree or two,

00:16:01.799 --> 00:16:03.359
but after a while of being off

00:16:03.359 --> 00:16:04.479
just a degree or two

00:16:04.479 --> 00:16:05.600
and going far enough,

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.440
you find that that distance of separation

00:16:08.479 --> 00:16:12.679
has increased exponentially.

00:16:12.679 --> 00:16:14.440
And I find this need for us

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.799
even as the prophets would cry out

00:16:17.799 --> 00:16:19.880
for this turning to God.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.559
It's interesting that the first song

00:16:21.559 --> 00:16:22.839
that we sang this evening,

00:16:22.839 --> 00:16:25.720
Draw Me Nearer,

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.679
this idea of being near to God,

00:16:27.679 --> 00:16:28.959
this fellowship with God.

00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:30.880
I want you to turn to the book of Revelation

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.000
as we close tonight.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.079
I want you to think about

00:16:33.079 --> 00:16:34.519
this New Testament principle.

00:16:34.519 --> 00:16:39.519
Revelation 2.

00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:40.679
The book of Revelation,

00:16:40.679 --> 00:16:41.919
these couple of chapters,

00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:42.919
chapters 2 and 3,

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:45.000
we read of course of the letters

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.239
to the churches in Asia.

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:50.160
And we read about the many things

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.639
that God has to say about these churches.

00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:56.279
And it's interesting that

00:16:56.279 --> 00:16:58.639
these are real churches that exist.

00:16:58.639 --> 00:17:00.399
They're real churches.

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:01.600
And we find the first one

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.959
is the church at Ephesus.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.519
We of course are mindful

00:17:04.519 --> 00:17:05.600
as you read the book of Acts

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.279
of being able to read through

00:17:07.279 --> 00:17:09.040
and see the time and ministry

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.959
that Paul spent in Ephesus.

00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:12.880
And then, you also have the privilege

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.559
of reading the book of Ephesians

00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:16.040
and being able to get insight

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.760
as to the instruction that was provided.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.239
And we find that the church at Ephesus

00:17:21.239 --> 00:17:23.959
is the first church that's addressed here

00:17:23.959 --> 00:17:25.359
out of these seven letters.

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:26.959
And it says this in verse 1,

00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:30.760
unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write,

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.839
these things saith he that holdeth

00:17:32.839 --> 00:17:35.399
the seven stars in his right hand,

00:17:35.399 --> 00:17:36.839
who walketh in the midst

00:17:36.839 --> 00:17:39.559
of the seven golden candlesticks.

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.720
Notice, he says, I know thy works.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.799
You know, God knows everything about us.

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:45.799
He knows everything.

00:17:45.799 --> 00:17:48.839
He's the omniscient God.

00:17:48.839 --> 00:17:52.559
I know thy works and thy labor

00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:55.000
and thy patience,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.239
and how thou canst not bear them

00:17:57.239 --> 00:17:59.079
which are evil.

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:00.359
And thou hast tried them

00:18:00.359 --> 00:18:03.040
which say they are apostles and are not,

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.160
and hast found them liars.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.880
I mean, that's commendable, is it not?

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.279
They can't bear evil.

00:18:10.279 --> 00:18:12.839
They don't have any interest in corruption

00:18:12.839 --> 00:18:14.799
within the house of God.

00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:16.600
And we're going to separate.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.399
We're going to walk and live wholly.

00:18:19.399 --> 00:18:21.519
It's important.

00:18:21.519 --> 00:18:22.839
He says, thou hast tried them

00:18:22.839 --> 00:18:24.160
which say they are apostles.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.199
You understand that in the first century,

00:18:26.199 --> 00:18:29.079
they had difficulties with people coming in

00:18:29.119 --> 00:18:30.479
and these false teachers.

00:18:30.479 --> 00:18:33.119
And we still have that today.

00:18:33.119 --> 00:18:35.200
I'm thankful that we have the whole canon of Scripture.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.559
We have the whole Word of God.

00:18:36.559 --> 00:18:38.359
And as we're told in the book of 1 John,

00:18:38.359 --> 00:18:40.119
that we're to try the spirits.

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:42.080
And we have the Scriptures

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.200
that are the authority that we can use

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.279
and we can evaluate the message

00:18:46.279 --> 00:18:48.599
that the individual would live and proclaim.

00:18:48.599 --> 00:18:50.679
And we can say, no, no, that doesn't line up

00:18:50.679 --> 00:18:51.679
with the Word of God.

00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:53.719
Or, that does line up with the Word of God

00:18:53.719 --> 00:18:55.479
and amen, so be it.

00:18:55.479 --> 00:18:56.919
But we find that it says here

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.320
that they tried them which say they are apostles

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.039
and are not.

00:19:02.039 --> 00:19:04.400
And has found them liars.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.559
Commendable.

00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:09.520
And has borne and has patience.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.880
And for My name's sake has labored

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.520
and has not fainted.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.880
It's good to work for God, isn't it?

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:17.880
I mean, honestly.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.400
Work for the night is coming.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.520
I mean, we sing songs about working

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.119
and doing our best and serving God

00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:27.520
with our talents and using our talents

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.799
for His honor and for His glory.

00:19:29.799 --> 00:19:32.119
And it says that for My name's sake

00:19:32.119 --> 00:19:36.239
thou hast labored and hast not fainted.

00:19:36.239 --> 00:19:38.880
But notice the first word of v. 4.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.799
Nevertheless, nevertheless,

00:19:42.799 --> 00:19:46.919
I have somewhat against thee.

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:48.400
What does it say?

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:53.440
It says thou hast left thy first love.

00:19:55.559 --> 00:19:59.119
Thou hast left thy first love.

00:19:59.119 --> 00:20:00.119
God didn't leave them.

00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:04.399
For them, they were busy about the work.

00:20:04.399 --> 00:20:06.019
See, there are times in which

00:20:06.019 --> 00:20:08.479
we can be more busy about the work

00:20:08.479 --> 00:20:13.279
than being concerned about our time with God.

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:16.719
We get so busy doing and serving

00:20:16.719 --> 00:20:19.119
and these things going on,

00:20:19.119 --> 00:20:21.279
but we forget about that precious time

00:20:21.279 --> 00:20:23.999
with our Savior.

00:20:23.999 --> 00:20:30.099
And we forget the Master to Whom we serve.

00:20:30.099 --> 00:20:33.099
Do you remember the account of Mary and Martha?

00:20:33.099 --> 00:20:36.219
Martha is cumbered about with much serving.

00:20:36.219 --> 00:20:39.459
But Mary, she's at the feet of Jesus.

00:20:39.459 --> 00:20:43.739
And we find here that the Lord,

00:20:43.739 --> 00:20:47.099
as this first letter is given to the church at Ephesus,

00:20:47.099 --> 00:20:49.419
He says, I have somewhat against thee.

00:20:49.419 --> 00:20:53.819
Thou hast left thy first love.

00:20:53.819 --> 00:20:54.879
And then it says this,

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:57.659
Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen

00:20:57.659 --> 00:21:01.019
and repent and do the first works

00:21:01.019 --> 00:21:02.939
or else I will come unto thee quickly

00:21:02.939 --> 00:21:05.459
and will remove thy candlestick out of his place

00:21:05.459 --> 00:21:08.159
except thou repent.

00:21:08.159 --> 00:21:10.599
So we see the word here in verse number five

00:21:10.599 --> 00:21:12.179
is repent, not return,

00:21:12.179 --> 00:21:14.459
as we found there in Jeremiah

00:21:14.459 --> 00:21:17.459
and in Lamentations and in Hosea.

00:21:17.459 --> 00:21:20.659
But no doubt they're similar in their understanding.

00:21:20.659 --> 00:21:22.979
A repentance carries with it

00:21:22.979 --> 00:21:24.939
that idea of a turning away,

00:21:24.979 --> 00:21:28.179
a turning from something to something,

00:21:28.179 --> 00:21:30.779
turning from our ways to God's ways,

00:21:30.779 --> 00:21:34.579
this change of mind which results in a change of direction.

00:21:34.579 --> 00:21:38.459
And so we see that God says to the church at Ephesus,

00:21:38.459 --> 00:21:42.339
you've left thy first love and therefore repent.

00:21:44.419 --> 00:21:46.419
Jeremiah in Lamentations,

00:21:46.419 --> 00:21:50.539
he says, turn thou us unto thee.

00:21:50.539 --> 00:21:54.759
God didn't leave them and God doesn't leave us.

00:21:55.939 --> 00:22:00.939
It is the people of God that go astray.

00:22:03.219 --> 00:22:05.779
My dad spent time over the summer

00:22:05.779 --> 00:22:08.299
teaching from Psalm 23.

00:22:08.299 --> 00:22:10.699
The Lord is my shepherd.

00:22:10.699 --> 00:22:14.139
And I'm so thankful that He's my shepherd.

00:22:14.139 --> 00:22:16.699
We know there's something about sheep.

00:22:16.699 --> 00:22:20.259
Sometimes we wander astray.

00:22:20.259 --> 00:22:23.899
We kind of see the pasture over yonder

00:22:23.899 --> 00:22:26.699
that seems to be appealing.

00:22:26.699 --> 00:22:28.739
We kind of get out of the fold, so to speak,

00:22:28.739 --> 00:22:31.139
not understanding the dangers that lurk

00:22:31.139 --> 00:22:36.139
and understanding all that is needful for our survival.

00:22:36.139 --> 00:22:38.899
And we find at times,

00:22:38.899 --> 00:22:42.099
the shepherd, physically speaking,

00:22:42.099 --> 00:22:44.659
when you think about a shepherd and his sheep physically,

00:22:44.659 --> 00:22:47.019
there are times in which a wandering sheep,

00:22:47.019 --> 00:22:48.139
if they wander enough,

00:22:48.139 --> 00:22:51.299
the shepherd sometimes will break a leg.

00:22:52.139 --> 00:22:56.259
In order to prevent the continuous wandering.

00:22:57.259 --> 00:22:58.619
And there are times in our lives

00:22:58.619 --> 00:23:00.059
where God is just so gracious

00:23:00.059 --> 00:23:01.979
to bring us back into the fold.

00:23:01.979 --> 00:23:05.299
But we see that we have to turn thou us unto thee.

00:23:05.299 --> 00:23:06.739
What a prayer.

00:23:06.739 --> 00:23:09.099
What a desire on the part of Jeremiah.

00:23:09.099 --> 00:23:10.860
I hope that it would be our desire

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.940
that we'd say, God, I just want you.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.379
Like we see with this quote from A.W. Tozer,

00:23:17.379 --> 00:23:19.220
I've tasted, remember David said,

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.539
taste and see that the Lord is good.

00:23:22.459 --> 00:23:24.379
You're not gonna be disappointed.

00:23:24.379 --> 00:23:26.459
But we think about this turning

00:23:26.459 --> 00:23:28.419
that Jeremiah speaks of in Lamentations

00:23:28.419 --> 00:23:29.659
and he ends it with saying,

00:23:29.659 --> 00:23:34.459
renew our days as of old.

00:23:34.459 --> 00:23:38.580
That time of sweet fellowship and communion and blessing.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:39.940
That's what we desire.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.940
We desire Him, right?

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.819
The communion with Him.

00:23:43.819 --> 00:23:46.659
And then as we have in the fullness of His presence,

00:23:46.659 --> 00:23:48.739
or in His presence, His fullness of joy,

00:23:48.779 --> 00:23:50.659
that we have that joy and no doubt

00:23:50.659 --> 00:23:52.619
the blessings will flow.

00:23:52.619 --> 00:23:55.659
But just a desire, a thirst for God.

00:23:55.659 --> 00:23:58.619
I want to want thee.

00:23:58.619 --> 00:24:00.220
Man, that's powerful.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:06.940
This evening, we think about the church in Ephesus.

00:24:07.019 --> 00:24:09.739
Thou hast left thy first love.

00:24:09.739 --> 00:24:11.940
You're busy about doing the work.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.739
They're commended for a whole host of things.

00:24:14.739 --> 00:24:17.019
But you left your first love.

00:24:17.019 --> 00:24:19.779
Sometimes it's interesting when you think about

00:24:19.779 --> 00:24:21.299
when we first got saved.

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:25.739
And maybe the excitement and the freshness of everything.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.459
And again, if we're not careful,

00:24:29.459 --> 00:24:32.940
the pools of life, all of the various things

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.179
that would pull us in all sorts of directions,

00:24:36.179 --> 00:24:40.619
we can just, without meaning to,

00:24:40.619 --> 00:24:42.820
kind of drift away.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:48.820
And oh, that we'd say, Lord, I don't want to drift.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.699
I want to be in your presence.

00:24:52.699 --> 00:24:54.899
Turn thou us unto thee.

00:24:54.899 --> 00:24:59.899
Help me to draw nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,

00:24:59.899 --> 00:25:02.380
to thy precious bleeding side.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.699
Oh, to be in the presence of God.

00:25:04.699 --> 00:25:05.540
What a blessing.

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.859
What a challenge from Lamentations chapter five.

00:25:08.859 --> 00:25:11.419
I hope this evening we'll close in prayer in just a moment.

00:25:11.419 --> 00:25:12.979
We'll go off of live stream.

00:25:12.979 --> 00:25:16.660
And I hope that you'll spend some time in prayer tonight.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:19.579
Not only praying over those things in the prayer list

00:25:19.579 --> 00:25:22.500
and being mindful to pray one for another.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.699
And I'm thankful that the Bible tells us

00:25:24.699 --> 00:25:27.579
that the effectual prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

00:25:27.579 --> 00:25:29.899
I'm thankful that God says, call unto me,

00:25:29.899 --> 00:25:32.540
and I will answer thee and show thee great and mighty things

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.179
which thou knowest not.

00:25:34.179 --> 00:25:36.139
And I want to encourage you tonight.

00:25:36.139 --> 00:25:37.660
When the live stream goes off,

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.940
if you would take some time, it's only 20 minutes to eight.

00:25:40.979 --> 00:25:43.699
You're normally here at least until 8.15 or 8.30

00:25:43.699 --> 00:25:45.820
before you leave and then you gotta drive home.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.179
And I'm not suggesting that you need

00:25:47.179 --> 00:25:48.579
to spend an hour in prayer,

00:25:48.579 --> 00:25:51.380
but it wouldn't hurt you if you spent an hour in prayer.

00:25:57.419 --> 00:26:00.139
The songwriter said, the sweet hour of prayer.

00:26:01.339 --> 00:26:05.940
And someone noted that in 21st century Christianity,

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.220
we have exchanged the sweet hour of prayer

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.380
with just a little talk with Jesus.

00:26:11.899 --> 00:26:14.540
So I want to encourage you and challenge you tonight

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.579
to spend some time in prayer as a family.

00:26:17.619 --> 00:26:19.299
If you're an individual, just by yourself,

00:26:19.299 --> 00:26:21.380
just get alone with God.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.899
Yes, pray over the items in the prayer list,

00:26:23.899 --> 00:26:26.380
but really if you would pray specifically

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.579
about this revival meeting,

00:26:27.579 --> 00:26:29.260
pray that God does a work in your heart.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.299
Maybe there's something specific that you want to pray about

00:26:31.299 --> 00:26:33.739
that God would do in your heart and your life.

00:26:33.739 --> 00:26:35.779
Pray that God would move in our midst.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.739
I mentioned as I preached a couple of Sundays ago,

00:26:39.179 --> 00:26:42.019
before you ever have a revival in the church,

00:26:42.019 --> 00:26:43.179
you have a revival in the home.

00:26:43.179 --> 00:26:45.179
How to have a home that honors the Lord.

00:26:46.139 --> 00:26:47.459
Before you have a revival in the home,

00:26:47.459 --> 00:26:48.899
you have a revival as an individual.

00:26:48.899 --> 00:26:50.260
We want revival in our land,

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:52.019
but it starts with the individual.

00:26:53.059 --> 00:26:54.779
And then the home and then the church

00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:57.339
and then, man, it just spreads.

00:26:58.459 --> 00:26:59.660
And so I want to encourage you tonight.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:01.619
We're going to close in prayer.

00:27:01.619 --> 00:27:03.739
And if you would spend some extended period of time

00:27:03.739 --> 00:27:05.419
in prayer, I believe that God,

00:27:05.579 --> 00:27:09.019
the Lord of heaven will honor that.

00:27:09.019 --> 00:27:12.619
His hand is moved by the prayers of his people.

00:27:12.619 --> 00:27:15.500
Father, we love you and we thank you for loving us.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.820
Thank you for the opportunity to have a brief challenge

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.380
from your word tonight with regard to this prayer,

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:26.220
this plea of Jeremiah at the end of the book of Lamentations.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.739
I'm thankful to be reminded of the eternality of God,

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:36.419
the holiness of God, the judgment that we see there,

00:27:36.419 --> 00:27:38.380
but I'm thankful to be reminded of the mercy

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.139
and grace and loving kindness.

00:27:41.139 --> 00:27:46.139
Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned.

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:51.019
He asked for renewal as of the days of old.

00:27:52.859 --> 00:27:55.019
God, I pray that you'd help us,

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.179
perhaps one, perhaps many,

00:27:59.779 --> 00:28:03.019
if they would honestly evaluate their lives.

00:28:03.019 --> 00:28:04.979
They've strayed, they've wandered.

00:28:06.419 --> 00:28:09.459
We need to be drawn closer to thee.

00:28:09.459 --> 00:28:14.100
It is good for me to draw near to thee, O God.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:16.339
Return.

00:28:17.579 --> 00:28:21.540
I pray that as we engage in prayer,

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.419
though we cannot all be here at the church house,

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:30.380
as we're in our locations, our homes, wherever we are,

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:35.020
we just spend some time seeking the face of God.

00:28:36.339 --> 00:28:39.859
And we pray that you'd be pleased, honored, and glorified.

00:28:40.859 --> 00:28:43.179
We pray that you'd work mightily in our midst

00:28:44.339 --> 00:28:47.500
so that we would stand and simply be able to declare,

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:50.700
look what God did.

00:28:51.859 --> 00:28:53.539
We'll be careful to give you the honor and glory

00:28:54.059 --> 00:28:55.059
for all that you'll do.

00:28:55.059 --> 00:28:57.859
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
