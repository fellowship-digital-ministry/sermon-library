1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,639
I am thankful for God's Word and thankful for the truth that God has given us in His

2
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:11,720
Word and the guidance that He certainly provides us with, Joshua chapter 24.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,200
And let me say this as we get into the message this morning, the purpose of preaching goes

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,920
beyond simply dispensing information.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,840
And if we look at the idea, if we have the idea of preaching that it's just simply dispensing

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,700
information, we are wrong.

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,020
We have missed it.

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:37,419
Now obviously, as God's Word is preached and taught, we ought to be giving truth and dispensing

9
00:00:37,419 --> 00:00:39,419
information.

10
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:44,979
But ultimately, the preaching of God's Word should bring God's people to a place of decision.

11
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:46,619
And that is the purpose of it.

12
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:50,860
It's not just so that we can have our minds filled with information and facts, if you

13
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,740
will, so that we might be able to win some Bible quiz or so that we might be able to

14
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,259
do well at some Bible trivia game.

15
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,180
That's not the idea.

16
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:07,620
The idea ultimately is that we as God's people would align our lives with the truth of God's

17
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,919
Word.

18
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:10,059
Let me say this.

19
00:01:10,059 --> 00:01:15,099
It's not enough to simply respond to preaching by saying something like this, that was a

20
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:17,139
good message.

21
00:01:17,139 --> 00:01:24,059
And it needs to go far beyond just being able to acknowledge from an intellectual perspective

22
00:01:24,059 --> 00:01:27,180
that perhaps there was a good message that was given.

23
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,819
The goal, as I mentioned a moment ago, is that we would apply the truth in our lives.

24
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:36,220
So as we look at the truth of preaching and we think about the preaching that we've heard

25
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,699
in the last week, if you were here for all of the services of the Revival Meeting, you

26
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:42,620
heard six messages.

27
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,019
And I wonder, as we think about the Revival Meeting, as we think about every week that

28
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:54,620
we come to church, that we ask ourselves this question, how did I respond to what I heard?

29
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,739
What was it that God spoke to me about?

30
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,620
That's why we have prayer time before our service.

31
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:06,019
One of the reasons is because of the desire that we would say, God, I want you to work

32
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:12,100
in my life today, I want you to teach me something, to show me something, to reveal something in

33
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,740
my life that I need to stop doing or something I need to begin to do, and we have that time.

34
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,059
Of course, we understand that the Lord Jesus Christ, that His house should be a house of

35
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:26,699
prayer, and a couple of years ago I was deeply convicted over the fact that so often in our

36
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:29,860
services we would use prayer basically as bookends.

37
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,300
We open a service in prayer and ask God to bless, and we close a service in prayer and

38
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:41,100
thank God for blessing, and we needed to have some time that was designated to prayer and

39
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,179
asking God to work in our hearts personally.

40
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:50,059
And so as we have that time, it's God in these next moments as we sing, prepare my heart,

41
00:02:50,059 --> 00:02:54,940
but as we open your word, speak to me and help me to understand what it is that you

42
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,580
have for me personally.

43
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,300
I could say this, not only is how should we respond, but what choices did I make?

44
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,500
Did I make any choices when I heard the preaching of God's word?

45
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,179
Was I brought to a place of decision?

46
00:03:09,179 --> 00:03:13,259
As we look at the final three chapters of the book of Joshua, we find that God records

47
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:17,259
for us three messages that Joshua delivers.

48
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:22,699
In Joshua chapter number 22 specifically, we find that that message in Joshua 22 is

49
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:25,699
delivered to the two and a half tribes.

50
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:31,899
You'll recall from your Bible study and reading that those two and a half tribes, they spoke

51
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:37,100
to Moses and asked if they could have the inheritance on the eastern side of the Jordan

52
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,779
River, and as they sought the face of God, as Moses prayed about and sought God's counsel,

53
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:47,339
we find that those two and a half tribes, they were given that as their inheritance,

54
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:53,580
but they had the responsibility to go with their brethren to enter into the land of Canaan

55
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,899
to fight with them as they would conquer the land, and we find that they did.

56
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:03,820
They fulfilled their responsibility, and in Joshua 22, they're going to return back to

57
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:09,740
the land of their inheritance, and we find that Joshua addresses them specifically.

58
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:16,660
In Joshua chapter 23, we find another message that is delivered from Joshua specifically

59
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,660
in that portion of scripture.

60
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:23,299
It's to the leaders of the tribes of Israel, and we find that in Joshua 23, that's who

61
00:04:23,299 --> 00:04:27,500
he's specifically addressing, but we come to the 24th chapter, the chapter in which

62
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,700
we'll be looking at this morning as we seek to look at this really a well-known passage

63
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:38,859
of scripture, but we find that in Joshua 24 that Joshua is addressing the people of God,

64
00:04:38,859 --> 00:04:40,100
the people of Israel.

65
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,160
Notice in verse number one, and Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem and called

66
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,779
for the elders of Israel and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers,

67
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:57,940
and they presented themselves before God, and Joshua said unto all the people, notice

68
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:04,160
what he says, thus saith the Lord God of Israel, so this is not Joshua just delivering a message

69
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,940
of opinion of that which he thought that they needed.

70
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,779
He's giving them what God had for them.

71
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:15,140
He says, your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the

72
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,260
father of Abraham and the father of Nacor, and they served other gods, and we find that

73
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,859
as he continues down, we're going to skip down through and look at this message that

74
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:32,559
he, Joshua, would deliver to these people, and notice in verse 14, he says, now therefore,

75
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:38,339
after he's presented the truth in verses two through 13, he says, now therefore, fear the

76
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:46,339
Lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers served

77
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:52,260
on the other side of the flood and in Egypt, and serve ye the Lord.

78
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:57,739
Verse 15, a very, very well-known verse of scripture, at least a portion of it, the Bible

79
00:05:57,739 --> 00:06:03,820
says in it, if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, notice, choose you this day whom

80
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,940
you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side

81
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:13,459
of the flood or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell, but as for me and my

82
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:18,220
house, we will serve the Lord.

83
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,859
The people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other

84
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:26,739
gods, we'll look further into the chapter as we get through the message this morning,

85
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:31,940
but we find that really, that latter part of verse number 15 is a very well-known phrase

86
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:37,239
of scripture, in fact, many of you probably have something within your house that may

87
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,959
have this portion of scripture on it, but as for me and my house, we will serve the

88
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,880
Lord.

89
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:49,839
As we look at this portion of scripture this morning, and really, as we leave the revival

90
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,799
meeting that we just had, and all of those truths just really fresh on our minds, I've

91
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:58,179
titled the message this morning, The Choice is Yours.

92
00:06:58,179 --> 00:06:59,359
The Choice is Yours.

93
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:04,440
Again, as we understand the true purpose of preaching is not simply to dispense information

94
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,720
or facts, but it's to bring God's people to a place of decision.

95
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,920
And as we go through God's word daily in our lives, as we seek and read the Bible, as we're

96
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,640
seeking the face of God, every day of our lives, we ought to ask ourselves the question,

97
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,420
what does God have for me?

98
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,920
What is God showing me?

99
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,179
How do I respond this morning or this evening, whenever it is that you might read the Bible

100
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:31,700
personally, to what God is showing me?

101
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:37,220
As we gather in the house of God for the purpose of worship, we say, God, we want you to speak

102
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,140
to us as individuals, and then we have a choice, we have a choice.

103
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,100
Why do we have an invitation at the end of our service?

104
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,059
We have an invitation to give you an opportunity to respond.

105
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:51,579
You don't have to come to an old-fashioned altar to respond to the preaching of God's

106
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:55,980
word, but we do not want to just have a final amen and then everything's just gone and we

107
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,179
run out and everything.

108
00:07:57,179 --> 00:08:03,339
No, we want to reflect upon what we've heard and respond to what God's done in our lives.

109
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:05,980
We want to make decisions, make choices.

110
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,540
As we look here in this portion of Scripture, if you're taking notes, number one, I want

111
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,380
you to notice what Joshua recognized.

112
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,700
Notice what Joshua recognized.

113
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:19,339
He says, now therefore fear the Lord, in verse number 14, and serve Him, the Lord, in sincerity

114
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:20,700
and in truth.

115
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,140
Put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt,

116
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,019
and serve ye the Lord.

117
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:33,859
He says in verse 15, and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day

118
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:36,580
whom ye will serve.

119
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:42,500
I believe that Joshua recognized some important truth with regard to the choices that people

120
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,500
make.

121
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,780
Number one, he understood the individual nature of choice.

122
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:51,219
He understood that every individual had a responsibility to respond to this message

123
00:08:51,219 --> 00:08:52,859
that he was delivering.

124
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:54,340
He's the servant of the Lord.

125
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,299
He's the messenger of God.

126
00:08:56,299 --> 00:09:00,739
He's giving them the word of the Lord, and he understands that he's going to bring them

127
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:06,940
to a place of decision, but there's an individual nature of choice.

128
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:13,059
Every single person has a responsibility to respond, to make a choice with regard to what

129
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:14,580
they hear.

130
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,580
We do not believe.

131
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:20,260
We just had in our Sunday school hour, we just spoke about individual soul liberty as

132
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,460
one of the points that we dealt with this morning, and I said this, that with the individual

133
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:30,500
soul liberty comes individual responsibility, and this morning when we see the individual

134
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:36,859
nature of choice, and Joshua recognizing this, he says, choose you this day whom you will

135
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:37,859
serve.

136
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:41,700
He's speaking to this whole congregation, and he's saying to them they have a choice

137
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,700
to make.

138
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,700
I would say this.

139
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,859
I believe that Joshua also recognized the importance of making the right choice.

140
00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:53,859
You know, the reality this morning is that the man Joshua, the servant of the Lord here,

141
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:59,059
he understood the importance of making the right choice, but you know what he could not

142
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:00,059
do is he couldn't make the right choice.

143
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:02,899
the right choice for every individual.

144
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:03,739
Why?

145
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:05,659
Because there's the individual nature of choice

146
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:08,959
and just because I know, just because Joshua,

147
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,219
just because you may know the right choice to be made,

148
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:15,519
it doesn't mean that you can make it for the person.

149
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,419
Amen?

150
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:20,139
Everyone has their own choice to be made

151
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:22,539
and we find that Joshua understood the importance

152
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,939
of making the right choice.

153
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:26,019
He brings them to that place of decision.

154
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:28,459
He lays the groundwork, the framework.

155
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:31,379
He lays the foundation, he gives them the truth

156
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:33,299
and he understands the importance

157
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,419
of making the right choice.

158
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:37,499
Have you ever wanted to make a choice for someone else?

159
00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:39,659
Make a decision for someone else?

160
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:42,259
You see someone that's going down a path,

161
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:43,819
maybe a child or maybe someone else,

162
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:44,979
you see them going down a path

163
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:47,979
and they're making wrong decisions, wrong choices.

164
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:50,739
You say, man, I wish I could make the choice for them,

165
00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:52,419
make the decision for them.

166
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,059
But you know what you learn?

167
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:54,899
You can't.

168
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:56,579
You can't.

169
00:10:57,459 --> 00:10:59,339
But Joshua as the leader,

170
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:02,739
he recognizes the importance of making the right choice.

171
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:05,860
I believe he also understood and he recognized

172
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,220
the impact that our choices will have on others.

173
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,379
You know, you think about the impact of our decisions,

174
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:14,199
the impact of our choices.

175
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:16,339
They not only will affect us,

176
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:18,739
but they'll in fact affect, excuse me,

177
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:21,419
impact future generations.

178
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:24,019
They will impact, they will affect our brothers

179
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:25,579
and sisters in Christ.

180
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:30,299
And we find that decisions, choices have consequences,

181
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:32,500
but there's also great impact.

182
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,860
I want you to think about the book of Joshua this morning

183
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,739
and as you would think back to the battle at Ai

184
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,419
and you would consider what takes place.

185
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:43,099
And there were 36 men that lost their lives

186
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:45,899
in that battle of Ai the first time around.

187
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:47,699
And it was because the Bible tells us

188
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:50,899
that there was sin in the camp.

189
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:52,860
It's very interesting if you were to take the time,

190
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,159
we don't have the time this morning,

191
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,639
but if you were to study through Joshua chapter number seven

192
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,599
and you would find that that sin in the camp,

193
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:01,759
it was Achan, the troubler of Israel

194
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,079
as he's referred to in the book of First Chronicles.

195
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,000
And we find that he was the one

196
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,559
that took of the accursed thing.

197
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,880
The instruction at Jericho was clear,

198
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,559
the instruction was given,

199
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,399
but he, Achan, as an individual made a choice

200
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,539
to take of the accursed thing.

201
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,179
And I would say to you this morning

202
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:26,020
that that choice affected the entire congregation.

203
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,979
The entire nation of Israel,

204
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:31,179
there was sin in the camp and it impacted them,

205
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:34,059
it affected them, 36 men lost their lives.

206
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:35,300
If you study through the book of Joshua,

207
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,099
it's the only record that we have of anyone dying

208
00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:42,259
in the time in which they went into the land of Canaan

209
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:44,979
to conquer and to divide the land.

210
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:46,940
You think about those 36 men,

211
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,339
you think there were families that were impacted?

212
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:55,339
Those 36 men, husbands, fathers, brothers, sons, right?

213
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:58,739
People are impacted, people are affected.

214
00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:01,619
And so I believe that Joshua is bringing the people,

215
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:04,779
the congregation together here in Joshua 24.

216
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:07,020
He's saying, listen, he's recognizing

217
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,779
the individual nature of choice,

218
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:11,580
he understands the importance of making the right choice,

219
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,380
the correct choice, he understands the impact

220
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,419
that our choices are going to have on other people.

221
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:19,860
I believe as you look here in the text of scripture,

222
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,300
he also understands the influence of idolatry.

223
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,300
It's interesting how that in verse number two,

224
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,419
he talks about the gods that their fathers served.

225
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:31,500
He mentions it again in verse number 14.

226
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,979
He mentions it in verse number 15.

227
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,899
He's dealing with this subject of idolatry

228
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,419
and dealing with the influence of idolatry.

229
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,739
And I wanna draw your attention

230
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:42,020
to what he says in verse 23.

231
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:46,220
Notice what the Bible says in Joshua 24 in verse 23.

232
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,899
After they respond, and we'll look at that

233
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:49,699
in just a moment in greater detail,

234
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:52,380
but I want you to see what Joshua says in verse 23.

235
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,739
He says, now therefore put away, said he,

236
00:13:55,739 --> 00:13:59,339
the strange gods which are among you.

237
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:04,779
And incline your heart unto the Lord God of Israel.

238
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:07,220
Now it's interesting because Joshua here,

239
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,739
he says to put away the strange gods.

240
00:14:09,739 --> 00:14:13,380
Notice where he says which are among you.

241
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,059
There was some truth that Joshua was aware of

242
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:20,380
that there was already some that had some idols

243
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,380
that had them within their things, within their stuff.

244
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,540
And he says, put away those strange gods

245
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,779
which are among you.

246
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:29,299
By the way, if you were to go back

247
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:32,700
and you look at Rachel, remember she took the images

248
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,459
of her father and she hid them amongst the stuff

249
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,540
so much so that Jacob, he's talking to Laban

250
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,660
and he says, search and whoever they're found with,

251
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,139
they can die.

252
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:46,619
And Jacob didn't even know that Rachel had them,

253
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:47,660
but she did.

254
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,579
Now she lied to her father and she made up a story

255
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:53,859
and Laban didn't find them and then Laban and Jacob

256
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,179
are arguing about it, what have you,

257
00:14:56,179 --> 00:15:00,220
but God knew and here Joshua says,

258
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,980
we think about this influence of idols and idolatry

259
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,899
and we know with the nation of Israel,

260
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:08,019
they're constantly dealing with idolatry.

261
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:10,899
As you study through the history of Israel

262
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:14,260
and you see over and over the idol worship

263
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:19,019
and the detriment that comes as a result of their idolatry

264
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,899
and he deals with and he explains to them

265
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:25,500
the fact that they must put away those strange gods

266
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,019
that were among them.

267
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:32,019
John says this, my little children, keep yourself from idols.

268
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:33,660
Keep yourself from idols.

269
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:38,619
We live in a time in which I believe some have the idea

270
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,820
that well, we don't have idols like they had idols

271
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,139
and we don't have the danger of idolatry

272
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:46,859
like the children of Israel had the danger of idolatry,

273
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:50,100
but we see that he says, keep yourself from idols.

274
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:54,660
We find that Colossians 1 tells us that in all things,

275
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,179
Christ must have the preeminence and truly this morning,

276
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:00,619
an idol is anything that takes first place,

277
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:03,660
anything that takes place of God.

278
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,660
There should be nothing in your life or in my life

279
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,899
that would take that place of primacy

280
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:10,779
that belongs only to the Lord Jesus Christ

281
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:14,700
that in all things, he might have the preeminence.

282
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,179
We may not have idols like they had idols.

283
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:21,339
We may not have figures that are crafted by individuals

284
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:24,940
that we set into some little cabinet somewhere.

285
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,820
We may not have that type of idol.

286
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,980
We know of places around the globe where they still have

287
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,500
that type of idolatry that takes place,

288
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,419
but for many today, an idol in an American's life

289
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:41,419
might be a job, a position, a paycheck,

290
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:46,739
sports, sports, sports.

291
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,779
Amen?

292
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:53,500
Honestly, it becomes an idol.

293
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,380
Things.

294
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,940
We find this morning that as we look at the text

295
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,739
of scripture, we find that Joshua recognized

296
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:04,739
some important truth with regard to choices,

297
00:17:04,739 --> 00:17:06,459
with regard to making decisions.

298
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:10,579
He's bringing the people together and he's encouraging them

299
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:13,380
to make the right choice and he understands,

300
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,619
he recognizes these principles that we look to,

301
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,339
but we find that as we continue to look

302
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,579
through this portion of scripture,

303
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:23,500
number one, we said that we notice what Joshua recognized.

304
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,040
Number two, consider the resolve of Joshua.

305
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,500
I love this portion of scripture

306
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,179
and I love the resolve of Joshua.

307
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,019
We know, as I mentioned already,

308
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:33,899
that the latter part of verse number 15

309
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:35,579
is a very familiar verse of scripture

310
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:40,359
that many people would have on some type of material,

311
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,019
wood or something in their home that would declare,

312
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:46,100
ask for me in my house, we will serve the Lord,

313
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,619
but I notice the resolve of Joshua

314
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:51,559
as he's bringing the people to a place of decision,

315
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:54,179
as he's telling them, choose you this day

316
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:55,579
whom you will serve.

317
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:57,940
Notice whether the gods which your father served

318
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,239
that were on the other side of the flood,

319
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:00,779
he mentioned that in verse two,

320
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:03,859
or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell,

321
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,540
remember they would be faced

322
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,299
with a bunch of idols in the land.

323
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:12,299
He says this, but as for me and my house,

324
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:18,380
we will serve the Lord.

325
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,179
I love the resolve of Joshua as it's given to us here

326
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:24,540
in this single statement of scripture.

327
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,019
And I see this resolve.

328
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:28,739
I see a man that understood the importance

329
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:30,559
of him making the decision,

330
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,219
even that he's bringing others to make.

331
00:18:33,219 --> 00:18:36,299
See, he's encouraging others to serve the Lord,

332
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:39,940
but he himself is saying, I've made the choice to serve God.

333
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,140
I've responded to the same truth,

334
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,979
the same message that I'm delivering to you.

335
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:47,020
I have responded to this.

336
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,380
And by the way, that's good leadership, amen.

337
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,500
That's good leadership on the part of Joshua

338
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,260
to explain that, listen, I'm not just trying to get you

339
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,500
to as an individual within the congregation of Israel,

340
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,179
the nation of Israel to make a decision.

341
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:05,900
I've made a decision and I've chosen

342
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,200
that I'm going to serve the Lord.

343
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,619
Me and my house, we will serve the Lord.

344
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:12,299
Notice, I want you to see as we note this truth

345
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,500
in verse 15, it's interesting.

346
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,919
He made his choice known as a public choice.

347
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:21,919
He didn't just keep it to himself.

348
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,840
You know, there's accountability in that, amen.

349
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,859
There's accountability.

350
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:31,099
But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.

351
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:32,460
All of a sudden he stands down.

352
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,279
Notice where he's standing.

353
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:35,260
He's called all the people together and check him.

354
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,460
We see it in verse one.

355
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,179
In verse two, he addresses the people.

356
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:40,219
There's a huge group of people that are here

357
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:42,460
that he's addressing and he says to these people,

358
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,340
but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.

359
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,140
That's resolve.

360
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,539
But I want you to know that as he's made his decision

361
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:54,140
known publicly, that there's an aspect of accountability.

362
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:57,299
There are some times in which a decision that is made,

363
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,739
a choice that is made by an individual believer,

364
00:19:59,739 --> 00:20:03,279
should be a personal, it should be a personal decision,

365
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:05,659
a personal choice, but I want you to understand

366
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:08,579
that at times when we make choices in responding

367
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:10,719
to what God tells us in his word,

368
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:12,719
that at times there's a huge benefit

369
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:16,119
in making that choice known publicly,

370
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,679
because there's accountability.

371
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,999
There's accountability.

372
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:22,199
Listen, by the way, accountability is a good thing.

373
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:23,839
It's good to be held accountable.

374
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:27,159
I remember as I was in Bible college,

375
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,099
I remember a fella that said to me,

376
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:30,979
he went to our church, he didn't go to the college,

377
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,379
he went to church, and he said,

378
00:20:32,379 --> 00:20:34,839
he came to me after a special meeting that we had,

379
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:35,819
he said, I wanna know if you'd be

380
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,979
an accountability partner for me.

381
00:20:37,979 --> 00:20:40,119
That was a great idea, a great opportunity,

382
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,979
and we would keep each other accountable,

383
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:43,659
and all of a sudden I realized real quick

384
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,059
that he really didn't wanna be accountable,

385
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:47,719
because all of a sudden I would try to give him

386
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:49,739
phone calls and text messages and just ask,

387
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:51,659
how are things going, and I wasn't trying to be a pest,

388
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:53,339
I was just trying to keep him accountable

389
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:55,279
and help him in his walk with God,

390
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:57,219
and he said to me, he said,

391
00:20:57,219 --> 00:20:58,819
I wanna read my Bible every day.

392
00:20:58,819 --> 00:21:00,339
I've been struggling with reading my Bible.

393
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:01,459
I wanna read my Bible every day.

394
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:02,339
I wanna pray every day.

395
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:04,219
I haven't prayed like I should,

396
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:05,339
and I wanna do these things,

397
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:07,659
and so I'm trying to help him to stay accountable,

398
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:09,659
and then he'd just stop answering my phone calls.

399
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:12,639
He'd stop responding to text messages.

400
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,259
Unfortunately, that young man today

401
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:15,579
is actually older than I am,

402
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:18,399
is nowhere near a church this morning.

403
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:19,819
It's very sad.

404
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:20,819
Breaks your heart.

405
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:24,499
It's a good thing to have an accountability

406
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:26,599
to brothers and sisters in Christ.

407
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:29,159
Maybe your spouse is probably one of the best people

408
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:30,639
to have accountability to,

409
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:32,119
and you know what happens sometimes?

410
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:34,639
We get angry when we get asked questions

411
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:36,019
about being accountable.

412
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,079
It sounds good to be accountable,

413
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,559
but then all of a sudden we gotta answer a question.

414
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:43,119
I've said this for years.

415
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,799
Counsel is getting answers to your questions.

416
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:49,779
Accountability is answering the questions

417
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:53,539
that are asked of you, and there's a difference,

418
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:56,039
and this morning we find that Joshua,

419
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:59,279
the resolve of Joshua, but he makes his choice known,

420
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:01,199
and there's a measure of accountability in that.

421
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:04,039
Yes, there's an aspect of good leadership in that,

422
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:06,399
and letting the people know that he's made his choice.

423
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:07,439
I want you to note with me

424
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:09,559
that not only did he make his choice known,

425
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:12,159
but he did not wait for the people to respond

426
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,399
before he made his choice.

427
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:15,959
Listen, don't wait for someone else

428
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,839
to make a decision to follow Christ.

429
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:20,079
You decide I'm gonna follow Christ.

430
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,039
Don't wait for someone else to move in an invitation

431
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:24,739
when God speaks to your heart,

432
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:28,379
when God moves in your life about something specifically.

433
00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:31,419
You don't have to wait for somebody else to respond

434
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:33,439
and then say, oh yeah, I think I'll respond as well.

435
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:36,619
No, I'm responding to God.

436
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:40,539
I'm not responding because somebody else responded.

437
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:42,059
I'm not making the choice

438
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:43,659
because someone else made the choice.

439
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:46,259
No, I'm gonna make the determination.

440
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:50,459
The Bible says I have decided to follow Jesus.

441
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:53,359
The song says I have decided to follow Jesus.

442
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:55,479
You think about the decision with that songwriter.

443
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:57,959
He says, though none go with me,

444
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:02,099
still I will follow.

445
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:06,119
Though none go with me, still I will follow.

446
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:08,759
See, this morning as we think about the work of God

447
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:09,919
and the way in which he works

448
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,719
in the hearts and lives of his people,

449
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:14,879
our God is an individual God.

450
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:16,399
I love that.

451
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:18,959
When we talked and we dealt with earlier in the year

452
00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:21,619
about God's love and we spoke about defining

453
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:23,279
and describing the love of God,

454
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:25,619
we said that God's love is universal

455
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:27,459
for God so loved the world.

456
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:28,739
And I'm thankful for that,

457
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:30,899
but God's love is individual

458
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:34,539
in the fact that he loves me as an individual.

459
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:36,659
And as our God being an individual God,

460
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:37,499
you know what he does?

461
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,379
He works and speaks in your heart

462
00:23:39,379 --> 00:23:40,899
and he works and speaks in your heart

463
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:41,979
and he works and speaks.

464
00:23:41,979 --> 00:23:46,419
And God is able to take a message from his word

465
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:48,479
and minister to every individual

466
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:52,719
that's gathered together in a specific personal way.

467
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:55,199
It's amazing what God is able to do.

468
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:57,839
There's no way that a speaker,

469
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,519
someone that's just going to get up

470
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:04,399
and try to speak and give some kind of a message,

471
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:07,559
they can't meet, I don't know everyone's need.

472
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:11,639
But as I seek to follow the Lord

473
00:24:11,639 --> 00:24:13,779
and seek to hear the voice of God

474
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:16,160
with regard to the message that's to be delivered,

475
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:18,899
then the Holy Spirit of God can use his word

476
00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:21,859
and he can minister to each individual

477
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:23,059
that's gathered together.

478
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:25,539
It's amazing what God can do.

479
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:27,819
Joshua's speaking as he says,

480
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:30,220
here's what God says, he's giving God's word,

481
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,739
he's challenging the people.

482
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:34,639
There are times in which I've heard,

483
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,479
I've experienced in the 12 years of pastoring here

484
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:38,319
where someone would say,

485
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,859
man, this really helped me in the message today,

486
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:41,979
I made this choice and I'm like,

487
00:24:41,979 --> 00:24:44,179
I didn't even know I said that this morning.

488
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,500
God was working, God's at work.

489
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,299
And so when we understand that God works individually,

490
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:54,739
that he's an individual God,

491
00:24:54,739 --> 00:24:56,500
then God's working in your life

492
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,339
with regard to decisions and choices

493
00:24:58,339 --> 00:25:00,459
that you need to make and we can go around

494
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:02,739
and we can say that about every single individual

495
00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:04,619
and so we understand this morning

496
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:06,139
that Joshua, there's resolve,

497
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:07,899
he says, ask for me in my house,

498
00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:09,819
we will serve the Lord.

499
00:25:09,819 --> 00:25:11,899
He makes that known, it's public,

500
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:14,819
he tells everyone but he also makes the decision

501
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:16,880
before the people respond.

502
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,239
He says, I want you to know that your response

503
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:22,599
to this message has no bearing on my choice

504
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:26,160
because we're gonna serve God.

505
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,059
If all of you walk out, if all of you say,

506
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,199
no, we're gonna go ahead and serve

507
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:30,399
the gods of the Amorites,

508
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:32,079
no, we're gonna go ahead and serve the,

509
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,940
I'm serving God, amen?

510
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,720
And that's the way it should be.

511
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,759
We're not waiting for, listen,

512
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:40,639
I understand that it's nice when other people

513
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,479
are going in the same direction that you're going, amen?

514
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,119
It's nice when other people are going

515
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,440
in the same direction and they're making

516
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,919
the same choice and the same decisions

517
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:51,799
and they're responding but God's an individual God

518
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,959
and he's working in our hearts individually

519
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,880
and we see that Joshua makes that known.

520
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,279
Notice with me, not only do we find

521
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:02,519
that he's made it known publicly

522
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,799
that he made the choice even before the people responded

523
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:09,239
but I would say this, his choice was the right choice.

524
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:10,639
Would you agree?

525
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:12,559
He made the right choice.

526
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,599
We're gonna serve God.

527
00:26:15,259 --> 00:26:16,299
We're gonna serve the Lord.

528
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,099
What a great choice.

529
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:21,500
You know, you're never gonna regret serving God.

530
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:25,720
You never will regret serving God.

531
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,539
You're never going to regret following

532
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:31,899
the leadership of the Holy Spirit of God in your life.

533
00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:34,179
You're never gonna regret responding

534
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:35,940
to what thus saith the Lord.

535
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,720
We may regret not responding properly.

536
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,639
We may regret not doing what God called us to do,

537
00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:47,500
what God prompted us to do

538
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:50,979
but you're never gonna regret following the Lord.

539
00:26:50,979 --> 00:26:52,899
I believe that with all my heart this morning.

540
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:55,720
You're not gonna ever regret following the Lord.

541
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:59,859
We find this morning that this choice of Joshua,

542
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:01,319
this was the right choice.

543
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,539
We need to be careful that in our lives

544
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:08,859
that we're diligent to make the right choice,

545
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:11,279
to make the choice that's aligned

546
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,839
with what the Bible teaches,

547
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,839
that we would not be concerned with the crowd,

548
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,319
with the popularity.

549
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:25,019
We don't take a straw poll to see what the majority

550
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,059
of the people wanna do.

551
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:28,039
No, we say we're gonna follow the Lord.

552
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:32,000
If God before us, who can be against us?

553
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,160
And we understand this morning that Joshua,

554
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,539
he makes this choice and what a blessing

555
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,519
to consider this morning, the resolve of Joshua.

556
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:41,619
As we continue through the passage of scripture,

557
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:42,459
number three this morning,

558
00:27:42,459 --> 00:27:44,399
we noticed the response of the people.

559
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,559
They made a choice.

560
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:47,599
They had a choice to make and they made a choice.

561
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,160
The Bible says in verse 16

562
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,000
and we'll read down through verse number 24.

563
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,839
Notice the Bible says,

564
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,720
and the people answered and said,

565
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,279
God forbid that we should forsake the Lord

566
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:57,559
to serve other gods.

567
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:58,839
That's a good answer.

568
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:00,880
It says in verse 17, for the Lord, our God,

569
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,440
he it is that brought us up and our fathers

570
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:07,459
out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage

571
00:28:07,459 --> 00:28:10,019
and which did those great signs in our sight

572
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:13,459
and preserved us in all the way wherein we went

573
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:15,500
and among all the people through whom we passed.

574
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,819
Are they correct in what they're saying?

575
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:17,880
Absolutely.

576
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,559
They're saying it's God that brought us out

577
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,660
from the land of Egypt.

578
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,819
And we can think about all of the signs and wonders

579
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:26,859
that God did in bringing them out of Egypt.

580
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:29,940
He said, they say that did those great signs.

581
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,119
Notice in verse 17, in our sight, they saw what God did.

582
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,659
They saw his greatness.

583
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:37,380
They observed his power.

584
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,779
And it says that he not only did those great works

585
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:43,440
to be able to bring us out of bondage,

586
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,779
but it says in preserved us

587
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:47,619
in all the way wherein we went.

588
00:28:47,619 --> 00:28:49,640
You think about their journey from Egypt

589
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,500
to where they stand today in Joshua 24

590
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,219
as Joshua is addressing these people.

591
00:28:55,219 --> 00:28:57,219
And you think about the wilderness wanderings

592
00:28:57,219 --> 00:28:58,940
and you think about the entrance into

593
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,500
and the conquering of the land of Canaan,

594
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,059
the division of the land of Canaan.

595
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:07,159
And they stand there and they say, God has preserved us.

596
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:08,339
They're right.

597
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,239
It says in verse 18,

598
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:14,979
and the Lord drave out from before us all the people,

599
00:29:14,979 --> 00:29:16,799
even the Amorites, which dwelt in the land.

600
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,799
Therefore, will we also serve the Lord for he is our God.

601
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:22,880
Did God do that?

602
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,640
Yes, he promised to do it and he did.

603
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,279
And we find that in verses 17 and 18,

604
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:33,739
they're responding appropriately to this message

605
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:35,419
that Joshua has delivered.

606
00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:38,459
And they're saying, we will serve the Lord

607
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:40,159
for he is our God.

608
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,059
And Joshua said to the people in verse 19,

609
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:44,700
you cannot serve the Lord for he is an holy God.

610
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,599
He's a jealous God.

611
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:48,099
He will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.

612
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:50,539
If you forsake the Lord and serve strange gods,

613
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:54,739
then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you.

614
00:29:54,739 --> 00:29:57,260
After that, he hath done you good.

615
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,279
And that's interesting as you read that verse of scripture.

616
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:05,879
those verses of scripture there in verse 19 and 20 as Joshua is responding to the people

617
00:30:05,879 --> 00:30:09,239
and he's helping them to understand, you know, the Bible tells us in Exodus 20 that our God's

618
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:18,759
a jealous God. He alone is worthy of our worship. Listen, God will not share His glory with

619
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:28,359
any other. Amen? He will not share His glory with any other. He alone is holy. He alone

620
00:30:28,439 --> 00:30:35,319
is worthy. And we find that Joshua is trying to help these people understand the seriousness

621
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:40,119
of the decision that is before them and understanding the seriousness of the consequences of following

622
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:44,519
strange gods and getting wrapped up in idolatry. If you were to read through, and we don't

623
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:49,679
have time this morning, but to consider the book of Judges, there was a generation that

624
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,959
died Joshua and that generation they died and you begin to read through the book of

625
00:30:53,959 --> 00:31:01,039
Judges and you begin to see how they served idols. And what happened? Well, God raised

626
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:10,879
up some people groups that brought His people under oppression. He brought judgment. Notice

627
00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:14,919
it says in verse 20, if you forsake the Lord and serve strange gods then He will turn and

628
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:20,919
do you hurt and consume you after that He hath done you good. He's the one that brought

629
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:25,279
them into the land. He's the one that's provided for them as He promised to do so. But if you

630
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:29,759
read in the book of Judges you find that God was the one that would raise up these people

631
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:35,719
groups that would oppress the nation of Israel. Yes, God was faithful and He was merciful

632
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:41,739
and He was gracious to raise up a judge when His people would turn to Him. I'm thankful

633
00:31:41,739 --> 00:31:48,319
that our God is long-suffering. He's ready to pardon and ready to forgive. I think about

634
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:55,199
Jeremiah. As Jeremiah is brought in and of course he was faithfully preaching about the

635
00:31:55,199 --> 00:32:00,359
Babylonian captivity and we find that he's telling them, listen, this is the result of

636
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:05,639
your sin. This is the consequence for the choices that you have made. You're following

637
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:13,079
idols. You're serving strange gods. You're forgetting and forsaking the Lord your God

638
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:18,439
and all these things that they're guilty of. The nation of Judah and Jeremiah is preaching

639
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:23,639
and yet we find that on more than one occasion Jeremiah would be challenged with regard to

640
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:28,399
the message that he's delivering. The king comes to him and says, hey, do you have a

641
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,919
word from God? As if there's something different that Jeremiah is going to tell him. No, you're

642
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:36,479
going to be conquered. You're going to be destroyed. You're going to be taken captive.

643
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:41,879
Why? Because of your sin. At one point the people come to Jeremiah and they say, is God

644
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:48,919
going to fight for us? No. Jeremiah says, God's going to fight against you. That's heavy.

645
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:59,439
That's heavy. Why was God going to fight against them? Because of their idolatry? Because of

646
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:05,199
their sin? Let me say it this way, because of the choices that they made. And this morning

647
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:09,799
when we look here at this book of Joshua and this challenge, he's telling the people, listen,

648
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:14,639
the gravity of this decision, this choice that is before them, and we find that the

649
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:19,719
people then respond to Joshua in verse 21 and they say, nay, but we will serve the Lord.

650
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:24,799
We see a measure of resolve there in verse 21, even amongst the people that Joshua is

651
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:29,759
speaking to. And he says in verse 22, ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have

652
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:36,679
chosen you, the Lord, to serve him. And they said, we are witnesses. Now therefore, we

653
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:41,119
referenced verse 23 a moment ago, he says, now therefore, put away, said he, the strange

654
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:47,759
gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the Lord God of Israel. It's interesting

655
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:52,839
that even as they were saying that we're going to serve the Lord, that it seems as you look

656
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:57,119
at the passage here that there were some that even had idols within their stuff. Because

657
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:01,719
he says, put away the strange gods which are among you. Verse 24, and the people said unto

658
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:08,239
Joshua, the Lord our God, will we serve in his voice? Will we obey? I want you to notice

659
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:14,999
that in verse number 24. That's a good statement. As much as we appreciate the statement of

660
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:19,719
Joshua in verse 25, but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord, we notice at the end

661
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:25,719
of verse number 24 that the people say to Joshua, the Lord our God, will we serve in

662
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:33,959
his voice? Will we obey? That's a good statement. That's a good proclamation. That's the right

663
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:39,319
choice. This morning as we begin to think about the choice is yours and begin to think

664
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:46,079
about the text here in Joshua 24, but then also bringing to mind that which we have heard

665
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,719
in the last week with various messages during the revival meeting. Again, if you were here

666
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:56,199
for the duration of the revival meeting hearing six messages with the preaching, again, not

667
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:01,599
just to give out information, to dispense information, but to bring God's people to

668
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:08,239
a place of decision. Perhaps in that moment of invitation during one of those services

669
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,919
that there were choices that were made, there were decisions that were made, there were

670
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:16,759
people that responded, but at times the Holy Spirit of God, listen, I'm thankful that the

671
00:35:16,759 --> 00:35:20,839
Holy Spirit will continue to work in our hearts and lives even after we've heard the

672
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:25,399
message. Maybe we didn't respond right away. Maybe there was a measure of delay and the

673
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:29,039
Holy Spirit just keeps bringing something back to our mind and he keeps reminding us

674
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:36,399
of the truth and what we need to do and how we need to respond. Moses says this in Exodus

675
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:44,359
chapter 32 and verse number 26, who is on the Lord's side? Who's on the Lord's side?

676
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:48,759
We sing that song, who is on the Lord's side, and we understand that as we sing it and we

677
00:35:48,759 --> 00:35:54,359
enjoy the opportunity to sing it, but we find that Moses made that question known in Exodus

678
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:58,679
32 after the people, you know what they did? They had just received the Ten Commandments,

679
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:02,559
the law, they got all this instruction with regard to the tabernacle and they made this

680
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:08,519
covenant with God and in Exodus chapter 32 they break the covenant. They disobey God.

681
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:16,399
They're serving a calf, an idol, right? That's what they're doing in Exodus 32. And as Moses

682
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:19,839
and Joshua are coming down, remember God tells them get down there into the camp and they're

683
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:25,119
coming and Joshua says it's like a sound of war and Moses is going in response and they

684
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:34,679
come and the people, they have defiled themselves. Moses says, who is on the Lord's side? Who

685
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:42,519
is on the Lord's side? I think about Elijah in 1 Kings chapter 18 and verse number 21.

686
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:47,759
We're familiar with the text of scripture when Elijah has that opportunity at Mount

687
00:36:47,759 --> 00:36:52,679
Carmel to have that fire come from heaven, but before the fire ever comes from heaven

688
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:57,879
and consumes the offering, he stands before the people that are gathered together and

689
00:36:57,879 --> 00:37:07,079
he says, how long halt ye between two opinions? If God be God, follow him, but if Baal, then

690
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:10,479
follow him. You know what the Bible says in that portion of scripture, they answered him

691
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:18,319
not a word. Can I tell you that that's a choice? No choice is a choice. You say, well that

692
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:23,399
doesn't make sense. No, it is. You're making a choice that you're not going to respond.

693
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:30,959
You're making a choice that you're going to put off, to delay. I want you to turn to

694
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:34,239
the book of Deuteronomy if you will very quickly. We're going to look at two passages of scripture

695
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:38,119
as we close this morning in Deuteronomy chapter number 11 and then we'll go over to Deuteronomy

696
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:48,359
chapter number 30. Look in Deuteronomy chapter number 11 if you will. You go back in history

697
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:52,319
as you come back to the book of Deuteronomy as Moses is giving the instruction to the

698
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:55,999
children of Israel before they would enter into the land. Of course Joshua, as we're

699
00:37:55,999 --> 00:38:00,959
looking at Joshua 24, he would become the human leader of the nation of Israel. Of course

700
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:05,159
God was their leader but humanly speaking he would lead the nation of Israel. Moses

701
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:09,599
was not permitted to enter into the land of promise. He was told to speak to the rock

702
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,279
but he smote it and God would not allow him to enter into the land of promise and he died.

703
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:19,319
We read that in the book of Deuteronomy as far as his death is concerned. But we find

704
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:24,839
that as he's preparing the people for entrance into the land that God had promised them,

705
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:28,999
we find that on two occasions, and we'll look at both of these this morning very quickly,

706
00:38:28,999 --> 00:38:33,119
but he brings the people again to the same place that Joshua was bringing the people

707
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,439
and speaking of this idea the choice is yours. Notice in verse 26, the Bible says this in

708
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:43,599
Deuteronomy 11 and verse 26. Behold I set before you this day a blessing and a curse.

709
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,759
A blessing if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you this

710
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:50,799
day and a curse if you will not obey the commandments of the Lord your God but turn

711
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:55,119
aside out of the way which I command you this day to go after other gods which you have

712
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:01,059
not known. As we look at these two, three verses of scripture, verse 26 to verse 28,

713
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:05,519
we see that Moses is saying to the people I'm setting before you, listen, a blessing

714
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:10,979
and a curse. But in verse 27 and again in verse 28 he gives the instruction with regard

715
00:39:10,979 --> 00:39:16,399
to here's the choice that will lead to blessing and here's the choice that will lead to a

716
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:22,719
curse. Now it seems pretty obvious doesn't it? And I was going to use an object lesson

717
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:26,799
this morning but I chose not to and I was going to use an object lesson and sometimes

718
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:30,599
when you have a choice you don't know what the consequence of your choice is going to

719
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:34,839
be. So he says hey choose and I was going to have up here this table with all these

720
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:38,919
solo cups, you know the cups that we drink drinks out of and I was going to put some

721
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:43,319
money under one of them so that somebody could pick a cup and they'd get some money. But

722
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:48,439
here's the object lesson if you think about it. If I have 50 cups up here and I tell Tim

723
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:52,599
you pick a cup under one of them there's a $20 bill if you pick it you can have it. His

724
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:59,599
odds are pretty low. Right? One of 50. Pretty low odds. Now he may or may not and if I pick

725
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,239
put them all up here and he picked the right cup it would just destroy my object lesson

726
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:09,679
and so that's why I didn't do it this morning. But if he picked, likely he would pick the

727
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:17,359
wrong cup, it'd be empty. But here's what God does. If I could use that same object

728
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:21,639
lesson this morning and in your mind you can see it this morning, what God does is we see

729
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:26,159
here in Moses addressing the people of Israel, he says, I set before you this day a blessing

730
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:34,439
and a curse. A blessing if you obey. A curse is the result of disobedience. So if we were

731
00:40:34,439 --> 00:40:38,399
to use that object lesson this morning, I'd say to Tim, Tim, there are 50 cups up here

732
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:43,039
and one of them has a $20 bill under it. If you pick that one you can keep the $20 bill.

733
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:49,039
Now Tim, before you choose, let me show you, this is the cup that has $20 underneath of

734
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:54,279
it, okay. So Tim, you're going to pick whatever one you want out of these 50 cups but this

735
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:58,359
is the one I'm showing you. Can you see the $20 bill? This is the one that has the $20

736
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:02,799
bill and I put the cup back down and I say, now you choose. Now if he picked one of the

737
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:14,079
other 49 cups, what would you think about Tim? She said he's stupid. Oh man. But you

738
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:21,839
would think, what is he thinking? You just showed him. Is that what you would think?

739
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,459
So what would you expect Tim to do if we went through that same process that I just

740
00:41:25,459 --> 00:41:29,399
revealed and I said, Tim, now remember Tim, it's this cup right here. I showed you already,

741
00:41:29,399 --> 00:41:33,839
now it's this one. What would you expect Tim to do? He would pick that cup up, he'd get

742
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:42,839
$20 and he'd go have lunch somewhere. God says, I set before you this day a blessing

743
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:51,479
and a curse. A blessing if you obey. But obey what? Well obey my commandments and by the

744
00:41:51,479 --> 00:42:00,839
way I've given them all to you. I've preserved them for you. A curse if you disobey. Disobey

745
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:06,719
what? My commandments and by the way I've preserved them for you. And so God has done

746
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:15,399
his part to really make it simple for us. He says, I've given you all the commandments.

747
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:23,399
If you obey them, there's a blessing. If you disobey them, there's a curse. But the

748
00:42:23,399 --> 00:42:29,459
choice is yours. The choice is yours. As much as I could try to help Tim to make the right

749
00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:33,839
choice in picking the right cup, as much as some in the audience might say, no, no, no,

750
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,639
not that one, not that one, pick that, he already showed you, right? If you brought

751
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:41,959
a real little kid up here, maybe there was a cup that was pink and they just like pink

752
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:44,959
and they're going to pick the pink cup because that's the one that they like the most and

753
00:42:44,959 --> 00:42:50,159
you're saying, no, no, no, no, no, no. You can't make the choice for them. And I feel

754
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:58,259
like at times that God's saying, my child, my child, I've given you, I've provided you

755
00:42:58,259 --> 00:43:07,199
with the commandments, the truth of my word. Why are you making those choices? Why are

756
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:16,359
you choosing to disobey? Choose to obey, choose to follow, choose to submit. God says

757
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:23,359
this in his word that in keeping of them, in Psalm 19, a familiar passage of scripture,

758
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:27,939
the law of the Lord is perfect and we're familiar with the portion of scripture and we rejoice.

759
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:32,919
And it says that, moreover, by them as thy servant warned and in keeping of them there

760
00:43:32,919 --> 00:43:44,519
is great reward. I want the blessing. I want the great reward. I want God's favor. But

761
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:51,119
it comes through obedience. Notice in Deuteronomy chapter 30, we'll close here with Deuteronomy

762
00:43:51,119 --> 00:44:06,259
chapter number 30. I love what God says here through Moses. He's speaking to the people

763
00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:10,839
beginning in verse number 11. I really want to get to verse 19. I may not read all of

764
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:14,599
the portion, but we'll read starting in verse number 11 and we'll eventually get to verse

765
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:20,399
19. It says, for this commandment which I command thee this day, notice what it says,

766
00:44:20,399 --> 00:44:27,839
it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. You ought to thank God for that.

767
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:34,479
Verse number 11, you ought to thank God that His commandments are not hidden from us, that

768
00:44:34,479 --> 00:44:40,159
they're not far off. Could you imagine if you were held accountable for something that

769
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:45,159
you did not know? Could you imagine if you were held accountable for something that was

770
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:51,479
not communicated to you? That would be tough. But God has been faithful. He said all scripture

771
00:44:51,479 --> 00:44:56,319
is given by inspiration of God, but then He said He would preserve it for every generation.

772
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:01,799
I'm so thankful for God's Word. And Moses says here to the children of Israel, for this

773
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:06,039
commandment which I command thee this day is not hidden from thee, neither is it far

774
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:10,199
off. God has been faithful to give it. Moses has been a faithful servant to deliver it.

775
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:13,559
Notice in verse 12, it is not in heaven that thou shouldst say, who shall go up for us

776
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:17,279
to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it? Neither is it beyond the

777
00:45:17,279 --> 00:45:20,999
sea that thou shouldst say, who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we

778
00:45:20,999 --> 00:45:26,439
may hear it and do it? But the Word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thine heart

779
00:45:26,439 --> 00:45:34,279
that thou mayest do it. Wow. Praise the Lord. Verse 15, see I have set before thee this

780
00:45:34,279 --> 00:45:38,919
day life and good and death and evil, that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy

781
00:45:38,919 --> 00:45:43,359
God, to walk in His ways and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His judgments that thou

782
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:48,119
mayest live and multiply. And the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou

783
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:54,119
goest to possess it. Look at verse 19, I call heaven and earth to record this day against

784
00:45:54,119 --> 00:46:02,239
you that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Therefore, choose life

785
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:09,719
that both thou and thy seed may live. Remember we mentioned about what Joshua recognized

786
00:46:09,759 --> 00:46:15,799
with regard to the choice, the individual nature of choice. But we also spoke about

787
00:46:15,799 --> 00:46:19,839
the importance of making the right choice. Notice Moses saying, I call heaven and earth

788
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,439
to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death, blessing and

789
00:46:23,439 --> 00:46:28,519
curse. Therefore, choose life. That's the right choice. He says that both thou and thy

790
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:36,079
seed may live. The impact of our choice. We find this morning that Moses is bringing the

791
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:41,559
people here and then Joshua in Joshua 24, bringing the people to a place of decision.

792
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:47,079
You have to make a choice. In Luke chapter 12, the Bible gives us the principle that

793
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:53,279
we often refer to as to whom much is given, much is required. I'm thankful that God's

794
00:46:53,279 --> 00:47:01,039
given us His Word. I'm thankful that we have the opportunity to read daily His Word. I'm

795
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:05,759
thankful, yes, as the pastor I know, to be able to have the privilege of preaching God's

796
00:47:05,759 --> 00:47:10,159
Word regularly. But I'm also thankful for the opportunity to be able to hear the preaching

797
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:16,319
of God's Word and to be challenged by what God teaches us in His Word. And God brings

798
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:22,299
us to a place of decision. The choice is yours. This morning, maybe there's some choices,

799
00:47:22,299 --> 00:47:28,459
some decisions that you need to make. Maybe through the revival meeting God was just working

800
00:47:28,459 --> 00:47:32,679
and moving. But maybe you've just not made a choice. Maybe this morning through something

801
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:36,559
that was said, the Holy Spirit of God just kind of touched a spot in your life, in your

802
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:42,599
heart. And the question is not that we just dispense information. It's not that we just

803
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:49,399
say, oh, that was a nice message. No, what does God have for me? What is God doing in

804
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:53,439
my life? Because He's an individual God that wants to work in each of our lives and bring

805
00:47:53,439 --> 00:47:59,839
us to a place of decision. We will serve the Lord. What a great decision, what a great

806
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:04,679
choice. But the choice is yours. I can't make it for you. No one else can make it for

807
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:11,199
you. God's given you the individual responsibility to make that choice. So this morning the choice

808
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:14,839
is yours. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. Thank you for

809
00:48:14,839 --> 00:48:21,039
your Word. Thank you for the truth of your Word. God, I'm not sure how you might be working

810
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:26,599
in the hearts of your people. God, I trust that you're at work. I trust the Holy Spirit

811
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:31,559
is moving and working. And I pray that in these moments of invitation that just as we've

812
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:39,399
been ready to receive your Word that we'd be ready to respond. God, help us to determine

813
00:48:39,399 --> 00:48:45,359
to obey you, to follow you. Lord, help us to dig into your Word daily so that we could

814
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:49,279
know your commandments and your statutes and your judgments so that we might apply and

815
00:48:49,279 --> 00:48:54,079
keep them and do them. I pray, Lord, that if there's one that needs to make the choice

816
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:59,279
of trusting Christ as their Savior, they've never been born again, I pray that this morning

817
00:48:59,279 --> 00:49:06,219
they would make that choice to trust Christ. Maybe you've been calling someone to the ministry.

818
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:13,000
Maybe you've been working through some other means in someone's life with regard to choices,

819
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,559
decisions, and how they're serving you. Lord, I pray that you'd just move and work. I pray

820
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:22,359
that we'd respond in obedience. We'll commit this time to you and we'll thank you for what

821
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:25,880
you'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed,

822
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:30,319
eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano. We'll have a time of

823
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:35,359
invitation where you have an opportunity to respond. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
