WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.639
I am thankful for God's Word and thankful for the truth that God has given us in His

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:11.720
Word and the guidance that He certainly provides us with, Joshua chapter 24.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.200
And let me say this as we get into the message this morning, the purpose of preaching goes

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.920
beyond simply dispensing information.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.840
And if we look at the idea, if we have the idea of preaching that it's just simply dispensing

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.700
information, we are wrong.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.020
We have missed it.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.419
Now obviously, as God's Word is preached and taught, we ought to be giving truth and dispensing

00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:39.419
information.

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:44.979
But ultimately, the preaching of God's Word should bring God's people to a place of decision.

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:46.619
And that is the purpose of it.

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:50.860
It's not just so that we can have our minds filled with information and facts, if you

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.740
will, so that we might be able to win some Bible quiz or so that we might be able to

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.259
do well at some Bible trivia game.

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.180
That's not the idea.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.620
The idea ultimately is that we as God's people would align our lives with the truth of God's

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.919
Word.

00:01:08.919 --> 00:01:10.059
Let me say this.

00:01:10.059 --> 00:01:15.099
It's not enough to simply respond to preaching by saying something like this, that was a

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:17.139
good message.

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:24.059
And it needs to go far beyond just being able to acknowledge from an intellectual perspective

00:01:24.059 --> 00:01:27.180
that perhaps there was a good message that was given.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.819
The goal, as I mentioned a moment ago, is that we would apply the truth in our lives.

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:36.220
So as we look at the truth of preaching and we think about the preaching that we've heard

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.699
in the last week, if you were here for all of the services of the Revival Meeting, you

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:42.620
heard six messages.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.019
And I wonder, as we think about the Revival Meeting, as we think about every week that

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:54.620
we come to church, that we ask ourselves this question, how did I respond to what I heard?

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.739
What was it that God spoke to me about?

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.620
That's why we have prayer time before our service.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:06.019
One of the reasons is because of the desire that we would say, God, I want you to work

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:12.100
in my life today, I want you to teach me something, to show me something, to reveal something in

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.740
my life that I need to stop doing or something I need to begin to do, and we have that time.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.059
Of course, we understand that the Lord Jesus Christ, that His house should be a house of

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:26.699
prayer, and a couple of years ago I was deeply convicted over the fact that so often in our

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:29.860
services we would use prayer basically as bookends.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.300
We open a service in prayer and ask God to bless, and we close a service in prayer and

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:41.100
thank God for blessing, and we needed to have some time that was designated to prayer and

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.179
asking God to work in our hearts personally.

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:50.059
And so as we have that time, it's God in these next moments as we sing, prepare my heart,

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:54.940
but as we open your word, speak to me and help me to understand what it is that you

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.580
have for me personally.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.300
I could say this, not only is how should we respond, but what choices did I make?

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.500
Did I make any choices when I heard the preaching of God's word?

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.179
Was I brought to a place of decision?

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:13.259
As we look at the final three chapters of the book of Joshua, we find that God records

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:17.259
for us three messages that Joshua delivers.

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:22.699
In Joshua chapter number 22 specifically, we find that that message in Joshua 22 is

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:25.699
delivered to the two and a half tribes.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.899
You'll recall from your Bible study and reading that those two and a half tribes, they spoke

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:37.100
to Moses and asked if they could have the inheritance on the eastern side of the Jordan

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.779
River, and as they sought the face of God, as Moses prayed about and sought God's counsel,

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:47.339
we find that those two and a half tribes, they were given that as their inheritance,

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:53.580
but they had the responsibility to go with their brethren to enter into the land of Canaan

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.899
to fight with them as they would conquer the land, and we find that they did.

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:03.820
They fulfilled their responsibility, and in Joshua 22, they're going to return back to

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.740
the land of their inheritance, and we find that Joshua addresses them specifically.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:16.660
In Joshua chapter 23, we find another message that is delivered from Joshua specifically

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.660
in that portion of scripture.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.299
It's to the leaders of the tribes of Israel, and we find that in Joshua 23, that's who

00:04:23.299 --> 00:04:27.500
he's specifically addressing, but we come to the 24th chapter, the chapter in which

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.700
we'll be looking at this morning as we seek to look at this really a well-known passage

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.859
of scripture, but we find that in Joshua 24 that Joshua is addressing the people of God,

00:04:38.859 --> 00:04:40.100
the people of Israel.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.160
Notice in verse number one, and Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem and called

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.779
for the elders of Israel and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers,

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:57.940
and they presented themselves before God, and Joshua said unto all the people, notice

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:04.160
what he says, thus saith the Lord God of Israel, so this is not Joshua just delivering a message

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.940
of opinion of that which he thought that they needed.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.779
He's giving them what God had for them.

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:15.140
He says, your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.260
father of Abraham and the father of Nacor, and they served other gods, and we find that

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.859
as he continues down, we're going to skip down through and look at this message that

00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:32.559
he, Joshua, would deliver to these people, and notice in verse 14, he says, now therefore,

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:38.339
after he's presented the truth in verses two through 13, he says, now therefore, fear the

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:46.339
Lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers served

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.260
on the other side of the flood and in Egypt, and serve ye the Lord.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.739
Verse 15, a very, very well-known verse of scripture, at least a portion of it, the Bible

00:05:57.739 --> 00:06:03.820
says in it, if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, notice, choose you this day whom

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.940
you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.459
of the flood or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell, but as for me and my

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.220
house, we will serve the Lord.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.859
The people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other

00:06:22.859 --> 00:06:26.739
gods, we'll look further into the chapter as we get through the message this morning,

00:06:26.739 --> 00:06:31.940
but we find that really, that latter part of verse number 15 is a very well-known phrase

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.239
of scripture, in fact, many of you probably have something within your house that may

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.959
have this portion of scripture on it, but as for me and my house, we will serve the

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:43.880
Lord.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.839
As we look at this portion of scripture this morning, and really, as we leave the revival

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:54.799
meeting that we just had, and all of those truths just really fresh on our minds, I've

00:06:54.799 --> 00:06:58.179
titled the message this morning, The Choice is Yours.

00:06:58.179 --> 00:06:59.359
The Choice is Yours.

00:06:59.359 --> 00:07:04.440
Again, as we understand the true purpose of preaching is not simply to dispense information

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.720
or facts, but it's to bring God's people to a place of decision.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:15.920
And as we go through God's word daily in our lives, as we seek and read the Bible, as we're

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.640
seeking the face of God, every day of our lives, we ought to ask ourselves the question,

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.420
what does God have for me?

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.920
What is God showing me?

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:29.179
How do I respond this morning or this evening, whenever it is that you might read the Bible

00:07:29.179 --> 00:07:31.700
personally, to what God is showing me?

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:37.220
As we gather in the house of God for the purpose of worship, we say, God, we want you to speak

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.140
to us as individuals, and then we have a choice, we have a choice.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.100
Why do we have an invitation at the end of our service?

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.059
We have an invitation to give you an opportunity to respond.

00:07:47.059 --> 00:07:51.579
You don't have to come to an old-fashioned altar to respond to the preaching of God's

00:07:51.579 --> 00:07:55.980
word, but we do not want to just have a final amen and then everything's just gone and we

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.179
run out and everything.

00:07:57.179 --> 00:08:03.339
No, we want to reflect upon what we've heard and respond to what God's done in our lives.

00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:05.980
We want to make decisions, make choices.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.540
As we look here in this portion of Scripture, if you're taking notes, number one, I want

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.380
you to notice what Joshua recognized.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.700
Notice what Joshua recognized.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:19.339
He says, now therefore fear the Lord, in verse number 14, and serve Him, the Lord, in sincerity

00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:20.700
and in truth.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:25.140
Put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt,

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.019
and serve ye the Lord.

00:08:27.019 --> 00:08:33.859
He says in verse 15, and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day

00:08:33.859 --> 00:08:36.580
whom ye will serve.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:42.500
I believe that Joshua recognized some important truth with regard to the choices that people

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.500
make.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.780
Number one, he understood the individual nature of choice.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.219
He understood that every individual had a responsibility to respond to this message

00:08:51.219 --> 00:08:52.859
that he was delivering.

00:08:52.859 --> 00:08:54.340
He's the servant of the Lord.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.299
He's the messenger of God.

00:08:56.299 --> 00:09:00.739
He's giving them the word of the Lord, and he understands that he's going to bring them

00:09:00.739 --> 00:09:06.940
to a place of decision, but there's an individual nature of choice.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:13.059
Every single person has a responsibility to respond, to make a choice with regard to what

00:09:13.059 --> 00:09:14.580
they hear.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.580
We do not believe.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:20.260
We just had in our Sunday school hour, we just spoke about individual soul liberty as

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.460
one of the points that we dealt with this morning, and I said this, that with the individual

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:30.500
soul liberty comes individual responsibility, and this morning when we see the individual

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:36.859
nature of choice, and Joshua recognizing this, he says, choose you this day whom you will

00:09:36.859 --> 00:09:37.859
serve.

00:09:37.859 --> 00:09:41.700
He's speaking to this whole congregation, and he's saying to them they have a choice

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.700
to make.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.700
I would say this.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.859
I believe that Joshua also recognized the importance of making the right choice.

00:09:48.859 --> 00:09:53.859
You know, the reality this morning is that the man Joshua, the servant of the Lord here,

00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:59.059
he understood the importance of making the right choice, but you know what he could not

00:09:59.059 --> 00:10:00.059
do is he couldn't make the right choice.

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:02.899
the right choice for every individual.

00:10:02.899 --> 00:10:03.739
Why?

00:10:03.739 --> 00:10:05.659
Because there's the individual nature of choice

00:10:05.659 --> 00:10:08.959
and just because I know, just because Joshua,

00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:12.219
just because you may know the right choice to be made,

00:10:12.219 --> 00:10:15.519
it doesn't mean that you can make it for the person.

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:16.419
Amen?

00:10:16.419 --> 00:10:20.139
Everyone has their own choice to be made

00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:22.539
and we find that Joshua understood the importance

00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:23.939
of making the right choice.

00:10:23.939 --> 00:10:26.019
He brings them to that place of decision.

00:10:26.019 --> 00:10:28.459
He lays the groundwork, the framework.

00:10:28.459 --> 00:10:31.379
He lays the foundation, he gives them the truth

00:10:31.379 --> 00:10:33.299
and he understands the importance

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:35.419
of making the right choice.

00:10:35.419 --> 00:10:37.499
Have you ever wanted to make a choice for someone else?

00:10:37.499 --> 00:10:39.659
Make a decision for someone else?

00:10:39.659 --> 00:10:42.259
You see someone that's going down a path,

00:10:42.259 --> 00:10:43.819
maybe a child or maybe someone else,

00:10:43.819 --> 00:10:44.979
you see them going down a path

00:10:44.979 --> 00:10:47.979
and they're making wrong decisions, wrong choices.

00:10:47.979 --> 00:10:50.739
You say, man, I wish I could make the choice for them,

00:10:50.739 --> 00:10:52.419
make the decision for them.

00:10:52.419 --> 00:10:54.059
But you know what you learn?

00:10:54.059 --> 00:10:54.899
You can't.

00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:56.579
You can't.

00:10:57.459 --> 00:10:59.339
But Joshua as the leader,

00:10:59.339 --> 00:11:02.739
he recognizes the importance of making the right choice.

00:11:02.739 --> 00:11:05.860
I believe he also understood and he recognized

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:10.220
the impact that our choices will have on others.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.379
You know, you think about the impact of our decisions,

00:11:12.379 --> 00:11:14.199
the impact of our choices.

00:11:14.199 --> 00:11:16.339
They not only will affect us,

00:11:16.339 --> 00:11:18.739
but they'll in fact affect, excuse me,

00:11:18.739 --> 00:11:21.419
impact future generations.

00:11:21.419 --> 00:11:24.019
They will impact, they will affect our brothers

00:11:24.019 --> 00:11:25.579
and sisters in Christ.

00:11:25.579 --> 00:11:30.299
And we find that decisions, choices have consequences,

00:11:30.299 --> 00:11:32.500
but there's also great impact.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.860
I want you to think about the book of Joshua this morning

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.739
and as you would think back to the battle at Ai

00:11:38.739 --> 00:11:40.419
and you would consider what takes place.

00:11:40.419 --> 00:11:43.099
And there were 36 men that lost their lives

00:11:43.099 --> 00:11:45.899
in that battle of Ai the first time around.

00:11:45.899 --> 00:11:47.699
And it was because the Bible tells us

00:11:47.699 --> 00:11:50.899
that there was sin in the camp.

00:11:50.899 --> 00:11:52.860
It's very interesting if you were to take the time,

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.159
we don't have the time this morning,

00:11:54.159 --> 00:11:57.639
but if you were to study through Joshua chapter number seven

00:11:57.639 --> 00:11:59.599
and you would find that that sin in the camp,

00:11:59.599 --> 00:12:01.759
it was Achan, the troubler of Israel

00:12:01.759 --> 00:12:04.079
as he's referred to in the book of First Chronicles.

00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:06.000
And we find that he was the one

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.559
that took of the accursed thing.

00:12:08.559 --> 00:12:10.880
The instruction at Jericho was clear,

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.559
the instruction was given,

00:12:12.559 --> 00:12:16.399
but he, Achan, as an individual made a choice

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:19.539
to take of the accursed thing.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.179
And I would say to you this morning

00:12:22.179 --> 00:12:26.020
that that choice affected the entire congregation.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.979
The entire nation of Israel,

00:12:27.979 --> 00:12:31.179
there was sin in the camp and it impacted them,

00:12:31.179 --> 00:12:34.059
it affected them, 36 men lost their lives.

00:12:34.059 --> 00:12:35.300
If you study through the book of Joshua,

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.099
it's the only record that we have of anyone dying

00:12:38.099 --> 00:12:42.259
in the time in which they went into the land of Canaan

00:12:42.259 --> 00:12:44.979
to conquer and to divide the land.

00:12:44.979 --> 00:12:46.940
You think about those 36 men,

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.339
you think there were families that were impacted?

00:12:50.339 --> 00:12:55.339
Those 36 men, husbands, fathers, brothers, sons, right?

00:12:56.259 --> 00:12:58.739
People are impacted, people are affected.

00:12:58.739 --> 00:13:01.619
And so I believe that Joshua is bringing the people,

00:13:01.619 --> 00:13:04.779
the congregation together here in Joshua 24.

00:13:04.779 --> 00:13:07.020
He's saying, listen, he's recognizing

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.779
the individual nature of choice,

00:13:08.779 --> 00:13:11.580
he understands the importance of making the right choice,

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.380
the correct choice, he understands the impact

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.419
that our choices are going to have on other people.

00:13:17.419 --> 00:13:19.860
I believe as you look here in the text of scripture,

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:23.300
he also understands the influence of idolatry.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.300
It's interesting how that in verse number two,

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:29.419
he talks about the gods that their fathers served.

00:13:29.419 --> 00:13:31.500
He mentions it again in verse number 14.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.979
He mentions it in verse number 15.

00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:36.899
He's dealing with this subject of idolatry

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:39.419
and dealing with the influence of idolatry.

00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:40.739
And I wanna draw your attention

00:13:40.739 --> 00:13:42.020
to what he says in verse 23.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.220
Notice what the Bible says in Joshua 24 in verse 23.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.899
After they respond, and we'll look at that

00:13:47.899 --> 00:13:49.699
in just a moment in greater detail,

00:13:49.699 --> 00:13:52.380
but I want you to see what Joshua says in verse 23.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.739
He says, now therefore put away, said he,

00:13:55.739 --> 00:13:59.339
the strange gods which are among you.

00:14:00.899 --> 00:14:04.779
And incline your heart unto the Lord God of Israel.

00:14:04.779 --> 00:14:07.220
Now it's interesting because Joshua here,

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.739
he says to put away the strange gods.

00:14:09.739 --> 00:14:13.380
Notice where he says which are among you.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:17.059
There was some truth that Joshua was aware of

00:14:17.059 --> 00:14:20.380
that there was already some that had some idols

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.380
that had them within their things, within their stuff.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.540
And he says, put away those strange gods

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.779
which are among you.

00:14:27.779 --> 00:14:29.299
By the way, if you were to go back

00:14:29.299 --> 00:14:32.700
and you look at Rachel, remember she took the images

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:36.459
of her father and she hid them amongst the stuff

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:39.540
so much so that Jacob, he's talking to Laban

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.660
and he says, search and whoever they're found with,

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.139
they can die.

00:14:43.899 --> 00:14:46.619
And Jacob didn't even know that Rachel had them,

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:47.660
but she did.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:51.579
Now she lied to her father and she made up a story

00:14:51.579 --> 00:14:53.859
and Laban didn't find them and then Laban and Jacob

00:14:53.859 --> 00:14:56.179
are arguing about it, what have you,

00:14:56.179 --> 00:15:00.220
but God knew and here Joshua says,

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.980
we think about this influence of idols and idolatry

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.899
and we know with the nation of Israel,

00:15:04.899 --> 00:15:08.019
they're constantly dealing with idolatry.

00:15:08.019 --> 00:15:10.899
As you study through the history of Israel

00:15:10.899 --> 00:15:14.260
and you see over and over the idol worship

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:19.019
and the detriment that comes as a result of their idolatry

00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:21.899
and he deals with and he explains to them

00:15:21.899 --> 00:15:25.500
the fact that they must put away those strange gods

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.019
that were among them.

00:15:27.019 --> 00:15:32.019
John says this, my little children, keep yourself from idols.

00:15:32.419 --> 00:15:33.660
Keep yourself from idols.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:38.619
We live in a time in which I believe some have the idea

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.820
that well, we don't have idols like they had idols

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.139
and we don't have the danger of idolatry

00:15:44.139 --> 00:15:46.859
like the children of Israel had the danger of idolatry,

00:15:46.859 --> 00:15:50.100
but we see that he says, keep yourself from idols.

00:15:51.019 --> 00:15:54.660
We find that Colossians 1 tells us that in all things,

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:58.179
Christ must have the preeminence and truly this morning,

00:15:58.179 --> 00:16:00.619
an idol is anything that takes first place,

00:16:00.619 --> 00:16:03.660
anything that takes place of God.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.660
There should be nothing in your life or in my life

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.899
that would take that place of primacy

00:16:07.899 --> 00:16:10.779
that belongs only to the Lord Jesus Christ

00:16:10.779 --> 00:16:14.700
that in all things, he might have the preeminence.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.179
We may not have idols like they had idols.

00:16:17.179 --> 00:16:21.339
We may not have figures that are crafted by individuals

00:16:21.339 --> 00:16:24.940
that we set into some little cabinet somewhere.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.820
We may not have that type of idol.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.980
We know of places around the globe where they still have

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.500
that type of idolatry that takes place,

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.419
but for many today, an idol in an American's life

00:16:36.419 --> 00:16:41.419
might be a job, a position, a paycheck,

00:16:41.739 --> 00:16:46.739
sports, sports, sports.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:49.779
Amen?

00:16:49.779 --> 00:16:53.500
Honestly, it becomes an idol.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.380
Things.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.940
We find this morning that as we look at the text

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.739
of scripture, we find that Joshua recognized

00:17:01.739 --> 00:17:04.739
some important truth with regard to choices,

00:17:04.739 --> 00:17:06.459
with regard to making decisions.

00:17:06.459 --> 00:17:10.579
He's bringing the people together and he's encouraging them

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:13.380
to make the right choice and he understands,

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.619
he recognizes these principles that we look to,

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:18.339
but we find that as we continue to look

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:19.579
through this portion of scripture,

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:23.500
number one, we said that we notice what Joshua recognized.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:27.040
Number two, consider the resolve of Joshua.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.500
I love this portion of scripture

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.179
and I love the resolve of Joshua.

00:17:30.179 --> 00:17:32.019
We know, as I mentioned already,

00:17:32.019 --> 00:17:33.899
that the latter part of verse number 15

00:17:33.899 --> 00:17:35.579
is a very familiar verse of scripture

00:17:35.579 --> 00:17:40.359
that many people would have on some type of material,

00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:43.019
wood or something in their home that would declare,

00:17:43.019 --> 00:17:46.100
ask for me in my house, we will serve the Lord,

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.619
but I notice the resolve of Joshua

00:17:48.619 --> 00:17:51.559
as he's bringing the people to a place of decision,

00:17:51.559 --> 00:17:54.179
as he's telling them, choose you this day

00:17:54.179 --> 00:17:55.579
whom you will serve.

00:17:55.579 --> 00:17:57.940
Notice whether the gods which your father served

00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.239
that were on the other side of the flood,

00:17:59.239 --> 00:18:00.779
he mentioned that in verse two,

00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:03.859
or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell,

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:05.540
remember they would be faced

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.299
with a bunch of idols in the land.

00:18:07.299 --> 00:18:12.299
He says this, but as for me and my house,

00:18:13.419 --> 00:18:18.380
we will serve the Lord.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:22.179
I love the resolve of Joshua as it's given to us here

00:18:22.179 --> 00:18:24.540
in this single statement of scripture.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.019
And I see this resolve.

00:18:26.019 --> 00:18:28.739
I see a man that understood the importance

00:18:28.739 --> 00:18:30.559
of him making the decision,

00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:33.219
even that he's bringing others to make.

00:18:33.219 --> 00:18:36.299
See, he's encouraging others to serve the Lord,

00:18:36.299 --> 00:18:39.940
but he himself is saying, I've made the choice to serve God.

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:43.140
I've responded to the same truth,

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.979
the same message that I'm delivering to you.

00:18:44.979 --> 00:18:47.020
I have responded to this.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.380
And by the way, that's good leadership, amen.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.500
That's good leadership on the part of Joshua

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.260
to explain that, listen, I'm not just trying to get you

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.500
to as an individual within the congregation of Israel,

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.179
the nation of Israel to make a decision.

00:19:03.179 --> 00:19:05.900
I've made a decision and I've chosen

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.200
that I'm going to serve the Lord.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.619
Me and my house, we will serve the Lord.

00:19:09.619 --> 00:19:12.299
Notice, I want you to see as we note this truth

00:19:12.299 --> 00:19:14.500
in verse 15, it's interesting.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:18.919
He made his choice known as a public choice.

00:19:20.219 --> 00:19:21.919
He didn't just keep it to himself.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.840
You know, there's accountability in that, amen.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:27.859
There's accountability.

00:19:27.859 --> 00:19:31.099
But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.

00:19:31.619 --> 00:19:32.460
All of a sudden he stands down.

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:33.279
Notice where he's standing.

00:19:33.279 --> 00:19:35.260
He's called all the people together and check him.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.460
We see it in verse one.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.179
In verse two, he addresses the people.

00:19:38.179 --> 00:19:40.219
There's a huge group of people that are here

00:19:40.219 --> 00:19:42.460
that he's addressing and he says to these people,

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.340
but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.140
That's resolve.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.539
But I want you to know that as he's made his decision

00:19:50.539 --> 00:19:54.140
known publicly, that there's an aspect of accountability.

00:19:54.979 --> 00:19:57.299
There are some times in which a decision that is made,

00:19:57.299 --> 00:19:59.739
a choice that is made by an individual believer,

00:19:59.739 --> 00:20:03.279
should be a personal, it should be a personal decision,

00:20:03.279 --> 00:20:05.659
a personal choice, but I want you to understand

00:20:05.659 --> 00:20:08.579
that at times when we make choices in responding

00:20:08.579 --> 00:20:10.719
to what God tells us in his word,

00:20:10.719 --> 00:20:12.719
that at times there's a huge benefit

00:20:12.719 --> 00:20:16.119
in making that choice known publicly,

00:20:16.119 --> 00:20:17.679
because there's accountability.

00:20:17.679 --> 00:20:18.999
There's accountability.

00:20:18.999 --> 00:20:22.199
Listen, by the way, accountability is a good thing.

00:20:22.199 --> 00:20:23.839
It's good to be held accountable.

00:20:25.199 --> 00:20:27.159
I remember as I was in Bible college,

00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:29.099
I remember a fella that said to me,

00:20:29.099 --> 00:20:30.979
he went to our church, he didn't go to the college,

00:20:30.979 --> 00:20:32.379
he went to church, and he said,

00:20:32.379 --> 00:20:34.839
he came to me after a special meeting that we had,

00:20:34.839 --> 00:20:35.819
he said, I wanna know if you'd be

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:37.979
an accountability partner for me.

00:20:37.979 --> 00:20:40.119
That was a great idea, a great opportunity,

00:20:40.119 --> 00:20:41.979
and we would keep each other accountable,

00:20:41.979 --> 00:20:43.659
and all of a sudden I realized real quick

00:20:43.659 --> 00:20:46.059
that he really didn't wanna be accountable,

00:20:46.059 --> 00:20:47.719
because all of a sudden I would try to give him

00:20:47.719 --> 00:20:49.739
phone calls and text messages and just ask,

00:20:49.739 --> 00:20:51.659
how are things going, and I wasn't trying to be a pest,

00:20:51.659 --> 00:20:53.339
I was just trying to keep him accountable

00:20:53.339 --> 00:20:55.279
and help him in his walk with God,

00:20:55.279 --> 00:20:57.219
and he said to me, he said,

00:20:57.219 --> 00:20:58.819
I wanna read my Bible every day.

00:20:58.819 --> 00:21:00.339
I've been struggling with reading my Bible.

00:21:00.339 --> 00:21:01.459
I wanna read my Bible every day.

00:21:01.459 --> 00:21:02.339
I wanna pray every day.

00:21:02.339 --> 00:21:04.219
I haven't prayed like I should,

00:21:04.219 --> 00:21:05.339
and I wanna do these things,

00:21:05.339 --> 00:21:07.659
and so I'm trying to help him to stay accountable,

00:21:07.659 --> 00:21:09.659
and then he'd just stop answering my phone calls.

00:21:09.659 --> 00:21:12.639
He'd stop responding to text messages.

00:21:12.639 --> 00:21:14.259
Unfortunately, that young man today

00:21:14.259 --> 00:21:15.579
is actually older than I am,

00:21:15.579 --> 00:21:18.399
is nowhere near a church this morning.

00:21:18.399 --> 00:21:19.819
It's very sad.

00:21:19.819 --> 00:21:20.819
Breaks your heart.

00:21:21.879 --> 00:21:24.499
It's a good thing to have an accountability

00:21:24.859 --> 00:21:26.599
to brothers and sisters in Christ.

00:21:26.599 --> 00:21:29.159
Maybe your spouse is probably one of the best people

00:21:29.159 --> 00:21:30.639
to have accountability to,

00:21:30.639 --> 00:21:32.119
and you know what happens sometimes?

00:21:32.119 --> 00:21:34.639
We get angry when we get asked questions

00:21:34.639 --> 00:21:36.019
about being accountable.

00:21:37.799 --> 00:21:39.079
It sounds good to be accountable,

00:21:39.079 --> 00:21:41.559
but then all of a sudden we gotta answer a question.

00:21:41.559 --> 00:21:43.119
I've said this for years.

00:21:43.119 --> 00:21:47.799
Counsel is getting answers to your questions.

00:21:47.799 --> 00:21:49.779
Accountability is answering the questions

00:21:49.779 --> 00:21:53.539
that are asked of you, and there's a difference,

00:21:53.539 --> 00:21:56.039
and this morning we find that Joshua,

00:21:56.039 --> 00:21:59.279
the resolve of Joshua, but he makes his choice known,

00:21:59.279 --> 00:22:01.199
and there's a measure of accountability in that.

00:22:01.199 --> 00:22:04.039
Yes, there's an aspect of good leadership in that,

00:22:04.039 --> 00:22:06.399
and letting the people know that he's made his choice.

00:22:06.399 --> 00:22:07.439
I want you to note with me

00:22:07.439 --> 00:22:09.559
that not only did he make his choice known,

00:22:09.559 --> 00:22:12.159
but he did not wait for the people to respond

00:22:12.159 --> 00:22:14.399
before he made his choice.

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:15.959
Listen, don't wait for someone else

00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:17.839
to make a decision to follow Christ.

00:22:17.839 --> 00:22:20.079
You decide I'm gonna follow Christ.

00:22:20.079 --> 00:22:23.039
Don't wait for someone else to move in an invitation

00:22:23.539 --> 00:22:24.739
when God speaks to your heart,

00:22:24.739 --> 00:22:28.379
when God moves in your life about something specifically.

00:22:28.379 --> 00:22:31.419
You don't have to wait for somebody else to respond

00:22:31.419 --> 00:22:33.439
and then say, oh yeah, I think I'll respond as well.

00:22:33.439 --> 00:22:36.619
No, I'm responding to God.

00:22:36.619 --> 00:22:40.539
I'm not responding because somebody else responded.

00:22:40.539 --> 00:22:42.059
I'm not making the choice

00:22:42.059 --> 00:22:43.659
because someone else made the choice.

00:22:43.659 --> 00:22:46.259
No, I'm gonna make the determination.

00:22:46.259 --> 00:22:50.459
The Bible says I have decided to follow Jesus.

00:22:50.599 --> 00:22:53.359
The song says I have decided to follow Jesus.

00:22:53.359 --> 00:22:55.479
You think about the decision with that songwriter.

00:22:55.479 --> 00:22:57.959
He says, though none go with me,

00:22:59.559 --> 00:23:02.099
still I will follow.

00:23:03.319 --> 00:23:06.119
Though none go with me, still I will follow.

00:23:06.119 --> 00:23:08.759
See, this morning as we think about the work of God

00:23:08.759 --> 00:23:09.919
and the way in which he works

00:23:09.919 --> 00:23:11.719
in the hearts and lives of his people,

00:23:11.719 --> 00:23:14.879
our God is an individual God.

00:23:14.879 --> 00:23:16.399
I love that.

00:23:16.399 --> 00:23:18.959
When we talked and we dealt with earlier in the year

00:23:18.979 --> 00:23:21.619
about God's love and we spoke about defining

00:23:21.619 --> 00:23:23.279
and describing the love of God,

00:23:23.279 --> 00:23:25.619
we said that God's love is universal

00:23:25.619 --> 00:23:27.459
for God so loved the world.

00:23:27.459 --> 00:23:28.739
And I'm thankful for that,

00:23:28.739 --> 00:23:30.899
but God's love is individual

00:23:30.899 --> 00:23:34.539
in the fact that he loves me as an individual.

00:23:34.539 --> 00:23:36.659
And as our God being an individual God,

00:23:36.659 --> 00:23:37.499
you know what he does?

00:23:37.499 --> 00:23:39.379
He works and speaks in your heart

00:23:39.379 --> 00:23:40.899
and he works and speaks in your heart

00:23:40.899 --> 00:23:41.979
and he works and speaks.

00:23:41.979 --> 00:23:46.419
And God is able to take a message from his word

00:23:46.419 --> 00:23:48.479
and minister to every individual

00:23:48.479 --> 00:23:52.719
that's gathered together in a specific personal way.

00:23:52.719 --> 00:23:55.199
It's amazing what God is able to do.

00:23:55.199 --> 00:23:57.839
There's no way that a speaker,

00:23:57.839 --> 00:23:59.519
someone that's just going to get up

00:23:59.519 --> 00:24:04.399
and try to speak and give some kind of a message,

00:24:04.399 --> 00:24:07.559
they can't meet, I don't know everyone's need.

00:24:09.119 --> 00:24:11.639
But as I seek to follow the Lord

00:24:11.639 --> 00:24:13.779
and seek to hear the voice of God

00:24:13.779 --> 00:24:16.160
with regard to the message that's to be delivered,

00:24:16.899 --> 00:24:18.899
then the Holy Spirit of God can use his word

00:24:18.899 --> 00:24:21.859
and he can minister to each individual

00:24:21.859 --> 00:24:23.059
that's gathered together.

00:24:23.059 --> 00:24:25.539
It's amazing what God can do.

00:24:25.539 --> 00:24:27.819
Joshua's speaking as he says,

00:24:27.819 --> 00:24:30.220
here's what God says, he's giving God's word,

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.739
he's challenging the people.

00:24:32.739 --> 00:24:34.639
There are times in which I've heard,

00:24:34.639 --> 00:24:37.479
I've experienced in the 12 years of pastoring here

00:24:37.479 --> 00:24:38.319
where someone would say,

00:24:38.319 --> 00:24:40.859
man, this really helped me in the message today,

00:24:40.859 --> 00:24:41.979
I made this choice and I'm like,

00:24:41.979 --> 00:24:44.179
I didn't even know I said that this morning.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:50.500
God was working, God's at work.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.299
And so when we understand that God works individually,

00:24:53.299 --> 00:24:54.739
that he's an individual God,

00:24:54.739 --> 00:24:56.500
then God's working in your life

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.339
with regard to decisions and choices

00:24:58.339 --> 00:25:00.459
that you need to make and we can go around

00:25:00.459 --> 00:25:02.739
and we can say that about every single individual

00:25:02.739 --> 00:25:04.619
and so we understand this morning

00:25:04.619 --> 00:25:06.139
that Joshua, there's resolve,

00:25:06.139 --> 00:25:07.899
he says, ask for me in my house,

00:25:07.899 --> 00:25:09.819
we will serve the Lord.

00:25:09.819 --> 00:25:11.899
He makes that known, it's public,

00:25:11.899 --> 00:25:14.819
he tells everyone but he also makes the decision

00:25:14.819 --> 00:25:16.880
before the people respond.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.239
He says, I want you to know that your response

00:25:19.239 --> 00:25:22.599
to this message has no bearing on my choice

00:25:23.819 --> 00:25:26.160
because we're gonna serve God.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.059
If all of you walk out, if all of you say,

00:25:28.059 --> 00:25:29.199
no, we're gonna go ahead and serve

00:25:29.199 --> 00:25:30.399
the gods of the Amorites,

00:25:30.399 --> 00:25:32.079
no, we're gonna go ahead and serve the,

00:25:32.079 --> 00:25:35.940
I'm serving God, amen?

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.720
And that's the way it should be.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.759
We're not waiting for, listen,

00:25:38.759 --> 00:25:40.639
I understand that it's nice when other people

00:25:40.639 --> 00:25:43.479
are going in the same direction that you're going, amen?

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.119
It's nice when other people are going

00:25:46.119 --> 00:25:47.440
in the same direction and they're making

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.919
the same choice and the same decisions

00:25:48.919 --> 00:25:51.799
and they're responding but God's an individual God

00:25:51.799 --> 00:25:53.959
and he's working in our hearts individually

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.880
and we see that Joshua makes that known.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.279
Notice with me, not only do we find

00:26:00.279 --> 00:26:02.519
that he's made it known publicly

00:26:02.519 --> 00:26:05.799
that he made the choice even before the people responded

00:26:05.799 --> 00:26:09.239
but I would say this, his choice was the right choice.

00:26:09.239 --> 00:26:10.639
Would you agree?

00:26:10.639 --> 00:26:12.559
He made the right choice.

00:26:12.559 --> 00:26:14.599
We're gonna serve God.

00:26:15.259 --> 00:26:16.299
We're gonna serve the Lord.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.099
What a great choice.

00:26:19.099 --> 00:26:21.500
You know, you're never gonna regret serving God.

00:26:22.859 --> 00:26:25.720
You never will regret serving God.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.539
You're never going to regret following

00:26:28.539 --> 00:26:31.899
the leadership of the Holy Spirit of God in your life.

00:26:31.899 --> 00:26:34.179
You're never gonna regret responding

00:26:34.179 --> 00:26:35.940
to what thus saith the Lord.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.720
We may regret not responding properly.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:45.639
We may regret not doing what God called us to do,

00:26:45.639 --> 00:26:47.500
what God prompted us to do

00:26:48.459 --> 00:26:50.979
but you're never gonna regret following the Lord.

00:26:50.979 --> 00:26:52.899
I believe that with all my heart this morning.

00:26:52.899 --> 00:26:55.720
You're not gonna ever regret following the Lord.

00:26:56.699 --> 00:26:59.859
We find this morning that this choice of Joshua,

00:26:59.859 --> 00:27:01.319
this was the right choice.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.539
We need to be careful that in our lives

00:27:05.539 --> 00:27:08.859
that we're diligent to make the right choice,

00:27:08.859 --> 00:27:11.279
to make the choice that's aligned

00:27:11.279 --> 00:27:13.839
with what the Bible teaches,

00:27:13.839 --> 00:27:18.839
that we would not be concerned with the crowd,

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.319
with the popularity.

00:27:21.319 --> 00:27:25.019
We don't take a straw poll to see what the majority

00:27:25.019 --> 00:27:26.059
of the people wanna do.

00:27:26.059 --> 00:27:28.039
No, we say we're gonna follow the Lord.

00:27:28.039 --> 00:27:32.000
If God before us, who can be against us?

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.160
And we understand this morning that Joshua,

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.539
he makes this choice and what a blessing

00:27:36.559 --> 00:27:39.519
to consider this morning, the resolve of Joshua.

00:27:39.519 --> 00:27:41.619
As we continue through the passage of scripture,

00:27:41.619 --> 00:27:42.459
number three this morning,

00:27:42.459 --> 00:27:44.399
we noticed the response of the people.

00:27:44.399 --> 00:27:45.559
They made a choice.

00:27:45.559 --> 00:27:47.599
They had a choice to make and they made a choice.

00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:49.160
The Bible says in verse 16

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.000
and we'll read down through verse number 24.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:51.839
Notice the Bible says,

00:27:51.839 --> 00:27:53.720
and the people answered and said,

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.279
God forbid that we should forsake the Lord

00:27:56.279 --> 00:27:57.559
to serve other gods.

00:27:57.559 --> 00:27:58.839
That's a good answer.

00:27:58.839 --> 00:28:00.880
It says in verse 17, for the Lord, our God,

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:04.440
he it is that brought us up and our fathers

00:28:04.459 --> 00:28:07.459
out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage

00:28:07.459 --> 00:28:10.019
and which did those great signs in our sight

00:28:10.019 --> 00:28:13.459
and preserved us in all the way wherein we went

00:28:13.459 --> 00:28:15.500
and among all the people through whom we passed.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:16.819
Are they correct in what they're saying?

00:28:16.819 --> 00:28:17.880
Absolutely.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.559
They're saying it's God that brought us out

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:21.660
from the land of Egypt.

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.819
And we can think about all of the signs and wonders

00:28:24.819 --> 00:28:26.859
that God did in bringing them out of Egypt.

00:28:26.859 --> 00:28:29.940
He said, they say that did those great signs.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:34.119
Notice in verse 17, in our sight, they saw what God did.

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:35.659
They saw his greatness.

00:28:35.659 --> 00:28:37.380
They observed his power.

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.779
And it says that he not only did those great works

00:28:40.779 --> 00:28:43.440
to be able to bring us out of bondage,

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.779
but it says in preserved us

00:28:45.779 --> 00:28:47.619
in all the way wherein we went.

00:28:47.619 --> 00:28:49.640
You think about their journey from Egypt

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.500
to where they stand today in Joshua 24

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.219
as Joshua is addressing these people.

00:28:55.219 --> 00:28:57.219
And you think about the wilderness wanderings

00:28:57.219 --> 00:28:58.940
and you think about the entrance into

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.500
and the conquering of the land of Canaan,

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.059
the division of the land of Canaan.

00:29:03.059 --> 00:29:07.159
And they stand there and they say, God has preserved us.

00:29:07.159 --> 00:29:08.339
They're right.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.239
It says in verse 18,

00:29:12.239 --> 00:29:14.979
and the Lord drave out from before us all the people,

00:29:14.979 --> 00:29:16.799
even the Amorites, which dwelt in the land.

00:29:16.799 --> 00:29:21.799
Therefore, will we also serve the Lord for he is our God.

00:29:21.919 --> 00:29:22.880
Did God do that?

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.640
Yes, he promised to do it and he did.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:29.279
And we find that in verses 17 and 18,

00:29:29.299 --> 00:29:33.739
they're responding appropriately to this message

00:29:33.739 --> 00:29:35.419
that Joshua has delivered.

00:29:35.419 --> 00:29:38.459
And they're saying, we will serve the Lord

00:29:38.459 --> 00:29:40.159
for he is our God.

00:29:40.159 --> 00:29:42.059
And Joshua said to the people in verse 19,

00:29:42.059 --> 00:29:44.700
you cannot serve the Lord for he is an holy God.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:45.599
He's a jealous God.

00:29:45.599 --> 00:29:48.099
He will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.

00:29:48.099 --> 00:29:50.539
If you forsake the Lord and serve strange gods,

00:29:50.539 --> 00:29:54.739
then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you.

00:29:54.739 --> 00:29:57.260
After that, he hath done you good.

00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:00.279
And that's interesting as you read that verse of scripture.

00:30:00.279 --> 00:30:05.879
those verses of scripture there in verse 19 and 20 as Joshua is responding to the people

00:30:05.879 --> 00:30:09.239
and he's helping them to understand, you know, the Bible tells us in Exodus 20 that our God's

00:30:09.239 --> 00:30:18.759
a jealous God. He alone is worthy of our worship. Listen, God will not share His glory with

00:30:18.759 --> 00:30:28.359
any other. Amen? He will not share His glory with any other. He alone is holy. He alone

00:30:28.439 --> 00:30:35.319
is worthy. And we find that Joshua is trying to help these people understand the seriousness

00:30:35.319 --> 00:30:40.119
of the decision that is before them and understanding the seriousness of the consequences of following

00:30:40.119 --> 00:30:44.519
strange gods and getting wrapped up in idolatry. If you were to read through, and we don't

00:30:44.519 --> 00:30:49.679
have time this morning, but to consider the book of Judges, there was a generation that

00:30:49.679 --> 00:30:53.959
died Joshua and that generation they died and you begin to read through the book of

00:30:53.959 --> 00:31:01.039
Judges and you begin to see how they served idols. And what happened? Well, God raised

00:31:01.039 --> 00:31:10.879
up some people groups that brought His people under oppression. He brought judgment. Notice

00:31:10.879 --> 00:31:14.919
it says in verse 20, if you forsake the Lord and serve strange gods then He will turn and

00:31:14.919 --> 00:31:20.919
do you hurt and consume you after that He hath done you good. He's the one that brought

00:31:20.919 --> 00:31:25.279
them into the land. He's the one that's provided for them as He promised to do so. But if you

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:29.759
read in the book of Judges you find that God was the one that would raise up these people

00:31:29.759 --> 00:31:35.719
groups that would oppress the nation of Israel. Yes, God was faithful and He was merciful

00:31:35.719 --> 00:31:41.739
and He was gracious to raise up a judge when His people would turn to Him. I'm thankful

00:31:41.739 --> 00:31:48.319
that our God is long-suffering. He's ready to pardon and ready to forgive. I think about

00:31:48.319 --> 00:31:55.199
Jeremiah. As Jeremiah is brought in and of course he was faithfully preaching about the

00:31:55.199 --> 00:32:00.359
Babylonian captivity and we find that he's telling them, listen, this is the result of

00:32:00.359 --> 00:32:05.639
your sin. This is the consequence for the choices that you have made. You're following

00:32:05.639 --> 00:32:13.079
idols. You're serving strange gods. You're forgetting and forsaking the Lord your God

00:32:13.119 --> 00:32:18.439
and all these things that they're guilty of. The nation of Judah and Jeremiah is preaching

00:32:18.439 --> 00:32:23.639
and yet we find that on more than one occasion Jeremiah would be challenged with regard to

00:32:23.639 --> 00:32:28.399
the message that he's delivering. The king comes to him and says, hey, do you have a

00:32:28.399 --> 00:32:32.919
word from God? As if there's something different that Jeremiah is going to tell him. No, you're

00:32:32.919 --> 00:32:36.479
going to be conquered. You're going to be destroyed. You're going to be taken captive.

00:32:36.479 --> 00:32:41.879
Why? Because of your sin. At one point the people come to Jeremiah and they say, is God

00:32:41.919 --> 00:32:48.919
going to fight for us? No. Jeremiah says, God's going to fight against you. That's heavy.

00:32:52.439 --> 00:32:59.439
That's heavy. Why was God going to fight against them? Because of their idolatry? Because of

00:32:59.479 --> 00:33:05.199
their sin? Let me say it this way, because of the choices that they made. And this morning

00:33:05.199 --> 00:33:09.799
when we look here at this book of Joshua and this challenge, he's telling the people, listen,

00:33:09.799 --> 00:33:14.639
the gravity of this decision, this choice that is before them, and we find that the

00:33:14.639 --> 00:33:19.719
people then respond to Joshua in verse 21 and they say, nay, but we will serve the Lord.

00:33:19.719 --> 00:33:24.799
We see a measure of resolve there in verse 21, even amongst the people that Joshua is

00:33:24.799 --> 00:33:29.759
speaking to. And he says in verse 22, ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have

00:33:29.759 --> 00:33:36.679
chosen you, the Lord, to serve him. And they said, we are witnesses. Now therefore, we

00:33:36.679 --> 00:33:41.119
referenced verse 23 a moment ago, he says, now therefore, put away, said he, the strange

00:33:41.119 --> 00:33:47.759
gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the Lord God of Israel. It's interesting

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:52.839
that even as they were saying that we're going to serve the Lord, that it seems as you look

00:33:52.839 --> 00:33:57.119
at the passage here that there were some that even had idols within their stuff. Because

00:33:57.119 --> 00:34:01.719
he says, put away the strange gods which are among you. Verse 24, and the people said unto

00:34:01.719 --> 00:34:08.239
Joshua, the Lord our God, will we serve in his voice? Will we obey? I want you to notice

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:14.999
that in verse number 24. That's a good statement. As much as we appreciate the statement of

00:34:14.999 --> 00:34:19.719
Joshua in verse 25, but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord, we notice at the end

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:25.719
of verse number 24 that the people say to Joshua, the Lord our God, will we serve in

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:33.959
his voice? Will we obey? That's a good statement. That's a good proclamation. That's the right

00:34:33.959 --> 00:34:39.319
choice. This morning as we begin to think about the choice is yours and begin to think

00:34:39.319 --> 00:34:46.079
about the text here in Joshua 24, but then also bringing to mind that which we have heard

00:34:46.079 --> 00:34:50.719
in the last week with various messages during the revival meeting. Again, if you were here

00:34:50.719 --> 00:34:56.199
for the duration of the revival meeting hearing six messages with the preaching, again, not

00:34:56.199 --> 00:35:01.599
just to give out information, to dispense information, but to bring God's people to

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:08.239
a place of decision. Perhaps in that moment of invitation during one of those services

00:35:08.239 --> 00:35:11.919
that there were choices that were made, there were decisions that were made, there were

00:35:11.919 --> 00:35:16.759
people that responded, but at times the Holy Spirit of God, listen, I'm thankful that the

00:35:16.759 --> 00:35:20.839
Holy Spirit will continue to work in our hearts and lives even after we've heard the

00:35:20.839 --> 00:35:25.399
message. Maybe we didn't respond right away. Maybe there was a measure of delay and the

00:35:25.399 --> 00:35:29.039
Holy Spirit just keeps bringing something back to our mind and he keeps reminding us

00:35:29.039 --> 00:35:36.399
of the truth and what we need to do and how we need to respond. Moses says this in Exodus

00:35:36.399 --> 00:35:44.359
chapter 32 and verse number 26, who is on the Lord's side? Who's on the Lord's side?

00:35:44.359 --> 00:35:48.759
We sing that song, who is on the Lord's side, and we understand that as we sing it and we

00:35:48.759 --> 00:35:54.359
enjoy the opportunity to sing it, but we find that Moses made that question known in Exodus

00:35:54.359 --> 00:35:58.679
32 after the people, you know what they did? They had just received the Ten Commandments,

00:35:58.679 --> 00:36:02.559
the law, they got all this instruction with regard to the tabernacle and they made this

00:36:02.559 --> 00:36:08.519
covenant with God and in Exodus chapter 32 they break the covenant. They disobey God.

00:36:08.519 --> 00:36:16.399
They're serving a calf, an idol, right? That's what they're doing in Exodus 32. And as Moses

00:36:16.399 --> 00:36:19.839
and Joshua are coming down, remember God tells them get down there into the camp and they're

00:36:19.839 --> 00:36:25.119
coming and Joshua says it's like a sound of war and Moses is going in response and they

00:36:25.119 --> 00:36:34.679
come and the people, they have defiled themselves. Moses says, who is on the Lord's side? Who

00:36:34.679 --> 00:36:42.519
is on the Lord's side? I think about Elijah in 1 Kings chapter 18 and verse number 21.

00:36:42.519 --> 00:36:47.759
We're familiar with the text of scripture when Elijah has that opportunity at Mount

00:36:47.759 --> 00:36:52.679
Carmel to have that fire come from heaven, but before the fire ever comes from heaven

00:36:52.679 --> 00:36:57.879
and consumes the offering, he stands before the people that are gathered together and

00:36:57.879 --> 00:37:07.079
he says, how long halt ye between two opinions? If God be God, follow him, but if Baal, then

00:37:07.079 --> 00:37:10.479
follow him. You know what the Bible says in that portion of scripture, they answered him

00:37:10.479 --> 00:37:18.319
not a word. Can I tell you that that's a choice? No choice is a choice. You say, well that

00:37:18.319 --> 00:37:23.399
doesn't make sense. No, it is. You're making a choice that you're not going to respond.

00:37:23.399 --> 00:37:30.959
You're making a choice that you're going to put off, to delay. I want you to turn to

00:37:30.959 --> 00:37:34.239
the book of Deuteronomy if you will very quickly. We're going to look at two passages of scripture

00:37:34.239 --> 00:37:38.119
as we close this morning in Deuteronomy chapter number 11 and then we'll go over to Deuteronomy

00:37:38.119 --> 00:37:48.359
chapter number 30. Look in Deuteronomy chapter number 11 if you will. You go back in history

00:37:48.359 --> 00:37:52.319
as you come back to the book of Deuteronomy as Moses is giving the instruction to the

00:37:52.319 --> 00:37:55.999
children of Israel before they would enter into the land. Of course Joshua, as we're

00:37:55.999 --> 00:38:00.959
looking at Joshua 24, he would become the human leader of the nation of Israel. Of course

00:38:00.959 --> 00:38:05.159
God was their leader but humanly speaking he would lead the nation of Israel. Moses

00:38:05.159 --> 00:38:09.599
was not permitted to enter into the land of promise. He was told to speak to the rock

00:38:09.599 --> 00:38:15.279
but he smote it and God would not allow him to enter into the land of promise and he died.

00:38:15.279 --> 00:38:19.319
We read that in the book of Deuteronomy as far as his death is concerned. But we find

00:38:19.319 --> 00:38:24.839
that as he's preparing the people for entrance into the land that God had promised them,

00:38:24.839 --> 00:38:28.999
we find that on two occasions, and we'll look at both of these this morning very quickly,

00:38:28.999 --> 00:38:33.119
but he brings the people again to the same place that Joshua was bringing the people

00:38:33.119 --> 00:38:37.439
and speaking of this idea the choice is yours. Notice in verse 26, the Bible says this in

00:38:37.439 --> 00:38:43.599
Deuteronomy 11 and verse 26. Behold I set before you this day a blessing and a curse.

00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:46.759
A blessing if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you this

00:38:46.759 --> 00:38:50.799
day and a curse if you will not obey the commandments of the Lord your God but turn

00:38:50.799 --> 00:38:55.119
aside out of the way which I command you this day to go after other gods which you have

00:38:55.119 --> 00:39:01.059
not known. As we look at these two, three verses of scripture, verse 26 to verse 28,

00:39:01.059 --> 00:39:05.519
we see that Moses is saying to the people I'm setting before you, listen, a blessing

00:39:05.519 --> 00:39:10.979
and a curse. But in verse 27 and again in verse 28 he gives the instruction with regard

00:39:10.979 --> 00:39:16.399
to here's the choice that will lead to blessing and here's the choice that will lead to a

00:39:16.439 --> 00:39:22.719
curse. Now it seems pretty obvious doesn't it? And I was going to use an object lesson

00:39:22.719 --> 00:39:26.799
this morning but I chose not to and I was going to use an object lesson and sometimes

00:39:26.799 --> 00:39:30.599
when you have a choice you don't know what the consequence of your choice is going to

00:39:30.599 --> 00:39:34.839
be. So he says hey choose and I was going to have up here this table with all these

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:38.919
solo cups, you know the cups that we drink drinks out of and I was going to put some

00:39:38.919 --> 00:39:43.319
money under one of them so that somebody could pick a cup and they'd get some money. But

00:39:43.479 --> 00:39:48.439
here's the object lesson if you think about it. If I have 50 cups up here and I tell Tim

00:39:48.439 --> 00:39:52.599
you pick a cup under one of them there's a $20 bill if you pick it you can have it. His

00:39:52.599 --> 00:39:59.599
odds are pretty low. Right? One of 50. Pretty low odds. Now he may or may not and if I pick

00:39:59.599 --> 00:40:03.239
put them all up here and he picked the right cup it would just destroy my object lesson

00:40:03.239 --> 00:40:09.679
and so that's why I didn't do it this morning. But if he picked, likely he would pick the

00:40:09.679 --> 00:40:17.359
wrong cup, it'd be empty. But here's what God does. If I could use that same object

00:40:17.359 --> 00:40:21.639
lesson this morning and in your mind you can see it this morning, what God does is we see

00:40:21.639 --> 00:40:26.159
here in Moses addressing the people of Israel, he says, I set before you this day a blessing

00:40:26.159 --> 00:40:34.439
and a curse. A blessing if you obey. A curse is the result of disobedience. So if we were

00:40:34.439 --> 00:40:38.399
to use that object lesson this morning, I'd say to Tim, Tim, there are 50 cups up here

00:40:38.399 --> 00:40:43.039
and one of them has a $20 bill under it. If you pick that one you can keep the $20 bill.

00:40:43.039 --> 00:40:49.039
Now Tim, before you choose, let me show you, this is the cup that has $20 underneath of

00:40:49.039 --> 00:40:54.279
it, okay. So Tim, you're going to pick whatever one you want out of these 50 cups but this

00:40:54.359 --> 00:40:58.359
is the one I'm showing you. Can you see the $20 bill? This is the one that has the $20

00:40:58.359 --> 00:41:02.799
bill and I put the cup back down and I say, now you choose. Now if he picked one of the

00:41:02.799 --> 00:41:14.079
other 49 cups, what would you think about Tim? She said he's stupid. Oh man. But you

00:41:14.079 --> 00:41:21.839
would think, what is he thinking? You just showed him. Is that what you would think?

00:41:21.839 --> 00:41:25.459
So what would you expect Tim to do if we went through that same process that I just

00:41:25.459 --> 00:41:29.399
revealed and I said, Tim, now remember Tim, it's this cup right here. I showed you already,

00:41:29.399 --> 00:41:33.839
now it's this one. What would you expect Tim to do? He would pick that cup up, he'd get

00:41:33.839 --> 00:41:42.839
$20 and he'd go have lunch somewhere. God says, I set before you this day a blessing

00:41:42.839 --> 00:41:51.479
and a curse. A blessing if you obey. But obey what? Well obey my commandments and by the

00:41:51.479 --> 00:42:00.839
way I've given them all to you. I've preserved them for you. A curse if you disobey. Disobey

00:42:00.839 --> 00:42:06.719
what? My commandments and by the way I've preserved them for you. And so God has done

00:42:06.719 --> 00:42:15.399
his part to really make it simple for us. He says, I've given you all the commandments.

00:42:15.399 --> 00:42:23.399
If you obey them, there's a blessing. If you disobey them, there's a curse. But the

00:42:23.399 --> 00:42:29.459
choice is yours. The choice is yours. As much as I could try to help Tim to make the right

00:42:29.459 --> 00:42:33.839
choice in picking the right cup, as much as some in the audience might say, no, no, no,

00:42:33.839 --> 00:42:37.639
not that one, not that one, pick that, he already showed you, right? If you brought

00:42:37.639 --> 00:42:41.959
a real little kid up here, maybe there was a cup that was pink and they just like pink

00:42:41.959 --> 00:42:44.959
and they're going to pick the pink cup because that's the one that they like the most and

00:42:44.959 --> 00:42:50.159
you're saying, no, no, no, no, no, no. You can't make the choice for them. And I feel

00:42:50.159 --> 00:42:58.259
like at times that God's saying, my child, my child, I've given you, I've provided you

00:42:58.259 --> 00:43:07.199
with the commandments, the truth of my word. Why are you making those choices? Why are

00:43:07.199 --> 00:43:16.359
you choosing to disobey? Choose to obey, choose to follow, choose to submit. God says

00:43:16.359 --> 00:43:23.359
this in his word that in keeping of them, in Psalm 19, a familiar passage of scripture,

00:43:23.359 --> 00:43:27.939
the law of the Lord is perfect and we're familiar with the portion of scripture and we rejoice.

00:43:27.939 --> 00:43:32.919
And it says that, moreover, by them as thy servant warned and in keeping of them there

00:43:32.919 --> 00:43:44.519
is great reward. I want the blessing. I want the great reward. I want God's favor. But

00:43:44.519 --> 00:43:51.119
it comes through obedience. Notice in Deuteronomy chapter 30, we'll close here with Deuteronomy

00:43:51.119 --> 00:44:06.259
chapter number 30. I love what God says here through Moses. He's speaking to the people

00:44:06.259 --> 00:44:10.839
beginning in verse number 11. I really want to get to verse 19. I may not read all of

00:44:10.839 --> 00:44:14.599
the portion, but we'll read starting in verse number 11 and we'll eventually get to verse

00:44:14.599 --> 00:44:20.399
19. It says, for this commandment which I command thee this day, notice what it says,

00:44:20.399 --> 00:44:27.839
it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. You ought to thank God for that.

00:44:27.839 --> 00:44:34.479
Verse number 11, you ought to thank God that His commandments are not hidden from us, that

00:44:34.479 --> 00:44:40.159
they're not far off. Could you imagine if you were held accountable for something that

00:44:40.159 --> 00:44:45.159
you did not know? Could you imagine if you were held accountable for something that was

00:44:45.159 --> 00:44:51.479
not communicated to you? That would be tough. But God has been faithful. He said all scripture

00:44:51.479 --> 00:44:56.319
is given by inspiration of God, but then He said He would preserve it for every generation.

00:44:56.319 --> 00:45:01.799
I'm so thankful for God's Word. And Moses says here to the children of Israel, for this

00:45:01.799 --> 00:45:06.039
commandment which I command thee this day is not hidden from thee, neither is it far

00:45:06.039 --> 00:45:10.199
off. God has been faithful to give it. Moses has been a faithful servant to deliver it.

00:45:10.199 --> 00:45:13.559
Notice in verse 12, it is not in heaven that thou shouldst say, who shall go up for us

00:45:13.559 --> 00:45:17.279
to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it? Neither is it beyond the

00:45:17.279 --> 00:45:20.999
sea that thou shouldst say, who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we

00:45:20.999 --> 00:45:26.439
may hear it and do it? But the Word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thine heart

00:45:26.439 --> 00:45:34.279
that thou mayest do it. Wow. Praise the Lord. Verse 15, see I have set before thee this

00:45:34.279 --> 00:45:38.919
day life and good and death and evil, that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy

00:45:38.919 --> 00:45:43.359
God, to walk in His ways and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His judgments that thou

00:45:43.359 --> 00:45:48.119
mayest live and multiply. And the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou

00:45:48.119 --> 00:45:54.119
goest to possess it. Look at verse 19, I call heaven and earth to record this day against

00:45:54.119 --> 00:46:02.239
you that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Therefore, choose life

00:46:02.239 --> 00:46:09.719
that both thou and thy seed may live. Remember we mentioned about what Joshua recognized

00:46:09.759 --> 00:46:15.799
with regard to the choice, the individual nature of choice. But we also spoke about

00:46:15.799 --> 00:46:19.839
the importance of making the right choice. Notice Moses saying, I call heaven and earth

00:46:19.839 --> 00:46:23.439
to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death, blessing and

00:46:23.439 --> 00:46:28.519
curse. Therefore, choose life. That's the right choice. He says that both thou and thy

00:46:28.519 --> 00:46:36.079
seed may live. The impact of our choice. We find this morning that Moses is bringing the

00:46:36.079 --> 00:46:41.559
people here and then Joshua in Joshua 24, bringing the people to a place of decision.

00:46:41.559 --> 00:46:47.079
You have to make a choice. In Luke chapter 12, the Bible gives us the principle that

00:46:47.079 --> 00:46:53.279
we often refer to as to whom much is given, much is required. I'm thankful that God's

00:46:53.279 --> 00:47:01.039
given us His Word. I'm thankful that we have the opportunity to read daily His Word. I'm

00:47:01.039 --> 00:47:05.759
thankful, yes, as the pastor I know, to be able to have the privilege of preaching God's

00:47:05.759 --> 00:47:10.159
Word regularly. But I'm also thankful for the opportunity to be able to hear the preaching

00:47:10.159 --> 00:47:16.319
of God's Word and to be challenged by what God teaches us in His Word. And God brings

00:47:16.319 --> 00:47:22.299
us to a place of decision. The choice is yours. This morning, maybe there's some choices,

00:47:22.299 --> 00:47:28.459
some decisions that you need to make. Maybe through the revival meeting God was just working

00:47:28.459 --> 00:47:32.679
and moving. But maybe you've just not made a choice. Maybe this morning through something

00:47:32.679 --> 00:47:36.559
that was said, the Holy Spirit of God just kind of touched a spot in your life, in your

00:47:36.559 --> 00:47:42.599
heart. And the question is not that we just dispense information. It's not that we just

00:47:42.599 --> 00:47:49.399
say, oh, that was a nice message. No, what does God have for me? What is God doing in

00:47:49.399 --> 00:47:53.439
my life? Because He's an individual God that wants to work in each of our lives and bring

00:47:53.439 --> 00:47:59.839
us to a place of decision. We will serve the Lord. What a great decision, what a great

00:47:59.839 --> 00:48:04.679
choice. But the choice is yours. I can't make it for you. No one else can make it for

00:48:04.679 --> 00:48:11.199
you. God's given you the individual responsibility to make that choice. So this morning the choice

00:48:11.199 --> 00:48:14.839
is yours. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. Thank you for

00:48:14.839 --> 00:48:21.039
your Word. Thank you for the truth of your Word. God, I'm not sure how you might be working

00:48:21.039 --> 00:48:26.599
in the hearts of your people. God, I trust that you're at work. I trust the Holy Spirit

00:48:26.599 --> 00:48:31.559
is moving and working. And I pray that in these moments of invitation that just as we've

00:48:31.559 --> 00:48:39.399
been ready to receive your Word that we'd be ready to respond. God, help us to determine

00:48:39.399 --> 00:48:45.359
to obey you, to follow you. Lord, help us to dig into your Word daily so that we could

00:48:45.359 --> 00:48:49.279
know your commandments and your statutes and your judgments so that we might apply and

00:48:49.279 --> 00:48:54.079
keep them and do them. I pray, Lord, that if there's one that needs to make the choice

00:48:54.079 --> 00:48:59.279
of trusting Christ as their Savior, they've never been born again, I pray that this morning

00:48:59.279 --> 00:49:06.219
they would make that choice to trust Christ. Maybe you've been calling someone to the ministry.

00:49:06.219 --> 00:49:13.000
Maybe you've been working through some other means in someone's life with regard to choices,

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.559
decisions, and how they're serving you. Lord, I pray that you'd just move and work. I pray

00:49:17.559 --> 00:49:22.359
that we'd respond in obedience. We'll commit this time to you and we'll thank you for what

00:49:22.359 --> 00:49:25.880
you'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed,

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:30.319
eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano. We'll have a time of

00:49:30.319 --> 00:49:35.359
invitation where you have an opportunity to respond. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
