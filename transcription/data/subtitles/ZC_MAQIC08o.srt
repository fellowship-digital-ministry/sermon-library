1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,119
Chapter number 3, as you've got your place there, I want you to also, if you would, hold

2
00:00:05,119 --> 00:00:08,680
your place in Ephesians chapter number 5.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,600
We will make some reference back to the 5th chapter of the book of Ephesians, and really

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,620
into the first few verses of chapter number 6 this morning as well, as we look at this

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,840
portion of Scripture.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,239
You'll remember that in Colossians 3, verses 5 through 14, as we've been studying over

7
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:28,239
the last several weeks, that we have been instructed to crucify our flesh, to put off

8
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,200
the old man and his deeds, and to put on the new man.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,599
We find that the process of sanctification is in view in this passage of Scripture, and

10
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:42,240
I believe that we are given practical insight regarding our walk with the Lord.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,880
Truly, we find that we have the responsibility to walk in the Spirit so that we do not fulfill

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,400
the lust of the flesh.

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,040
And we find that as we look at this portion of Scripture that we've studied over the last

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,279
several weeks, you continue to read through the passage, and you find even as we looked

15
00:00:57,279 --> 00:01:03,200
last week at verses 15 through 17, that it appears quite obvious that as we take heed

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:10,639
to the instruction given in verses 5 through 14, that it will have an impact on our behavior.

17
00:01:10,639 --> 00:01:16,440
When we crucify our flesh, when we put off the old man, the flesh, and the deeds, and

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:22,080
we put on the new man, and we walk in the Spirit, we find that it will impact, it will

19
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,680
affect the way that we live, it will affect our behavior.

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,879
I've often said over the years that belief impacts behavior.

21
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:34,239
It is true also that behavior reveals belief.

22
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,139
And we find this morning that as we look at this portion of Scripture that even as we

23
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:45,319
discussed last week in verses 15 through 17, we noted the behavior of God's people in God's

24
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,319
house.

25
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:52,680
And I'm thankful that God gives us instruction for behavior in the house of God.

26
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,279
And we find that as we looked at this portion last week, we said that our behavior in the

27
00:01:56,279 --> 00:02:00,040
church house should be characterized by five things.

28
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,199
By peace, by unity, devotion.

29
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:08,520
Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.

30
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,919
We talked about that devotion and how appropriate to hear Brother Savalle share about the Word

31
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,559
of God making such an impact in the believers in the church.

32
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:19,479
And that's how it's supposed to work, amen?

33
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:23,559
And so we see peace and unity and devotion, and then purpose.

34
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:29,860
All that we do is to bring honor and glory to the Lord Jesus Christ that He alone would

35
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,279
be exalted.

36
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:36,679
And then finally, we looked at that last idea from really all three of the verses that our

37
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:39,960
behavior should be characterized by praise.

38
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,679
And we are to enter into His gates with thanksgiving.

39
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:49,000
Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord, praise ye the Lord.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,559
He is worthy of our worship.

41
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:52,240
He is worthy of our praise.

42
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,520
And so we find that the first aspect of our behavior that is dealt with in this portion

43
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,020
of Scripture is with regard to our behavior in the church house.

44
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:05,240
This morning we'll be focusing on verses 18 through 21, and as we look at these few verses

45
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,320
of Scripture, we find that the focus now shifts to the home.

46
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,199
We know, we understand biblically that it was God that designed the home.

47
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:18,800
You understand that all the way back in the Garden of Eden, as we read the book of Genesis,

48
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,759
that God instituted the home.

49
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:28,039
I'm thankful that the home is not the idea of man, that we're not relying upon the instruction

50
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,039
of man.

51
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,759
We find that God is the author of the home.

52
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:39,500
He's intended for the home to follow the instruction that He has provided in His Word.

53
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,839
And we find that as we would take the instruction that He's provided in His Word with regard

54
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:49,960
to the home, I believe this morning that we can have a home that thrives, not just

55
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
survival mode.

56
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,039
You know, there are a lot of homes in America today that are on survival mode.

57
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:58,759
There are a lot of homes...listen, the home is under attack.

58
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,759
Amen?

59
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,919
We see it all around our society.

60
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,800
We see it everywhere in which we go.

61
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,320
You do not have to look very far.

62
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,679
It's very apparent that the home is under serious attack.

63
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:14,679
We understand that the enemy attacks everything that God designs.

64
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:15,679
Amen?

65
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:20,239
And God designed the home, and we find that the home is now under attack.

66
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,100
And we find that as we consider the home, and we consider this which is in front of

67
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:30,640
us this morning, I believe that we can have a home where the Lord is honored.

68
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:36,320
And that's the title for the message this morning, a home where the Lord is honored.

69
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,640
I want you to notice with me as we look at this portion of Scripture, begin with me in

70
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,640
verse number 18.

71
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,959
The Bible says this,

72
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:48,640
Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.

73
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,880
Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.

74
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:59,880
Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing unto the Lord.

75
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,679
Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.

76
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:12,559
I believe this morning that a strong church is made up of strong families.

77
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:15,279
That's one of the reasons why the family is under attack.

78
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,119
Because as the family breaks down, the church also breaks down.

79
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:23,559
I believe this morning that before we ever have revival in the church, that we have to

80
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:26,040
have revival in our homes.

81
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,119
And I believe that God has given us instruction as we look at this portion of Scripture.

82
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:36,440
It seems so easy, and really the thoughts this morning are quite basic.

83
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,519
Number one, if you're taking notes, think of this.

84
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,760
Instruction has been provided.

85
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
Instruction has been provided.

86
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,760
Now, I want to say this right at the beginning of the message.

87
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,799
I am thankful that God has given instruction.

88
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:55,480
We ought to agree this morning that our God has been faithful to provide us with instruction.

89
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,799
Have you ever attempted to put something together?

90
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:59,399
Maybe you've purchased something.

91
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:03,720
Maybe you've made the decision to purchase something from IKEA, and you got it, and

92
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,239
there's 5,000 little pieces and all of this stuff that you need to put together.

93
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:11,160
And you say, man, alive, this is a project.

94
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,839
And I heard about the president of IKEA, all of the senior management got together for

95
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,160
his birthday to provide him with a cake, and they gave him a couple of eggs and some oil

96
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,720
and some water and some flour and said, here's your birthday cake, right?

97
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,559
And it was quite comical.

98
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:30,200
But the reality is that sometimes instructions can be one thing.

99
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,920
We look at them and say, what in the world?

100
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,920
Right, Joseph?

101
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,200
He does some projects with me.

102
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,320
And sometimes I look at the instructions and I'm like, I don't get it.

103
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,119
It just does not make sense to me.

104
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:41,920
I'm not following what I'm supposed to do here.

105
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
What is this part for?

106
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,279
What is this thing for?

107
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:50,839
When we think about the instructions that God has provided to us, we ought to be thankful

108
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,359
that our God has been faithful to provide us with this instruction.

109
00:06:56,359 --> 00:07:01,640
And as we consider this morning, not only the reality that God has been faithful, but

110
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,239
I also want you to think about this and acknowledge this truth this morning, that the instruction

111
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,760
is indeed from God.

112
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,160
This is not just Paul's instruction to the families in Colossae.

113
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,920
This is not just my instruction to the folks in our church this morning.

114
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,179
No, this is God's instruction.

115
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:24,459
We believe this morning in the inspiration of God's word, that all scripture is given

116
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:28,980
by inspiration of God and is what is profitable.

117
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,579
And I believe this morning that as we consider the word of God that is before us, that we

118
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:37,059
must acknowledge that this is the word of God.

119
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:41,459
And as God has given, we're not going to attack, well, Paul just didn't understand in this.

120
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:43,179
No, it's God's word.

121
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:44,179
Amen.

122
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:49,140
And when we acknowledge that it's God's word and this instruction is from God, and we understand

123
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:54,299
this morning that it's profitable, then I believe that we also would come to this point,

124
00:07:54,299 --> 00:08:00,320
and perhaps I would say this, we should agree this morning that God knows best.

125
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,859
Would you agree with that?

126
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:02,859
God knows best.

127
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:05,619
He is the author of the home.

128
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:06,720
He designed it.

129
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,519
He instituted the home.

130
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:13,380
And so who would know better about the home than God?

131
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,380
Right?

132
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,260
Listen, I understand this morning, there are a lot of books that have been written by a

133
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,700
lot of very good authors about the home.

134
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,059
I understand that.

135
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:24,420
And there are some valuable things that you can glean from some of those books that are

136
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:29,859
out there, but I would say this, that those truths must be in line with the truth that's

137
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:32,020
provided in this book.

138
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,539
Because God is the author of the home.

139
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:40,000
He is the designer, and therefore He knows best.

140
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,739
And when we agree this morning at the very onset of the message, when we consider this

141
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:47,679
instruction that's provided, is that first, I'm going to be thankful that God's given

142
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,679
the instruction.

143
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:53,820
I'm going to acknowledge that it's from God, and I'm also going to agree that He knows

144
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,820
best.

145
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,059
Then it helps us as we approach this portion of Scripture.

146
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:59,500
Amen?

147
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:05,780
Because all of a sudden, our perspective and our entrance into the verses that we see are

148
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:09,700
going to be received in a different manner.

149
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,859
Because we say, this is God's Word, and God knows best.

150
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:15,580
And I'm thankful that He's provided the instruction.

151
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,659
Notice with me, as we consider the instruction that's been provided, first we see in verse

152
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:23,500
number 18, He addresses the wives.

153
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,640
He says this, wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands.

154
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,820
And it says this as it is fit in the Lord.

155
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,940
The word submit, we understand it to be a word that means to arrange under rank.

156
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,619
In fact, it would be a word that would be often used with regard to military type of

157
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:42,619
reference.

158
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,580
But we find that it means to arrange under rank.

159
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,619
It does not mean slavery, amen?

160
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:51,059
It means to arrange under rank.

161
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:55,979
And we consider this truth that's been given here, we must understand that our God is a

162
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:58,739
God of order.

163
00:09:58,739 --> 00:09:59,979
Everything that our God does...

164
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:01,059
is with order.

165
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,699
You read Genesis chapter number one

166
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:06,059
as you read about the creation of all that he did,

167
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:08,139
and you see the order in creation,

168
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:11,219
and you find that God says in the church in Corinth

169
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:14,459
that everything is to be done decently and in order.

170
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:15,279
Why?

171
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,199
Because our God is a God of order.

172
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:21,719
You find that the enemy is the designer

173
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:24,339
of chaos and confusion.

174
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:28,039
He is not about order, but our God is about order.

175
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:31,359
And so therefore, as he's providing this instruction to us,

176
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:35,479
we find that he's giving us order for the home.

177
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:38,679
And as we consider, first he speaks to the wives

178
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,639
about this subject of submission,

179
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,559
and then he finishes the verse by saying,

180
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,959
as it is fit in the Lord.

181
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,039
It is fitting as a wife would fulfill her responsibility

182
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,239
to submit to her own husband.

183
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:52,719
It's pleasing to God.

184
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,419
We find that as you not only consider

185
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:56,479
that it's pleasing to God,

186
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:59,599
I believe it also would carry with it the idea

187
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:02,119
that it is appropriate in God's eyes.

188
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:05,239
In other words, it's not for a wife to submit

189
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:07,079
to do something that would be contrary

190
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,079
to what God's word has said.

191
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,999
That some husband can say,

192
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,399
well, you're supposed to submit,

193
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:15,239
and so do this, so on and so forth.

194
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:17,919
That's not the idea of submission.

195
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,139
And really what happens is the enemy wants

196
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:22,519
to get that little thought in your head

197
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,359
so that when you hear the word submit,

198
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:26,959
you have both arms out in resistance.

199
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:31,519
But when we take the approach that this is from God,

200
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,519
and that God knows best,

201
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,759
and that God has been faithful to give the instruction,

202
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,599
all of a sudden, I'm going to receive the instruction

203
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,799
and understand that it is best for me

204
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,799
to follow the instruction.

205
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:46,339
Look over, I asked you to keep your place in Ephesians 5.

206
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:51,259
Notice in Ephesians 5, in verses 22 through 24,

207
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:52,799
we find that God gives instruction

208
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,399
to the believers in Ephesus.

209
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,979
Again, he begins with the wives.

210
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:59,159
He says this, submit yourselves unto your own husbands.

211
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:03,119
Look at what he says, as unto the Lord.

212
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:06,239
Understanding, again, that God has given order.

213
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:07,919
And I know that there's some that say,

214
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,999
I just don't wanna, I just can't submit to him,

215
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:11,079
and so on and so forth.

216
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:13,959
You understand that he's responsible to God.

217
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:15,679
And as you submit and you fulfill

218
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,959
your responsibility to God to submit,

219
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:21,279
then that responsibility ends with the husband.

220
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,039
And really, there's a valuable level of protection

221
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:27,039
for the wife as she submits unto her husband

222
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,639
as unto the Lord.

223
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,499
Notice in verse 23, for the husband is the head of the wife

224
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:33,439
even as Christ is the head of the church,

225
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:36,259
and he is the savior of the body.

226
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:38,959
Therefore, as the church is subject unto Christ,

227
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,879
we'll let the wives be to their own husbands in everything.

228
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:43,839
And so we find that the instruction is provided

229
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:44,679
first to the wives.

230
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:46,079
Number two, to the husbands.

231
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,639
Notice back in Colossians 3, in verse number 19,

232
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,799
the Bible says this, husbands.

233
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:56,199
It says, love your wives and be not bitter against them.

234
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,519
We find that the truth in Ephesians 5

235
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:02,959
with regard to this instruction for husbands

236
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,599
to love our wives, it says this,

237
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:09,039
it gives us the manner in which we're to love our wives.

238
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,399
In Ephesians 5, in verse number 25,

239
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,199
husbands, love your wives even as Christ

240
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:20,199
also loved the church and gave himself for it.

241
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:22,579
That's the highest form of love.

242
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:24,519
It's the Greek word agape.

243
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:26,079
It's the word that's denoted,

244
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,359
that's used regarding the love of God.

245
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:32,599
And we find that we are to love our wives, husbands,

246
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:35,719
as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it.

247
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:38,079
It is a sacrificial love.

248
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,379
And let me say this this morning,

249
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:41,719
maybe perhaps as a question,

250
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:43,599
does your wife, husbands,

251
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:48,399
does your wife know that you love her in this manner?

252
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,239
Does she know that you love her?

253
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:55,599
Are you demonstrating, are you showing her your love?

254
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:57,399
This is our responsibility.

255
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:00,479
Husbands, love your wives

256
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:03,879
even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it.

257
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:07,319
We find that the instruction continues in Colossians

258
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:11,359
and it tells us this with regard to the truth

259
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:12,879
of the husbands, it says,

260
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,239
and be not bitter against them.

261
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:18,759
Be not bitter against them.

262
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,599
The reality is that there are times even as we mentioned

263
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:26,119
with regard to the behavior in the church

264
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:28,039
and the peace that should be prevalent

265
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:31,519
in the church of God because of that crucifying our flesh,

266
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,079
because of the putting off and the putting on,

267
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,959
that one of the references that was given

268
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,319
with regard to the put on was in verse number 13

269
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:41,519
forbearing one another,

270
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,599
literally putting up with one another

271
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:45,599
and forgiving one another.

272
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:46,479
And then it said this,

273
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:48,599
if any man have a quarrel against any,

274
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:52,799
even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.

275
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,239
You know, our home, husbands, when it says

276
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:57,599
and be not bitter against them,

277
00:14:57,599 --> 00:15:00,119
we need to be careful that our home is a place

278
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:02,639
in which we are practicing forgiveness,

279
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,919
that we're not allowing the sun to go down upon our wrath,

280
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:09,079
that we're speaking the truth in love,

281
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:11,879
that we're open dialogue one with another.

282
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:16,079
I know that there are times in relationships,

283
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,879
no matter what the relationship is

284
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:20,679
and specifically as we're focused on the home this morning,

285
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,759
that there will be some level of quarrel,

286
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,679
there's a contention, there's a problem,

287
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:27,119
there's something that just doesn't go the way

288
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:30,079
that we planned for it to go, right?

289
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,839
I told you about the fellow that I heard preach

290
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,559
at a pastor's meeting not long ago

291
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,439
and he stood there and said, I can tell you,

292
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:37,559
I can stand here, Brother Savalle, he said,

293
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:40,159
in all honesty, I've been married for 35 years

294
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:44,139
and I've never said one thing to my wife that I regret.

295
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:46,579
I've never had one argument with my wife,

296
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:49,739
I've never raised my voice to my wife one time

297
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:52,339
and all the preachers are like, man, this is amazing.

298
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,979
And then he said this, but there've been plenty of times

299
00:15:55,979 --> 00:15:58,739
that I just didn't talk to her for days.

300
00:15:58,739 --> 00:16:00,979
Well, that's not the answer either, right?

301
00:16:00,979 --> 00:16:03,939
That's not the way it's supposed to work, amen?

302
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:05,119
But what was he doing?

303
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,459
He was really saying, look, I didn't do this,

304
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:09,019
but I did this.

305
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:11,539
Well, what he did wasn't right and he acknowledged that,

306
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:16,059
he was just being funny with regard to his own behavior

307
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:19,819
and his shortcoming and his need to allow God

308
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:20,819
to work in his life.

309
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:23,779
Listen, we need to be careful and guard against bitterness,

310
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:28,359
against brother and sister, church member,

311
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:32,059
against husband and wife, parent and children.

312
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,719
I mean, bitterness is a terrible thing.

313
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:36,259
Bitterness destroys.

314
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:39,379
I've often said this, it destroys the vessel

315
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:41,619
in which it's stored more than the vessel

316
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:43,379
in which it's poured.

317
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:45,379
We find that bitterness is a terrible thing

318
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:49,139
and God says to the husbands, not only to love your wives,

319
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:53,359
but then he says, and be not bitter against them.

320
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:56,359
Now the focus turns to children in verse number 20,

321
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:57,959
the instruction being provided.

322
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,859
Notice in verse number 20, he says,

323
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:03,219
children, obey your parents in all things.

324
00:17:03,219 --> 00:17:04,739
And now the parents get a little excited

325
00:17:04,739 --> 00:17:06,419
because the wives say, man,

326
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:07,659
you're not dealing with the wife anymore.

327
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,379
The husbands say, not dealing with the husbands anymore.

328
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:10,379
Now we're dealing with the children.

329
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:12,419
And so, hey, kids, listen up, right?

330
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:13,819
Kevin's back there, Ian and Isaiah,

331
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,579
you listen to the preacher, amen.

332
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:18,219
He's talking about the children now, right?

333
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:19,739
Amen, right?

334
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:23,739
He turned me off when I talked about husbands,

335
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:26,459
but man, when he heard children, he said, listen up, boys.

336
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,739
I'm just teasing, I'm just teasing.

337
00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:32,459
But listen, he says, children,

338
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:38,319
obey your parents in all things.

339
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:41,599
Not some things, not most things,

340
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,119
not the things that you like,

341
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:45,519
the things that you agree with,

342
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,719
but in all things, right?

343
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,759
There's a level of protection for the children,

344
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:54,699
just as I mentioned the protection for the wife

345
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,719
and submission because the husband is accountable.

346
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:59,779
Biblical proof for that, when Sarah laughed,

347
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,159
who did God go to?

348
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:02,419
Abraham.

349
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:04,879
Abraham, why did Sarah laugh?

350
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:08,359
It's interesting that he didn't ask Sarah why she laughed.

351
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:11,279
Why, because the husband is responsible.

352
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:19,079
Children have a safety net, if you will,

353
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:21,639
in obedience to their parents.

354
00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:24,119
Obey your parents, it says, in all things,

355
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:26,599
but then I want you to catch this, it says this,

356
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:31,599
for this is well-pleasing unto the Lord.

357
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:35,119
That's encouraging for a child.

358
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:37,119
I understand that obedience doesn't come natural

359
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:37,940
for a child.

360
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,159
Any of you that have had children,

361
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,039
you understand the fact that we are born sinners, amen?

362
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,919
It's not hard when you talk about the truth

363
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,639
of giving the gospel presentation for all have sinned.

364
00:18:49,639 --> 00:18:51,079
You say, man, I got some kids,

365
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,599
and we didn't have to teach them to sin.

366
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,839
They were born sinners.

367
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:58,719
It doesn't come natural for children to obey in all things,

368
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:00,760
but we find that the truth that's given here

369
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,719
is that this, obedience to your parents,

370
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:07,739
is well-pleasing unto the Lord.

371
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,559
We find that we understand that God has given instruction,

372
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:14,599
I asked you to be in chapter five,

373
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:16,919
this goes down into chapter number six.

374
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,479
In chapter number six, in verses one through three,

375
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:22,159
the Bible says this, children,

376
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:23,579
obey your parents and the Lord,

377
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,239
notice, for this is right.

378
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:28,399
It then says this, honor thy father and mother,

379
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:29,459
and then notice, he says,

380
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,320
which is the first commandment with promise.

381
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,359
He goes back to the Exodus chapter number 20,

382
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,519
we'll look at it in just a moment.

383
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,760
And then it says this, that it may be well with thee,

384
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,079
and that thou mayest live long on the earth.

385
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:45,719
Well, so when I understand all that God is telling me,

386
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:48,159
again, he's the one that's designed this.

387
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:51,320
He's the one that knows what is best,

388
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,919
and he's been faithful to give us the instruction.

389
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,719
I say, well, this just makes sense that I would do this.

390
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:57,880
It's gonna be better for me.

391
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,639
It's going to result in living a long life.

392
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:06,239
life that would be longer, that would bring honor to God, it says in Exodus 20

393
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:09,559
and verse 12, honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon

394
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:17,399
the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. I am thankful to be living in New

395
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:23,559
Testament era, aren't you? If you say I'm not so sure about that, read the book of

396
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:26,799
Leviticus this afternoon and perhaps you'll come back tonight with a

397
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:33,519
different idea. I'm thankful that we're no longer under the law. Christ has

398
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:39,759
redeemed us from the law, amen? Now we understand that it's still valuable and

399
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,519
there's still instruction that we learn from it, but I'm thankful to not be under

400
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:48,639
the law. Listen, the law could never save. Galatians is very clear about that. If

401
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:52,599
righteousness came by the law, then Christ is dead in vain, but I want you to

402
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:56,039
understand some things about the Old Testament that there are many things.

403
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:00,319
Listen, children would be put to death for some of the behavior that is

404
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:06,119
tolerated today. Again, I'm thankful to live in the New Testament, amen? And I'm

405
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:10,919
thankful for God's grace and for God's mercy, but you understand that as we look

406
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:16,759
at these truths that what God is doing is God is trying to, I shouldn't

407
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:22,599
say trying, God is providing instruction that is profitable, right? You think about

408
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:25,559
those in the Old Testament, there are portions of scripture that you can read

409
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:29,239
about children that were stoned because of their sin, because of their

410
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:32,879
disobedience, their lack of honor, so on and so forth, and as you look at those

411
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:37,519
situations, you say, well the commandment was, honor thy father and mother that thy

412
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,839
days may be long upon the earth. They were cut short because of your sin,

413
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:46,519
because of your disobedience, right? And so we find here that in the New

414
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:53,039
Testament that God is giving us this instruction. We notice that he says again

415
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:58,319
that this is well-pleasing unto the Lord. Finally, we come to verse number 21 as we

416
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:02,719
think about the instruction that's been provided. We find that the passage

417
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:08,119
now addresses fathers. We see wives in verse 18, husbands in verse 19, children

418
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:16,679
in verse 20. In verse 21, fathers. It says, provoke not your children to anger lest

419
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:23,319
they be discouraged. Provoke not. We see this also in the book of Ephesians in

420
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:28,919
chapter number 6, and we find that there the Bible says, and ye fathers, provoke

421
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:34,119
not your children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of

422
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:41,239
the Lord. I believe this morning that consistency is key. I believe that one of

423
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:46,839
the easiest ways for us to, as fathers, as parents, to provoke our children to

424
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:51,759
anger, to wrath, is through inconsistency. I believe that it's important that we

425
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:56,599
understand that our children are a blessing from God. Amen?

426
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:02,639
Lo, children are an heritage from the Lord. They're a blessing from God, and we

427
00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:08,719
have been, for a season of time, we have been entrusted by God to instruct our

428
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:13,079
children, to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, and we need

429
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:16,279
to be careful to understand that they're a blessing from God and that we play a

430
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:21,559
vital role in their development, and that we help them to understand much about

431
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:27,119
who God is and how God operates. And the consistency in the lives of parents is

432
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,539
essential, that we would not provoke our children to anger, to wrath. Notice the

433
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:37,759
last part of verse 21. It says, lest they be discouraged. The word discouraged means

434
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:43,719
to be disheartened. It means to be broken in spirit. Oftentimes, we've heard people

435
00:23:43,719 --> 00:23:49,679
speak about the necessity, perhaps, of breaking a child's will. You've

436
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,839
heard somebody use that terminology. They're strong-willed, or whatever the

437
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:58,219
terminology would be that someone would use, and they need to have their

438
00:23:58,219 --> 00:24:03,119
will broken, and we will use that terminology. That's quite different than

439
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:08,759
breaking their spirit. We need to be careful that we understand this. Let me

440
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:12,639
say, as we look at the instruction provided, that each one of us here this

441
00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:18,959
morning find ourselves in a category, and as we would look at the categories that

442
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:23,119
are provided, we must thank God for the instruction that's been given, and as we

443
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:27,719
look here, wives, husbands, children, fathers, we see that the instruction has

444
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:31,599
been provided, and then I would ask this, or say this as our second point this

445
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:37,599
morning, instruction provided, instruction understood, and I'm gonna say

446
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:43,799
question mark. Do you understand the instruction? So, I think this morning that

447
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:46,919
as we look at these four verses of Scripture, that it would be very easy for

448
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:54,639
us to agree that the truth that is given is not complicated, right? It's not like

449
00:24:54,639 --> 00:24:57,479
some of those instruction booklets that you've received on some of those

450
00:24:57,479 --> 00:25:00,999
products that you've purchased, and you don't know which one. I'm like, man, maybe

451
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,839
I'll read the Spanish side of this, because it might make more sense, you

452
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:10,359
know? I mean, it just can be so confusing. I told you about the the ceiling fan I

453
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:14,919
tried to put together. I mean, it was an absolute nonsense, but it made sense

454
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:18,679
once I followed the instructions, but the instructions made no sense in the

455
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,319
beginning, because I've put together tons of ceiling fans, and it's always followed

456
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:27,079
the same exact process until I got this one, and I was glad that I used the

457
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:31,039
illustration, because I saved brother Ron Adams some time as well, amen? Because he

458
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,159
got one of those same silly fans that has the crazy instructions, but the

459
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:39,879
reality is that there are times in which instructions can be complicated. You ever

460
00:25:39,879 --> 00:25:43,319
wonder why the folks at Microsoft decided you got to push control alt

461
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:47,719
delete? Right? Like, I mean, why do I have to? Why can't there just be one button?

462
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:50,799
That's what they decided. I don't know, the computer science guys are

463
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,999
gonna come give me answers after the service, right? This is why you have to do

464
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:59,759
it this way, but the reality is that, listen, we understand instructions being

465
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:05,279
provided, and there are times in which we can say, man, that's complicated, but this

466
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:11,399
morning this is basic. This is easy to understand, and my question for you this

467
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:16,159
morning is, do we understand the instruction that God has given? Again,

468
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,279
we're agreeing at the onset of the message that God knows best. We're

469
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:24,679
agreeing on the onset of the message that this is God's Word. This is, yes, God

470
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:28,719
used the Apostle Paul to be the human penman of this particular book, but all

471
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:33,159
Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and it's profitable, and we find here

472
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:36,799
this morning that this instruction, it's not hard. You know, there are people that

473
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,879
criticize the Bible and say, oh, it's so complicated, it's so difficult. The

474
00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:46,279
reality is that much of the Bible is very easy to understand, and when you

475
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:49,479
couple that with the fact that we have the Holy Spirit of God that is the

476
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:54,319
Teacher that dwells within us and He illumines the Scriptures to us, it makes

477
00:26:54,319 --> 00:27:00,559
it that much easier for us to understand the Word of God. And this morning, I don't

478
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:07,759
think anyone that's here could honestly say, I just don't understand, because the

479
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:12,799
instruction is easy to understand. So it leads me to my final thought this

480
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:20,759
morning. Instruction must be embraced and applied. Instruction must be embraced

481
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:27,039
and applied. The instruction has been provided. Instruction can be understood,

482
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:34,399
but can I say this this morning? Understanding does not equal applying.

483
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:41,159
We can understand something and not apply it, correct? We can understand

484
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:45,559
something and not apply it. So understanding does not equal applying.

485
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:49,959
But this morning, when we look at this portion of Scripture, if we truly desire

486
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:55,839
to have a home where the Lord is honored, where we have a harmonious home, where we

487
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:01,439
aren't just in survival mode, but we're thriving with the blessing of God, and

488
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:06,639
we're going through life enjoying all that God has designed for us to enjoy,

489
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:12,239
then we must apply the truth that has been given. It's not enough to just say

490
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:17,279
that God's provided the instruction. Oh, we're thankful that He's provided it. What

491
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,199
a tremendous blessing. I mean, can you imagine if God did not provide

492
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,599
instruction for your home? We wouldn't know how to behave. We wouldn't know who's

493
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:29,359
supposed to do what, and so on and so forth, and it could be very chaotic. But

494
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,919
God has graciously provided the instruction, and it's very easy to

495
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,519
understand. But understanding does not equal applying, and we find that I must

496
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:45,399
embrace this truth, and as I embrace the instruction, I then apply it in my life.

497
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:50,879
The wives apply the truth of verse 18. The husbands applying the truth of verse

498
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:55,319
number 19. The children applying the truth of verse number 20. The

499
00:28:55,319 --> 00:29:01,119
father's parents applying the truth of verse number 21. And listen, here's what

500
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:09,399
I find this morning. My flesh and your flesh probably have a hard time with

501
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:16,759
some of the instruction that's provided here, but that's why the preceding text

502
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:21,359
is so important. Mortify, therefore, your members which are upon the earth.

503
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:30,279
Literally crucify your flesh. Put off the old man, all of these things. Put on

504
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:36,799
the new man with all of these things. Now your behavior in the church house is

505
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,839
going to be characterized by peace and unity and devotion and purpose and

506
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:47,719
praise, and now your home is going to be a home where each individual is

507
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:57,279
fulfilling the plan that God has. It's possible in the power of God. I will say

508
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:02,679
this. Husbands, you're

509
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:05,939
Your wife will have a much easier time submitting

510
00:30:05,939 --> 00:30:08,099
if she knows you love her.

511
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:11,279
Amen?

512
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:14,079
It's the way it works.

513
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:17,219
Wives will have a much easier time submitting

514
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:21,019
when they know that their husbands love them,

515
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,819
that their husbands are walking with God,

516
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:26,119
that their husbands have put off the old man

517
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:27,599
and put on the new man

518
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,239
and are walking in the power of the Holy Spirit of God.

519
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:32,919
Children are gonna have a much easier time

520
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:33,919
obeying their parents

521
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,219
as they know that their parents love them

522
00:30:36,219 --> 00:30:38,999
and that their parents are seeking the face of God

523
00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:41,699
and desiring to please God.

524
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:45,379
There are times in which perhaps we can tell our children,

525
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:47,199
give them an answer with regard to something

526
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:48,519
that they desire to do,

527
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:50,919
and we can take them directly to some verses of Scripture

528
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:53,639
and explain to them why we're not going to engage

529
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:56,199
in such and such of behavior and so on and so forth.

530
00:30:56,199 --> 00:30:57,999
And there are other times that we just might be like,

531
00:30:57,999 --> 00:31:00,639
hey, listen, can you just trust me on this?

532
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:03,519
We just don't have a piece about this.

533
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,959
And if our children know that we're walking with God,

534
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:07,759
if our children know that we love them,

535
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:09,959
that we're not seeking to provoke them to anger,

536
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:12,719
that we're not living a life of hypocrisy,

537
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:17,239
that we're not seeking to be contentious and inconsistent,

538
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:19,819
then they can have an easier time of obeying.

539
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,759
But if we do all of that

540
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,279
without putting off and putting on,

541
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,599
we're gonna struggle

542
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:30,639
because it's gonna get old real fast in the flesh

543
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:31,599
trying to do that.

544
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,399
It's very interesting to me

545
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:35,879
that the truth that is given to us,

546
00:31:35,879 --> 00:31:38,759
the instruction provided in verses 18 through 21,

547
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:42,279
in this portion of Colossians is preceded

548
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:44,519
by that which we've dealt with in the last several weeks.

549
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:46,959
It's also of interest and noteworthy

550
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:49,079
that in Ephesians five and six,

551
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:51,099
the portion that we were looking at earlier,

552
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:53,519
where the same instruction is provided,

553
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,979
I want you to be understanding this morning

554
00:31:55,979 --> 00:31:57,779
of the preceding passage

555
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:01,419
that deals with this truth in Ephesians five.

556
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:05,419
Before he gets to wives and husbands and children

557
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:07,459
as he's addressing the church in Ephesus,

558
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:12,059
he says this in verse number 18 of Ephesians five.

559
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:13,659
And be not drunk with wine,

560
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:15,219
wherein is excess.

561
00:32:15,219 --> 00:32:19,199
Notice, but be filled with the Spirit.

562
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:22,979
I believe this morning that what is summarized

563
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:25,799
in those few words at the end of verse number 18,

564
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:27,639
but be filled with the Spirit,

565
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:30,199
is what is illustrated to us in detail

566
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:32,839
in Colossians three verses five through 14.

567
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:35,719
Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth.

568
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:37,879
Put off the old man, put on the new.

569
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:40,799
That's the idea of being filled with the Spirit of God.

570
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,879
That's the rubber meets the road truth

571
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,299
of okay, how do I do this?

572
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:49,099
The application.

573
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:51,859
We find that he says, but be filled with the Spirit.

574
00:32:51,859 --> 00:32:54,519
Notice, speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns

575
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:56,999
and spiritual songs, singing and making melody

576
00:32:56,999 --> 00:32:58,319
in your heart to the Lord,

577
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:00,539
giving thanks always for all things unto God

578
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:02,679
and for the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

579
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:05,599
submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.

580
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:09,239
Then he addresses the wives and the husbands

581
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:10,179
and the children.

582
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:14,059
And so as I'm walking in the Spirit,

583
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:19,059
it is God who enables me to apply the instruction

584
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,439
that he's given me with regard to the home.

585
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:24,859
I can't do it in my own power.

586
00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:26,279
You understand something this morning?

587
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,759
You can't live the Christian life in your own power.

588
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:30,879
You can try for a little while.

589
00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:33,219
You're gonna get frustrated.

590
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,059
You really are.

591
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:35,799
You're gonna just get sideways in life

592
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:36,839
and you're gonna get frustrated

593
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:38,559
because you're trying to do it in your own power.

594
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,559
Paul said, I know that in me that is in my flesh

595
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,619
dwelleth no good thing, right?

596
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:45,799
He says, the things that I would, I do not.

597
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:47,399
The things that I would not, that I do.

598
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:51,439
Listen, you try to live the Christian life in your own power

599
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:53,119
and we become miserable.

600
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:58,139
But it's amazing when God, when we come to that place

601
00:33:58,139 --> 00:34:03,139
of surrender, submission to God, walking in the Spirit

602
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,239
and how he enables us to implement,

603
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:12,519
to apply the instruction that he has provided.

604
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:17,299
This morning, I would hope that each and every one of us

605
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:19,399
would stand and testify and say,

606
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:21,919
I want a home where the Lord is honored.

607
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:24,259
I want a home where God is honored.

608
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,639
The home, I've often said this over the years,

609
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:30,599
is that haven, that safe place.

610
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,239
I remember when I worked in the corporate world,

611
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:36,119
it's a little bit different now as a pastor of a church.

612
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:39,319
My office is kind of a haven of rest as well

613
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:40,559
until some people wanna meet.

614
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:41,679
No, I'm just teasing.

615
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,959
But the reality is that, listen,

616
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:46,199
when I worked in the corporate world,

617
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,959
I worked in the corporate world for years.

618
00:34:47,959 --> 00:34:50,719
I understand what it is to work in the corporate life.

619
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:54,159
And oh, how I love to come home,

620
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:58,939
to come to that haven, that safe place.

621
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:03,599
I'm not in any way saying that my home is perfect,

622
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,579
but I desire to have a home that honors God.

623
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:09,479
And this morning, if you wanna have a home that honors God,

624
00:35:09,479 --> 00:35:13,479
if you desire that, we understand that God's provided

625
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:16,599
the instruction and we ought to be thankful for that.

626
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:18,479
It's easy to understand,

627
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:21,939
but oh, how we must embrace it and apply it.

628
00:35:21,939 --> 00:35:26,939
And when we do, I believe the result will be a home

629
00:35:27,399 --> 00:35:30,099
where the Lord is honored.

630
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:31,699
Maybe this morning for our invitation,

631
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:33,799
we need to have some families just gather together

632
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,559
and pray together.

633
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:38,919
Maybe visit the altar together, husbands and wives.

634
00:35:38,919 --> 00:35:39,899
I know most of the children,

635
00:35:39,899 --> 00:35:42,279
the young children are downstairs.

636
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:47,239
But just ask God to help us, to enable us.

637
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:49,319
We can identify a place in our lives and say,

638
00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:52,679
man, I've struggled in this area.

639
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:55,639
Oh, that God would help me in this area

640
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:59,599
so that we can have a home where the Lord is honored.

641
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:00,439
Let's pray.

642
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:02,879
Father, how we love you and how we thank you

643
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:04,999
for the instruction that you've provided.

644
00:36:04,999 --> 00:36:09,079
We acknowledge this morning that this is your word.

645
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,759
And you designed the home

646
00:36:15,479 --> 00:36:17,559
and you've provided the instruction

647
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:20,839
for each member in the home.

648
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:25,639
I believe this morning it's simple.

649
00:36:26,759 --> 00:36:28,319
It's easy to understand.

650
00:36:30,459 --> 00:36:32,279
But oh, how we understand this morning

651
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:34,279
that to understand something

652
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:36,219
does not mean to apply something.

653
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,599
We're challenged by the truth of James 1

654
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:47,079
that we would be doers of the word and not hearers only.

655
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,399
Our homes are under attack.

656
00:36:48,399 --> 00:36:49,319
If we're not careful,

657
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:53,719
we begin to listen to what the world says

658
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:55,779
about how a home should operate.

659
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:59,359
We begin to receive counsel from individuals

660
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:02,319
that would speak to us about the role

661
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:04,119
that we should play in our homes

662
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:07,439
instead of listening to the voice of God.

663
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:12,079
I pray that you'd move and work this morning

664
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,879
in each family that's present.

665
00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:18,639
Perhaps they would have the opportunity

666
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:21,879
to come to this altar as a family and just pray.

667
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,559
God, we pray that you would have your will and way,

668
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:27,479
that decisions would be made this morning

669
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:30,279
that would honor you.

670
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:32,399
Maybe some commitments that would be renewed

671
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:35,839
maybe some commitments that would be renewed this morning

672
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:43,239
