00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.119
Chapter number 3, as you've got your place there, I want you to also, if you would, hold

00:00:05.119 --> 00:00:08.680
your place in Ephesians chapter number 5.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.600
We will make some reference back to the 5th chapter of the book of Ephesians, and really

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.620
into the first few verses of chapter number 6 this morning as well, as we look at this

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.840
portion of Scripture.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.239
You'll remember that in Colossians 3, verses 5 through 14, as we've been studying over

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:28.239
the last several weeks, that we have been instructed to crucify our flesh, to put off

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.200
the old man and his deeds, and to put on the new man.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.599
We find that the process of sanctification is in view in this passage of Scripture, and

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:42.240
I believe that we are given practical insight regarding our walk with the Lord.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.880
Truly, we find that we have the responsibility to walk in the Spirit so that we do not fulfill

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.400
the lust of the flesh.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.040
And we find that as we look at this portion of Scripture that we've studied over the last

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.279
several weeks, you continue to read through the passage, and you find even as we looked

00:00:57.279 --> 00:01:03.200
last week at verses 15 through 17, that it appears quite obvious that as we take heed

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:10.639
to the instruction given in verses 5 through 14, that it will have an impact on our behavior.

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:16.440
When we crucify our flesh, when we put off the old man, the flesh, and the deeds, and

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.080
we put on the new man, and we walk in the Spirit, we find that it will impact, it will

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.680
affect the way that we live, it will affect our behavior.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.879
I've often said over the years that belief impacts behavior.

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:34.239
It is true also that behavior reveals belief.

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:38.139
And we find this morning that as we look at this portion of Scripture that even as we

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:45.319
discussed last week in verses 15 through 17, we noted the behavior of God's people in God's

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:46.319
house.

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:52.680
And I'm thankful that God gives us instruction for behavior in the house of God.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.279
And we find that as we looked at this portion last week, we said that our behavior in the

00:01:56.279 --> 00:02:00.040
church house should be characterized by five things.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.199
By peace, by unity, devotion.

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:08.520
Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.919
We talked about that devotion and how appropriate to hear Brother Savalle share about the Word

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:17.559
of God making such an impact in the believers in the church.

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:19.479
And that's how it's supposed to work, amen?

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:23.559
And so we see peace and unity and devotion, and then purpose.

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:29.860
All that we do is to bring honor and glory to the Lord Jesus Christ that He alone would

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.279
be exalted.

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:36.679
And then finally, we looked at that last idea from really all three of the verses that our

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.960
behavior should be characterized by praise.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.679
And we are to enter into His gates with thanksgiving.

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:49.000
Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord, praise ye the Lord.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.559
He is worthy of our worship.

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:52.240
He is worthy of our praise.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.520
And so we find that the first aspect of our behavior that is dealt with in this portion

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.020
of Scripture is with regard to our behavior in the church house.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.240
This morning we'll be focusing on verses 18 through 21, and as we look at these few verses

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.320
of Scripture, we find that the focus now shifts to the home.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.199
We know, we understand biblically that it was God that designed the home.

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:18.800
You understand that all the way back in the Garden of Eden, as we read the book of Genesis,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.759
that God instituted the home.

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:28.039
I'm thankful that the home is not the idea of man, that we're not relying upon the instruction

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:29.039
of man.

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:32.759
We find that God is the author of the home.

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:39.500
He's intended for the home to follow the instruction that He has provided in His Word.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.839
And we find that as we would take the instruction that He's provided in His Word with regard

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:49.960
to the home, I believe this morning that we can have a home that thrives, not just

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.960
survival mode.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.039
You know, there are a lot of homes in America today that are on survival mode.

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:58.759
There are a lot of homes...listen, the home is under attack.

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:59.759
Amen?

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.919
We see it all around our society.

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.800
We see it everywhere in which we go.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.320
You do not have to look very far.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.679
It's very apparent that the home is under serious attack.

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:14.679
We understand that the enemy attacks everything that God designs.

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:15.679
Amen?

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:20.239
And God designed the home, and we find that the home is now under attack.

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.100
And we find that as we consider the home, and we consider this which is in front of

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.640
us this morning, I believe that we can have a home where the Lord is honored.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.320
And that's the title for the message this morning, a home where the Lord is honored.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.640
I want you to notice with me as we look at this portion of Scripture, begin with me in

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.640
verse number 18.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.959
The Bible says this,

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:48.640
Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.880
Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:59.880
Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing unto the Lord.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.679
Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:12.559
I believe this morning that a strong church is made up of strong families.

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:15.279
That's one of the reasons why the family is under attack.

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:19.119
Because as the family breaks down, the church also breaks down.

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:23.559
I believe this morning that before we ever have revival in the church, that we have to

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:26.040
have revival in our homes.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.119
And I believe that God has given us instruction as we look at this portion of Scripture.

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:36.440
It seems so easy, and really the thoughts this morning are quite basic.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.519
Number one, if you're taking notes, think of this.

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:41.760
Instruction has been provided.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.760
Instruction has been provided.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.760
Now, I want to say this right at the beginning of the message.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.799
I am thankful that God has given instruction.

00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:55.480
We ought to agree this morning that our God has been faithful to provide us with instruction.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.799
Have you ever attempted to put something together?

00:05:57.799 --> 00:05:59.399
Maybe you've purchased something.

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:03.720
Maybe you've made the decision to purchase something from IKEA, and you got it, and

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.239
there's 5,000 little pieces and all of this stuff that you need to put together.

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:11.160
And you say, man, alive, this is a project.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.839
And I heard about the president of IKEA, all of the senior management got together for

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:20.160
his birthday to provide him with a cake, and they gave him a couple of eggs and some oil

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.720
and some water and some flour and said, here's your birthday cake, right?

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.559
And it was quite comical.

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:30.200
But the reality is that sometimes instructions can be one thing.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.920
We look at them and say, what in the world?

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.920
Right, Joseph?

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.200
He does some projects with me.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.320
And sometimes I look at the instructions and I'm like, I don't get it.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.119
It just does not make sense to me.

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:41.920
I'm not following what I'm supposed to do here.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.920
What is this part for?

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.279
What is this thing for?

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:50.839
When we think about the instructions that God has provided to us, we ought to be thankful

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.359
that our God has been faithful to provide us with this instruction.

00:06:56.359 --> 00:07:01.640
And as we consider this morning, not only the reality that God has been faithful, but

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.239
I also want you to think about this and acknowledge this truth this morning, that the instruction

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:08.760
is indeed from God.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.160
This is not just Paul's instruction to the families in Colossae.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.920
This is not just my instruction to the folks in our church this morning.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.179
No, this is God's instruction.

00:07:19.179 --> 00:07:24.459
We believe this morning in the inspiration of God's word, that all scripture is given

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:28.980
by inspiration of God and is what is profitable.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.579
And I believe this morning that as we consider the word of God that is before us, that we

00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:37.059
must acknowledge that this is the word of God.

00:07:37.059 --> 00:07:41.459
And as God has given, we're not going to attack, well, Paul just didn't understand in this.

00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:43.179
No, it's God's word.

00:07:43.179 --> 00:07:44.179
Amen.

00:07:44.179 --> 00:07:49.140
And when we acknowledge that it's God's word and this instruction is from God, and we understand

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:54.299
this morning that it's profitable, then I believe that we also would come to this point,

00:07:54.299 --> 00:08:00.320
and perhaps I would say this, we should agree this morning that God knows best.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.859
Would you agree with that?

00:08:01.859 --> 00:08:02.859
God knows best.

00:08:02.859 --> 00:08:05.619
He is the author of the home.

00:08:05.619 --> 00:08:06.720
He designed it.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.519
He instituted the home.

00:08:08.519 --> 00:08:13.380
And so who would know better about the home than God?

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.380
Right?

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.260
Listen, I understand this morning, there are a lot of books that have been written by a

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.700
lot of very good authors about the home.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.059
I understand that.

00:08:21.059 --> 00:08:24.420
And there are some valuable things that you can glean from some of those books that are

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:29.859
out there, but I would say this, that those truths must be in line with the truth that's

00:08:29.859 --> 00:08:32.020
provided in this book.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.539
Because God is the author of the home.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:40.000
He is the designer, and therefore He knows best.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.739
And when we agree this morning at the very onset of the message, when we consider this

00:08:43.739 --> 00:08:47.679
instruction that's provided, is that first, I'm going to be thankful that God's given

00:08:47.679 --> 00:08:48.679
the instruction.

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:53.820
I'm going to acknowledge that it's from God, and I'm also going to agree that He knows

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:54.820
best.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.059
Then it helps us as we approach this portion of Scripture.

00:08:58.059 --> 00:08:59.500
Amen?

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:05.780
Because all of a sudden, our perspective and our entrance into the verses that we see are

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.700
going to be received in a different manner.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.859
Because we say, this is God's Word, and God knows best.

00:09:12.979 --> 00:09:15.580
And I'm thankful that He's provided the instruction.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.659
Notice with me, as we consider the instruction that's been provided, first we see in verse

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:23.500
number 18, He addresses the wives.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.640
He says this, wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.820
And it says this as it is fit in the Lord.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:36.940
The word submit, we understand it to be a word that means to arrange under rank.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:41.619
In fact, it would be a word that would be often used with regard to military type of

00:09:41.619 --> 00:09:42.619
reference.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.580
But we find that it means to arrange under rank.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.619
It does not mean slavery, amen?

00:09:49.619 --> 00:09:51.059
It means to arrange under rank.

00:09:51.059 --> 00:09:55.979
And we consider this truth that's been given here, we must understand that our God is a

00:09:55.979 --> 00:09:58.739
God of order.

00:09:58.739 --> 00:09:59.979
Everything that our God does...

00:09:59.979 --> 00:10:01.059
is with order.

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:02.699
You read Genesis chapter number one

00:10:02.699 --> 00:10:06.059
as you read about the creation of all that he did,

00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:08.139
and you see the order in creation,

00:10:08.139 --> 00:10:11.219
and you find that God says in the church in Corinth

00:10:11.219 --> 00:10:14.459
that everything is to be done decently and in order.

00:10:14.459 --> 00:10:15.279
Why?

00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:18.199
Because our God is a God of order.

00:10:18.199 --> 00:10:21.719
You find that the enemy is the designer

00:10:21.719 --> 00:10:24.339
of chaos and confusion.

00:10:24.339 --> 00:10:28.039
He is not about order, but our God is about order.

00:10:28.039 --> 00:10:31.359
And so therefore, as he's providing this instruction to us,

00:10:31.359 --> 00:10:35.479
we find that he's giving us order for the home.

00:10:35.479 --> 00:10:38.679
And as we consider, first he speaks to the wives

00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:40.639
about this subject of submission,

00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:42.559
and then he finishes the verse by saying,

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:44.959
as it is fit in the Lord.

00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:49.039
It is fitting as a wife would fulfill her responsibility

00:10:49.039 --> 00:10:51.239
to submit to her own husband.

00:10:51.239 --> 00:10:52.719
It's pleasing to God.

00:10:52.719 --> 00:10:55.419
We find that as you not only consider

00:10:55.419 --> 00:10:56.479
that it's pleasing to God,

00:10:56.479 --> 00:10:59.599
I believe it also would carry with it the idea

00:10:59.599 --> 00:11:02.119
that it is appropriate in God's eyes.

00:11:02.119 --> 00:11:05.239
In other words, it's not for a wife to submit

00:11:05.239 --> 00:11:07.079
to do something that would be contrary

00:11:07.079 --> 00:11:09.079
to what God's word has said.

00:11:10.679 --> 00:11:11.999
That some husband can say,

00:11:11.999 --> 00:11:13.399
well, you're supposed to submit,

00:11:13.399 --> 00:11:15.239
and so do this, so on and so forth.

00:11:15.239 --> 00:11:17.919
That's not the idea of submission.

00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:20.139
And really what happens is the enemy wants

00:11:20.139 --> 00:11:22.519
to get that little thought in your head

00:11:22.519 --> 00:11:24.359
so that when you hear the word submit,

00:11:24.359 --> 00:11:26.959
you have both arms out in resistance.

00:11:27.899 --> 00:11:31.519
But when we take the approach that this is from God,

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:33.519
and that God knows best,

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:35.759
and that God has been faithful to give the instruction,

00:11:35.759 --> 00:11:39.599
all of a sudden, I'm going to receive the instruction

00:11:39.599 --> 00:11:41.799
and understand that it is best for me

00:11:41.799 --> 00:11:43.799
to follow the instruction.

00:11:43.799 --> 00:11:46.339
Look over, I asked you to keep your place in Ephesians 5.

00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:51.259
Notice in Ephesians 5, in verses 22 through 24,

00:11:51.259 --> 00:11:52.799
we find that God gives instruction

00:11:52.799 --> 00:11:54.399
to the believers in Ephesus.

00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:55.979
Again, he begins with the wives.

00:11:55.979 --> 00:11:59.159
He says this, submit yourselves unto your own husbands.

00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:03.119
Look at what he says, as unto the Lord.

00:12:03.119 --> 00:12:06.239
Understanding, again, that God has given order.

00:12:06.239 --> 00:12:07.919
And I know that there's some that say,

00:12:07.919 --> 00:12:09.999
I just don't wanna, I just can't submit to him,

00:12:09.999 --> 00:12:11.079
and so on and so forth.

00:12:11.079 --> 00:12:13.959
You understand that he's responsible to God.

00:12:13.959 --> 00:12:15.679
And as you submit and you fulfill

00:12:15.679 --> 00:12:17.959
your responsibility to God to submit,

00:12:17.959 --> 00:12:21.279
then that responsibility ends with the husband.

00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:24.039
And really, there's a valuable level of protection

00:12:24.039 --> 00:12:27.039
for the wife as she submits unto her husband

00:12:27.039 --> 00:12:28.639
as unto the Lord.

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:31.499
Notice in verse 23, for the husband is the head of the wife

00:12:31.499 --> 00:12:33.439
even as Christ is the head of the church,

00:12:33.439 --> 00:12:36.259
and he is the savior of the body.

00:12:36.259 --> 00:12:38.959
Therefore, as the church is subject unto Christ,

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:41.879
we'll let the wives be to their own husbands in everything.

00:12:41.879 --> 00:12:43.839
And so we find that the instruction is provided

00:12:43.839 --> 00:12:44.679
first to the wives.

00:12:44.679 --> 00:12:46.079
Number two, to the husbands.

00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:48.639
Notice back in Colossians 3, in verse number 19,

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:50.799
the Bible says this, husbands.

00:12:51.199 --> 00:12:56.199
It says, love your wives and be not bitter against them.

00:12:57.519 --> 00:13:00.519
We find that the truth in Ephesians 5

00:13:00.519 --> 00:13:02.959
with regard to this instruction for husbands

00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:05.599
to love our wives, it says this,

00:13:05.599 --> 00:13:09.039
it gives us the manner in which we're to love our wives.

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:11.399
In Ephesians 5, in verse number 25,

00:13:11.399 --> 00:13:15.199
husbands, love your wives even as Christ

00:13:15.199 --> 00:13:20.199
also loved the church and gave himself for it.

00:13:20.999 --> 00:13:22.579
That's the highest form of love.

00:13:22.579 --> 00:13:24.519
It's the Greek word agape.

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:26.079
It's the word that's denoted,

00:13:26.079 --> 00:13:29.359
that's used regarding the love of God.

00:13:29.359 --> 00:13:32.599
And we find that we are to love our wives, husbands,

00:13:32.599 --> 00:13:35.719
as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it.

00:13:35.719 --> 00:13:38.079
It is a sacrificial love.

00:13:38.079 --> 00:13:39.379
And let me say this this morning,

00:13:39.379 --> 00:13:41.719
maybe perhaps as a question,

00:13:41.719 --> 00:13:43.599
does your wife, husbands,

00:13:43.599 --> 00:13:48.399
does your wife know that you love her in this manner?

00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:50.239
Does she know that you love her?

00:13:50.599 --> 00:13:55.599
Are you demonstrating, are you showing her your love?

00:13:55.639 --> 00:13:57.399
This is our responsibility.

00:13:57.399 --> 00:14:00.479
Husbands, love your wives

00:14:00.479 --> 00:14:03.879
even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it.

00:14:03.879 --> 00:14:07.319
We find that the instruction continues in Colossians

00:14:07.319 --> 00:14:11.359
and it tells us this with regard to the truth

00:14:11.359 --> 00:14:12.879
of the husbands, it says,

00:14:12.879 --> 00:14:16.239
and be not bitter against them.

00:14:16.239 --> 00:14:18.759
Be not bitter against them.

00:14:19.039 --> 00:14:22.599
The reality is that there are times even as we mentioned

00:14:22.599 --> 00:14:26.119
with regard to the behavior in the church

00:14:26.119 --> 00:14:28.039
and the peace that should be prevalent

00:14:28.039 --> 00:14:31.519
in the church of God because of that crucifying our flesh,

00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:34.079
because of the putting off and the putting on,

00:14:34.079 --> 00:14:36.959
that one of the references that was given

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:40.319
with regard to the put on was in verse number 13

00:14:40.319 --> 00:14:41.519
forbearing one another,

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:43.599
literally putting up with one another

00:14:43.599 --> 00:14:45.599
and forgiving one another.

00:14:45.599 --> 00:14:46.479
And then it said this,

00:14:46.479 --> 00:14:48.599
if any man have a quarrel against any,

00:14:49.439 --> 00:14:52.799
even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.

00:14:52.799 --> 00:14:55.239
You know, our home, husbands, when it says

00:14:55.239 --> 00:14:57.599
and be not bitter against them,

00:14:57.599 --> 00:15:00.119
we need to be careful that our home is a place

00:15:00.119 --> 00:15:02.639
in which we are practicing forgiveness,

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:06.919
that we're not allowing the sun to go down upon our wrath,

00:15:06.919 --> 00:15:09.079
that we're speaking the truth in love,

00:15:09.079 --> 00:15:11.879
that we're open dialogue one with another.

00:15:11.879 --> 00:15:16.079
I know that there are times in relationships,

00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:17.879
no matter what the relationship is

00:15:17.919 --> 00:15:20.679
and specifically as we're focused on the home this morning,

00:15:20.679 --> 00:15:22.759
that there will be some level of quarrel,

00:15:22.759 --> 00:15:24.679
there's a contention, there's a problem,

00:15:24.679 --> 00:15:27.119
there's something that just doesn't go the way

00:15:27.119 --> 00:15:30.079
that we planned for it to go, right?

00:15:30.079 --> 00:15:31.839
I told you about the fellow that I heard preach

00:15:31.839 --> 00:15:33.559
at a pastor's meeting not long ago

00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:35.439
and he stood there and said, I can tell you,

00:15:35.439 --> 00:15:37.559
I can stand here, Brother Savalle, he said,

00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:40.159
in all honesty, I've been married for 35 years

00:15:40.159 --> 00:15:44.139
and I've never said one thing to my wife that I regret.

00:15:44.139 --> 00:15:46.579
I've never had one argument with my wife,

00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:49.739
I've never raised my voice to my wife one time

00:15:49.739 --> 00:15:52.339
and all the preachers are like, man, this is amazing.

00:15:53.459 --> 00:15:55.979
And then he said this, but there've been plenty of times

00:15:55.979 --> 00:15:58.739
that I just didn't talk to her for days.

00:15:58.739 --> 00:16:00.979
Well, that's not the answer either, right?

00:16:00.979 --> 00:16:03.939
That's not the way it's supposed to work, amen?

00:16:03.939 --> 00:16:05.119
But what was he doing?

00:16:05.119 --> 00:16:07.459
He was really saying, look, I didn't do this,

00:16:07.459 --> 00:16:09.019
but I did this.

00:16:09.019 --> 00:16:11.539
Well, what he did wasn't right and he acknowledged that,

00:16:11.539 --> 00:16:16.059
he was just being funny with regard to his own behavior

00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:19.819
and his shortcoming and his need to allow God

00:16:19.819 --> 00:16:20.819
to work in his life.

00:16:20.819 --> 00:16:23.779
Listen, we need to be careful and guard against bitterness,

00:16:24.739 --> 00:16:28.359
against brother and sister, church member,

00:16:28.359 --> 00:16:32.059
against husband and wife, parent and children.

00:16:32.059 --> 00:16:34.719
I mean, bitterness is a terrible thing.

00:16:34.719 --> 00:16:36.259
Bitterness destroys.

00:16:37.459 --> 00:16:39.379
I've often said this, it destroys the vessel

00:16:39.379 --> 00:16:41.619
in which it's stored more than the vessel

00:16:41.619 --> 00:16:43.379
in which it's poured.

00:16:43.379 --> 00:16:45.379
We find that bitterness is a terrible thing

00:16:45.539 --> 00:16:49.139
and God says to the husbands, not only to love your wives,

00:16:49.139 --> 00:16:53.359
but then he says, and be not bitter against them.

00:16:53.359 --> 00:16:56.359
Now the focus turns to children in verse number 20,

00:16:56.359 --> 00:16:57.959
the instruction being provided.

00:16:57.959 --> 00:16:59.859
Notice in verse number 20, he says,

00:16:59.859 --> 00:17:03.219
children, obey your parents in all things.

00:17:03.219 --> 00:17:04.739
And now the parents get a little excited

00:17:04.739 --> 00:17:06.419
because the wives say, man,

00:17:06.419 --> 00:17:07.659
you're not dealing with the wife anymore.

00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:09.379
The husbands say, not dealing with the husbands anymore.

00:17:09.379 --> 00:17:10.379
Now we're dealing with the children.

00:17:10.379 --> 00:17:12.419
And so, hey, kids, listen up, right?

00:17:12.419 --> 00:17:13.819
Kevin's back there, Ian and Isaiah,

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:15.579
you listen to the preacher, amen.

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:18.219
He's talking about the children now, right?

00:17:18.219 --> 00:17:19.739
Amen, right?

00:17:21.699 --> 00:17:23.739
He turned me off when I talked about husbands,

00:17:23.739 --> 00:17:26.459
but man, when he heard children, he said, listen up, boys.

00:17:26.459 --> 00:17:28.739
I'm just teasing, I'm just teasing.

00:17:28.739 --> 00:17:32.459
But listen, he says, children,

00:17:33.319 --> 00:17:38.319
obey your parents in all things.

00:17:39.499 --> 00:17:41.599
Not some things, not most things,

00:17:41.599 --> 00:17:43.119
not the things that you like,

00:17:43.119 --> 00:17:45.519
the things that you agree with,

00:17:45.519 --> 00:17:47.719
but in all things, right?

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:52.759
There's a level of protection for the children,

00:17:52.759 --> 00:17:54.699
just as I mentioned the protection for the wife

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:57.719
and submission because the husband is accountable.

00:17:57.719 --> 00:17:59.779
Biblical proof for that, when Sarah laughed,

00:17:59.779 --> 00:18:01.159
who did God go to?

00:18:01.159 --> 00:18:02.419
Abraham.

00:18:02.419 --> 00:18:04.879
Abraham, why did Sarah laugh?

00:18:04.879 --> 00:18:08.359
It's interesting that he didn't ask Sarah why she laughed.

00:18:08.359 --> 00:18:11.279
Why, because the husband is responsible.

00:18:14.119 --> 00:18:19.079
Children have a safety net, if you will,

00:18:19.079 --> 00:18:21.639
in obedience to their parents.

00:18:21.639 --> 00:18:24.119
Obey your parents, it says, in all things,

00:18:24.119 --> 00:18:26.599
but then I want you to catch this, it says this,

00:18:26.599 --> 00:18:31.599
for this is well-pleasing unto the Lord.

00:18:31.719 --> 00:18:35.119
That's encouraging for a child.

00:18:35.119 --> 00:18:37.119
I understand that obedience doesn't come natural

00:18:37.119 --> 00:18:37.940
for a child.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.159
Any of you that have had children,

00:18:39.159 --> 00:18:43.039
you understand the fact that we are born sinners, amen?

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.919
It's not hard when you talk about the truth

00:18:45.919 --> 00:18:49.639
of giving the gospel presentation for all have sinned.

00:18:49.639 --> 00:18:51.079
You say, man, I got some kids,

00:18:51.079 --> 00:18:53.599
and we didn't have to teach them to sin.

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:55.839
They were born sinners.

00:18:55.839 --> 00:18:58.719
It doesn't come natural for children to obey in all things,

00:18:58.719 --> 00:19:00.760
but we find that the truth that's given here

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.719
is that this, obedience to your parents,

00:19:03.719 --> 00:19:07.739
is well-pleasing unto the Lord.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.559
We find that we understand that God has given instruction,

00:19:13.199 --> 00:19:14.599
I asked you to be in chapter five,

00:19:14.599 --> 00:19:16.919
this goes down into chapter number six.

00:19:17.919 --> 00:19:20.479
In chapter number six, in verses one through three,

00:19:20.479 --> 00:19:22.159
the Bible says this, children,

00:19:22.159 --> 00:19:23.579
obey your parents and the Lord,

00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:25.239
notice, for this is right.

00:19:25.239 --> 00:19:28.399
It then says this, honor thy father and mother,

00:19:28.399 --> 00:19:29.459
and then notice, he says,

00:19:29.459 --> 00:19:31.320
which is the first commandment with promise.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.359
He goes back to the Exodus chapter number 20,

00:19:34.359 --> 00:19:35.519
we'll look at it in just a moment.

00:19:35.519 --> 00:19:38.760
And then it says this, that it may be well with thee,

00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:43.079
and that thou mayest live long on the earth.

00:19:43.079 --> 00:19:45.719
Well, so when I understand all that God is telling me,

00:19:45.719 --> 00:19:48.159
again, he's the one that's designed this.

00:19:48.159 --> 00:19:51.320
He's the one that knows what is best,

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.919
and he's been faithful to give us the instruction.

00:19:53.919 --> 00:19:56.719
I say, well, this just makes sense that I would do this.

00:19:56.719 --> 00:19:57.880
It's gonna be better for me.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.639
It's going to result in living a long life.

00:20:00.639 --> 00:20:06.239
life that would be longer, that would bring honor to God, it says in Exodus 20

00:20:06.239 --> 00:20:09.559
and verse 12, honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon

00:20:09.559 --> 00:20:17.399
the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. I am thankful to be living in New

00:20:17.399 --> 00:20:23.559
Testament era, aren't you? If you say I'm not so sure about that, read the book of

00:20:23.559 --> 00:20:26.799
Leviticus this afternoon and perhaps you'll come back tonight with a

00:20:26.799 --> 00:20:33.519
different idea. I'm thankful that we're no longer under the law. Christ has

00:20:33.519 --> 00:20:39.759
redeemed us from the law, amen? Now we understand that it's still valuable and

00:20:39.759 --> 00:20:43.519
there's still instruction that we learn from it, but I'm thankful to not be under

00:20:43.519 --> 00:20:48.639
the law. Listen, the law could never save. Galatians is very clear about that. If

00:20:48.639 --> 00:20:52.599
righteousness came by the law, then Christ is dead in vain, but I want you to

00:20:52.599 --> 00:20:56.039
understand some things about the Old Testament that there are many things.

00:20:56.039 --> 00:21:00.319
Listen, children would be put to death for some of the behavior that is

00:21:00.319 --> 00:21:06.119
tolerated today. Again, I'm thankful to live in the New Testament, amen? And I'm

00:21:06.119 --> 00:21:10.919
thankful for God's grace and for God's mercy, but you understand that as we look

00:21:10.919 --> 00:21:16.759
at these truths that what God is doing is God is trying to, I shouldn't

00:21:16.759 --> 00:21:22.599
say trying, God is providing instruction that is profitable, right? You think about

00:21:22.599 --> 00:21:25.559
those in the Old Testament, there are portions of scripture that you can read

00:21:25.559 --> 00:21:29.239
about children that were stoned because of their sin, because of their

00:21:29.239 --> 00:21:32.879
disobedience, their lack of honor, so on and so forth, and as you look at those

00:21:32.879 --> 00:21:37.519
situations, you say, well the commandment was, honor thy father and mother that thy

00:21:37.519 --> 00:21:41.839
days may be long upon the earth. They were cut short because of your sin,

00:21:41.839 --> 00:21:46.519
because of your disobedience, right? And so we find here that in the New

00:21:46.519 --> 00:21:53.039
Testament that God is giving us this instruction. We notice that he says again

00:21:53.079 --> 00:21:58.319
that this is well-pleasing unto the Lord. Finally, we come to verse number 21 as we

00:21:58.319 --> 00:22:02.719
think about the instruction that's been provided. We find that the passage

00:22:02.719 --> 00:22:08.119
now addresses fathers. We see wives in verse 18, husbands in verse 19, children

00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:16.679
in verse 20. In verse 21, fathers. It says, provoke not your children to anger lest

00:22:16.679 --> 00:22:23.319
they be discouraged. Provoke not. We see this also in the book of Ephesians in

00:22:23.319 --> 00:22:28.919
chapter number 6, and we find that there the Bible says, and ye fathers, provoke

00:22:28.919 --> 00:22:34.119
not your children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of

00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:41.239
the Lord. I believe this morning that consistency is key. I believe that one of

00:22:41.319 --> 00:22:46.839
the easiest ways for us to, as fathers, as parents, to provoke our children to

00:22:46.839 --> 00:22:51.759
anger, to wrath, is through inconsistency. I believe that it's important that we

00:22:51.759 --> 00:22:56.599
understand that our children are a blessing from God. Amen?

00:22:56.599 --> 00:23:02.639
Lo, children are an heritage from the Lord. They're a blessing from God, and we

00:23:02.639 --> 00:23:08.719
have been, for a season of time, we have been entrusted by God to instruct our

00:23:08.759 --> 00:23:13.079
children, to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, and we need

00:23:13.079 --> 00:23:16.279
to be careful to understand that they're a blessing from God and that we play a

00:23:16.279 --> 00:23:21.559
vital role in their development, and that we help them to understand much about

00:23:21.559 --> 00:23:27.119
who God is and how God operates. And the consistency in the lives of parents is

00:23:27.119 --> 00:23:31.539
essential, that we would not provoke our children to anger, to wrath. Notice the

00:23:31.539 --> 00:23:37.759
last part of verse 21. It says, lest they be discouraged. The word discouraged means

00:23:37.799 --> 00:23:43.719
to be disheartened. It means to be broken in spirit. Oftentimes, we've heard people

00:23:43.719 --> 00:23:49.679
speak about the necessity, perhaps, of breaking a child's will. You've

00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:54.839
heard somebody use that terminology. They're strong-willed, or whatever the

00:23:54.839 --> 00:23:58.219
terminology would be that someone would use, and they need to have their

00:23:58.219 --> 00:24:03.119
will broken, and we will use that terminology. That's quite different than

00:24:03.159 --> 00:24:08.759
breaking their spirit. We need to be careful that we understand this. Let me

00:24:08.759 --> 00:24:12.639
say, as we look at the instruction provided, that each one of us here this

00:24:12.639 --> 00:24:18.959
morning find ourselves in a category, and as we would look at the categories that

00:24:18.959 --> 00:24:23.119
are provided, we must thank God for the instruction that's been given, and as we

00:24:23.119 --> 00:24:27.719
look here, wives, husbands, children, fathers, we see that the instruction has

00:24:27.719 --> 00:24:31.599
been provided, and then I would ask this, or say this as our second point this

00:24:31.599 --> 00:24:37.599
morning, instruction provided, instruction understood, and I'm gonna say

00:24:37.599 --> 00:24:43.799
question mark. Do you understand the instruction? So, I think this morning that

00:24:43.799 --> 00:24:46.919
as we look at these four verses of Scripture, that it would be very easy for

00:24:46.919 --> 00:24:54.639
us to agree that the truth that is given is not complicated, right? It's not like

00:24:54.639 --> 00:24:57.479
some of those instruction booklets that you've received on some of those

00:24:57.479 --> 00:25:00.999
products that you've purchased, and you don't know which one. I'm like, man, maybe

00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:03.839
I'll read the Spanish side of this, because it might make more sense, you

00:25:03.839 --> 00:25:10.359
know? I mean, it just can be so confusing. I told you about the the ceiling fan I

00:25:10.359 --> 00:25:14.919
tried to put together. I mean, it was an absolute nonsense, but it made sense

00:25:14.919 --> 00:25:18.679
once I followed the instructions, but the instructions made no sense in the

00:25:18.679 --> 00:25:23.319
beginning, because I've put together tons of ceiling fans, and it's always followed

00:25:23.319 --> 00:25:27.079
the same exact process until I got this one, and I was glad that I used the

00:25:27.079 --> 00:25:31.039
illustration, because I saved brother Ron Adams some time as well, amen? Because he

00:25:31.039 --> 00:25:35.159
got one of those same silly fans that has the crazy instructions, but the

00:25:35.159 --> 00:25:39.879
reality is that there are times in which instructions can be complicated. You ever

00:25:39.879 --> 00:25:43.319
wonder why the folks at Microsoft decided you got to push control alt

00:25:43.319 --> 00:25:47.719
delete? Right? Like, I mean, why do I have to? Why can't there just be one button?

00:25:47.719 --> 00:25:50.799
That's what they decided. I don't know, the computer science guys are

00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:53.999
gonna come give me answers after the service, right? This is why you have to do

00:25:53.999 --> 00:25:59.759
it this way, but the reality is that, listen, we understand instructions being

00:25:59.759 --> 00:26:05.279
provided, and there are times in which we can say, man, that's complicated, but this

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:11.399
morning this is basic. This is easy to understand, and my question for you this

00:26:11.399 --> 00:26:16.159
morning is, do we understand the instruction that God has given? Again,

00:26:16.159 --> 00:26:20.279
we're agreeing at the onset of the message that God knows best. We're

00:26:20.279 --> 00:26:24.679
agreeing on the onset of the message that this is God's Word. This is, yes, God

00:26:24.679 --> 00:26:28.719
used the Apostle Paul to be the human penman of this particular book, but all

00:26:28.719 --> 00:26:33.159
Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and it's profitable, and we find here

00:26:33.159 --> 00:26:36.799
this morning that this instruction, it's not hard. You know, there are people that

00:26:36.799 --> 00:26:41.879
criticize the Bible and say, oh, it's so complicated, it's so difficult. The

00:26:41.879 --> 00:26:46.279
reality is that much of the Bible is very easy to understand, and when you

00:26:46.279 --> 00:26:49.479
couple that with the fact that we have the Holy Spirit of God that is the

00:26:49.479 --> 00:26:54.319
Teacher that dwells within us and He illumines the Scriptures to us, it makes

00:26:54.319 --> 00:27:00.559
it that much easier for us to understand the Word of God. And this morning, I don't

00:27:00.559 --> 00:27:07.759
think anyone that's here could honestly say, I just don't understand, because the

00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:12.799
instruction is easy to understand. So it leads me to my final thought this

00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:20.759
morning. Instruction must be embraced and applied. Instruction must be embraced

00:27:20.759 --> 00:27:27.039
and applied. The instruction has been provided. Instruction can be understood,

00:27:27.039 --> 00:27:34.399
but can I say this this morning? Understanding does not equal applying.

00:27:34.399 --> 00:27:41.159
We can understand something and not apply it, correct? We can understand

00:27:41.199 --> 00:27:45.559
something and not apply it. So understanding does not equal applying.

00:27:45.559 --> 00:27:49.959
But this morning, when we look at this portion of Scripture, if we truly desire

00:27:49.959 --> 00:27:55.839
to have a home where the Lord is honored, where we have a harmonious home, where we

00:27:55.839 --> 00:28:01.439
aren't just in survival mode, but we're thriving with the blessing of God, and

00:28:01.439 --> 00:28:06.639
we're going through life enjoying all that God has designed for us to enjoy,

00:28:06.719 --> 00:28:12.239
then we must apply the truth that has been given. It's not enough to just say

00:28:12.239 --> 00:28:17.279
that God's provided the instruction. Oh, we're thankful that He's provided it. What

00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:21.199
a tremendous blessing. I mean, can you imagine if God did not provide

00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:24.599
instruction for your home? We wouldn't know how to behave. We wouldn't know who's

00:28:24.599 --> 00:28:29.359
supposed to do what, and so on and so forth, and it could be very chaotic. But

00:28:29.359 --> 00:28:33.919
God has graciously provided the instruction, and it's very easy to

00:28:33.919 --> 00:28:38.519
understand. But understanding does not equal applying, and we find that I must

00:28:38.519 --> 00:28:45.399
embrace this truth, and as I embrace the instruction, I then apply it in my life.

00:28:45.399 --> 00:28:50.879
The wives apply the truth of verse 18. The husbands applying the truth of verse

00:28:50.879 --> 00:28:55.319
number 19. The children applying the truth of verse number 20. The

00:28:55.319 --> 00:29:01.119
father's parents applying the truth of verse number 21. And listen, here's what

00:29:01.119 --> 00:29:09.399
I find this morning. My flesh and your flesh probably have a hard time with

00:29:09.399 --> 00:29:16.759
some of the instruction that's provided here, but that's why the preceding text

00:29:16.759 --> 00:29:21.359
is so important. Mortify, therefore, your members which are upon the earth.

00:29:21.359 --> 00:29:30.279
Literally crucify your flesh. Put off the old man, all of these things. Put on

00:29:30.279 --> 00:29:36.799
the new man with all of these things. Now your behavior in the church house is

00:29:36.799 --> 00:29:41.839
going to be characterized by peace and unity and devotion and purpose and

00:29:41.839 --> 00:29:47.719
praise, and now your home is going to be a home where each individual is

00:29:47.799 --> 00:29:57.279
fulfilling the plan that God has. It's possible in the power of God. I will say

00:29:57.279 --> 00:30:02.679
this. Husbands, you're

00:30:02.679 --> 00:30:05.939
Your wife will have a much easier time submitting

00:30:05.939 --> 00:30:08.099
if she knows you love her.

00:30:10.439 --> 00:30:11.279
Amen?

00:30:12.259 --> 00:30:14.079
It's the way it works.

00:30:14.079 --> 00:30:17.219
Wives will have a much easier time submitting

00:30:17.219 --> 00:30:21.019
when they know that their husbands love them,

00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:23.819
that their husbands are walking with God,

00:30:23.819 --> 00:30:26.119
that their husbands have put off the old man

00:30:26.119 --> 00:30:27.599
and put on the new man

00:30:27.599 --> 00:30:31.239
and are walking in the power of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:30:31.239 --> 00:30:32.919
Children are gonna have a much easier time

00:30:32.919 --> 00:30:33.919
obeying their parents

00:30:33.919 --> 00:30:36.219
as they know that their parents love them

00:30:36.219 --> 00:30:38.999
and that their parents are seeking the face of God

00:30:38.999 --> 00:30:41.699
and desiring to please God.

00:30:41.699 --> 00:30:45.379
There are times in which perhaps we can tell our children,

00:30:45.379 --> 00:30:47.199
give them an answer with regard to something

00:30:47.199 --> 00:30:48.519
that they desire to do,

00:30:48.519 --> 00:30:50.919
and we can take them directly to some verses of Scripture

00:30:50.919 --> 00:30:53.639
and explain to them why we're not going to engage

00:30:53.639 --> 00:30:56.199
in such and such of behavior and so on and so forth.

00:30:56.199 --> 00:30:57.999
And there are other times that we just might be like,

00:30:57.999 --> 00:31:00.639
hey, listen, can you just trust me on this?

00:31:00.679 --> 00:31:03.519
We just don't have a piece about this.

00:31:03.519 --> 00:31:05.959
And if our children know that we're walking with God,

00:31:05.959 --> 00:31:07.759
if our children know that we love them,

00:31:07.759 --> 00:31:09.959
that we're not seeking to provoke them to anger,

00:31:09.959 --> 00:31:12.719
that we're not living a life of hypocrisy,

00:31:12.719 --> 00:31:17.239
that we're not seeking to be contentious and inconsistent,

00:31:17.239 --> 00:31:19.819
then they can have an easier time of obeying.

00:31:21.119 --> 00:31:23.759
But if we do all of that

00:31:23.759 --> 00:31:27.279
without putting off and putting on,

00:31:27.279 --> 00:31:28.599
we're gonna struggle

00:31:28.599 --> 00:31:30.639
because it's gonna get old real fast in the flesh

00:31:30.639 --> 00:31:31.599
trying to do that.

00:31:33.039 --> 00:31:34.399
It's very interesting to me

00:31:34.399 --> 00:31:35.879
that the truth that is given to us,

00:31:35.879 --> 00:31:38.759
the instruction provided in verses 18 through 21,

00:31:38.759 --> 00:31:42.279
in this portion of Colossians is preceded

00:31:42.279 --> 00:31:44.519
by that which we've dealt with in the last several weeks.

00:31:44.519 --> 00:31:46.959
It's also of interest and noteworthy

00:31:46.959 --> 00:31:49.079
that in Ephesians five and six,

00:31:49.079 --> 00:31:51.099
the portion that we were looking at earlier,

00:31:51.099 --> 00:31:53.519
where the same instruction is provided,

00:31:53.519 --> 00:31:55.979
I want you to be understanding this morning

00:31:55.979 --> 00:31:57.779
of the preceding passage

00:31:57.779 --> 00:32:01.419
that deals with this truth in Ephesians five.

00:32:02.259 --> 00:32:05.419
Before he gets to wives and husbands and children

00:32:05.419 --> 00:32:07.459
as he's addressing the church in Ephesus,

00:32:07.459 --> 00:32:12.059
he says this in verse number 18 of Ephesians five.

00:32:12.059 --> 00:32:13.659
And be not drunk with wine,

00:32:13.659 --> 00:32:15.219
wherein is excess.

00:32:15.219 --> 00:32:19.199
Notice, but be filled with the Spirit.

00:32:20.539 --> 00:32:22.979
I believe this morning that what is summarized

00:32:22.979 --> 00:32:25.799
in those few words at the end of verse number 18,

00:32:26.619 --> 00:32:27.639
but be filled with the Spirit,

00:32:27.639 --> 00:32:30.199
is what is illustrated to us in detail

00:32:30.199 --> 00:32:32.839
in Colossians three verses five through 14.

00:32:32.839 --> 00:32:35.719
Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth.

00:32:35.719 --> 00:32:37.879
Put off the old man, put on the new.

00:32:37.879 --> 00:32:40.799
That's the idea of being filled with the Spirit of God.

00:32:40.799 --> 00:32:43.879
That's the rubber meets the road truth

00:32:43.879 --> 00:32:46.299
of okay, how do I do this?

00:32:47.199 --> 00:32:49.099
The application.

00:32:49.099 --> 00:32:51.859
We find that he says, but be filled with the Spirit.

00:32:51.859 --> 00:32:54.519
Notice, speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns

00:32:54.519 --> 00:32:56.999
and spiritual songs, singing and making melody

00:32:56.999 --> 00:32:58.319
in your heart to the Lord,

00:32:58.319 --> 00:33:00.539
giving thanks always for all things unto God

00:33:00.539 --> 00:33:02.679
and for the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:33:02.679 --> 00:33:05.599
submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.

00:33:05.599 --> 00:33:09.239
Then he addresses the wives and the husbands

00:33:09.239 --> 00:33:10.179
and the children.

00:33:11.119 --> 00:33:14.059
And so as I'm walking in the Spirit,

00:33:14.059 --> 00:33:19.059
it is God who enables me to apply the instruction

00:33:20.039 --> 00:33:23.439
that he's given me with regard to the home.

00:33:23.439 --> 00:33:24.859
I can't do it in my own power.

00:33:24.859 --> 00:33:26.279
You understand something this morning?

00:33:26.279 --> 00:33:28.759
You can't live the Christian life in your own power.

00:33:28.759 --> 00:33:30.879
You can try for a little while.

00:33:30.879 --> 00:33:33.219
You're gonna get frustrated.

00:33:33.219 --> 00:33:34.059
You really are.

00:33:34.059 --> 00:33:35.799
You're gonna just get sideways in life

00:33:35.799 --> 00:33:36.839
and you're gonna get frustrated

00:33:36.839 --> 00:33:38.559
because you're trying to do it in your own power.

00:33:38.559 --> 00:33:40.559
Paul said, I know that in me that is in my flesh

00:33:40.559 --> 00:33:43.619
dwelleth no good thing, right?

00:33:43.619 --> 00:33:45.799
He says, the things that I would, I do not.

00:33:45.799 --> 00:33:47.399
The things that I would not, that I do.

00:33:47.399 --> 00:33:51.439
Listen, you try to live the Christian life in your own power

00:33:51.439 --> 00:33:53.119
and we become miserable.

00:33:54.519 --> 00:33:58.139
But it's amazing when God, when we come to that place

00:33:58.139 --> 00:34:03.139
of surrender, submission to God, walking in the Spirit

00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:08.239
and how he enables us to implement,

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:12.519
to apply the instruction that he has provided.

00:34:12.519 --> 00:34:17.299
This morning, I would hope that each and every one of us

00:34:17.299 --> 00:34:19.399
would stand and testify and say,

00:34:19.399 --> 00:34:21.919
I want a home where the Lord is honored.

00:34:21.919 --> 00:34:24.259
I want a home where God is honored.

00:34:25.359 --> 00:34:27.639
The home, I've often said this over the years,

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:30.599
is that haven, that safe place.

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:33.239
I remember when I worked in the corporate world,

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:36.119
it's a little bit different now as a pastor of a church.

00:34:36.119 --> 00:34:39.319
My office is kind of a haven of rest as well

00:34:39.319 --> 00:34:40.559
until some people wanna meet.

00:34:40.559 --> 00:34:41.679
No, I'm just teasing.

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:43.959
But the reality is that, listen,

00:34:44.919 --> 00:34:46.199
when I worked in the corporate world,

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:47.959
I worked in the corporate world for years.

00:34:47.959 --> 00:34:50.719
I understand what it is to work in the corporate life.

00:34:52.039 --> 00:34:54.159
And oh, how I love to come home,

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:58.939
to come to that haven, that safe place.

00:35:00.479 --> 00:35:03.599
I'm not in any way saying that my home is perfect,

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:06.579
but I desire to have a home that honors God.

00:35:06.579 --> 00:35:09.479
And this morning, if you wanna have a home that honors God,

00:35:09.479 --> 00:35:13.479
if you desire that, we understand that God's provided

00:35:13.479 --> 00:35:16.599
the instruction and we ought to be thankful for that.

00:35:16.599 --> 00:35:18.479
It's easy to understand,

00:35:18.479 --> 00:35:21.939
but oh, how we must embrace it and apply it.

00:35:21.939 --> 00:35:26.939
And when we do, I believe the result will be a home

00:35:27.399 --> 00:35:30.099
where the Lord is honored.

00:35:30.099 --> 00:35:31.699
Maybe this morning for our invitation,

00:35:31.699 --> 00:35:33.799
we need to have some families just gather together

00:35:33.799 --> 00:35:35.559
and pray together.

00:35:35.559 --> 00:35:38.919
Maybe visit the altar together, husbands and wives.

00:35:38.919 --> 00:35:39.899
I know most of the children,

00:35:39.899 --> 00:35:42.279
the young children are downstairs.

00:35:42.279 --> 00:35:47.239
But just ask God to help us, to enable us.

00:35:47.239 --> 00:35:49.319
We can identify a place in our lives and say,

00:35:49.319 --> 00:35:52.679
man, I've struggled in this area.

00:35:52.679 --> 00:35:55.639
Oh, that God would help me in this area

00:35:56.639 --> 00:35:59.599
so that we can have a home where the Lord is honored.

00:35:59.599 --> 00:36:00.439
Let's pray.

00:36:00.439 --> 00:36:02.879
Father, how we love you and how we thank you

00:36:02.879 --> 00:36:04.999
for the instruction that you've provided.

00:36:04.999 --> 00:36:09.079
We acknowledge this morning that this is your word.

00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:13.759
And you designed the home

00:36:15.479 --> 00:36:17.559
and you've provided the instruction

00:36:19.259 --> 00:36:20.839
for each member in the home.

00:36:23.199 --> 00:36:25.639
I believe this morning it's simple.

00:36:26.759 --> 00:36:28.319
It's easy to understand.

00:36:30.459 --> 00:36:32.279
But oh, how we understand this morning

00:36:32.279 --> 00:36:34.279
that to understand something

00:36:34.279 --> 00:36:36.219
does not mean to apply something.

00:36:40.079 --> 00:36:42.599
We're challenged by the truth of James 1

00:36:42.599 --> 00:36:47.079
that we would be doers of the word and not hearers only.

00:36:47.079 --> 00:36:48.399
Our homes are under attack.

00:36:48.399 --> 00:36:49.319
If we're not careful,

00:36:49.319 --> 00:36:53.719
we begin to listen to what the world says

00:36:53.719 --> 00:36:55.779
about how a home should operate.

00:36:56.639 --> 00:36:59.359
We begin to receive counsel from individuals

00:37:00.399 --> 00:37:02.319
that would speak to us about the role

00:37:02.319 --> 00:37:04.119
that we should play in our homes

00:37:04.839 --> 00:37:07.439
instead of listening to the voice of God.

00:37:09.679 --> 00:37:12.079
I pray that you'd move and work this morning

00:37:14.079 --> 00:37:15.879
in each family that's present.

00:37:16.799 --> 00:37:18.639
Perhaps they would have the opportunity

00:37:18.639 --> 00:37:21.879
to come to this altar as a family and just pray.

00:37:23.599 --> 00:37:25.559
God, we pray that you would have your will and way,

00:37:25.559 --> 00:37:27.479
that decisions would be made this morning

00:37:27.479 --> 00:37:30.279
that would honor you.

00:37:30.279 --> 00:37:32.399
Maybe some commitments that would be renewed

00:37:32.559 --> 00:37:35.839
maybe some commitments that would be renewed this morning

00:37:39.319 --> 00:37:43.239
so that we truly could have a home where you are honored.

00:37:45.279 --> 00:37:46.919
We will thank you for all that you'll do

00:37:46.919 --> 00:37:48.839
for it's in Christ's name we pray.
