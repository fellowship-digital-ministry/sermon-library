1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
number 11 as we continue really this little mini series if you will it's a

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,720
brief study through the first few verses here in Luke chapter number 11 I trust

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,680
that these thoughts from this passage of scripture have had an impact upon your

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,719
prayer life I've said often over these last few weeks and obviously last week

5
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:25,040
with a missionary but I've made the statement that we need a revival of

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,159
prayer and we need it in our lives personally we need in our families we

7
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:34,840
need in our church and we need to return to prayer I was thinking this morning of

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,159
that great hymn I think we actually on Sunday evening Dean I think we sang that

9
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:45,520
song sweet hour of prayer and I was convicted as I was thinking about that

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,759
song and what a blessing to have the privilege of prayer but so often we would

11
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,360
if we would acknowledge the truth and be transparent with the Lord we neglect

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,880
that great privilege of communing with our God and spending time with him in

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,919
prayer as we have not only studied here in Luke 11 but also as we study the

14
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:08,760
book of Colossians of course in the first section of Colossians 1 we've had

15
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,160
the opportunity several weeks ago to read about the way in which Paul was

16
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,519
praying for the believers in Colossae and we have said that that passage of

17
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,160
scripture is not only exemplary but it's convicting to think about the ministry

18
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,199
of intercessory prayer and the way in which Paul was saying to these believers

19
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:31,400
that he'd never met personally he'd simply heard about their faith through

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,040
their minister through their pastor Epaphras and Paul says I am praying for

21
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,919
you and here's how I'm praying for you and we think about prayer and we have

22
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:47,639
noted as we go through this passage in Luke 11 that this request of this

23
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:53,440
disciple when he said Lord teach us to pray that the response that our Savior

24
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,519
gives is of utmost importance we understand and we recognize even as we

25
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:04,239
studied last time that the reason that we have access this reason that we can

26
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,279
go before the throne room of heaven is because of our relationship remember

27
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:14,000
Jesus said when you pray say our Father which art in heaven as we looked at that

28
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:18,759
portion of this particular passage of scripture we rejoicing and understanding

29
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:23,279
that he is the Lord God omnipotent that is the Creator God the sustainer of all

30
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:27,919
things yet he is our father and the access that we have because of

31
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:33,919
relationship and what a joy that is and we understand that as we look at this

32
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:38,119
passage of scripture and I just want to remind us this evening that this

33
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:43,360
response of Jesus as he provides this instruction here that in no way was he

34
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,759
this isn't the prayer of Jesus so many people refer to this passage and the

35
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:52,000
sister passage in Matthew as being the Lord's Prayer it's not the Lord's Prayer

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,559
it's a motto it's the framework for prayer in fact as you would think about

37
00:02:56,559 --> 00:03:01,240
these particular words and this instruction the response of Jesus it was

38
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:09,080
never intended to simply be repeated in a given form it was not some type of

39
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,440
passage of scripture that Jesus is teaching to the disciples and they were

40
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,399
to memorize it and just recite it rehearse it verbatim in fact as you

41
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:23,240
study the New Testament you'll find that there are many records of the people of

42
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,399
God praying in fact we've studied some of the prayers of Paul we've studied in

43
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:32,080
Colossians 1 a couple of years ago as we study through the book of Ephesians you

44
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,160
see that there are two prayers in part specifically there that Paul gives in

45
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,199
chapter 2 and 3 of the book of Ephesians where he is providing actually

46
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,039
I think it's chapter 1 and 3 where he's providing the record of how he's praying

47
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,279
for the believers in Ephesus you will know that as you study the prayers that

48
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:54,160
are recorded in the New Testament by the people of God that never not one time are

49
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,360
these words quoted verbatim but yet you have people that think that this is

50
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,679
supposed to be something that is just quoted rehearsed recited verbatim as

51
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:09,600
being the Lord's Prayer but God is giving a model he's giving framework for

52
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,000
prayer as we continue our study we're gonna look at the latter part of verse

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,440
number 2 where the Bible says this I'll read the entirety of the passage in

54
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,519
verse 1 and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place Jesus was

55
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,200
praying when he seized one of his disciples said unto him Lord teach us to

56
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:32,239
pray as John also taught his disciples and he Jesus said unto them the

57
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:36,119
disciples collectively it was one disciple that asked the question but

58
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:41,320
Jesus now answers and gives all of the disciples this instruction when you pray

59
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:47,600
not if you pray but when you pray say our Father which art in heaven the text

60
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,839
that we'll be looking at this evening begins with this next phrase hallowed be

61
00:04:51,839 --> 00:05:00,880
thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in earth if you're

62
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,760
taking notes and you'd like to give a title I've simply titled it hallowed be

63
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:10,239
thy name we're gonna look at two aspects from these truths this evening in verse

64
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:15,519
number two of really our attitude of prayer how it is that we approach prayer

65
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:20,399
and I would say number one is we look at this phrase hallowed be thy name we

66
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:25,440
enter into our time of prayer into that season of prayer with an attitude of

67
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,079
reverence an attitude of reverence the Bible says hallowed be thy name the

68
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:34,839
word hallowed carries with the idea of being sanctified but really gives us the

69
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:40,640
idea of holy we understand that our God is holy the attribute of God's holiness

70
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,839
is found throughout the scriptures you find there in the book of Leviticus in

71
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:49,399
particular that God is giving his people the children of Israel the truth with

72
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:54,519
regard to his holiness and he says be ye holy as I am holy we find that it's

73
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:59,839
there in Isaiah chapter number six as Isaiah sees God high holy and lifted up

74
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:07,480
in his train filled the temple that the angels say holy holy holy Peter tells

75
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,880
those that he's writing to in first Peter as he's giving them the admonition

76
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,880
and the instruction of living lives of obedience and holiness he refers back to

77
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,760
that passage or those passages in Leviticus when he says be holy even as I

78
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,359
am holy we find in the book of Revelation once again when the throne

79
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:29,279
room of heaven is in scene and you begin to read in chapter number five and you

80
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:37,480
read about holy holy holy our God is holy and we think about this attitude of

81
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,559
reverence as we think about the holiness of God it is important I believe

82
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:47,559
imperative that when we enter into our time of prayer that yes we're praying to

83
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:54,399
our father but we must be mindful of the fact that he's holy he's a holy God

84
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,160
this evening as we think about the holiness of God and we're mindful of his

85
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,079
holiness we would understand that the reality of that truth should have a

86
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:08,640
profound impact and influence upon our lives as individuals I don't know

87
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,119
perhaps some of the parents here you've been in a situation before or maybe some

88
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:16,000
of the adults here you remember when you were a teenager that you were in this

89
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,959
situation when you were speaking to your parents and they said hold on a

90
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:26,519
minute who are you talking to I'm not your friend I'm your parent has that

91
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:32,000
ever happened listen sometimes if we're not careful in everyday conversations

92
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,559
and interactions we might kind of forget who we're talking to or addressing in

93
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:42,679
which manner and so on and so forth we understand as Jesus is giving this

94
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:47,559
answer this response of the disciples he says our father which art in heaven

95
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:54,440
hallowed be thy name the name of God what a wonderful name we've been

96
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,119
studying in the book of Genesis on Sunday evenings in fact this past Sunday

97
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:01,559
night we're dealing with Genesis 17 and verse number one the Almighty God El

98
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:05,920
Shaddai and you find that as you look through the life of Abram and his name

99
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,880
will soon be changed to Abraham as we're studying through the book of Genesis you

100
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:20,040
find that God regularly is revealing names of himself to Abraham he's through

101
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:26,399
those names through the names of God we find that is how God is revealing to us

102
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:32,919
who he is that we may more clearly understand who he is he's the Lord God

103
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:38,280
omnipotent he is Jehovah Jireh the God who provides he's I mean we could go

104
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,200
through all the names of God and just understand the fullness of who he did

105
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,960
who he is the all-sufficient one we sang this evening Savior like a shepherd lead

106
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,039
us how do we get that idea how did the songwriter get that idea well the Bible

107
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:58,559
says that the Lord is the Good Shepherd that he's the Great Shepherd that he's

108
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:03,840
the Chief Shepherd we find that the the sweet psalmist of Israel David he says

109
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:10,280
the Lord is my shepherd and we find as we think about the name of God hallowed

110
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,000
be thy name that when we enter into prayer that we enter with an attitude or

111
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:24,619
a spirit of reverence our God is holy he's holy I'm thankful that I can

112
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:28,119
approach him but you know the only reason that I can approach him is

113
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:33,479
because I have been born again I've been redeemed I'm clothed in the righteousness

114
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:38,880
of Christ I can't approach him in my own righteousness but I because he's my

115
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,280
father I can approach him I've access but I must be mindful of the truth that

116
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,479
he is holy it's interesting to me you don't need to turn there you can if you

117
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:50,239
want but in Psalm 30 hold your place there if you are gonna turn because

118
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:54,719
we'll be back to Luke in just a moment but in Psalm 30 the psalmist gives us a

119
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:58,799
truth that I think is of significant importance and I believe that as you

120
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,039
would use the the correlation here between this truth in Psalm 30 and the

121
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,479
answer that Jesus gives to the disciples with regard to prayer notice

122
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:12,080
what the psalmist says in Psalm 30 in verse number four he says this sing

123
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:19,960
unto the Lord O you saints of his and give thanks at the remembrance of his

124
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:26,159
holiness you know when we pray and we recognize we're mindful of the fact

125
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,239
again it's not just verbatim repeated words but we enter into with that

126
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:35,359
attitude that spirit of reverence and we begin to just worship God for who he

127
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:41,280
is how he's revealed to us his person his character his nature through his

128
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,479
word that we are mindful of his holiness and it leads me to a spirit of

129
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:52,919
thanksgiving because I am begin to rejoice at the remembrance and I'm

130
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:59,400
giving thanks at the remembrance of his holiness and so when Jesus says hallowed

131
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:05,559
be thy name sanctified or holy then I once again I'm being mindful of the

132
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:10,280
attributes of God and I begin to rejoice that our God is holy aren't you

133
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:15,679
thankful that our God is holy he's revealed that to us he's just he's

134
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:21,200
righteous and he's love I mean we see all of his attributes but here in this

135
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:28,719
response of Jesus he says hallowed be thy name we enter into that time of

136
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:36,400
prayer with a spirit of reverence the spirit of reverence I hope this evening

137
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:42,679
that when you pray that at times in your life that you just get caught up in

138
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:49,799
worshiping God standing in awe of who he is I mean truly you understand that

139
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:58,119
prayer is not really a list of our demands sometimes I think we kind of get

140
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:03,880
it backwards where we just think that prayer consists solely or entirely of

141
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,599
just my wants what are my needs I'm just bringing my list of needs to God but you

142
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:13,000
know that when you begin with a spirit of thanksgiving when you begin with a

143
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,840
spirit of praise and standing in awe of who God is all of a sudden that's going

144
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,719
to influence and impact really that list of needs that you had because you just

145
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:29,559
begin to get into the presence of God the psalmist said that in thy presence

146
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:36,559
is fullness of joy fullness of joy and as you begin to pray as you have your

147
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:44,000
time of prayer I wonder how often do we just worship God just be mindful of who

148
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,559
he is and his attributes and leads to a spirit of thanksgiving back in Luke 11

149
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:55,640
not only do we see an attitude of reverence hallowed be thy name but I

150
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,919
believe that we see an attitude of submission number two an attitude of

151
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:04,960
submission the Bible says that the end of verse number two of Luke 11 thy

152
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:15,000
kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in earth an attitude of

153
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,239
submission I believe that this attitude of submission is a direct result of our

154
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:26,840
understanding of who God is when we enter into that time of prayer with an

155
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,760
attitude of reverence it's going to have a profound impact on our attitude of

156
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,880
submission because we're understanding who he is we're saying that he's holy

157
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:41,239
that he is the Lord God omnipotent the reality is that sometimes maybe I should

158
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:47,039
say many times for many people when we enter into or even just generally in

159
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:57,039
life we want what we want no one had to teach you to be selfish those kind ladies

160
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:04,640
in our church that serve in the nursery ministry you would understand no one

161
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,760
ever had to teach those kids to be selfish it's amazing how you can get

162
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:14,479
just a couple of kids in a room and you can have 40 toys but whichever toy Johnny

163
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:19,039
is playing with that's the same toy that little Alex wants or whatever the

164
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:26,799
names are right man they can be selfish sometimes as adults we know how to kind

165
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:34,520
of make our selfishness look a little bit more shiny a little bit more you

166
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:41,000
know acceptable if you will but the reality is that it's not really about

167
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,719
what I want it's about God's will being accomplished and sometimes if we're not

168
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:53,919
careful we're playing we're praying according to my will not the will of God

169
00:14:53,919 --> 00:15:02,440
I think about Paul he prayed thrice that that thorn in the flesh would depart

170
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:09,200
from him what did Jesus say my grace is sufficient for thee my grace is

171
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,280
sufficient for thee you know the reality is that I and I've said this

172
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,400
many times over the years God can deliver us from anything he's God he's

173
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:25,479
the Lord God omnipotent there's nothing too hard for him but sometimes he wants

174
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:31,520
to develop us through that something instead of delivering us from that

175
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,119
something and I understand that's not always easy I understand it's not always

176
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:41,880
enjoyable for us to go through the storm as opposed to just simply avoiding

177
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,000
the storm altogether and if we'd have our way we'd probably like to just

178
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,400
avoid the storm altogether but we find here the Bible says thy kingdom come thy

179
00:15:52,400 --> 00:16:00,119
will be done as in heaven so on earth I mentioned on Sunday the fact that God

180
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:05,840
has given us in his word some truth with regard to the timeline of the end day in

181
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:11,599
times the last days and God has revealed to us in his word some things

182
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:15,400
that are going to come to pass and I made this statement that there are many

183
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,200
today that are saying as they're looking at the things that are taking place in

184
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,080
our world that the things are falling apart and I understand people that look

185
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,239
at it from that perspective but you can look at it from a perspective to see

186
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:33,640
that fault things are falling in place things are falling in place and we

187
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,760
understand that Jesus is going to return and the Bible says that in the

188
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,119
last days perilous time shall come the Bible says that evil men and seducers

189
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:45,799
shall wax worse and worse they're not gonna get better and better you know

190
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:52,400
worse and worse so how do we pray the will of God to be accomplished thy will

191
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:59,440
be done as in heaven so in earth and we find that that God has a plan and God's

192
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:04,599
plan will come to pass we understand that but the reality is that as we're

193
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:09,439
praying for the will of God to be accomplished and we're desiring to know

194
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,880
the will of God for our lives and we're praying in that spirit of submission

195
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,400
it's going to really affect how we look at the circumstances in which we're

196
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:27,599
dealing with our God is he is able he is able to do exceeding abundantly above

197
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,599
all that we ask or think I was listening to a song recently about praising the

198
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:40,599
Lord and many songs carry with it this idea but this particular song put it in

199
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:46,400
a very interesting format of speaking about whether I'm on the mountain or in

200
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,959
the valley I'm going to lift my praise to God so that people would know who he

201
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:58,479
is it's sometimes it's easy for us on the mountain to praise God and not so

202
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:02,640
much in the valley but what if in that valley is what the will of God is at

203
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,040
this moment for us in our lives I mean Paul says in Philippians 1 that the

204
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,520
things that happened to me happened for the furtherance of the gospel I spoke

205
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,119
with a man not long ago right here in our auditorium and as I spoke with that

206
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:22,920
individual he shared with me a tragic event that he experienced in his life in

207
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:29,959
an event that I don't think any of us would ever want to endure and he looked

208
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:36,800
at me as serious as could be after going through that event of great tragedy very

209
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:42,160
much physical pain extended period of time in the hospital a number of

210
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,800
surgeries he said I'd do it all over again do you know why because while I

211
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,760
was in that place I got to share the gospel with people that otherwise I

212
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,439
never would have been able to share the gospel with there were nurses that got

213
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:59,040
saved there was a doctor that got saved he said it was the worst pain I ever

214
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:05,280
experienced in my life but I'd do it again to be able to share the gospel

215
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,640
with those people man that's the spirit of Paul in Philippians 1 that's

216
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:19,760
understanding the will of God see God is so much greater than than we are I like

217
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,160
to plan many of you know that I mean I'm a planner I got things tried to

218
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,280
figure out I got missionaries that call me all the time saying I'm gonna be in

219
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,439
your area next week I'm scheduled out to the next year I got evangelists lined up

220
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:39,040
for three years worth of revival meetings I like to plan but sometimes my

221
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:47,959
plans don't always line up with God's plans but God's way is always best God's

222
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:54,160
way is always best always I think about turn over the book of 1st John and we're

223
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,439
gonna be done so we can have some prayer time this evening I told you before when

224
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:04,000
we started this series it's easier to talk about prayer it's easier to teach a

225
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,040
lesson on prayer and to preach on prayer than it is to pray it really is we can

226
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,760
talk a whole lot about prayer in fact I can talk to you about exercise a whole

227
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:20,560
lot too but I don't like to do it amen I can give you a good regimen of what

228
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:27,719
you should do how you should do I don't want to do it prayer is work laboring

229
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:36,959
in prayer 1st John chapter 5 I love the Word of God every word is pure and you

230
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:41,040
think about the specifics of the words they're so important notice what John

231
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:47,920
says in 1st John 5 in verse 14 and this is the confidence I mean don't you like

232
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,359
having confidence the man that I got to share the gospel with today I looked at

233
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:55,920
him I said are you a hundred percent sure that if you die today you go to

234
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,400
heaven well if you put it that way that's kind of how I responded right

235
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,280
because I listen I'm not asking you if you're 97% sure are you a hundred

236
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:13,239
percent sure and here John says this is the confidence that we have in him that

237
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:21,359
if we ask anything look at those next words according to his will he heareth

238
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:28,439
us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have

239
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:35,800
the petitions that we desired of him this evening as we think about this

240
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,000
truth of an attitude of reverence followed by an attitude of submission

241
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,280
and we see here what John says with regard to having this confidence and

242
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,280
asking according to his will that he heareth us and what a blessing to know

243
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,640
that that God hears and answers prayer and to have the understanding this

244
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:00,319
evening that that as we enter into his presence with the spirit of reverence

245
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:06,479
this attitude of reverence this attitude of submission thy will that he hears us

246
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:11,800
listen I believe this evening that there are some prayers that you can absolutely

247
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:17,520
have answered because you're praying according the will of God teach me thy

248
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,599
word O Lord open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of thy

249
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:27,959
law Lord I'm gonna open your word and I'm gonna read it today and I'm asking

250
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:32,920
that your spirit would teach me the Word of God help me to understand it illumine

251
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,599
the scriptures to me I believe that God delights in answering that prayer why

252
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:42,339
because it's according to his will Lord give me an opportunity to share the

253
00:22:42,339 --> 00:22:47,280
gospel with someone help me to have the boldness that only comes through the

254
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,079
empowerment of the Holy Spirit of God so that I could share the gospel with an

255
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:56,439
individual God's gonna he's gonna answer that prayer according to his will

256
00:22:56,439 --> 00:23:02,119
preach the gospel to every creature we could go on and on this evening and look

257
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:06,040
at a number of examples but we find tonight that it's so important that when

258
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:12,760
we look at the framework and model by which Jesus responded to the request of

259
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:19,400
the disciple our Father which art in heaven he says hallowed be thy name

260
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:25,839
sanctified holy all that we'd enter with a spirit of reverence a spirit of

261
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:31,640
reverence understanding the holiness of God and at the remembrance of his

262
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:39,640
holiness giving thanks followed by a spirit or an attitude of submission

263
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,119
Jesus as he prayed in the garden not my will but thine be done

264
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:51,800
good example we find that this evening we ought to be more concerned about the

265
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:57,439
will of God than our own desires then are even our own conveniences or

266
00:23:57,439 --> 00:24:04,199
comforts and I like to be comfortable and I'm pretty sure if you'd be honest

267
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:08,280
you like to be comfortable too but sometimes God's gonna bring us out of

268
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:15,560
our comfort zone to accomplish his will an attitude of reverence an attitude of

269
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:21,439
submission as we seek the face of God let's pray father we love you we thank

270
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:27,520
you for loving us we thank you so much for your word and for the framework that

271
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,520
you give us here in this passage with regard to prayer we know that it was not

272
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:44,119
intended to be something that is just mindlessly repeated its framework we

273
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:49,479
thank you that we have access because relationship because of the sacrifice of

274
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:54,839
our Savior the cross of Calvary is death burial glorious resurrection we're

275
00:24:54,839 --> 00:25:06,920
thankful tonight you're holy we pray that as we approach you we'd have this

276
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:13,040
attitude of reverence and submission I pray the bless our time of prayer we do

277
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,199
thank you for the privilege pray that you'd work in our midst and we'll thank

278
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:18,359
