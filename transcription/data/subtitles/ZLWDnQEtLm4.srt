1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,559
Looking at a single verse of scripture

2
00:00:01,559 --> 00:00:05,119
as we kind of use as a springboard here this evening

3
00:00:05,119 --> 00:00:06,480
into this thought I mentioned

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,680
at the closing of the service this morning,

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,600
the title for the message, someone is watching you.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,779
Someone is watching you.

7
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:15,520
Have you ever been in a situation

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,159
where you could feel that someone was watching you?

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,639
Have you ever, can you relate to that?

10
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:23,680
You perhaps, maybe somebody asked you to do something,

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,799
there was a particular task that you were trying to do

12
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:28,360
and all eyes were on you, the reality,

13
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,120
the pressure that was mounting

14
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,599
because everyone was looking at you became overwhelming

15
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:36,200
and maybe you said something like this,

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,099
stop watching me, stop looking at me.

17
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:41,799
I can't do it if you're watching me.

18
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,880
And maybe you can relate to that

19
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,360
and we understand that that reminds us

20
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,680
that people are watching us.

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,759
How about this?

22
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:50,560
Maybe there's been a time in your life

23
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,319
where someone came to you and said they saw you

24
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:56,479
or they watched, observed you do something

25
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,479
and yet you had no idea that they saw you.

26
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:02,479
You had no idea they were even there.

27
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,440
You had no idea that they were even watching you

28
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,400
but sure enough as they rehearsed

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,440
and they recounted the events that they observed,

30
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,959
you can be assured of the fact

31
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:17,599
that they were observing you, they saw you.

32
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,260
This evening, both of those scenarios

33
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,559
teach us a valuable lesson and that lesson is this,

34
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:25,360
someone is watching you.

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,000
Years ago, I was driving through the neighborhood

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,480
just off of Germantown

37
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,680
and I was driving through that neighborhood

38
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,559
and as I was driving through that neighborhood,

39
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:37,839
I saw a sign that was in someone's yard.

40
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:39,559
In fact, as I continued to drive,

41
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:42,400
I saw a few of them in that same neighborhood

42
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,599
and the sign read this way.

43
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:49,599
It said drive like your kids live and play here

44
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:52,319
and I thought that was quite interesting

45
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,360
because obviously they had some people

46
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,559
cutting through the neighborhood there

47
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:58,480
trying to avoid lights and what have you

48
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,639
and they weren't driving real carefully

49
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:04,400
and so parents put up signs and they said drive

50
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,639
like your kids live and play here.

51
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:09,679
They were trying to communicate a message

52
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,199
to those drivers of the importance of being careful, why?

53
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:17,160
Because there are kids that live and play

54
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,479
in that neighborhood.

55
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,399
Immediately upon reading that sign,

56
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:24,100
I had this thought that we are to live

57
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:26,419
like someone is watching us.

58
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:27,419
Why?

59
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:28,979
Well, because they are.

60
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:30,020
Because they are.

61
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,380
Someone's watching you.

62
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,779
Someone's watching me and I am aware of that.

63
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,619
I know that many times we go through life,

64
00:02:37,619 --> 00:02:41,339
we can maybe think that we're isolated

65
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:43,960
and maybe we can have the idea that no one notices,

66
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,020
no one sees but I can assure you

67
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,380
that there are people that are watching you,

68
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,699
people that are observing your behavior.

69
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:53,100
In fact, I know that it's been said

70
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,539
that there are times that we could look to

71
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:57,699
and we can see that neighbors,

72
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:59,899
they observe that you go to church.

73
00:02:59,899 --> 00:03:01,279
They see you leave your house.

74
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:03,139
They see you leave on Sunday morning,

75
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:04,580
on Sunday night, on Wednesday night,

76
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,300
missions conference, you're leaving each night.

77
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,179
They observe it and by the way,

78
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:11,020
they notice when you don't leave to go to church.

79
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,860
Amen?

80
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,940
I mean, they know, they're watching.

81
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,539
They may not say something but they're watching.

82
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:18,580
They know, they're observing and they see that

83
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,899
and this evening as we look at this portion of scripture,

84
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:23,619
a single verse of scripture in Proverbs 23

85
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:26,380
and verse number 26, notice what the Bible says.

86
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:31,380
My son, give me thine heart

87
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:36,839
and let thine eyes observe my ways.

88
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:40,320
Now we understand that in this verse of scripture

89
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,740
that Solomon makes an appeal to his son.

90
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,380
In fact, he extends an invitation to his son

91
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,380
not only to give him his heart

92
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:51,619
but to let his eyes observe his ways.

93
00:03:51,619 --> 00:03:53,740
Now we understand some things about Solomon

94
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,660
and unfortunately, he was a man that just did some things.

95
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,220
Of course, as you study his life,

96
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,179
he forsook the path that he should have stayed on.

97
00:04:04,179 --> 00:04:06,139
He had many wives and concubines,

98
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:08,660
began to serve and what have you

99
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,500
with regard to the false gods and deities

100
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,979
and making places of worship and offering

101
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:16,720
and so on and so forth and we understand

102
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,799
he was a man who was fallible.

103
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,959
I said this this morning when we look at the truth

104
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,359
of the book of Proverbs, the book of Proverbs

105
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:28,720
is a book in which God allowed Solomon

106
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,079
to be the human penman and if we take it just at face value,

107
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:37,399
we see that Solomon is instructing Rehoboam, his son.

108
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:39,760
Now we understand that this book

109
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,839
is part of the canon of scripture

110
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,279
and we understand that all scripture

111
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,160
is given by inspiration of God

112
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,959
and as much as we look at this book

113
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,559
and we see that Solomon is speaking to Rehoboam,

114
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:52,480
that there is a spiritual application

115
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,399
from the book of Proverbs that God, our father,

116
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,079
is speaking to us as his children

117
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,799
and we find this evening that as we look

118
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,000
at this verse of scripture and we can see Solomon

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,720
speaking to his son Rehoboam and we can understand

120
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,739
that he makes this appeal, he gives this invitation

121
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:11,040
for his son to observe his ways.

122
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,279
The reality this evening is that Rehoboam

123
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,519
was gonna watch and observe his dad

124
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,760
whether he ever extended an invitation to him or not.

125
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,600
Why?

126
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,880
Because boys watch their dads, it's what they do.

127
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,920
Young people watch, why do the young people

128
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,720
start doing the same thing the teenagers are doing?

129
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,619
Because the young people are watching the teenagers.

130
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:35,799
Is it not true?

131
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:37,799
We see it, this is a cycle of life,

132
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:39,959
we've been aware of this for many years,

133
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,239
most of us this evening and we see this

134
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:44,200
and we understand this.

135
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,920
As we look at the text of scripture

136
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,200
and we think about the spiritual application,

137
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,880
I'm reminded this evening that our savior

138
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,320
came to the sin-cursed world and he lived

139
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,399
a perfect and sinless life and he left us an example

140
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,160
that we too can look at his life and we can be challenged

141
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,880
through the things that he did and the things that he taught.

142
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,959
This evening as we consider this thought,

143
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,480
someone is watching you, I want you to consider

144
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,160
a few passages of scripture from the New Testament

145
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,920
and then we're gonna go back to an illustration

146
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,799
from the Old Testament as we wrap up this evening.

147
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:20,119
Turn to the book of Acts if you will,

148
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:23,399
Acts chapter number one and really the thought tonight,

149
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:27,679
someone is watching you, therefore we ought to do and teach.

150
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,399
We ought to do and teach, why?

151
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:32,200
Because someone is watching you.

152
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,040
In the book of Acts in the first chapter,

153
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,600
we find that the introduction is given

154
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,359
but God gives us a bit of an insight

155
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,000
with regard to the life and ministry

156
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,200
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

157
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,519
Of course we know as you come to the book of Acts

158
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,160
that the Lord Jesus Christ had completed

159
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,359
his earthly ministry, over three years walking

160
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:55,640
during his earthly ministry, of course over 30 years

161
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,440
of his total life on earth but three years

162
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,200
of his public earthly ministry, three and a half years or so

163
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,640
and we find that after that he was crucified,

164
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,679
he was buried, he rose again.

165
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:10,119
We come to the book of Acts in the first chapter,

166
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:13,320
we read of the ascension of Jesus Christ

167
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,480
but before that I want you to notice in verse number one,

168
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,959
the Bible says the former treaties have I made,

169
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:23,239
O Theophilus, of all, notice this phrase,

170
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:28,239
that Jesus began both to do and teach

171
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,079
until the day in which he was taken up

172
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,559
after that he through the Holy Ghost

173
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:37,359
had given commandments unto the apostles

174
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,079
whom he had chosen, to whom also he showed himself alive

175
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,679
after his passion by many infallible proofs

176
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:49,600
being seen of them 40 days and speaking of the things

177
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,279
pertaining to the kingdom of God.

178
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,239
As we zero in on that phrase in verse number one,

179
00:07:56,239 --> 00:08:01,239
of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,

180
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:06,279
I would say this evening that Jesus is the master teacher

181
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,160
and no one's ever taught like Jesus.

182
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,920
In fact, we understand that as you read the scriptures,

183
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,040
as you read the gospel accounts,

184
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,760
that there are times in which the Jewish people

185
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,320
after hearing the Lord Jesus Christ teach,

186
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,440
they said no man spake like this man.

187
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,440
He speaks as one that has authority.

188
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:30,640
I like that truth, I like that declaration, why?

189
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,320
Because he does have authority,

190
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,000
he has all power and all authority,

191
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
he is God in flesh and truly no man spoke like him.

192
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,679
No man taught like him.

193
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,520
He was a wise master teacher, why?

194
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,239
Because he's God and we find that as you study

195
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:50,479
through the gospel records that he was teaching,

196
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:53,760
he was instructing, he was influencing

197
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,119
those that he was called to influence

198
00:08:56,119 --> 00:09:00,080
but it wasn't just that he was teaching, he was doing.

199
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,640
He was doing.

200
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,599
We've often heard and I've said over the years

201
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:09,719
that the message of your life speaks louder

202
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:11,520
than the message of your lips.

203
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,320
We can say a whole lot of things

204
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,080
but if we're not doing what we're saying,

205
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,400
the message falls flat.

206
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,000
It's as if it falls on deaf ears.

207
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,599
We find this evening that the Lord Jesus Christ

208
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,960
that he was not only the master teacher

209
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,440
but we find that he practiced that which he taught.

210
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,119
We find that the truth is given to us

211
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:38,760
in 1 Peter chapter number two, notice if you will,

212
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,080
a familiar verse of scripture this evening

213
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,039
as we look at this truth with regard to the life

214
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,880
and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ.

215
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,479
In 1 Peter chapter number two,

216
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:53,039
Peter of course had the opportunity to walk on this earth

217
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,200
during the earthly public ministry

218
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,000
of the Lord Jesus Christ with Jesus.

219
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,719
Now we understand that Peter, in fact,

220
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:02,999
of us can relate to Peter, and oftentimes,

221
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:06,919
we look at the various events in Peter's life

222
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,439
as he's walking with the Lord,

223
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:10,439
and we may say something like this,

224
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:13,279
that he was often the first one to speak up,

225
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,759
he was often the first one to put his foot in his mouth,

226
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,079
and so on and so forth, but Peter was a man

227
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:21,759
that was passionate, Peter was a man

228
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,159
that was following Christ, and we find that Peter,

229
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:28,759
as he walked with the Lord, he was in that inner circle,

230
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,719
if we could call it that this evening.

231
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:32,359
When you really think about the ministry

232
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:36,439
of the Lord Jesus Christ, we're of course aware of the 12,

233
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:41,439
Judas was a traitor, so 11, but with that group of people,

234
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:46,759
there was really an inner circle, Peter, James, and John,

235
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,679
they were the three that went up with Jesus

236
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,559
on the Mount of Transfiguration,

237
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:53,719
they were the ones that had the opportunity to see

238
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,879
even more than some of the other disciples

239
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,199
had the opportunity to see, and as God would use Peter,

240
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:03,359
now remember, Peter denied the Lord

241
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:06,839
before the crucifixion, Jesus told Peter that he would,

242
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,919
and Peter said, no way, not me, I'm not gonna deny you,

243
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,919
I'll die with you, for you, but Peter denied the Lord,

244
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:18,759
denied him thrice, three times, but you know,

245
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:22,399
the Bible says that when the cock crew and Jesus

246
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,399
looked at him, that he, Peter, wept bitterly.

247
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:30,679
It's very interesting when Jesus in the Gospel of Luke

248
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:33,759
tells Peter about the fact that he would deny him,

249
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,359
he says to him, he says, Peter, Satan hath desired

250
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:39,879
to have you that he may sift you as wheat,

251
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:42,919
but I've prayed for you, when thou art converted,

252
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:47,919
strengthen the brethren, and now God would use Peter,

253
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:51,519
of course, we understand that Peter, in John chapter 21,

254
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,879
he says, I go a fishing, and Jesus spoke to Peter,

255
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:57,439
and ministered to Peter, and he said, Peter, do you love me?

256
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:58,799
Peter, do you love me?

257
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,199
Peter, do you love me?

258
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:02,439
And we know that God used Peter, I mean,

259
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:05,119
Peter's the one that stands up on the day of Pentecost,

260
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:08,599
filled with the spirit of God, and preaches boldly

261
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:10,759
a great message, and souls were saved,

262
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:14,119
3,000 added to the church, and you trace the steps

263
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:16,879
of Peter through the book of Acts in the early church,

264
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,359
and God was using Peter, and now we find that Peter

265
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:24,199
is being used of the Lord to pen 1 and 2 Peter

266
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:26,199
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

267
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:28,279
and I want you to notice what Peter says

268
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:32,199
in 1 Peter 2 and verse 21, for even here unto

269
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:37,199
were ye called, because Christ also suffered for us,

270
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:43,859
leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps.

271
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:47,859
Should follow his steps.

272
00:12:47,859 --> 00:12:51,539
The example that Jesus left is a perfect example,

273
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:54,619
it is the perfect example, why?

274
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:56,539
Because he's God.

275
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:59,379
I wonder this evening, when we look at this text

276
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,259
of scripture, and we understand this truth

277
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:05,579
of do and teach, coupled with the idea

278
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:10,539
from Proverbs 23 and verse 26, someone is watching you.

279
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,659
Yes, in Proverbs 23, Solomon is speaking

280
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:16,579
to his son, Rehoboam, but the reality this evening

281
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:20,019
is that this message, this thought, though contextually

282
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:23,059
it's a father speaking to a son, this truth

283
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:25,379
is for every one of us this evening,

284
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:29,539
someone is watching you, and I wonder tonight

285
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:33,819
if the example that you're leaving is an example

286
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:36,059
that others should follow.

287
00:13:37,739 --> 00:13:40,059
That's a convicting thought.

288
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:44,739
That's a question, a statement that requires

289
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:49,739
some inspection, some stop and evaluate and examine.

290
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:54,179
Is the example that I'm leaving an example

291
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:57,859
that I want someone else to follow?

292
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:02,579
Peter says Jesus left us an example

293
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:06,039
that we should follow his steps.

294
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:08,859
We think about the apostle Paul and a great example,

295
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:12,179
obviously the greatest example is the Lord Jesus Christ.

296
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:16,019
We think about the apostle Paul, we find that many times

297
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,179
we would look at the life of the apostle Paul

298
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:22,879
as God has given us many just truths with regard

299
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:25,299
to his life and ministry, and much scripture

300
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:28,139
is given to us with regard to his life,

301
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,599
and we might say something like this,

302
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:32,739
that he's the greatest Christian that ever lived,

303
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:37,739
but Paul himself said that he was the chief of sinners.

304
00:14:37,739 --> 00:14:40,019
Paul was a man that was saved by the grace of God.

305
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:44,059
He never forgot what happened on the road to Damascus.

306
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:44,979
How do I know that?

307
00:14:44,979 --> 00:14:47,579
Because every time he had opportunity to begin to preach

308
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,819
and to give his testimony, you know what he always

309
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:50,659
went back to?

310
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:53,579
He went back to his conversion.

311
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:55,499
He never got over the fact that he was saved

312
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:57,139
by the grace of God.

313
00:14:57,139 --> 00:14:59,859
He says to the believers in 1 Corinthians 11

314
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:02,819
and verse number one, be followers of me,

315
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,859
but there's not a period there.

316
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:09,899
He says, even as I also am of Christ.

317
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:13,939
See, the apostle Paul was a man that wanted to follow

318
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:18,499
the Lord Jesus Christ, and so much as he followed the Lord,

319
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:21,179
he was also providing an example that others could look

320
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:23,159
at his life and follow him.

321
00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:27,419
There have been times in my life that I have observed

322
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:30,319
parents saying to children, hey, don't do that,

323
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:32,819
or maybe they'll say, I don't know where they learned

324
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:34,419
that from.

325
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:36,579
If you'd give me an opportunity, I'll help you understand

326
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:38,059
where they learned that from.

327
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:39,379
What do I mean by that?

328
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:41,659
Well, they observed it in your life.

329
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:42,979
They observed, they heard you.

330
00:15:42,979 --> 00:15:45,139
I don't know where they heard anything like that.

331
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:45,979
Really?

332
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:48,059
Because I've heard you talk like that, and so they picked

333
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:49,899
it up right there at home, amen?

334
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:53,019
And people don't like that, they get embarrassed by it,

335
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:58,019
but the reality is that we are giving an example to others.

336
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:00,379
Notice what Paul says in the book of Philippians

337
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:01,979
in chapter number four.

338
00:16:01,979 --> 00:16:04,939
Philippians chapter number four, of course,

339
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:09,099
Paul writing here to this church that was started

340
00:16:09,099 --> 00:16:13,059
in Philippi, a church that God gave him personally

341
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:16,779
the opportunity to see established, and he's writing

342
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:19,979
to these believers about the importance of rejoicing

343
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,459
and continuing and being a light in a dark world

344
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:26,059
and so on and so forth, and we find that as we come

345
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:29,419
to the fourth chapter, in verse number nine,

346
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:31,299
I want you to notice what the Bible says.

347
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:36,259
Those things which ye have both learned and received

348
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:41,259
and heard and seen in me do.

349
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:46,099
The God of peace shall be with you.

350
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,379
I have that entire verse underlined in my Bible.

351
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:53,659
If you were only to underline a portion of that verse,

352
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:57,339
I personally like the seen in me part of it

353
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:02,099
because the Apostle Paul was not just a follower of Christ

354
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:05,979
that taught a message, but he lived the message

355
00:17:05,979 --> 00:17:07,299
that he taught.

356
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:09,539
We find that the Apostle Paul, many times,

357
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:12,779
he would tell people about the importance of prayer,

358
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:14,299
and he would tell people about the importance

359
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,819
of praying for him, but then you read about how

360
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,939
the Apostle Paul was praying for others,

361
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:21,499
and it's recorded in the pages of scripture

362
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:24,559
how he prayed for the believers, for he prayed

363
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,459
for the individuals, for the churches.

364
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,619
We find that Paul would tell the churches,

365
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:31,459
he would tell individuals the importance of rejoicing

366
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:33,379
and praising God and thanking God,

367
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:36,899
but yet, as you read the epistles that are penned

368
00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:39,619
by the Apostle Paul, you find that he's a man

369
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:43,019
that's praising God, that's giving thanks unto the Lord,

370
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:46,979
and so we find that Paul, he was a man that gave truth.

371
00:17:46,979 --> 00:17:51,299
He taught, he instructed, he diligently fulfilled

372
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:53,659
the task that God gave him to do,

373
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:58,659
but he did not simply teach, he was a man that did

374
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:02,259
as well as teaching the truth.

375
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:04,939
He says, not only the things that you have learned

376
00:18:04,939 --> 00:18:09,939
and received and heard, but he says, seen in me.

377
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:14,679
Do, and the God of peace shall be with you.

378
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:18,339
Again, I wonder this evening, if we were to examine

379
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:20,579
our lives, if we were to consider as we see

380
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:22,779
in the lives of others, if we find somebody

381
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:25,139
that's walking behind us and they're doing

382
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:27,179
the same things that we're doing,

383
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:30,339
if they're emulating what they're seeing in us,

384
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:33,779
is that a good thing or is it a bad thing?

385
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:38,500
Is it an example that we would be thankful and happy

386
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,579
that they would be following our steps?

387
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:46,619
We find that as you look through the pages of Scripture,

388
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:49,859
there is much truth that is given with regard

389
00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:52,939
to the importance of not only teaching truth,

390
00:18:52,939 --> 00:18:56,379
but that we would do that which we are teaching,

391
00:18:56,379 --> 00:19:00,539
that the message of our life would align

392
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,859
with the message of our lips.

393
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:06,619
I know that you've heard and I've heard as well

394
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:09,259
about parents that will say, hey, don't do this

395
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:12,599
as they're engaging in that very activity.

396
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:14,659
It's bad for you, don't do this, you don't wanna

397
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:17,019
go down this path, but yet they're doing,

398
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:20,139
they're consuming, they're participating,

399
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:23,019
and the reality this evening is that that message

400
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:26,099
of don't do this is a shallow message

401
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:29,359
because the example that is being seen

402
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:31,979
carries so much more weight.

403
00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:33,939
I want you to look over the Old Testament,

404
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,859
look of 2 Chronicles, if you will,

405
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:37,619
and I want you to look at this example,

406
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:39,859
and I'm gonna tell you it's a negative example,

407
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:42,519
but I believe that we learn from this example

408
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,899
in 2 Chronicles chapter 33.

409
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:46,899
I wish I had the time to read the entirety

410
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:49,659
of the chapter, I do not, but I'm gonna just

411
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:52,459
kind of pick my way through the chapter here.

412
00:19:53,739 --> 00:19:56,339
And I want you to see a great lesson

413
00:19:56,339 --> 00:19:59,899
from this portion of Scripture that's a negative example.

414
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:03,739
but I hope will help us to see the importance

415
00:20:03,739 --> 00:20:06,139
of the fact that others are watching us.

416
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:11,059
Someone is watching you and the impact of your influence.

417
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:14,179
Beginning in verse number one of 2 Chronicles 33,

418
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,979
the Bible says Manasseh was 12 years old

419
00:20:16,979 --> 00:20:18,139
when he began to reign,

420
00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:22,299
and he reigned 50 and five years in Jerusalem.

421
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:25,299
Now, I want you to understand that here,

422
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:29,059
Manasseh is the king after Hezekiah.

423
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:31,779
Now, Hezekiah was a good king.

424
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:34,339
Hezekiah was the one that we understand

425
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:35,779
that as the Assyrians come,

426
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:38,539
he comes to the Lord and he lays it all out

427
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:41,419
and he trusts the Lord and God blesses

428
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:46,379
and God works and delivers them from the Assyrians,

429
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,939
the people of Judah,

430
00:20:47,939 --> 00:20:52,019
but we understand that Hezekiah was told from Isaiah

431
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:53,379
that he would die.

432
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:57,979
Hezekiah prayed and he requested that he would not die

433
00:20:57,979 --> 00:21:01,579
and he was granted 15 more years.

434
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:02,899
In those 15 years,

435
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:05,979
we understand if you were to read that the Babylonians,

436
00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:08,499
there's an entourage of people that come from Babylon

437
00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:12,339
and Hezekiah shows all of the things within his realm.

438
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:14,219
We find that Isaiah comes and says,

439
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:16,379
he inquires about what has taken place

440
00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:20,019
and we find that the truth is given to Hezekiah

441
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:22,299
that the Babylonians would take captive.

442
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:24,579
It would not happen in his day,

443
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:26,339
but in his descendants day.

444
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:29,419
And unfortunately Hezekiah made a statement such as this,

445
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:31,939
well, good that there's peace in my day.

446
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:35,379
And now the Bible tells us in chapter 33

447
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:37,419
that Manasseh begins to reign.

448
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:39,739
Did you notice how old Manasseh was?

449
00:21:39,739 --> 00:21:41,259
He was 12.

450
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:43,819
Do you remember as I just told you just quickly,

451
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:47,019
how many additional years Hezekiah had?

452
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:48,379
15.

453
00:21:48,379 --> 00:21:50,299
Manasseh was born during those 15 years,

454
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:52,819
he's only 12 when he begins to reign.

455
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:54,579
And the Bible says in verse number two,

456
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,059
but did that which was, notice what it says,

457
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:00,939
evil in the sight of the Lord,

458
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:03,179
like unto the abominations of the heathen

459
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:06,019
whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel,

460
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:07,899
for he built again the high places

461
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:09,779
which Hezekiah and his father had broken down

462
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:11,899
and he reared up altars for Balaam

463
00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:14,619
and made groves and worshiped all the host of heaven

464
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:16,379
and served them and he built altars

465
00:22:16,379 --> 00:22:17,459
in the house of the Lord,

466
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:19,539
whereof the Lord had said in Jerusalem,

467
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:21,579
shall my name be forever.

468
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:24,139
And he built altars for all the host of heaven

469
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:25,979
in the two courts of the house of the Lord.

470
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:28,299
Do you understand what God's telling us here?

471
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:31,779
In the temple, in the very place where God

472
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:34,499
allowed Solomon to build the temple,

473
00:22:34,499 --> 00:22:37,459
the place where you think about the holy of holies,

474
00:22:37,459 --> 00:22:39,139
we understand the tabernacle,

475
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:41,579
but then after the reign of David,

476
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:43,299
when David says, I wanna build a house

477
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:44,979
and the prophet Nathan says,

478
00:22:44,979 --> 00:22:47,059
go and do all that's in thine heart,

479
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:49,179
but God says that night, no, no, no,

480
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:50,859
David's not gonna build a temple,

481
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:53,339
but Solomon, his son will build a temple.

482
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:55,539
It's this temple that we're speaking about,

483
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:59,139
the temple that contains all the brazen altar,

484
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:03,379
the labor, you think about in the holy of holies

485
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:05,779
with the mercy seat on the Ark of the Covenant,

486
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:07,899
all that takes place and you think about this

487
00:23:07,899 --> 00:23:10,299
and here, the Bible tells us that Manasseh

488
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:12,459
in that place, the holy place,

489
00:23:13,499 --> 00:23:17,859
he reared up altars to all of the host of heaven.

490
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:18,899
Do you understand what that means?

491
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:22,419
All of the false gods, all of the idols,

492
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:25,019
all of this idolatry that would take place,

493
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:30,019
this is what Manasseh does, wicked, ungodly.

494
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:32,059
Skip down if you will,

495
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:33,179
we don't have time to read all of it,

496
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,819
maybe you get to read it this week on your own,

497
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:39,459
but I want you to skip down in verse number nine,

498
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,579
the Bible says, so Manasseh made Judah

499
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:43,939
and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err

500
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:45,859
and to do worse than the heathen

501
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:48,579
whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel.

502
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:50,139
I mean, it was a bad time.

503
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:52,339
The Lord spake to Manasseh and to his people,

504
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:54,619
but they would not hearken.

505
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:57,099
God is so gracious.

506
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:03,339
I said this morning, you can hear,

507
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:06,779
but it doesn't mean you receive.

508
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,619
Hearing and receiving are two different things.

509
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:11,859
And here we find the Bible says

510
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:16,859
that the Lord spake to Manasseh and to his people,

511
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:18,939
but they would not hearken.

512
00:24:18,939 --> 00:24:21,259
Wherefore, the Lord brought upon them

513
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,659
the captains of the host of the king of Assyria,

514
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:25,339
which took Manasseh among the thorns

515
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:28,899
and bound him with fetters and carried him to Babylon.

516
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:31,659
And when he was in affliction, notice this in verse 12,

517
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:34,419
he besought the Lord his God

518
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:39,179
and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.

519
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,619
Now I'm thankful for verse number 12,

520
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:43,699
but I would submit to you this evening

521
00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:46,179
that it's far better that we humble ourselves

522
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:50,699
and seek the Lord before the time of affliction,

523
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:52,699
before the time of judgment,

524
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:57,499
that we take heed to the voice of God, to the word of God,

525
00:24:57,499 --> 00:24:59,419
that we hearken to his voice

526
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:01,459
as they should have in verse number 10.

527
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:04,539
And we do not have to deal with what is recorded to us

528
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:05,779
in verse number 11.

529
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:07,679
But in that time of affliction,

530
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,219
the Bible tells us that he, Manasseh,

531
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:11,739
he besought the Lord his God,

532
00:25:11,739 --> 00:25:15,019
he humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.

533
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:17,739
And he prayed unto him and he was entreated of him

534
00:25:17,739 --> 00:25:19,179
and heard his supplication.

535
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:21,419
Oh, isn't God so gracious?

536
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:22,819
God is so merciful.

537
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:25,459
His mercy endureth forever.

538
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:27,099
He is long-suffering.

539
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:28,939
What a joy to understand that.

540
00:25:28,939 --> 00:25:32,859
But I tell you this evening, do not tempt the Lord.

541
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:34,859
Don't go as far as you can and be like,

542
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:36,219
well, God will forgive me.

543
00:25:36,219 --> 00:25:37,859
God will be merciful to me.

544
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:39,739
God is long-suffering.

545
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:41,699
No, it's far better to continue

546
00:25:41,699 --> 00:25:44,539
to walk in obedience to God.

547
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:49,339
It says in verse 13 that God was entreated of him

548
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,379
and heard his supplication

549
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:52,799
and brought him again to Jerusalem and to his kingdom.

550
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,459
Then notice this statement at the end of verse number 13.

551
00:25:55,459 --> 00:26:00,459
Then Manasseh knew that the Lord, he was God.

552
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:06,339
Now, after this, he built a wall without the city of David

553
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:09,419
on the west side of Gihon and the valley,

554
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:11,259
even to the entering in at the fish gate

555
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:14,579
and compassed about Ophel and raised it up

556
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:16,939
a very great height and put captains of war

557
00:26:16,939 --> 00:26:18,459
in all the fenced cities of Judah.

558
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:20,379
He took away, notice in verse 15,

559
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:23,139
he took away the strange gods and the idol

560
00:26:23,139 --> 00:26:25,739
out of the house of the Lord and all the altars

561
00:26:25,739 --> 00:26:27,659
that he had built in the mound to the house of the Lord

562
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:30,579
and in Jerusalem and cast them out of the city.

563
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:32,299
Praise God.

564
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,199
That's a good thing, is it not?

565
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:37,539
I mean, Manasseh is getting right with God.

566
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:39,459
Manasseh did evil in the sight of the Lord.

567
00:26:39,459 --> 00:26:42,139
As we begin the chapter, we see all of this behavior,

568
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:45,599
but now we find after he recognizes that the Lord,

569
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,459
he is God after God's grace and his mercy

570
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:52,139
that he cast all of these things out of the city.

571
00:26:52,139 --> 00:26:54,339
He cleanses really the temple

572
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:55,659
and he gets rid of all this stuff.

573
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:59,219
In verse 16, he repaired the altar of the Lord

574
00:26:59,219 --> 00:27:01,539
and he sacrificed there on peace offerings

575
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:04,179
and thank offerings and commanded Judah

576
00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:07,459
to serve the Lord God of Israel.

577
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:13,419
Now, in verse 16, we find that Manasseh

578
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:15,419
was doing a good thing.

579
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:18,099
Manasseh was making sacrifices

580
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:21,339
according to what God had commanded in the law.

581
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,899
Manasseh makes a decree.

582
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:27,099
The decree is this, that all the people of Judah

583
00:27:27,099 --> 00:27:29,179
were to serve the Lord God of Israel.

584
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:30,219
Can I tell you this evening,

585
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:32,499
you cannot legislate righteousness.

586
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:34,579
You can't do it.

587
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:37,179
You can't legislate righteousness.

588
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:40,579
You can't force people to serve God.

589
00:27:40,579 --> 00:27:41,619
You can't do it.

590
00:27:42,739 --> 00:27:43,579
It's a matter of the will.

591
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,659
It's a matter of the heart.

592
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:48,059
And here the Bible says, nevertheless, in verse 17,

593
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:50,579
the people did sacrifice still in the high places

594
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:52,519
yet unto the Lord their God only.

595
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,099
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh

596
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:55,059
and his prayer unto his God,

597
00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:56,459
so Manasseh's life is gonna end.

598
00:27:56,459 --> 00:27:59,499
In verse 20, it says, so Manasseh slept with his fathers.

599
00:27:59,499 --> 00:28:00,899
They buried him in his own house

600
00:28:00,899 --> 00:28:03,299
and Amon, his son, reigned in his stead.

601
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:05,179
Now, I want you to notice about this man, Amon,

602
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:06,839
his son that's gonna reign.

603
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:09,839
It tells us in verse 21 that he was two and 20 years old

604
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:12,999
when he began to reign and reigned two years in Jerusalem.

605
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:15,119
But I want you to notice what the Bible says about his son.

606
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:20,119
In verse 22, it says, but he did that which was evil

607
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,079
in the sight of the Lord.

608
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:27,979
And then notice what it says, as did Manasseh his father.

609
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:30,839
Do you see it there?

610
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:33,679
For Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images

611
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,399
which Manasseh his father had made and served them

612
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,319
and humbled not himself before the Lord

613
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:41,559
as Manasseh his father had humbled himself,

614
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:46,399
but Amon trespassed more and more.

615
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:50,359
I've written in the margin of my Bible,

616
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:52,499
Manasseh returned to the Lord,

617
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:55,899
the son, Amon, transgressed greatly.

618
00:28:55,899 --> 00:29:00,899
How sad to consider the behavior of those we may influence.

619
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:02,559
You know, you understand this evening

620
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,979
that you might come back to God as Manasseh did.

621
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,199
But what about the people that you're influencing

622
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:14,879
that might not come back to God?

623
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:16,159
It's a negative example.

624
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,839
I told you that before we got to it this evening,

625
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:21,559
but it's an example that helps us really nail down

626
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:25,279
the point this evening that someone is watching you.

627
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,839
Could I submit to you this evening

628
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:31,839
that Amon was watching Manasseh when he did evil

629
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:35,559
and most likely he was watching Manasseh when he did right?

630
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:39,639
And I believe this evening with all of my heart,

631
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:41,759
I cannot prove it scripturally,

632
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:44,679
but I believe in my heart, if you disagree,

633
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:45,759
that's perfectly fine.

634
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:47,319
I've acknowledged to you that I can't prove it

635
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:50,059
from the Bible, but I believe that Manasseh

636
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:53,239
would have desired for his son

637
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:56,759
to follow the example of his latter days

638
00:29:56,759 --> 00:29:59,279
and not his former days.

639
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,479
Would you agree with me?

640
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:05,759
me this evening? I don't think for one second of time that Manasseh would

641
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:11,359
desire that his son Amon would follow the example of his early days. In his

642
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:16,479
days of idolatry, in his days of wickedness, I don't think for one moment

643
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:22,319
of time Manasseh would want for his son Amon to follow that example. I think that

644
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:27,399
if Manasseh had his choice, that if Manasseh could have it his way, he would

645
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:33,319
desire that Amon, his son, would serve the Lord, would follow God, would serve as

646
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:38,959
he made the command in verse 16. He makes the command that all Judah should serve

647
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:42,879
the Lord God of Israel. No doubt if that was his heart and his concern for the

648
00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:48,639
people, the inhabitants of Judah, it was most certainly his heart for his own son

649
00:30:48,639 --> 00:31:00,039
in his own house. But Manasseh had no control over what his son would do. There

650
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:05,279
was an example that was given. Unfortunately, when we look at the

651
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:11,879
example of Solomon, though he was the one used to pen the words in Proverbs 23

652
00:31:11,879 --> 00:31:21,319
and verse 26, let thine eyes observe my ways. He did not leave the best example. He did

653
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:31,079
not lead a life that was most honorable. But he did influence his son. And this evening,

654
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:36,399
whether you give someone permission to observe your ways or not, there are people watching

655
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:45,479
you. You don't have to grant someone permission to observe your ways. They're simply a group

656
00:31:45,479 --> 00:31:53,239
of people that are watching you this evening. And I wonder how often, as we live our lives,

657
00:31:53,239 --> 00:32:03,879
do we live with this awareness that someone is watching me? What kind of an example am

658
00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:16,759
I giving to them? Would I be pleased if they did what I do? If they live how I live? Paul

659
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:24,199
said, not only the things that you learned, but the things that you've seen in me do.

660
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:29,359
The greatest example, of course, is the Lord Jesus Christ. As Peter said it in 1 Peter

661
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:35,639
2 21, he left us an example that we should follow his steps. But I wonder tonight, are

662
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:44,439
we able to say as Paul did to the church at Corinth, be followers of me, even as I also

663
00:32:44,439 --> 00:32:50,759
am of Christ. Because if we're following Christ, we're not going to be perfect. But we can

664
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:58,079
leave an example that is worth following. Someone is watching you. Let's pray. Father,

665
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:03,359
we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for the privilege to gather this

666
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,199
evening. We thank you for the singing and just the opportunity to praise you and to

667
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:16,199
be challenged from your word. And God, I pray that the truth of this message tonight, Lord,

668
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:27,719
would help us in our daily lives to consider the fact that someone, in fact, many someones

669
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:35,199
are watching us. God, I pray that we would live in such a way that we would not be ashamed

670
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:42,799
or embarrassed if those individuals followed our example. I pray that you would move and

671
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,879
work in hearts and lives as only you can. We'll give you the glory for it. For it's

672
00:33:46,879 --> 00:33:48,119
in Christ's name we pray.
