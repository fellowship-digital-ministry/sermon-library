1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
13 this morning, John chapter number 13.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,980
And as you're turning there,

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,920
and we're certainly thankful for this portion of scripture,

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,180
I'll dive into it here in just a few moments.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,359
But as you know, I've already mentioned this morning,

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:13,760
you have the insert in your bulletin,

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,440
but our revival meeting, our annual revival meeting,

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,040
fall revival, as we often refer to it as,

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,680
is scheduled to begin next Sunday.

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,899
And I understand this morning,

11
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,719
and I hope that you do as well,

12
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:29,000
that an individual believer or a church

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,279
will not experience revival simply because

14
00:00:33,279 --> 00:00:34,959
it has been planned.

15
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:39,560
And I planned this meeting a long, long time ago

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,599
with Brother Marshawn and got it on the calendar

17
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:44,119
and all of those things.

18
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,799
But the reality is that revival doesn't come

19
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:48,000
because you've planned it,

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,319
it doesn't become because it's on a calendar.

21
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:52,319
It's not going to be some magical thing

22
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:53,959
that's going to happen that you show up

23
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:56,360
and bam, there's revival.

24
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,840
We find that yes, we'll have a guest speaker,

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,520
we'll have more services,

26
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,759
we'll have service all day on Sunday,

27
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:05,199
we'll have Monday evening and Tuesday evening

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,000
and Wednesday evening.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But we find that those things in of themselves

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
do not, cannot bring revival.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,739
And I've often said, as we have had revival meetings

32
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:20,080
over the years, that it is important

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,080
that we would be revival ready and not revival resistant.

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,360
And we find that we can read throughout the history,

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,440
not only of Israel, and I'll mention some things

36
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,720
during the message this morning,

37
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,559
but even throughout the history that you and I

38
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:38,040
can study of revivals that have taken place,

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,400
not only here in this nation,

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,800
the Great Awakening, the Second Great Awakening,

41
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,940
you can read of the Welsh revival that took place

42
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,720
right at the turn of the 20th century

43
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,160
and you can read of other revivals that have taken place

44
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,120
and you can see the work of God, the hand of God at work.

45
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,279
And revival really is an individual thing.

46
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:01,279
The fact of the matter is that we can have revival meeting

47
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:04,199
and some individuals that are in attendance

48
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:05,860
for that meeting, they can have,

49
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,000
they can experience revival and we can see

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and have that work of God in our lives.

51
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:19,679
And it is my earnest desire that each of us,

52
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:22,160
every single one of us would be revival ready.

53
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,039
I hope that throughout this week,

54
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:27,039
we would prepare our hearts, that we'd prepare our schedules

55
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,839
that we would make it a point to pray daily

56
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:33,580
and seek the face of God, that we would be revival ready,

57
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,020
that our hearts, the Bible likens our hearts to soil

58
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,880
and various types of soil and we can understand

59
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,399
as you read through the word of God,

60
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:45,279
you can read of those that had hard hearts

61
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:48,559
and you can read of those that had tender hearts

62
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:52,160
and the Bible says of Josiah that his heart was tender

63
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,759
and therefore when the book of the law was found

64
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,039
in the house of the Lord and it was read,

65
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,000
Josiah responded in a certain way, why?

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,279
Because his heart was tender.

67
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:04,839
And I pray that God would help us

68
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:06,600
to have hearts that are tender,

69
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,179
that we would receive truth,

70
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:11,399
that we would quickly respond in obedience

71
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,979
to what the Lord is speaking to us about.

72
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:17,639
We could ask the question, what is revival?

73
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:20,839
We could ask the question, do we even need revival?

74
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:23,479
And I would say this, that revival is renewed

75
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:28,479
in more active attention to our personal walk with the Lord.

76
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,979
A renewed and a more active attention

77
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:36,520
to our personal walk with the Lord.

78
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,759
A desire as the songwriter said,

79
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:43,320
to truly have nothing between my soul and my savior.

80
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,300
Understand this morning that revival is not regeneration.

81
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,979
Revival is not redemption.

82
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,699
Redemption is through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.

83
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:56,179
When I trust Christ as my personal savior

84
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:59,500
and I'm born again, I'm born of the spirit,

85
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,699
that is salvation and I'm thankful for salvation.

86
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:07,220
And the individual that is saved,

87
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,380
there are times when we need revival.

88
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,339
We need, I would call it this in just a simple term,

89
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:16,179
an awakening and we need to have,

90
00:04:16,179 --> 00:04:18,619
listen, sometimes we can get apathetic.

91
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:20,540
Sometimes we can get indifferent.

92
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,299
Sometimes we can fall into the trap

93
00:04:22,299 --> 00:04:24,420
of the church of the Laodiceans

94
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,260
and think that we're full of all these things

95
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,579
and we really have need of nothing.

96
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:33,579
And the reality is that we need a fresh touch of the Lord.

97
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,480
We need to have this awakening.

98
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,100
We need to come into this place where I would say this,

99
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,640
I don't wanna be calloused.

100
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,260
I don't wanna be cold.

101
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,220
I don't want to simply exist.

102
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,459
I want to abound spiritually.

103
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:54,299
You know, some people are perfectly fine with just existing.

104
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:58,519
Some people are perfectly fine with just coasting through,

105
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,820
if you will, and just existing.

106
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,320
But man, I wanna abound.

107
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,260
I wanna thrive spiritually.

108
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,459
I wanna have that, if I mentioned that the truth

109
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,940
of salvation is really a relationship

110
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,500
that I become a son of God.

111
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,899
He's my father through redemption,

112
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,220
through that regeneration.

113
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,059
If any man be in Christ, he's a new creature,

114
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:22,500
then I'm made alive.

115
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,459
I am his child.

116
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:25,420
I am saved.

117
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,980
I am born again.

118
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,779
The reality is that there are times

119
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:32,859
that we need that revival,

120
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:35,220
that we would have that first love

121
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,019
that Jesus speaks of with the church at Ephesus.

122
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:43,420
And this morning, when we think about revival in Israel,

123
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,299
if we were to go back,

124
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:46,220
and we won't take the time this morning,

125
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,820
but if we go back to the book of 2 Chronicles in particular

126
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,500
and look at the time in which Jehoshaphat

127
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,820
is reigning over Israel,

128
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,899
if you were to look at the time in which Hezekiah

129
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:58,660
is reigning over Judah, Jehoshaphat over Judah,

130
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,540
Hezekiah over Judah, Josiah reigning as king over Judah,

131
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,220
and you look at each of those periods of history,

132
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,899
and you look at the revivals that take place,

133
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:11,660
you will find several consistencies.

134
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,260
Number one, there's an acknowledgement of

135
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,260
and repentance of sin.

136
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,660
If you look at all of those accounts,

137
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,739
you will find that there's an acknowledgement

138
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:25,059
and a repentance of sin.

139
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:29,619
The period of time was marked by cleansing,

140
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:31,660
cleansing of the temple,

141
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,739
cleansing of the individuals.

142
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:35,619
You think about us as individual believers today,

143
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:36,820
New Testament believers,

144
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,059
we are the temple of God,

145
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:41,339
according to what we read in the scriptures,

146
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:43,820
that our bodies are the temple of the Holy Ghost,

147
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,260
which is in you, what you have of God.

148
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,899
We read that, we understand that,

149
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:50,339
and so it was marked by cleansing,

150
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:52,619
it was marked by obedience,

151
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:56,820
a renewed commitment to obey what thus saith the Lord.

152
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,579
It reminds me of John chapter two,

153
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:01,220
when Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus Christ,

154
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,459
says to those servants,

155
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,059
whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.

156
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,619
A renewed commitment to obedience,

157
00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:13,100
it was marked by worship, by worship.

158
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,660
Listen, we don't just come to church to mark a,

159
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,019
check a box that I was in church.

160
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,739
I'm thankful that in our church,

161
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:24,619
there's a great fellowship that takes place,

162
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:26,700
how appropriate that the name of our church is

163
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,179
Fellowship Baptist Church,

164
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:31,859
and I believe that God has allowed us in our church family

165
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:34,540
to establish some really good connections,

166
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,779
and we have sweet fellowship one with another.

167
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:38,140
But listen, you don't come to church

168
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,540
just because you wanna see a friend,

169
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,179
that you wanna fellowship with someone.

170
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:43,899
No, we come to church to worship the Lord,

171
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:46,220
to worship him in spirit and in truth,

172
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,820
and there's a renewed sense of worship of the Lord

173
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,059
when we think about this truth of revival

174
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:57,019
and see it in Israel's history, in Judah in particular.

175
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:00,220
We find that God's word was preached,

176
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,980
that prayer was primary,

177
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,820
and we see that the people of God were responding

178
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,380
to the challenges that were issued this morning.

179
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,899
I don't, you don't need to turn there,

180
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:13,779
I'll read it for you,

181
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:17,179
but in Romans chapter number 13 and verses 11 through 14,

182
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:19,540
listen to what the Bible says in this portion of scripture,

183
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,500
then we'll dig into John 13.

184
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,380
The Bible says this in Romans 13,

185
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,899
and that knowing the time,

186
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,940
that now it is high time, listen, to awake out of sleep.

187
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:37,099
For now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.

188
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,580
The night is far spent, the day is at hand.

189
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:44,419
Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness

190
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:47,940
and let us put on the armor of light.

191
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,580
Verse 13, let us walk honestly.

192
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,780
Man, wouldn't it be a wonderful thing

193
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,179
if there was just a renewed level of honesty,

194
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:59,299
not only in our nation, but I would say in our churches.

195
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,580
Let us walk honestly, as in the day,

196
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,419
not in rioting and in drunkenness,

197
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:08,099
not in chambering and wantonness,

198
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:09,780
not in strife and envying,

199
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,020
but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ,

200
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,340
notice this phrase to end the chapter,

201
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:19,260
make not provision for the flesh

202
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,820
to fulfill the lusts thereof.

203
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:25,859
You understand that your flesh has desires.

204
00:09:27,219 --> 00:09:30,859
I don't care if you're saved, your flesh has desires.

205
00:09:30,859 --> 00:09:34,539
I don't care how old you are, your flesh has desires.

206
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:38,140
And the Bible says that we're to make not provision

207
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,140
for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof.

208
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,099
And as we think about this portion of scripture

209
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:44,979
in Romans 13, by way of introduction,

210
00:09:44,979 --> 00:09:47,299
we find that it says that we're to awake out of sleep

211
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:50,659
and the way that we're to put off and put on in our walk

212
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:52,179
and what it should be marked by.

213
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:55,020
And we find that we live in this sin-cursed world

214
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,260
and we live in this time in which we're constantly

215
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,979
bombarded by so many things.

216
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:06,739
But as we look at John 13, we find that the Lord Jesus Christ, He rises from supper and

217
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,939
He washes the feet of the disciples.

218
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:14,099
And as He washes the feet of the disciples and we look contextually at what happens in

219
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:19,239
John 13, yes, there are some valuable lessons and we'll mark them quickly, but I want you

220
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:24,099
to understand that there is a spiritual truth that is given to us in John 13 that is so

221
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:27,739
necessary for us to understand today.

222
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:32,819
I've chosen this morning to title the message in the form of a question.

223
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:36,219
You've probably read it already in the back of the bulletin, but the title for the message

224
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:42,099
this morning posed as a question is this, are your feet dirty?

225
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,259
Are your feet dirty?

226
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:47,899
In John 13, pick it up with me in verse number one, the Bible says this, now before the feast

227
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:52,939
of the Passover, when Jesus knew that His hour was come, that He should depart out of

228
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:58,699
this world unto the Father, having loved His own, which were in the world, He loved them

229
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,699
unto the end.

230
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:02,139
Aren't you thankful for the love of God?

231
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:07,339
Verse two, in supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot,

232
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:13,579
Simon's son, to betray Him, Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into

233
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:20,059
His hands and that He was come from God and went to God, He riseth from supper.

234
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:25,459
First the Bible says He laid aside His garments and took a towel and girded Himself.

235
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:30,139
Can you imagine even at that point as the disciples would begin to see the Lord Jesus

236
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:35,019
Christ move and what He's doing and seeing that He lays aside His garments and He takes

237
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:36,819
this towel and He girds Himself?

238
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:42,379
And then the Bible says after that in verse five that He pours water into a basin.

239
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:47,699
Then it tells us that He began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the

240
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:50,739
towel wherewith He was girded.

241
00:11:50,739 --> 00:11:53,259
Can you see it in your mind's eye?

242
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:58,779
God in flesh, the Lord Jesus Christ, rising up from supper, these disciples that are sitting

243
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:03,619
there, and He rises up and He puts off His garments and the Bible tells us that He takes

244
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:08,899
and He takes this towel and He girds Himself and He pours this water in a basin and He

245
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:14,099
begins to wash the feet of the disciples and the Bible says that He then wiped them with

246
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:18,419
the towel wherewith He was girded.

247
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:23,659
I want to remind you that these same disciples according to other gospel accounts when they

248
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,619
entered into the room, you know what they were arguing over?

249
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:29,859
Who was the greatest among them?

250
00:12:29,859 --> 00:12:39,339
And here is God who after supper gets down and performs a task that was the task of a

251
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:42,659
servant.

252
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:48,379
I find this morning that as we look at just these first few verses that we can see the

253
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:50,699
valuable lesson of service.

254
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:56,019
I'm thankful that Mark's gospel reveals to us so vividly that the Lord Jesus Christ came

255
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:57,059
to be a servant.

256
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:00,699
He didn't come to be served but He came to serve.

257
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:04,099
What a privilege it is to be a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ.

258
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:08,179
What a privilege it is to serve the Master.

259
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:14,979
To know that He not only gave us an example of service here in this particular text of

260
00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:18,579
Scripture but He also gave us an example of humility.

261
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:19,579
What a lesson on humility.

262
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:25,019
When you begin to think about the Lord Jesus Christ, the Bible teaches us that He left

263
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:28,179
all of the glory of heaven.

264
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:35,459
You think about all of the splendor and glory that He had for all of eternity, past.

265
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,979
And He leaves.

266
00:13:37,979 --> 00:13:42,539
And at the appointed time God sent forth His Son, born of a virgin, why?

267
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:45,899
To redeem them that were under the law.

268
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:50,419
The Bible tells us that He humbled Himself and He became obedient unto death, even the

269
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:52,499
death of the cross.

270
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:57,339
And we see here in John 13 just before He would go to that cross of Calvary that He

271
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:01,259
is given this lesson to His disciples of service and humility.

272
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:05,019
In fact, if you skip down to verse number 12, the Bible says, so after He'd washed their

273
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:09,499
feet and had taken His garments and was set down again, He said unto them, know ye what

274
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:10,859
I have done to you.

275
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:13,939
He's gonna teach them this lesson of service and humility.

276
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:18,219
He finishes up the task and we're gonna go back and focus on verses 6 through 10 here

277
00:14:18,219 --> 00:14:19,219
in just a moment.

278
00:14:19,219 --> 00:14:23,419
But I want you to see that Jesus says, do you know, know ye what I have done to you

279
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:24,419
in verse 13.

280
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:28,659
And notice what He says, ye call me Master and Lord.

281
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,939
And ye say, well, for so I am.

282
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:35,779
You know, so many people today want to say, well, Jesus never claimed to be God.

283
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:38,939
You ever read John 13 and verse number 13?

284
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:43,739
Listen, if He's not God, why would He allow them to call Him Lord?

285
00:14:43,739 --> 00:14:46,139
Why would He allow them to call Him Master?

286
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:47,979
And He says, you call me Master and Lord.

287
00:14:47,979 --> 00:14:54,299
And notice what He says, and ye say, well, you are correct in calling me Master.

288
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:56,619
You are correct in calling me Lord.

289
00:14:56,619 --> 00:14:57,619
Why?

290
00:14:57,619 --> 00:14:59,419
For so I am.

291
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:01,379
It's an interesting study.

292
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:03,819
We won't take the time this morning, but if you were to study through the book of John

293
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,259
and reference the I am, right?

294
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:10,739
Jesus said before Abraham was, I am.

295
00:15:10,739 --> 00:15:11,739
What's He referring to?

296
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:13,979
All the way back in the book of Exodus, right?

297
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,179
I am that I am.

298
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:20,979
And we find here that He says before, and ye say, well, for so I am.

299
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:27,219
Notice in verse 14, if I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also

300
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,219
ought to wash one another's feet.

301
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,859
For I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you.

302
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:36,459
Verily, verily, I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that

303
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:39,099
is sent greater than he that sent him.

304
00:15:39,099 --> 00:15:45,019
And so we find that the Lord Jesus Christ performs this task that is a task that is

305
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:50,979
just a humiliating task, to clean the feet of the disciples, and He shows the service

306
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:52,339
and the humility.

307
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:57,379
But this morning, for just a few moments, I want to focus our attention on the interaction

308
00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:02,879
that is recorded for us between Jesus and Peter in verses 6 through 10.

309
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:08,859
As we look at this portion within the greater context, I want to deal with the specific

310
00:16:08,859 --> 00:16:14,559
application, but then also deal with a spiritual application that I think is so necessary for

311
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,519
each of us this morning.

312
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,519
Notice in verse number 6.

313
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,719
Now you know, as you've studied, as I've preached over the years, Peter is the one that often

314
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:25,639
stands up and speaks.

315
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:31,319
Peter is the one that stood up and made that great declaration when Jesus said, whom do

316
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:32,719
men say that I am?

317
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:37,359
And they answer, some say John the Baptist, some say Jeremiah, one of the other prophets.

318
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:40,239
And Jesus says, but whom say ye that I am?

319
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:45,319
And Peter stands up and he says, thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

320
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:50,679
Man, what a great, powerful truth that Peter stands up and gives.

321
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:55,199
Remember when Jesus is walking on the water and the disciples see Him and Peter says,

322
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,479
Lord, if it's Thee, bid me come to Thee.

323
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:03,239
Peter's the one that, out of all of the disciples of the boat, he's the one that speaks up.

324
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:07,279
When Jesus takes Peter, John, and James to the Mount of Transfiguration and shows them

325
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:10,039
His glory, it's Peter that says, man, it's good that we're here.

326
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:13,119
We should make some three tabernacles.

327
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:18,079
And we find that Peter, now in the midst of this room, and the disciples are there, and

328
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,239
I think that Peter probably says what all of them wanted to say.

329
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:29,799
And he says this in verse 6, then cometh he to Simon Peter, and Peter saith unto him,

330
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:36,419
Lord, dost thou wash my feet?

331
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:41,499
Now I think that's an appropriate question.

332
00:17:41,499 --> 00:17:44,139
Peter understanding, I mean, he lived in that culture.

333
00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:49,459
You and I this morning, we wear shoes and most of us wear socks and we don't walk on

334
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:50,779
everywhere we go.

335
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,059
It's not our mode of transportation is our feet.

336
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:57,459
We get in vehicles and we drive and for the most part we have clean roads.

337
00:17:57,459 --> 00:18:02,739
We don't walk on dusty, dirty roads where the same animals traverse and we walk through

338
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:03,739
all of those things.

339
00:18:03,739 --> 00:18:04,739
It was a different culture.

340
00:18:04,739 --> 00:18:06,259
It was a different time.

341
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:10,459
And these feet, they were dirty and Jesus is washing the feet of the disciples.

342
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:17,419
I don't know which number Peter is, but he comes to Peter and Peter says, Lord, dost

343
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:21,499
thou wash my feet?

344
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:26,259
Peter knew that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

345
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:29,339
Peter knew who Jesus was.

346
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:35,579
The God of the universe is going to wash my feet?

347
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:42,940
Jesus answered and said unto him, what I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know

348
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,979
hereafter.

349
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:47,579
Then notice what Peter says to the Lord Jesus Christ.

350
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:50,179
Can you see Peter?

351
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:53,019
He says, thou shalt never wash my feet.

352
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:57,579
Again, I can understand why Peter might say that.

353
00:18:57,579 --> 00:19:01,820
No Lord, thou shalt never.

354
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:09,459
The verbiage that is used is so strong that it's underscored, no, never, never you're

355
00:19:09,459 --> 00:19:12,859
going to do that.

356
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:24,339
And Jesus says, if I wash thee not, notice this, thou hast no part with me.

357
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:29,779
We'll get back to that in just a moment, but notice Peter's response to what Jesus says

358
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:31,399
in verse 8.

359
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:37,320
Then Peter says this, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.

360
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,359
You see how quickly Peter goes from, no Lord, never, you're not going to do it.

361
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:47,159
And Jesus says, listen, if I don't wash thee, if I don't do this, then thou hast no part

362
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:48,159
with me.

363
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:50,559
And then Peter goes all the way to the other side and says, okay, well then not just my

364
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,799
feet, but like wash me all over.

365
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,599
Notice what Jesus says in verse 10.

366
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,559
This is so important for us to understand as we look at the spiritual application this

367
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:00,559
morning.

368
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:00,579
We'll be right back.

369
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,579
Jesus saith to him,

370
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:09,579
He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet,

371
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:13,579
but is clean every wit.

372
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:17,579
And then Jesus says, and you are clean, but not all.

373
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:20,579
Now there's a distinction in the original language

374
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:23,579
that we have a difficulty of seeing this morning

375
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:26,579
in the English language, and I don't say that

376
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:28,579
to cause anyone to have confusion or doubt

377
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:31,579
or any of that sort of thing, but you understand

378
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:34,579
that some languages have multiple words

379
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:37,579
for different things that we in English

380
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:40,579
just have one word for.

381
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:42,579
We were talking to Tim after door knocking yesterday,

382
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:44,579
we were talking about mushroom,

383
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:46,579
and I don't even know how it came up,

384
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,579
but the word in French versus in Spanish,

385
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:51,579
but Armando has a different word for mushroom in Spanish

386
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:53,579
than somebody else has for the word in Spanish.

387
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:56,579
They just have different words.

388
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:59,579
The word love, we use the word love in English

389
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:03,579
that I love my wife, and I love pizza.

390
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:05,579
And you say, well that's kind of odd,

391
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:07,579
but we just have one word.

392
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:10,579
But you understand through the context of the statement

393
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:13,579
what we mean by it.

394
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:15,579
I hope that each of you would understand

395
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:17,579
that I love my wife in a different way

396
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:20,579
than I love pizza. Amen?

397
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,579
Even though she got me a little thing

398
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:24,579
that sits on my nightstand that says

399
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:26,579
tacos, and what a blessing,

400
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:28,579
because I know she loves tacos, amen?

401
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,579
But the reality is that sometimes

402
00:21:30,579 --> 00:21:32,579
we lack multiple words.

403
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:35,579
Actually, the vocabulary for English

404
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:37,579
is much smaller than the vocabulary

405
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:39,579
of a number of other languages,

406
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:42,579
Greek as well.

407
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:45,579
And here in this text of Scripture,

408
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:49,579
Jesus says, he that is washed.

409
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:52,579
That first reference in verse number 10

410
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:55,579
is a different word altogether

411
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:57,579
than the word when he says

412
00:21:57,579 --> 00:22:02,579
neither not to save, to wash his feet.

413
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:06,579
It's two different words.

414
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:08,579
And they mean something entirely different.

415
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:11,579
The first washed means to bathe,

416
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:14,579
and it means the whole person.

417
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:18,579
The second word wash simply means to wash,

418
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:21,579
and it means a part only.

419
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:25,579
Specifically referring to hands, feet, or face.

420
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:27,579
You ever say to somebody,

421
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,579
you need to go wash your face.

422
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:31,579
You need to go get washed up.

423
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:35,579
And so we may use the word bathe, right?

424
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:37,579
That you need to go get a bath.

425
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:40,579
And we find here that then Jesus says this,

426
00:22:40,579 --> 00:22:44,579
notice, he but is clean every wit.

427
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:48,579
And ye are clean, but not all.

428
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:50,579
Now why does he say not all?

429
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:54,579
Well, because Judas is sitting amongst the disciples.

430
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:58,579
And Jesus knows that Judas is not clean.

431
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:00,579
What do I mean by that?

432
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,579
Well, he's not been washed.

433
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:06,579
That first word that is used in John 13 and verse number 10,

434
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:08,579
he's not been washed.

435
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:10,579
He's not been saved.

436
00:23:10,579 --> 00:23:12,579
If I could use that terminology this morning,

437
00:23:12,579 --> 00:23:15,579
and you would understand the application that we're making.

438
00:23:15,579 --> 00:23:19,579
And so he says that ye are clean, but not all.

439
00:23:19,579 --> 00:23:21,579
The eleven have trusted,

440
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:23,579
but there's one Judas that's not,

441
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:25,579
and so he's not clean.

442
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:27,579
Now he's going to have his feet washed,

443
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:29,579
but it doesn't do him any good,

444
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:31,579
because he's not clean.

445
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:33,579
Does that make sense to you this morning?

446
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,579
So here's the physical understanding

447
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:37,579
of what they would understand

448
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:39,579
with regard to this text of scripture

449
00:23:39,579 --> 00:23:41,579
and what they would daily go through.

450
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:43,579
They, unlike you and unlike me,

451
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:46,579
they did not have indoor plumbing

452
00:23:46,579 --> 00:23:48,579
with their own bathrooms.

453
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:50,579
They did not have an en-suite.

454
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,579
They did not have a master bedroom with a beautiful...

455
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:54,579
No, they didn't have all of that.

456
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:57,579
And so a lot of times in the villages and the towns,

457
00:23:57,579 --> 00:24:00,579
they would have central bathhouses

458
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:02,579
that they would go to,

459
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:04,579
and that's where they would get washed,

460
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:06,579
where they would bathe themselves.

461
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,579
And then after they would bathe themselves,

462
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:11,579
they would have to walk home.

463
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:13,579
Guess how they would walk home?

464
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:15,579
They would walk home with sandals on.

465
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,579
And when they'd walk home with sandals on,

466
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:23,579
they'd walk on some dusty, dirty roads

467
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:27,579
that the shepherds just brought their flocks through.

468
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:29,579
Now I hope you can understand this morning

469
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:32,579
what flocks do.

470
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:34,579
Everyone good? You're tracking?

471
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:36,579
Amen?

472
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:38,579
And that's where you're walking.

473
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:40,579
So guess what happens?

474
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,579
Your feet are dirty.

475
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:44,579
So what do you have to do?

476
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:47,579
Well, typically, when you went into a house

477
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:50,579
in that culture, there was a servant

478
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:53,579
that their job was to wash the feet

479
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:56,579
of the people that entered into the house.

480
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:00,579
Culturally, custom, that's how it worked.

481
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:04,579
So Jesus, washing the feet of the disciples,

482
00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:06,579
he's giving them this truth.

483
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:08,579
Peter says, no, Lord, you're not going to wash my feet.

484
00:25:08,579 --> 00:25:10,579
Never!

485
00:25:10,579 --> 00:25:12,579
And Jesus says, remember verse 8,

486
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:14,579
I said that I'd get back to it in just a moment.

487
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,579
Jesus says in verse number 8,

488
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:18,579
he says, if I wash thee not,

489
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:20,579
thou hast no part with me.

490
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:23,579
Now understand that that word in verse number 8

491
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:25,579
is the second word that he uses

492
00:25:25,579 --> 00:25:27,579
in verse number 10.

493
00:25:27,579 --> 00:25:29,579
So this wash that he's speaking of

494
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:31,579
in verse number 8,

495
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:33,579
the second use in verse number 10

496
00:25:33,579 --> 00:25:35,579
is that part only.

497
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:37,579
It's not talking about redemption.

498
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:39,579
It's not talking about being washed

499
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,579
or the whole person.

500
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:43,579
He doesn't mean to wash the feet.

501
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:45,579
Why? Because they've gotten dirty.

502
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:48,579
And so he says, notice, if I wash thee not,

503
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:52,579
thou hast no part with me.

504
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:54,579
What does he mean by that?

505
00:25:54,579 --> 00:25:57,579
He doesn't mean that you stop being my child.

506
00:25:57,579 --> 00:26:00,579
He means that our fellowship with him

507
00:26:00,579 --> 00:26:03,579
is hindered.

508
00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:05,579
We've got dirty feet.

509
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:07,579
And dirty feet hinder my fellowship

510
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:09,579
with my Savior.

511
00:26:09,579 --> 00:26:11,579
And sin in the life of a believer

512
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:13,579
is never going to cause them

513
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:15,579
to have to be saved again.

514
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:18,579
Why? Because we believe in eternal security.

515
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:21,579
The Bible says that my sheep hear my voice,

516
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,579
and I know them, and I give unto them

517
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:25,579
eternal life.

518
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:27,579
And then he says, and they shall never perish.

519
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:29,579
I mean, listen, he had just taught this

520
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:31,579
in John chapter number 10

521
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:32,579
about this very truth.

522
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:34,579
He says, they shall never perish.

523
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:36,579
He says, neither shall any man pluck them

524
00:26:36,579 --> 00:26:37,579
out of my hand.

525
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:39,579
Which gave them me is greater than all,

526
00:26:39,579 --> 00:26:41,579
and no man is able to pluck them out

527
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:42,579
of my Father's hand.

528
00:26:42,579 --> 00:26:44,579
I and my Father are one.

529
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:47,579
Peter says that we're kept by the power of God.

530
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:50,579
That we have reserved for us in heaven

531
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:53,579
this inheritance that's corruptible,

532
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:55,579
that's incorruptible, excuse me,

533
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:58,579
that fadeth not away.

534
00:26:58,579 --> 00:27:00,579
So we understand the truth of eternal security.

535
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:02,579
By the way, I'm thankful that I can't lose it.

536
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,579
Because if I could lose it, if you could lose it,

537
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:06,579
we'd have lost it.

538
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:09,579
People like to run to Hebrews chapter number 6,

539
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:11,579
I believe it is, and run to Hebrews chapter number 6

540
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:14,579
and say, see right there, you can lose your salvation.

541
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:16,579
You know what's funny about that?

542
00:27:16,579 --> 00:27:18,579
Prior to and after that portion of Scripture

543
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:19,579
in Hebrews chapter number 6,

544
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:21,579
you know how the Lord talks about security,

545
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:23,579
about salvation, that he is the author

546
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:25,579
of eternal security.

547
00:27:25,579 --> 00:27:27,579
So you mean to tell me that God's going to tell us

548
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,579
that he's the author of eternal security

549
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:31,579
and then tell us you can lose it,

550
00:27:31,579 --> 00:27:33,579
and then tell us he's the author of eternal security?

551
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:36,579
It doesn't make any sense.

552
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:38,579
And so we find here this morning

553
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:40,579
that when Peter and the other disciples,

554
00:27:40,579 --> 00:27:43,579
and again, we focus in on this conversation,

555
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,579
this interaction between Peter and the Lord Jesus Christ,

556
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:48,579
and Jesus is washing the feet,

557
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:50,579
and he's giving them truth,

558
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:52,579
and Peter says, no, Lord,

559
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:54,579
and Jesus says to Peter,

560
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:57,579
but if I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.

561
00:27:57,579 --> 00:27:59,579
Peter, it's not that he's going to lose his salvation

562
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:01,579
because he doesn't get his feet washed,

563
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:06,579
it's that his fellowship is hindered.

564
00:28:06,579 --> 00:28:08,579
Remember I said this by way of introduction

565
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:09,579
a few moments ago,

566
00:28:09,579 --> 00:28:12,579
that I want nothing between my soul and my Savior.

567
00:28:12,579 --> 00:28:14,579
The Bible tells us that sin hinders

568
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:16,579
our fellowship with God.

569
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:18,579
It hinders our fellowship with God.

570
00:28:18,579 --> 00:28:19,579
D.L. Moody said this,

571
00:28:19,579 --> 00:28:20,579
sin will keep you from this book,

572
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:22,579
or this book will keep you from sin.

573
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:25,579
You know what happens when somebody is sinning?

574
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:26,579
They're not praying like they should be praying.

575
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:27,579
They're not reading the Bible

576
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:28,579
like they should be reading the Bible.

577
00:28:28,579 --> 00:28:29,579
They're not in church like they should be in church.

578
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:30,579
Why?

579
00:28:30,579 --> 00:28:33,579
Because sin keeps, breaks, hinders our fellowship.

580
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:36,579
The Bible says this in Psalm 66 and verse 18,

581
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:37,579
if I regard iniquity in my heart,

582
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:40,579
the Lord will not hear me.

583
00:28:40,579 --> 00:28:42,579
You ever feel like you can't get your prayers answered?

584
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:43,579
You feel like, man, it has come to the place,

585
00:28:43,579 --> 00:28:45,579
search me, oh Lord, show me.

586
00:28:45,579 --> 00:28:47,579
I need to get my feet washed

587
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:50,579
because my feet are dirty.

588
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:52,579
Great picture in the Old Testament.

589
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:55,579
Turn to the book of Exodus, if you will.

590
00:28:55,579 --> 00:28:58,579
Exodus chapter 29,

591
00:28:58,579 --> 00:29:00,579
and we'll look at chapter 29 and 30

592
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:01,579
here in the book of Exodus.

593
00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:03,579
A great picture in the Old Testament

594
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:06,579
of this truth that we're dealing with this morning,

595
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,579
and it's pictured, it's typified

596
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:10,579
in the Old Testament priest.

597
00:29:10,579 --> 00:29:12,579
In Exodus chapter 29,

598
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:13,579
we read, and we won't take the time

599
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:15,579
to read the entirety of the chapter.

600
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:17,579
It's a lengthy chapter in Exodus chapter 29,

601
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:19,579
but we read in Exodus chapter 29

602
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:22,579
of the consecration of the priest.

603
00:29:22,579 --> 00:29:25,579
When you read of the consecration of the priest,

604
00:29:25,579 --> 00:29:26,579
it begins in verse number one,

605
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:28,579
and it says, and this is the thing

606
00:29:28,579 --> 00:29:32,579
thou shalt do unto them to hallow them.

607
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:34,579
That means to consecrate them.

608
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:36,579
That means to sanctify them.

609
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:38,579
The word sanctify means to set apart.

610
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:40,579
It means to cleanse and to purify,

611
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:42,579
and we understand that these priests,

612
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:44,579
this consecration that was taking place

613
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:46,579
was a one-time event.

614
00:29:46,579 --> 00:29:48,579
They were, this thing that they did

615
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,579
in Exodus chapter 29,

616
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:51,579
this is what took place.

617
00:29:51,579 --> 00:29:53,579
This was the instruction

618
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:56,579
with regard to the consecration of the priest,

619
00:29:56,579 --> 00:29:59,579
and as they would enter into the priest's office,

620
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:01,579
this was what took place.

621
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:06,539
the process. Notice the Bible says, take one young bullock and two rams without

622
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:11,099
blemish, verse 2, and unleavened bread and cakes unleavened, tempered with oil, and

623
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:15,299
wafers unleavened, anointed with oil of wheat and flour shalt thou make them.

624
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:18,899
Thou shalt put them into one basket and bring them in the basket with the bullock

625
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:22,899
and the two rams, verse 4, and Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door

626
00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:26,859
of the tabernacle of the congregation, notice what it says, and shalt wash them

627
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:33,179
with water. That's at that moment of consecration, of that sanctification, of

628
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:38,419
them being set apart for that particular service. The Bible tells us about, as you

629
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:42,139
continue reading through here, about the killing of the ram, and verse number 20

630
00:30:42,139 --> 00:30:45,979
talks about taking his blood and putting it on the tip of the right ear of Aaron,

631
00:30:45,979 --> 00:30:49,339
upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of the right

632
00:30:49,339 --> 00:30:52,779
hand, upon the great toe of the right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the

633
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:57,379
altar round about. You would see from head to toe, they had been through this

634
00:30:57,379 --> 00:31:01,579
process of consecration. It started with being washed, though, in verse number 4.

635
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:08,139
But then think about this, as they serve the Lord in the office of a priest, they

636
00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:12,459
would serve in the tabernacle. When you serve in the tabernacle, the first piece

637
00:31:12,459 --> 00:31:16,179
of furniture that you come to after you enter the single gate of the tabernacle

638
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:21,019
is the brazen altar, and we find that that represents the fact that sacrifice

639
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:25,739
is required. You can't ever get to the holy place without first coming to the

640
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:31,579
brazen altar. But then after the brazen altar, there's a laver. Exodus chapter

641
00:31:31,579 --> 00:31:36,739
number 30, notice what the Bible says in verse number 17, in Exodus chapter 30, so

642
00:31:36,739 --> 00:31:41,819
now that one-time consecration is done in Exodus 29, now in chapter

643
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:45,099
number 30, notice in verse 17, the Bible says, the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

644
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:50,579
Thou shall also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash with

645
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:54,059
all, and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the

646
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:59,299
altar, and thou shalt put water therein. And it says that Aaron and his sons

647
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:06,139
shall wash what? Their hands and their feet thereat. When they go into the

648
00:32:06,139 --> 00:32:10,019
tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water. Notice what it

649
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:14,139
says, that they die not. Or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn

650
00:32:14,139 --> 00:32:17,779
offering made by fire unto the Lord, so they shall wash their hands and their

651
00:32:17,779 --> 00:32:21,819
feet, that they die not, and it shall be a statute forever to them, even to him

652
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:26,819
and to his seed throughout their generations. And we find here that in

653
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:32,939
in Exodus 30, verses 17 through 21, this laver served the purpose of washing, yes,

654
00:32:32,939 --> 00:32:36,659
their feet, but also their hands, because of what they would be involved in. And

655
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:40,139
guess what? As they were making the sacrifice unto the Lord, they were

656
00:32:40,139 --> 00:32:46,379
getting dirty feet and dirty hands. God said, use a laver for that purpose. So as

657
00:32:46,379 --> 00:32:51,179
we go back to John chapter number 13, and we seek to answer the question, are

658
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:56,539
your feet dirty? Are your feet dirty? If you're taking notes this morning, all

659
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:59,459
that was introduction, but don't worry, I only have two points, it's gonna be quick.

660
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:03,979
Promise. That was the big part of the message. Number one this morning, the

661
00:33:03,979 --> 00:33:10,299
reason our feet get dirty. The reason our feet get dirty. Number one, and quite

662
00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:16,499
obvious, is because of sin. No doubt, sin in the life of a believer must be dealt

663
00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:21,059
with. Sin causes us to have dirty feet. If we're looking at the same picture in

664
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:25,179
this illustration that we see in John 13, making this spiritual application, we

665
00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:31,019
find that that sin will make us dirty. We understand the importance of dealing

666
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:34,539
with sin in the life of believer. I mentioned this last year as I was

667
00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:37,699
preaching through the first, the book of 1st John, where a preacher was speaking

668
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:41,739
about sin in the life of a believer, and someone objected to the message that the

669
00:33:41,739 --> 00:33:45,179
preacher preached, because he said, listen, sin in the life of a believer is

670
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:48,979
different than sin in an unbeliever. And the preacher responded and said, yes, it's

671
00:33:48,979 --> 00:33:55,219
worse. It's worse. And what happens sometimes is we just kind of get

672
00:33:55,219 --> 00:33:58,779
comfortable with living in the culture that we're living in, and everybody else

673
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:02,959
around us, we talked about that truth in Romans 13, that we'd walk honestly, and I

674
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:07,339
said, listen, that's good for our culture, but it's good for our church. It's

675
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:14,699
amazing how often we can just ignore sin in our life, and we don't recognize

676
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:19,259
it as being sin. We don't recognize it as being awful and causing us to have our

677
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:25,339
fellowship with God hindered. No doubt our feet get dirty when we engage in

678
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:30,659
sin, but really more of the application that I'd like to make this morning is

679
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:34,019
that I would say to you, and I'd say to myself this morning, that our feet get

680
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:38,259
dirty simply because we live in this world. Turn to the book of John. You're

681
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:44,579
there in John 13. Turn to chapter 17, if you will. In John chapter number 17, you

682
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:48,779
notice that we're in the world. When I say that we're in the world, we find that

683
00:34:48,779 --> 00:34:52,259
we live in this sin-cursed world. You come into contact with people every

684
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:58,099
single day, and just like those people in the first century, those disciples that

685
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:01,499
Jesus is ministering to here in John chapter 13, that they would have

686
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:06,859
understood the daily routine, the weekly routine of going down to the bathhouse

687
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:11,499
and then having to walk through those roads and getting their feet dirty, and

688
00:35:11,499 --> 00:35:16,459
the importance of regularly washing their feet. Why? Because their feet

689
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:22,259
regularly got dirty because they were walking in that place. Does that make

690
00:35:22,259 --> 00:35:27,059
sense? And so this morning, when we understand the truth that we are in this

691
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:32,659
world, just because we're in the world, our feet get dirty. We get exposed to

692
00:35:32,659 --> 00:35:37,099
some things. Listen, you might not have participated in the dirty jokes that

693
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:40,539
were told this past week at your workplace. You may not have even laughed

694
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:45,059
at them, but you were influenced by them. You heard them. You may not have

695
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,739
supported what you saw on that billboard, or on that sign, or on that

696
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:53,059
advertisement that came across your phone, or in your mailbox, or wherever it

697
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:57,819
might have been, but it impacts you. You get dirty. Does that make sense to you

698
00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:02,219
this morning? And you might not have engaged in the sinful act, the sinful

699
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:07,059
behavior, but man, I have that. You know, we talk about be careful little eyes

700
00:36:07,059 --> 00:36:12,459
what you see, be careful little ears what you hear. Why? Because it impacts us.

701
00:36:12,459 --> 00:36:17,819
And Jesus says this in John 17. Notice what he says. I mean, this is a powerful

702
00:36:17,979 --> 00:36:23,059
passage of Scripture. Really, it is the Lord's Prayer. He's going, he speaks

703
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:27,179
about the hour coming to start the passage of Scripture, but I want to skip

704
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:33,099
down to verse 14. He says, I have given them thy word. Praise the Lord that we

705
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:38,299
have the Bible. He says, I have given them thy word, and the world hath hated them.

706
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:43,579
Why? Because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Listen, this

707
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:47,139
morning, I hope that you're so thankful that you're not of this world. I hope

708
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:50,299
this morning that you can rejoice in saying this world is not my home. I'm

709
00:36:50,299 --> 00:36:55,019
just a passing through. Listen, I'm a pilgrim and a stranger. My citizenship is

710
00:36:55,019 --> 00:37:00,799
in heaven, but I'm still in this world. I'm not of the world, but I'm in the

711
00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:04,619
world. Notice what he says in verse 15. I pray not that thou shouldest take them

712
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:09,459
out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them, notice what it says, from the

713
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:16,859
evil. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Listen, this

714
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:21,979
morning, I know sometimes we would say, even as Paul said, I'm in a straight

715
00:37:21,979 --> 00:37:25,779
betwixt two having a desire to depart to be with Christ, which is far better. Lord,

716
00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:30,939
even so, come, as John prays in Revelation. But you understand that Jesus, in verse

717
00:37:30,939 --> 00:37:35,019
15, he says, I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but

718
00:37:35,139 --> 00:37:39,859
that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. Listen, why does Jesus have us here

719
00:37:39,859 --> 00:37:45,219
still? Because we have a work to do. The world needs to hear the truth of the

720
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:49,579
gospel. Who's going to tell them? Listen, if the moment you got saved, you were

721
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:55,139
transported to heaven, there'd be no believers here. You think about who told

722
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:59,019
you the truth of the gospel. What if they were transported as soon as they trusted

723
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:02,299
Christ as their Savior? The gospel wouldn't have gotten to you. Does that make

724
00:38:02,299 --> 00:38:07,259
sense? So, he has a plan for us, and I know sometimes we can get so sick of this

725
00:38:07,259 --> 00:38:12,259
world. We get bombarded in this world, and we see all this wickedness that's going

726
00:38:12,259 --> 00:38:19,619
on, and we rack our brains. How could this be? Do you read the news? Do you see the

727
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:27,539
stuff that's going on? It's absolute insanity, and it makes us dirty. It

728
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:31,579
doesn't mean that we have to engage in the sin, but it impacts us. That's why I

729
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:35,139
need to go to God, and go to His Word. I'm going to get to that in just a moment. I would

730
00:38:35,139 --> 00:38:40,819
say that we're in the world, and just by simply being in the world, we get our

731
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:48,419
feet dirty. Get your feet dirty. I would say this, because we're in the world, sometimes

732
00:38:48,419 --> 00:38:54,979
we get spotted, polluted, defiled. I think about the truth of the temple. I made the

733
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:58,819
statement already that we are the temple. We made a statement about Jehoshaphat,

734
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:03,659
Hezekiah, and Josiah, and how they were cleansing the temple. During the time of Jesus, at the

735
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:06,979
beginning of His earthly ministry, and then right before He went to the cross, He

736
00:39:06,979 --> 00:39:12,819
cleansed the temple. Isn't it amazing that He had to do it twice? You know what happens

737
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:21,299
if we're not careful? Stuff can just kind of build up. My mother-in-law used to have

738
00:39:21,299 --> 00:39:24,579
this sign on her refrigerator. I remember it said this, I cleaned my house yesterday.

739
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:30,859
I wish you could have seen it. How many of you ladies, I hate dusting, but some of you

740
00:39:30,859 --> 00:39:34,419
ladies, you dust your house, and you say, man, I just dusted this house two days ago,

741
00:39:34,419 --> 00:39:39,459
and there's dust all over the place. I hate dusting. I like vacuuming. I love it, but

742
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:45,859
I don't like any other house chore. The reality is this, if you're not careful, you're going

743
00:39:45,859 --> 00:39:50,099
to get dirty just because you live in the world. The Bible tells us in James 1 and verse

744
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:55,779
27 that we're to be unspotted from the world. Guess what that tells me? I can be spotted

745
00:39:55,779 --> 00:40:00,939
by the world. I can be impacted and influenced. If we're not careful, the thoughts of this

746
00:40:00,939 --> 00:40:01,619
world begin to influence us.

747
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:04,859
impact our thoughts, and we need,

748
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:07,299
we see the reason that our feet get dirty,

749
00:40:07,299 --> 00:40:09,259
yes, number one, sin, but number two,

750
00:40:09,259 --> 00:40:11,719
just because we live in this world.

751
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,299
We live in this world.

752
00:40:13,299 --> 00:40:14,179
So what's the remedy?

753
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:15,379
Number two, we see, number one,

754
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:17,519
the reason that our feet get dirty.

755
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:19,419
What's the remedy for dirty feet?

756
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:21,059
What's the remedy for dirty feet?

757
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:22,839
Well, right there in John 17,

758
00:40:23,979 --> 00:40:25,699
he said that we're in the world,

759
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:26,859
but we're not of the world.

760
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:29,339
He said in verse 14 that I've given them thy word,

761
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:31,259
but then I want you to notice verse 17,

762
00:40:31,259 --> 00:40:36,219
sanctify them through thy truth.

763
00:40:36,219 --> 00:40:39,459
Thy word is truth.

764
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:41,619
That word sanctify, again, as I mentioned

765
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:44,859
from Exodus chapter 29, it means to cleanse.

766
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,099
It means to purify.

767
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:48,699
It means to set apart, and so I begin to think

768
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:52,299
about this truth of John 17 in verses 14 through 17,

769
00:40:52,299 --> 00:40:54,979
and Jesus says I've given them thy word,

770
00:40:54,979 --> 00:40:57,539
and then he gives this parenthetical statement

771
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:59,699
in a sense that the world hates them

772
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:02,459
because they hate me and that they're not of the world,

773
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:05,259
and I'm not of the world, and they're in the world,

774
00:41:05,259 --> 00:41:06,339
but they're not of the world,

775
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:10,859
and then he says this, sanctify them through thy truth.

776
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:14,179
Thy word is truth.

777
00:41:16,419 --> 00:41:19,179
Ephesians chapter five, verses 26 and seven.

778
00:41:19,179 --> 00:41:21,339
Look at that passage, if you will, very quickly,

779
00:41:21,339 --> 00:41:23,099
and we'll look at just a few verses,

780
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:24,159
and then I'll make a few statements,

781
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:25,459
and we'll close this morning,

782
00:41:25,459 --> 00:41:27,239
but in Ephesians chapter number five,

783
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:29,959
within the context of Ephesians five,

784
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:33,119
it begins about really revival.

785
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,599
If you read this passage of scripture,

786
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:36,959
you see just a great truth and outline

787
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:38,839
with regard to revival and the truth

788
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:40,919
of being filled with the spirit of God,

789
00:41:40,919 --> 00:41:43,599
and then he deals with the relationships in the home,

790
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,779
the home life, and verse 22 down through

791
00:41:46,779 --> 00:41:49,359
deals with wives and husbands and children

792
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,039
in the beginning of chapter number six,

793
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:54,359
but I wanna draw your attention to verse 25,

794
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:56,719
really focus on verse 26 and seven

795
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:59,919
for the purpose of this particular message this morning,

796
00:41:59,919 --> 00:42:01,219
but in verse 25, the Bible says,

797
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:03,239
husbands, love your wives, but then notice this,

798
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:05,839
and I don't mean to set that aside like it's not important

799
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,359
because it is very important,

800
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,679
but I want you to see that it says,

801
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:13,159
even as Christ also loved the church

802
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:16,319
and gave himself for it, the church, right?

803
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:17,359
So what is the church?

804
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,439
The church is not a building, the church is the people,

805
00:42:19,439 --> 00:42:20,859
those that have been born again,

806
00:42:20,859 --> 00:42:25,199
saved by the blood of Christ, that's the church, amen?

807
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:27,919
And we find that he says that he loved the church

808
00:42:27,919 --> 00:42:31,119
and he gave himself for it, but then notice verse 26,

809
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,119
that he might sanctify and cleanse it, the church, how?

810
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:40,319
With the washing of water, how?

811
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,179
By the word, by the word,

812
00:42:44,219 --> 00:42:48,579
that he might present it to himself a glorious church,

813
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:51,679
not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing,

814
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:55,799
but that it should be holy and without blemish.

815
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:58,799
This morning, yes, we understand

816
00:42:58,799 --> 00:43:00,359
that our feet get dirty with sin

817
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:03,599
and we need the truth of 1 John 1 and verse number nine,

818
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:04,639
that if we confess our sin,

819
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:06,839
his faith will adjust to forgive us our sin

820
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:08,879
and cleanse us from all unrighteousness

821
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:11,319
and I'm thankful for the blood of Christ.

822
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:13,599
But when we understand this morning,

823
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,219
this truth of getting our feet dirty

824
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:17,079
because we live in this world

825
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:20,519
and we live in all this filth of this world

826
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:24,519
and it impacts us and it causes us to be dirty

827
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:26,439
and we need to have our feet washed,

828
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:28,719
this remedy is that we see that he says

829
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:32,819
that it's the washing of water by the word.

830
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,559
Listen, why does the preacher say,

831
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:37,399
read your Bible every day?

832
00:43:37,399 --> 00:43:39,199
Not because we're trying to get certificates

833
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,559
to say who read their Bible in a year.

834
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:43,039
It's because you get dirty

835
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:47,759
and you need the cleansing of the word, amen?

836
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:50,399
Because it's the word of God that tells me what's right

837
00:43:51,279 --> 00:43:52,959
and what's wrong and all of that truth

838
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,399
that we find that with regard to the Bible

839
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,679
and I'm so thankful that God's given it to us

840
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:02,359
and listen this morning, he says this truth in Psalm 119,

841
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:05,679
wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way

842
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:09,439
by taking heed thereto according to thy word,

843
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:11,679
thy word have I hid in mine heart

844
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:15,039
that I might not sin against thee in verse number 11

845
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:17,679
and we find this morning that this truth,

846
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:19,439
the remedy for the dirty feet,

847
00:44:19,439 --> 00:44:21,759
yes, the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ

848
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,479
and how thankful I am for the blood that was shed,

849
00:44:24,479 --> 00:44:26,239
the blood that forgives,

850
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,399
I'm thankful that we have a God who's gracious and merciful

851
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:33,119
but I find this morning that the washing of water

852
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,619
by the word, sanctify them through thy truth,

853
00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:40,039
thy word is truth.

854
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:41,559
Listen, we need the Bible.

855
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:42,839
Tim and I knocking doors yesterday,

856
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:44,319
I asked a lady, hey, do you read the Bible?

857
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:45,999
She's like, eh, you know, occasionally it's a good read,

858
00:44:45,999 --> 00:44:47,759
you know, whatever.

859
00:44:47,759 --> 00:44:49,919
No, no, man, I read the Bible every day.

860
00:44:49,919 --> 00:44:51,199
Why, because you've never read it before?

861
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:53,799
No, I've read it countless times.

862
00:44:53,799 --> 00:44:55,519
I can't, I've stopped keeping track

863
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:57,079
of how many times I've read the Bible through.

864
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:58,479
I don't say that in pride,

865
00:44:58,479 --> 00:45:00,019
I don't say that to put myself up,

866
00:45:00,019 --> 00:45:02,479
I'm just simply saying I've stopped counting

867
00:45:02,479 --> 00:45:05,119
because I need it every single day.

868
00:45:06,439 --> 00:45:08,039
Some people say I read the Bible through in a year,

869
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,479
that's wonderful but listen,

870
00:45:09,479 --> 00:45:11,919
if you get done reading the Bible through on September 10th,

871
00:45:11,919 --> 00:45:13,159
that's the date today,

872
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:14,639
it doesn't mean that you don't read it

873
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:15,719
the rest of the year.

874
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:20,479
You go back to Genesis one if you're reading it that way.

875
00:45:20,479 --> 00:45:22,199
Amen?

876
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:24,639
Why, because we need God's word.

877
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,319
It cleanses us.

878
00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:28,399
It washes us.

879
00:45:28,399 --> 00:45:30,279
Listen, physically this morning,

880
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:34,239
as we look at John 13 physically,

881
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:36,399
it's easy to tell if you have dirty feet.

882
00:45:38,479 --> 00:45:39,639
Right?

883
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:43,439
I remember kids coming in, playing outside barefoot.

884
00:45:43,439 --> 00:45:45,119
They come in with dirty feet.

885
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,519
Sometimes my kids would play volleyball out here

886
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:49,599
with dirty feet on, dirty feet on.

887
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:50,779
I guess you can't take them off,

888
00:45:50,779 --> 00:45:53,519
but with no shoes, right?

889
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:54,719
They just play barefoot.

890
00:45:55,879 --> 00:45:58,479
And guess what happens when you play volleyball barefoot?

891
00:45:58,479 --> 00:45:59,559
First of all, you got a problem

892
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:01,799
with getting something in your foot maybe,

893
00:46:01,799 --> 00:46:03,759
but your feet get dirty.

894
00:46:05,759 --> 00:46:06,999
So you know what I tell my kids?

895
00:46:06,999 --> 00:46:10,159
You're not coming to my house with those dirty feet.

896
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:12,199
Joseph, is that what I say?

897
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:13,399
Not coming to the house with dirty feet.

898
00:46:13,999 --> 00:46:16,319
You're playing outside with bare feet?

899
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,659
So you know what Brownie used to do?

900
00:46:17,659 --> 00:46:21,599
She used to keep a pair of socks right at the front door.

901
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,799
And she put those socks on her dirty feet,

902
00:46:23,799 --> 00:46:26,239
and then she'd go upstairs and she'd wash her feet.

903
00:46:27,799 --> 00:46:30,399
You can tell if you have dirty feet physically.

904
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,379
It's obvious.

905
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:34,679
But can I tell you this morning?

906
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:38,919
At times, we can cover up our spiritually dirty feet.

907
00:46:39,919 --> 00:46:44,519
We can pretend as if our feet aren't dirty.

908
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:46,839
We can pretend as if we've not been influenced

909
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:48,699
and impacted by living in this world.

910
00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:50,539
We can pretend that we have no sin.

911
00:46:51,879 --> 00:46:54,179
But he that says that he has no sin is a liar.

912
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,359
Remember, God didn't put your opinion in the Bible.

913
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:58,399
He didn't put my opinion either.

914
00:46:58,399 --> 00:46:59,959
He just said his word.

915
00:46:59,959 --> 00:47:02,179
And in 1 John 1, he said, if you say that you have no sin,

916
00:47:02,179 --> 00:47:03,319
you're a liar.

917
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:04,719
The truth is not in you.

918
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:07,319
And then he says this, you make him a liar.

919
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:08,219
That's a problem.

920
00:47:09,919 --> 00:47:12,759
And spiritually speaking, many times,

921
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,799
only you know if you have dirty feet.

922
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:20,439
I would say it this way.

923
00:47:21,399 --> 00:47:22,999
Don't get used to dirty feet.

924
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,199
Don't be comfortable with dirty feet.

925
00:47:27,259 --> 00:47:29,759
How many of you like it having dirty hands?

926
00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:31,279
I know there's some mechanics.

927
00:47:31,279 --> 00:47:33,239
Mr. Manuel makes fun of me and Pierre,

928
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:34,759
never can have dirty hands.

929
00:47:34,759 --> 00:47:36,719
No, I don't like my hands being dirty.

930
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:37,559
I don't.

931
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:38,839
My battery died in my truck yesterday.

932
00:47:39,259 --> 00:47:40,279
I had to change my battery.

933
00:47:40,279 --> 00:47:41,979
I washed my hands like four times.

934
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:44,439
It's just crazy.

935
00:47:44,439 --> 00:47:45,839
I hate wearing gloves.

936
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:46,659
Why?

937
00:47:46,659 --> 00:47:47,499
Because when you wear gloves,

938
00:47:47,499 --> 00:47:48,919
you can't feel that your hands are dirty.

939
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:52,159
During that whole COVID nonsense,

940
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:54,479
you ever have a waiter, waitress that comes and brings,

941
00:47:54,479 --> 00:47:56,719
takes up all the dirty dishes from the other place,

942
00:47:56,719 --> 00:47:58,319
uses the same gloves and then brings you your,

943
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:59,719
here's your dinner.

944
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:00,719
Are you kidding me?

945
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:02,799
You didn't go wash your hands

946
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:03,839
after you got all that junk on it

947
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,319
because you got gloves on and you can't feel it.

948
00:48:07,439 --> 00:48:08,799
Amen?

949
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:10,479
I don't like dirty hands.

950
00:48:10,479 --> 00:48:12,159
I don't like dirty feet.

951
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:12,999
What am I saying?

952
00:48:12,999 --> 00:48:14,519
Don't get used to it.

953
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:17,339
Don't be okay with dirty feet spiritually.

954
00:48:18,399 --> 00:48:20,079
Don't be okay with sin.

955
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,679
Don't be okay with being influenced

956
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:24,199
and spotted by this world.

957
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:25,799
Listen, we live in this world,

958
00:48:25,799 --> 00:48:26,879
but we're not of the world.

959
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,399
And God gave us the remedy.

960
00:48:28,399 --> 00:48:30,119
He said, I've given you the word.

961
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:31,799
Listen, every day of our lives,

962
00:48:31,799 --> 00:48:34,479
we must determine that we're gonna spend time

963
00:48:34,479 --> 00:48:35,919
in God's word.

964
00:48:35,919 --> 00:48:36,759
Why?

965
00:48:36,759 --> 00:48:37,599
Because you need it.

966
00:48:38,439 --> 00:48:39,639
You need to be cleansed.

967
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,759
And you're cleansed through the word

968
00:48:42,759 --> 00:48:45,359
with this idea of being dirty or defiled

969
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,359
just by living in this world.

970
00:48:48,379 --> 00:48:51,399
To go back to the truth of John 13,

971
00:48:51,399 --> 00:48:54,379
those disciples understood what it was

972
00:48:54,379 --> 00:48:56,139
to get their feet dirty physically.

973
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:00,519
But Jesus said, I'm not only doing this,

974
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:02,119
but I'm teaching you a lesson.

975
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:03,879
Lesson on service and humility,

976
00:49:03,879 --> 00:49:06,599
absolutely 100%.

977
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:08,199
But teaching us a lesson that, listen,

978
00:49:08,199 --> 00:49:11,139
at times, your feet get dirty and my feet get dirty.

979
00:49:11,139 --> 00:49:14,319
So I ask you this morning, are your feet dirty?

980
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:15,319
Are your feet dirty?

981
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:19,059
Do you need to confess some sin?

982
00:49:20,019 --> 00:49:22,719
Do you need to just ask God to cleanse you

983
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:24,399
through his word?

984
00:49:24,399 --> 00:49:27,539
I don't wanna be defiled by this world.

985
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:29,479
Listen, have you experienced that sometimes

986
00:49:29,479 --> 00:49:31,919
you hear things that you really hoped,

987
00:49:31,919 --> 00:49:33,079
wished you didn't hear?

988
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:35,319
Does it happen to you?

989
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:36,319
It happens to me.

990
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:39,919
You ever see something that you wish you didn't see

991
00:49:39,919 --> 00:49:43,639
that you could unsee, that you could unhear?

992
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:46,199
You can't unhear it, you can't unsee it.

993
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:47,439
I know that's probably not good English,

994
00:49:47,439 --> 00:49:49,159
but you understand what I'm saying.

995
00:49:50,459 --> 00:49:51,899
But you know what you can do?

996
00:49:51,899 --> 00:49:54,559
You can bring into captivity every thought

997
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,119
to the obedience of Christ.

998
00:49:57,279 --> 00:49:59,459
You can renew your mind.

999
00:49:59,459 --> 00:50:00,759
How are you renewing your mind?

1000
00:50:00,759 --> 00:50:01,959
Through the word of God.

1001
00:50:01,959 --> 00:50:04,999
this morning. Are your feet dirty?

1002
00:50:04,999 --> 00:50:09,199
Let's pray. Father, we love you. Thank you for loving us. Thank you for your Word.

1003
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:15,239
God, I pray. I pray this morning that you would

1004
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:18,559
work. Holy Spirit, would you convict?

1005
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:24,439
Would you help us, Lord, to see? No pretense.

1006
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:27,799
Help us to see that we have dirty feet.

1007
00:50:27,799 --> 00:50:33,559
Just by living in this defiled world,

1008
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:39,159
we get dirty feet. God, would you help us to not get used to it?

1009
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:44,519
Would you help us not to ignore it? Would you help us not to

1010
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:49,399
try to make it look good? Help us, Lord, to be cleansed.

1011
00:50:49,399 --> 00:50:52,919
Help us to have clean feet. See,

1012
00:50:52,919 --> 00:50:57,599
we want to have that fellowship with you. When Peter heard those words, he said,

1013
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:03,559
not my feet only, but my feet, my hands, my head.

1014
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:07,679
Jesus, you said that he that is washed,

1015
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:11,399
we'd understand that to mean being saved, born again,

1016
00:51:11,399 --> 00:51:15,879
cleansed by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ,

1017
00:51:15,879 --> 00:51:19,359
save only to wash his feet.

1018
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:25,039
That daily cleansing for service and fellowship.

1019
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:31,359
Simply because we get dirty in this world. God, would you help us to be clean?

1020
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:34,599
God, we want to have nothing between

1021
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:40,159
our soul and our Savior. We want to be revival ready.

1022
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:43,719
I pray in these moments of invitation that you'd have your will and way.

1023
00:51:43,719 --> 00:51:47,679
God, would you work? We'll give you the glory.

1024
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:48,919
For it's in Christ's name we pray.
