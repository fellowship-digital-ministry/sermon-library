WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.679
6 this evening, Galatians chapter number 6, as we continue with this series of the danger

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:09.439
of deception.

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:15.680
And the reality is, it seems as if with each passing day, we are more and more convinced

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.440
of that truth that I stated at the beginning of this series several weeks ago, that we

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.100
are living in an age of deception.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.719
We find here in Galatians chapter number 6, the portion of Scripture that we'll look at

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:33.840
this evening, that once again we see the verse of Scripture begin with that great statement,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.659
be not deceived.

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:40.080
It's interesting because in the book of Amos, and if you want to turn back to the Old Testament,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.400
to the prophets there, and look at the book of Amos, and I want you to consider what is

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:52.659
said here with regard to this prophecy that is told to us in Amos chapter number 8.

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:57.540
And the Bible tells us here in Amos chapter number 8 that there was going to be a famine

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:04.440
and it says this in Amos 8 and verse number 11, it's 11 and 12, Amos says this under the

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.160
inspiration of God, of course,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.959
Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:17.639
a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water.

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:25.580
But notice what it says, but of hearing the words of the Lord.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.519
And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east.

00:01:30.519 --> 00:01:35.160
They shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.819
It's interesting that it says at the end of verse number 11 that this famine in which

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:44.120
is being discussed is a famine of hearing the words of the Lord.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.500
In 2 Timothy chapter number 4, as Paul is finishing that last letter that he would be

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.400
used of God as the human penman to write, noting, of course, that the time of his departure

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.580
was at hand, but before he gets to that, he gives a charge to Timothy.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.779
The charge that he issues to Timothy is a charge that continues to be given to preachers

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:10.259
to this day, and that is this, preach the word.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:17.259
But in this charge, we find that Paul also reveals to Timothy that the time will come

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.860
in verse 3 of 2 Timothy 4, when they will not endure sound doctrine, but after their

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.759
own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears, and they shall turn away

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:35.399
their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables.

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:41.000
I understand that across the globe this evening, there are plenty of places in which you cannot

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.520
go to a church and hear the preaching of the word of God.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.600
I understand that in various places of the world today that there are not Bibles available.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.479
We just had our scripture assembly, and we heard some of the statistics from Dan Hummel

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.860
with regard to the numbers of languages that are upon the face of the earth and the limited

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.020
number of whole, complete Bibles that have been translated in those languages.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.240
And as you begin to think about that, obviously we understand that there are places around

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.660
the globe in which they cannot hear the preaching of the word of God, they cannot find a Bible.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.179
But I would submit to you this evening that no doubt in this area of the world, in much

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:26.300
of the United States of America, there are churches that are standing and proclaiming

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.339
the truth of God's word.

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:33.899
We find that there are fewer and fewer churches, there are a number of churches that have compromised

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:39.220
and been influenced by the culture and the society, but I am thankful for scores and

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.619
scores of churches across this land that are standing faithfully preaching the word of

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:47.419
God.

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:51.740
The problem is in the hearing.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.899
The time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine.

00:03:55.899 --> 00:04:00.300
There are plenty of people today that are desiring to be entertained.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.820
They are not desiring to go and to hear the teaching and preaching of the word of God.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.779
They simply want to be entertained.

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:13.619
They simply desire to check a box, if you will, that they fulfilled their spiritual

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:19.339
obligations or duties, and it really is just no more than a nominal Christianity.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:21.339
It's in name only.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:26.660
We find that oftentimes there are people that desire the product, but they're not willing

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.980
to endure through the process.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.079
And we find that no doubt as we would consider the warnings or the statements that are given

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:42.579
and you couple those two truths together from Amos 8 and from 2 Timothy 4, and I believe

00:04:42.579 --> 00:04:48.260
as you put those two truths together that it leads to disaster.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.660
And we find that we're living in a time when we could ask ourselves this question as we

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.899
think about this age of deception in which we're living in and the danger of deception,

00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:06.579
we could ask ourselves this question, why does it seem so simple to deceive so many?

00:05:06.579 --> 00:05:09.540
I mean, honestly, we are living in an age of deception.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.820
We encounter people every single day that are just deceived.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:22.179
And we could ask ourselves, why is it that it is so simple to deceive so many people?

00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:27.779
I believe that the answer lies in these two verses or these two passages that we've discussed

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:33.179
here by way of introduction, and that is because truth has been rejected.

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:40.640
There's a society that we're living in that has denied the existence of absolute truth.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:47.260
They would seem to float the idea or to promote the concept that truth is relative, that there's

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.940
your truth and there's their truth and there's my truth and so on and so forth, but the fact

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.459
of the matter is that there is absolute truth and that is found in the Word of God.

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:05.820
But when truth is rejected and when error is… when truth is rejected, then deception

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:14.839
is very easy to creep in and it's very easy to deceive many because of an absence of truth.

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:19.420
As we think about this age of deception, we come again to a passage of Scripture here

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.359
in Galatians 6 where the verse of Scripture begins with, be not deceived.

00:06:24.359 --> 00:06:27.059
Look in verse number 7 of Galatians 6.

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:34.500
That's a familiar verse of Scripture, and the Bible says, be not deceived.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.339
You know, there are warnings that are issued throughout the Word of God.

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:40.700
I'm thankful for the warnings that God gives us.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:47.660
In fact, in the book of Psalms, in the 19th Psalm, as we find that great declaration,

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.820
the law of the Lord is perfect and all that God tells us about the written Word of God,

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:58.220
we find that the text of Scripture in verse number 11 concludes by saying, moreover, by

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:05.700
them is thy servant warned, and in keeping of them there is great reward.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.579
One of the ways in which Paul described the ministry that he'd been given by the Lord

00:07:10.579 --> 00:07:18.459
in Colossians 1 was that it was not only a teaching ministry, but it was a warning ministry.

00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:21.500
He says to the believers in Corinth, I warn you.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.500
Why?

00:07:23.179 --> 00:07:24.179
I warn you.

00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:25.179
Right?

00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:28.700
You see that there are warnings that are given, but unfortunately there are plenty of times

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:33.660
in which warnings are not heeded.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:38.779
We find that you could look at a number of examples throughout history of those that

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:45.179
had been warned of impending danger, and yet they did not take heed to the warning and

00:07:45.179 --> 00:07:47.660
were swiftly destroyed.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:52.779
You ever read about some of those that were warned about the explosion at Mount St. Helens,

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:58.980
the impending eruption, and there were people that did not take heed and they perished in

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.299
that catastrophic event?

00:08:01.299 --> 00:08:02.660
And we could go on and on.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.899
There was a pastor down in the southern part of the country.

00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:11.420
He and his wife were hurrying home after the service to tend to some things that needed

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:17.380
to take place, and there was a train track in between the church house and their home,

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.739
and the bars came down and the lights were flashing, and obviously a warning that there

00:08:22.739 --> 00:08:26.859
was a train that was approaching, and yet the pastor made the decision that he could

00:08:26.859 --> 00:08:33.539
beat the train, and he went around the guardrails that were giving the warning of a train that

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:38.179
was coming, and both he and his wife were killed instantly when that train destroyed

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:41.020
their car.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.539
So the warning that is given, be not deceived, man, when we read those words we ought to

00:08:45.539 --> 00:08:48.099
pay close attention, why?

00:08:48.099 --> 00:08:53.940
Because obviously if the preface to the statement, to the truth that is going to be given is

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:59.619
be not deceived, then we would understand that many are deceived in this particular

00:08:59.619 --> 00:09:01.059
matter.

00:09:01.059 --> 00:09:05.140
As we look at the text of Scripture, I'm simply entitling the message this evening,

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.919
sowing and reaping.

00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:11.979
Sowing and reaping, you notice that truth in verse number 7, be not deceived, God is

00:09:11.979 --> 00:09:18.179
not mocked, for whatsoever man soweth, that shall he also reap.

00:09:18.179 --> 00:09:23.539
We note the problem, the problem is deception, people have been deceived, people will continue

00:09:23.539 --> 00:09:29.820
to be deceived, the warning has been given, yet the deception is very great.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:34.659
We find that he begins and says, be not deceived, notice what he says, God is not mocked.

00:09:34.659 --> 00:09:41.500
See God has established principles within His Word, He has established laws within society,

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:46.719
and we find here that the Scriptures tell us that there is a problem, and it's a problem

00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:47.719
with deception.

00:09:47.719 --> 00:09:54.619
Remember, as we've said in these several messages during this series, that there is a remedy

00:09:54.619 --> 00:09:58.299
for deception, and that's knowing the truth.

00:09:58.299 --> 00:10:00.059
If we know the truth, the truth is the truth.

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:05.059
The truth will not only set us free, but we understand that the truth will enable us to

00:10:05.059 --> 00:10:11.379
guard against and to combat the deception that is so prevalent in our society today.

00:10:11.379 --> 00:10:12.819
Because I know truth.

00:10:12.819 --> 00:10:18.019
And therefore I will not be easily deceived, and we understand that as we look at the entirety

00:10:18.019 --> 00:10:22.579
of verse 7 and 8, the context in which is given here, I believe that there's a direct

00:10:22.579 --> 00:10:28.779
correlation to that which has been provided in Galatians 5, 16 through 26, when he speaks

00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:32.299
about walking in the Spirit so that you would not fulfill the lust of the flesh, and then

00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:37.099
he speaks about the works of the flesh are manifest, and he gives the description as

00:10:37.099 --> 00:10:42.859
to how the works of the flesh are made known, and then he says, but the fruit of the Spirit

00:10:42.859 --> 00:10:47.499
is, and he goes through the fruit of the Spirit, and as we would consider the truth in Galatians

00:10:47.499 --> 00:10:53.859
5 as it applies to the principle that is given here in chapter 6, verses 7 and 8, we find

00:10:53.859 --> 00:10:59.259
that this problem of deception really, it's the idea of thinking that you can get away

00:10:59.259 --> 00:11:02.139
with sin.

00:11:02.139 --> 00:11:10.299
You know, we understand that we live in a society, we live, sin is all around us, and

00:11:10.299 --> 00:11:16.139
I'm thankful that as a child of God that we have been delivered from the penalty of sin,

00:11:16.139 --> 00:11:20.939
and we have the Holy Spirit of God living within us that enables us to be delivered

00:11:20.939 --> 00:11:26.500
from the power of sin, but we still live in this sin-cursed world, we still have this

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.619
flesh, and we still deal with temptation.

00:11:30.619 --> 00:11:36.939
But the reality is that the potential for being deceived with regard to the context

00:11:36.939 --> 00:11:42.419
here is that we can be deceived thinking that we can get away with sin.

00:11:42.419 --> 00:11:50.299
Perhaps somebody would have the idea that no one will ever know.

00:11:50.299 --> 00:11:52.459
Everyone else is doing it.

00:11:52.459 --> 00:11:58.739
Those are statements that are made by individuals that would seek to deceive.

00:11:58.739 --> 00:12:03.779
In fact, as we think about the truth that has been established within these verses of

00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:08.339
Scripture, we understand that, listen, there will be people that will try to deceive us

00:12:08.339 --> 00:12:12.059
in regard to engaging in sin.

00:12:12.059 --> 00:12:15.619
What's the big deal?

00:12:15.619 --> 00:12:20.259
I mean, everyone else is doing it, no one's ever going to know.

00:12:20.259 --> 00:12:25.580
Notice what the book of Proverbs says in Proverbs 1 and verse number 10 when the wise

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:30.059
man Solomon, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, is speaking here, and

00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:32.699
he says in Proverbs 1 and verse number 10,

00:12:32.699 --> 00:12:39.899
My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.

00:12:39.899 --> 00:12:45.259
I would say this as we consider the truth of that verse of Scripture, you can rest assured

00:12:45.339 --> 00:12:51.899
that you will be tempted, you will be enticed to engage in sinful behavior.

00:12:51.899 --> 00:12:57.979
When this happens, when this enticement comes, consent thou not, when that deception comes

00:12:57.979 --> 00:13:03.020
from that individual, that, well, you have liberty.

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.380
People use that terminology.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.539
They take the biblical truth.

00:13:06.539 --> 00:13:13.139
In fact, here in the book of Galatians, Paul has dealt very seriously with the subject

00:13:13.139 --> 00:13:18.179
of liberty, and he talks about liberty, and yes, we're thankful that we have liberty in

00:13:18.179 --> 00:13:23.539
Christ, that we've been delivered from the power and bondage of sin, but liberty is not

00:13:23.539 --> 00:13:25.380
a license to sin.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.660
Liberty is not a license to live however I please.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:34.699
Liberty is not the ability for me to just simply satisfy my flesh.

00:13:34.699 --> 00:13:35.739
That's not liberty.

00:13:35.739 --> 00:13:41.000
That is taking liberty out of context biblically.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.559
In fact, in Galatians 5 and verse 13, this is for brethren.

00:13:44.559 --> 00:13:51.440
We have been called unto liberty, only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh,

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.279
but by love serve one another.

00:13:54.279 --> 00:13:57.399
Well, we don't really have to do that anymore.

00:13:57.399 --> 00:13:59.360
You know, the Bible was written a long time ago.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.199
Things are different now.

00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:04.940
I submit to you this evening that if things were different now and God didn't want us

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:09.419
to follow that which He had given us in His Word, that He would have given us another

00:14:09.419 --> 00:14:10.419
word.

00:14:10.419 --> 00:14:11.419
Amen?

00:14:11.419 --> 00:14:12.419
Is that pretty…

00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:17.419
I mean, it's pretty understandable that if God was changing things so you don't have

00:14:17.419 --> 00:14:21.940
to do these things anymore, this is no longer required, this is no longer the behavior that

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:28.139
pleases me, that God could have given us a different word that would tell us that, right?

00:14:28.139 --> 00:14:30.299
He's eternal.

00:14:30.299 --> 00:14:31.540
He's omniscient.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:38.739
He knows all things, but we find that He's given us a book that is perfect and complete

00:14:38.739 --> 00:14:44.059
and it is to be our guide for living life and we find that others will seek to deceive

00:14:44.059 --> 00:14:45.059
us.

00:14:45.059 --> 00:14:47.019
Listen, the enemy will seek to deceive you.

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:48.419
You know that He is the deceiver.

00:14:48.419 --> 00:14:52.380
You read in Revelation 20 and verse number 10, when He's cast in a lake of fire to be

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:58.540
tormented day and night forever and ever, it talks about the fact that He deceived them.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.540
He's a deceiver.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.419
He's a liar and He has been from the beginning, right?

00:15:03.419 --> 00:15:04.700
What did He say in Genesis 3?

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.859
Yea, hath God said, ye shall not surely die.

00:15:07.859 --> 00:15:10.899
Oh man, your eyes are going to be open, you're going to be like God.

00:15:10.899 --> 00:15:14.980
I mean, all of these things and we find that He's a deceiver.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:21.459
Remember when we first started this particular series, we talked about the fact that Eve

00:15:21.459 --> 00:15:22.459
was deceived.

00:15:22.459 --> 00:15:28.980
This is the oldest tool in the toolbox of Satan, that of deception.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.500
The reality is that we can be deceived ourselves.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:37.619
In 1 Corinthians 3 and verse number 8, the simple statement that is given in Scripture

00:15:37.619 --> 00:15:38.619
where the Bible…

00:15:38.619 --> 00:15:47.019
In verse number 18, excuse me, where the Bible says, let no man deceive himself.

00:15:47.019 --> 00:15:52.660
Let no man deceive himself in 1 Corinthians 3 and verse number 18.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:56.380
If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool that he

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.380
may be wise.

00:15:57.779 --> 00:16:01.540
And he talks about the wisdom of God and how we need God's wisdom.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.059
Let no man deceive himself.

00:16:03.059 --> 00:16:09.059
Listen, we're not seeking to use the world's wisdom, we're seeking to use God's wisdom.

00:16:09.059 --> 00:16:13.820
And we need to know the Word of God and so we see the problem as we begin looking at

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:19.500
these verses of Scripture in Galatians 6, verses 7 and 8, that the problem is deception.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.299
Be not deceived.

00:16:21.299 --> 00:16:26.299
Then God gives us this principle, really principles that are provided to us within the remainder

00:16:26.299 --> 00:16:28.899
of verse 7 and verse number 8.

00:16:28.899 --> 00:16:33.220
This principle or these principles that are given, we've used the title this evening,

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:38.899
sowing and reaping, and we'd understand that this law, if you will, is a self-evident principle

00:16:38.899 --> 00:16:43.619
or law that is revealed and observable in nature.

00:16:43.619 --> 00:16:47.619
We see it all around us, this law of sowing and reaping, right?

00:16:47.619 --> 00:16:52.059
I mean, Dean gave me some peppers on Sunday.

00:16:52.059 --> 00:16:53.459
How did he get those peppers?

00:16:53.619 --> 00:16:59.179
Well, he planted some seeds or he planted a plant that had been germinated from some

00:16:59.179 --> 00:17:03.619
seeds and he put that and he nourished that and he took care of that and then it produced

00:17:03.619 --> 00:17:04.619
fruit.

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:06.399
It provided a harvest.

00:17:06.399 --> 00:17:13.579
We understand it's very simple to observe and understand the truth of sowing and reaping.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:19.220
We know that here in this text of Scriptures, we would think about the natural world and

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.940
the laws that we see in the world.

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:27.339
When Dean gave me those peppers, it's because he planted pepper plants or pepper seeds.

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:34.459
He did not plant tomato seeds or tomato plants and get peppers, right?

00:17:34.459 --> 00:17:36.859
You plant tomatoes, you expect to get tomatoes.

00:17:36.859 --> 00:17:39.100
You plant peppers, you expect to get peppers.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.139
You plant apple trees, you expect to get apples.

00:17:42.139 --> 00:17:43.500
It's pretty simple.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:50.019
We see it observed in nature, but really the context is not dealing with the law in

00:17:50.019 --> 00:17:55.839
nature though that is observable and helps us to understand the truth that has been given,

00:17:55.839 --> 00:17:59.980
but we find that this is given to us with regard to the spiritual world.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:05.419
The Bible says, for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.

00:18:05.419 --> 00:18:11.820
Notice in verse 8, for he that soweth, it begins with a negative example, he that soweth

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:17.339
to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption.

00:18:17.339 --> 00:18:22.619
Remember I mentioned the truth of Galatians 5 verses 16 through 26 a moment ago and how

00:18:22.619 --> 00:18:27.059
that there's a correlation between that portion of Scripture and this truth that is given

00:18:27.059 --> 00:18:30.619
to us in Galatians 6 verses 7 and 8.

00:18:30.619 --> 00:18:36.940
When he's talking about the flesh lusteth against the spirit and this whole process

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:42.940
of crucifying the flesh that is mentioned back in Galatians 2 in verse number 20, and

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:50.580
so I am to die daily, I'm to crucify the flesh as Paul says in Galatians 2.20, but we find

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:55.779
here that it is possible for us to sow to the flesh.

00:18:55.779 --> 00:19:01.460
The Bible says that he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh, what does it say?

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.460
Reap corruption.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.820
That doesn't sound very good, does it?

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.260
That's not the fruit that we want in our lives.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.140
That's not the harvest that we desire.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:16.979
That's not what we desire in our lives, but we find that the principle is given to us

00:19:16.979 --> 00:19:21.239
when we think about the spiritual world, the negative aspect in verse number 8, that he

00:19:21.239 --> 00:19:29.380
that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption, but I'm thankful for this

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:34.099
but in Scripture where the Bible gives us this change in direction.

00:19:34.099 --> 00:19:40.659
He says, but he that soweth to the spirit, these are good seeds that are being planted,

00:19:40.659 --> 00:19:47.940
and it says, but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting,

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:52.380
and we understand the benefit here and the truth that is given.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:57.739
We understand everlasting life is the gift of God with regard to salvation, and it says

00:19:57.739 --> 00:19:58.739
here that he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting, and we

00:19:58.739 --> 00:19:59.739
understand the benefit here and the truth that is given.

00:19:59.739 --> 00:20:00.739
We understand everlasting life is the gift of God with regard to salvation, and we understand

00:20:00.739 --> 00:20:00.739


00:20:00.739 --> 00:20:05.779
shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting." I believe the idea within

00:20:05.779 --> 00:20:09.859
the verse of Scripture, when you make the contrast between that which is the

00:20:09.859 --> 00:20:13.819
result of sowing to the flesh being corruption, that which is sowing to the

00:20:13.819 --> 00:20:19.899
Spirit, you'll reap life everlasting, that good fruit, that reward.

00:20:19.899 --> 00:20:26.019
Remember in Galatians 5 and verse number 22, but the fruit of the Spirit is love,

00:20:26.019 --> 00:20:32.419
joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.

00:20:32.419 --> 00:20:38.979
Against such there is no law. I mean that is a good harvest, that is a

00:20:38.979 --> 00:20:45.219
good yield, that's something that we should desire in our lives. As we think

00:20:45.219 --> 00:20:49.739
about this truth that is provided to us here and we consider the warning that

00:20:49.739 --> 00:20:54.579
precedes the truth that is given, we must take heed to the warning, but we

00:20:54.579 --> 00:20:59.659
give some thought to this truth of sowing and reaping. The reality is that

00:20:59.659 --> 00:21:03.979
often in our lives, and you see it in nature and it's true also in our lives,

00:21:03.979 --> 00:21:12.499
is that you reap more than you sow. You reap more than you sow. In fact, I was

00:21:12.499 --> 00:21:16.579
considering as I was making some preparation for the lesson this evening

00:21:16.579 --> 00:21:22.219
and considering these truths with regard to sowing and reaping, I did a quick

00:21:22.219 --> 00:21:27.499
internet search. I am not a farmer, I am not the son of a farmer. My brother asked

00:21:27.499 --> 00:21:32.299
me the other day if I wanted to buy a farm, and I thought, man, you got how many

00:21:32.299 --> 00:21:35.179
years left in the Marine Corps, you want to buy a farm together so I can do some

00:21:35.179 --> 00:21:39.739
work or what? What's going on here, right? And Julianna said, I'm out, I don't want

00:21:39.739 --> 00:21:43.539
anything to do with a farm, but the reality is I'm not a farmer, so I don't

00:21:43.539 --> 00:21:47.939
know, and I just did a quick internet search, and if you want to plant some

00:21:47.939 --> 00:21:54.059
corn and you want to have a harvest of corn, they say that in each hole you put

00:21:54.059 --> 00:22:01.059
two to three seeds. And you really only need one, but they say to put two or

00:22:01.059 --> 00:22:05.939
three seeds, and as you put those two or three seeds, then you will have a corn

00:22:05.939 --> 00:22:12.019
stalk that should grow with all of the right care and so on and so forth, and

00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:19.539
that stalk of corn will have two to four ears of corn on average on that single

00:22:19.539 --> 00:22:29.499
stalk. And they say that each ear of corn has approximately 600 kernels. So you

00:22:29.499 --> 00:22:34.979
just do some quick math from a couple of seeds, a couple of kernels, even on the

00:22:34.979 --> 00:22:41.019
low end of only two ears of corn being on that single stalk, you use on the high

00:22:41.019 --> 00:22:53.019
end three kernels and you get 1,200. Or you get three and you get 2,400. Typically

00:22:53.019 --> 00:23:00.179
you sow, excuse me, you reap more than you sow. You reap more than you sow. We see

00:23:00.179 --> 00:23:06.859
that in nature, but oftentimes we don't really allow the truth of nature to

00:23:06.859 --> 00:23:11.419
impact us when we think about the spiritual aspect of it. I mentioned

00:23:11.419 --> 00:23:15.699
Psalm 19 a few moments ago, and you think about the law of the Lord is perfect

00:23:15.699 --> 00:23:20.179
enduring forever and all of that context there in verses 10 through, excuse me, I

00:23:20.179 --> 00:23:23.819
think it's 7 through 11, but really before you get to that, you know what the

00:23:23.819 --> 00:23:27.459
Bible says in Psalm 19? The heavens declare the glory of God. The firmament

00:23:27.459 --> 00:23:31.619
showeth forth his handiwork. You know, many times when the Lord Jesus Christ

00:23:31.619 --> 00:23:36.219
walked upon the earth, he used parables, and he would reference various things

00:23:36.499 --> 00:23:40.259
that people could see in nature that they could understand, and he would then

00:23:40.259 --> 00:23:44.539
give them from that natural occurrence, he would provide them with a spiritual

00:23:44.539 --> 00:23:50.099
truth. And so when we think about this principle, this law of sowing and reaping,

00:23:50.099 --> 00:23:54.819
we understand even by nature that you reap more than you sow, and yet for some

00:23:54.819 --> 00:23:58.699
reason when we think about the life that we're living and we think about

00:23:58.699 --> 00:24:03.379
our walk with God and we consider the thought of this passage of

00:24:03.379 --> 00:24:06.139
Scripture, and there are many that have been deceived thinking that they can

00:24:06.139 --> 00:24:10.819
get away with it, that God's okay with sin, that whatever the thoughts

00:24:10.819 --> 00:24:15.379
are, whoever, everybody is doing it, this is the acceptable thing that we can do

00:24:15.379 --> 00:24:21.779
now, so on and so forth, we fail to recognize that often you reap more than

00:24:21.779 --> 00:24:27.259
you sow. Say, man, why am I dealing with all of these things? Why is all of this

00:24:27.259 --> 00:24:31.660
stuff going on? You reap more than you sow. I know that I've used the quote

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:36.139
before that many times, I don't remember who it was, a preacher of yesteryear, he

00:24:36.139 --> 00:24:40.739
said that too many of God's people are sowing seeds to the flesh six days a

00:24:40.739 --> 00:24:44.859
week and they show up to church on Sunday and pray for crop failure. And

00:24:44.859 --> 00:24:49.739
that's just not going to happen. Why? Because God has given a principle or a

00:24:49.739 --> 00:24:55.019
law. And we think about this truth this evening, see what happens sometimes is we

00:24:55.019 --> 00:24:59.779
don't, and it leads me to my final thought tonight, and here's the thought

00:24:59.819 --> 00:25:06.419
and I'll mention what I was gonna say, oftentimes reaping isn't immediate, right?

00:25:06.419 --> 00:25:12.940
We see that in nature, but we see it spiritually as well. And sometimes what

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:18.339
happens with this thing of deception is we we get deceived by the enemy or by

00:25:18.339 --> 00:25:23.819
someone else or even perhaps by our own self-deception and we engage in

00:25:23.819 --> 00:25:27.059
something that we know we ought not engage in, we think that we can get away

00:25:27.139 --> 00:25:31.899
with sin, and then God doesn't like strike us with a bolt of lightning and

00:25:31.899 --> 00:25:37.940
things don't just fall apart immediately, and then the deception continues to

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:46.380
having this thought, well, I guess God's okay with it. Because nothing happened. Is

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:56.660
God ever okay with sin? No. God is never okay with sin. And what happens is we

00:25:57.139 --> 00:26:02.940
minimize the truth that God has given us in his Word that he's long-suffering. We

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.500
minimize the truth that he's given us in his Word that he's loving and he's

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:13.259
gracious and he's kind and he's slow to wrath. Aren't you thankful for that? Amen?

00:26:13.259 --> 00:26:17.000
Remember the disciples? They were dealing with some problems. They said,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.479
you want us to call down fire from heaven like Elijah did? I mean, they're

00:26:20.479 --> 00:26:25.380
ready to just, you ever feel like you could do that? Amen? He said, man, if I were

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:33.139
God, I'd smite these people. God is long-suffering. He is slow to wrath. And

00:26:33.139 --> 00:26:38.619
what happens, that thing of deception creeps in. That's why he says, be not

00:26:38.619 --> 00:26:45.380
deceived. Because we sow to the flesh and nothing really happens. We don't see any

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:50.940
immediate consequences and the the devil gets in there and continues to raise

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:55.859
the level of deception. We think, well, this must be okay. God must be okay with

00:26:55.859 --> 00:27:05.339
this. God is never okay with it. See, often reaping isn't immediate. This is true in

00:27:05.339 --> 00:27:10.779
the natural world. Dean, you gave me pepper, you didn't give the peppers to Holly, but

00:27:10.779 --> 00:27:16.059
you gave the peppers to Holly on Sunday. When did you plant those plants? Roughly.

00:27:16.059 --> 00:27:25.339
When? I said roughly. He said, bam, June 14th. And so, June 14th, it was October 24th

00:27:25.339 --> 00:27:31.259
on Sunday when he gave me those plants. And so, three months and ten days, about a

00:27:31.259 --> 00:27:37.699
hundred days, roughly, that it took from the time of planting to the time of

00:27:37.699 --> 00:27:43.299
reaping. And that's just a simple pepper plant. Do you know that the average apple

00:27:43.299 --> 00:27:50.579
tree, the standard size apple tree, can take up to eight years to bear fruit? Up to eight

00:27:50.579 --> 00:27:56.500
years to bear fruit. And we could just go on and on with examples from nature and we

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.739
could look at all of these things and say, man, look at how long this stuff takes. I

00:27:59.739 --> 00:28:05.059
mean, listen, it would be foolish of me, of the individual that wants to have a garden

00:28:05.059 --> 00:28:10.339
in his backyard and just have a few fresh vegetables, or even of the farmer of the thousand

00:28:10.339 --> 00:28:18.579
acres of farmland that he has to sow the seed on a Monday and go out on Tuesday expecting

00:28:18.579 --> 00:28:27.779
to have a harvest. It just would be nonsense, right? You sit down at the local establishment,

00:28:27.779 --> 00:28:33.260
whatever, there's a breakfast place or a general store, and you sit around. And on

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:37.419
Monday morning, hey, what are you guys doing today? I'm planting my crops. I'm getting

00:28:37.419 --> 00:28:40.700
the seed in the ground. Oh, man, it's wonderful. It's that time of year, you know, so on and

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.580
so forth. And then Tuesday morning, you're at the same meeting place. Boys, what are

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:48.219
you doing today? I'm going to go get my harvest. They'd all look at the individual like he

00:28:48.219 --> 00:28:56.380
was nuts. It just doesn't happen that way. Now, the reality is that sometimes spiritually

00:28:56.380 --> 00:29:06.979
there is reaping right away. But oftentimes, the reaping isn't immediate. And so when we

00:29:06.979 --> 00:29:12.539
understand these truths that God gives us through nature, coupled with the biblical

00:29:12.539 --> 00:29:17.940
principles that He provides us with here in His Word, we must take heed to that warning

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:25.200
that begins in verse number seven, be not deceived. I don't want to be deceived into

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:31.119
thinking that I can sow to my flesh, and that there's not going to be any consequences

00:29:31.119 --> 00:29:36.080
of that. It's just going to be an isolated incident. It's just going to be an isolated

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:44.359
situation, and there are going to be no other consequences. No, you sow to the flesh. According

00:29:44.359 --> 00:29:52.320
to what we read in verse number eight, of the flesh, you shall reap corruption. We need

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:59.359
to plant, sow good seeds. He that soweth to the Spirit, planting and sowing the good seeds.

00:29:59.359 --> 00:30:06.439
the good seeds and taking heed to the Word of God that He's provided us with and understanding

00:30:06.439 --> 00:30:08.119
that there are some things.

00:30:08.119 --> 00:30:13.759
Again, I made the statement last week when we looked at the subject matter of spiritual

00:30:13.759 --> 00:30:19.119
distancing and looking at that truth from 1 Corinthians 15 and verse 33 that evil communications

00:30:19.119 --> 00:30:21.519
corrupt good manners.

00:30:21.519 --> 00:30:26.959
The reality is that God has given us truths within His Word that we need to know and we

00:30:26.959 --> 00:30:32.559
need to apply so that we can say, no, I'm not going to be deceived in this matter.

00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:36.159
The enemy is not going to deceive me, the other people aren't going to deceive me, I'm

00:30:36.159 --> 00:30:43.319
not going to deceive myself, I am going to stand upon the truth of the Word of God.

00:30:43.319 --> 00:30:49.399
I remember as a lost teenager making the statement once to my dad, and he's here, I say once,

00:30:49.399 --> 00:30:54.599
I only remember making the statement once, I may have made it more than once, but there

00:30:54.599 --> 00:31:00.359
was one particular occasion that stands out in my mind, I believe that I was a sophomore

00:31:00.359 --> 00:31:08.559
in high school, and I remember approaching my parents about being able to engage in some

00:31:08.559 --> 00:31:14.279
activity that was taking place and getting an immediate no.

00:31:14.279 --> 00:31:16.499
What kind of deal is that?

00:31:16.499 --> 00:31:22.999
And I replied by saying, well, everyone else is doing it.

00:31:22.999 --> 00:31:26.199
And then the question was, okay, who?

00:31:26.199 --> 00:31:33.319
Well, everyone, literally, I thought I was smart when I was in 10th grade, but that's

00:31:33.319 --> 00:31:37.919
about how it recalls in my mind how that conversation went.

00:31:37.919 --> 00:31:42.279
The reality was that I learned a valuable, I wasn't even saved.

00:31:42.279 --> 00:31:46.759
My parents were saved, but I learned a valuable lesson on that day because I remember my dad

00:31:46.759 --> 00:31:51.559
sitting down and telling me, just because everyone else is doing it doesn't make it

00:31:51.559 --> 00:31:55.679
right for you to do it.

00:31:55.679 --> 00:32:01.399
And we live in a society in which we're pumped with that ideology that, well, it's just what

00:32:01.399 --> 00:32:03.659
everybody does.

00:32:03.659 --> 00:32:04.659
It's just acceptable.

00:32:04.659 --> 00:32:11.879
Nobody does that anymore, that's just, you're so outdated and you're so old school.

00:32:11.879 --> 00:32:18.959
I desire to follow the principles that God has given me in His Word, be not deceived.

00:32:18.959 --> 00:32:28.239
Because God is not mocked, whatsoever man soweth, that shall he also reap.

00:32:28.239 --> 00:32:33.959
Biblical truth, in this age of deception, oh, that God would help us to be on guard

00:32:33.959 --> 00:32:37.999
because there are people that are lying in wait to deceive.

00:32:37.999 --> 00:32:39.399
Father, we love You.

00:32:39.399 --> 00:32:40.819
We thank You for loving us.

00:32:40.819 --> 00:32:42.539
Thank You for Your Word.

00:32:42.539 --> 00:32:46.679
Thank You for the warning tonight, the principle that You've given us of sowing and reaping.

00:32:47.319 --> 00:32:49.799
It's so easy for us to see it in nature.

00:32:49.799 --> 00:32:57.799
It's so easy for us to discuss at great length the examples from nature.

00:32:57.799 --> 00:33:02.959
God, I pray that You'd help us tonight to understand the spiritual implication of this

00:33:02.959 --> 00:33:09.799
passage of Scripture, that You would help us to sow good seed, help us to sow to the

00:33:09.799 --> 00:33:10.799
Spirit.

00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:16.039
Lord, help us to walk in the Spirit, help us to know the Word of God and to apply the

00:33:16.079 --> 00:33:20.399
Word of God in our hearts and lives, that we might be conformed to the image of Christ

00:33:20.399 --> 00:33:22.399
and impact eternity.

00:33:22.399 --> 00:33:28.679
Help us to be guarded against this great deception that's taking place in our society and our

00:33:28.679 --> 00:33:31.919
world today as we live in an age of deception.

00:33:31.919 --> 00:33:34.239
I pray that You'd bless our time of prayer.

00:33:34.239 --> 00:33:37.319
We thank You so much for the privilege of prayer.

00:33:37.319 --> 00:33:41.599
We thank You that You're a God who hears and answers prayer and for the opportunity to

00:33:41.599 --> 00:33:48.599
have this prayer time in our midweek service, where as a body of believers that are assembled

00:33:48.599 --> 00:33:54.599
together, we can engage in corporate intercessory prayer, knowing that the effectual fervent

00:33:54.599 --> 00:33:59.679
prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

00:33:59.679 --> 00:34:03.199
We thank You and love You, for it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
