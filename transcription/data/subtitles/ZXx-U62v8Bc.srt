1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
We must also at the same time acknowledge that in our nation we are facing a crisis.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:12,340
And we're facing a crisis of fatherhood in our land according, and I don't want to be

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,540
super negative this morning, I'm just going to start with some negative just reality of

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,799
what we're dealing with in our nation.

5
00:00:18,799 --> 00:00:24,520
But according to the United States Census Bureau, nearly 18 and a half million children

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,520
will grow up without a father.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,200
18 and a half million children, that's a lot of kids.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,400
And here's the part that was extremely sad to me as I was doing some research on this

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:43,720
subject matter, that we as the United States of America lead the industrialized world in

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,279
fatherlessness.

11
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:49,119
That is not a good category to be at the head.

12
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,119
Would you agree?

13
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:56,000
It's terrible, it's tragic, and it's not something for us to be proud of, but we understand there's

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,200
great spiritual battle that's taking place.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:05,319
We understand as we go to the Word of God that God has instituted the home.

16
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,519
Not only has God instituted the home, but as you study the Word of God you find that

17
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:16,559
the same God who instituted the home has given, has provided us with instruction for the home.

18
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:21,000
He's given us instruction for parents, for fathers and for mothers.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,559
He's given instruction for children and he's provided for us.

20
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:29,800
Not only the home is an institution, but then in his grace and in his mercy he's given

21
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:37,120
us the instruction so that we can have homes where we have God being honored and glorified.

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:43,279
But as we understand that God has instituted and then instructed, we understand that we

23
00:01:43,279 --> 00:01:48,639
have an enemy and the enemy is against everything that God is for.

24
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:54,199
We find that as the enemy is against everything that God is for, that it is abundantly clear

25
00:01:54,239 --> 00:02:00,639
in our nation today that the home continues to be under satanic attack.

26
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:05,000
And we find that the home is under attack, it really is a relentless attack that our

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,960
home is under, and we think about what's taking place and the generations in which have passed

28
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:17,199
in this ongoing attack, this relentless attack upon the home.

29
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,919
As we think about this attack upon the home and we think about the truth that God has

30
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,960
given us in his word, even that wonderful song that the men just sang about faithful

31
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:32,399
men, and I want to preach a message this morning that I've simply entitled, The Kind of Man

32
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:34,080
God is Looking For.

33
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,160
It's very interesting as you study the book of Jeremiah and the book of Ezekiel that you'll

34
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,360
find two comments, and we'll look at both verses this morning, Jeremiah 5 and verse

35
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,779
number 1 and then Ezekiel 22 and verse number 30, where the Bible's speaking about looking

36
00:02:45,779 --> 00:02:51,899
for a man or searching for a man, and we find that God is still today looking for some men

37
00:02:51,899 --> 00:02:53,179
that would be faithful.

38
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:56,339
I'm so thankful for those faithful men that have gone before us.

39
00:02:56,339 --> 00:03:01,940
I'm thankful for the examples that we have of biblical examples of men that have gone

40
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:07,020
before us that stood for what was right, that finished their course, that did what God called

41
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,020
them to do.

42
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,740
I can think about men that God has given me an opportunity to study their lives throughout

43
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:17,380
history, and as you read about their lives and you read about how God's used them, it's

44
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:24,300
encouraging, and then even as we have the opportunity to serve God today, I am thankful

45
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,380
for faithful men.

46
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,699
I am thankful for preachers that are friends of mine.

47
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:35,000
I had some communication with a number of preachers this morning, had a pastor's meeting

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,380
this past Tuesday, and I'm thankful that there's some faithful pastors that are serving God,

49
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,740
that are faithfully preaching the Word of God.

50
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,500
I had some conversation yesterday with Brother Sommerdorf, and he sends his greetings and

51
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,960
they're in Idaho, and he was sharing with me about some churches that are just faithfully

52
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,899
preaching the Word of God in Idaho, and I was encouraged and I'm thankful that there's

53
00:03:57,899 --> 00:04:03,580
some faithful men, but God continues to look for these faithful men, and as we look at

54
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,339
these two comments, these two verses of Scripture from the book of Jeremiah and from the book

55
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:13,779
of Ezekiel, we find that really God gives us, from these couple of verses of Scripture,

56
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:18,940
at least three attributes that we can look to and say, these are the kind of attributes,

57
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:25,660
these are, these are characteristics that should be true in every one of our lives.

58
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,859
And as we begin to look at the verses of Scripture, let me just give you a little bit of background

59
00:04:29,859 --> 00:04:31,540
before we get into it.

60
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,660
We'll deal with Jeremiah first.

61
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:40,779
Jeremiah is prophesying historically on the eve of captivity, the Babylonian captivity,

62
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:42,380
and God has called him to minister.

63
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:47,140
In fact, as you read Jeremiah chapter number one, you read how that God places this call

64
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:53,579
upon Jeremiah, and God lays out the plan that he has for Jeremiah, and God promises him

65
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:59,100
that he'll be with him, and he gives him the encouragement that he needs, and we find that

66
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:05,299
in the next few chapters of the book of Jeremiah, the indictment upon the nation of Judah.

67
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:10,779
It's very interesting as you study the life and the ministry of Jeremiah, he's ministering

68
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:16,820
on the eve of captivity, and his ministry actually begins with King Josiah.

69
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,500
Now during the reign, if you know anything about the nation of Judah and their history

70
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,339
biblically, during the reign of King Josiah, they had great revival.

71
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:29,420
I mean, the word of God was going forth, I mean, it was amazing what was taking place

72
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,540
during the reign of Josiah.

73
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:39,619
He really stands at the top after the divided kingdom of one of the top of the good kings.

74
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:44,540
If you were to put them in any type of order, you'd find Josiah right there near the top,

75
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,399
and God blessed, and God worked, and Josiah was a man that followed the Lord, that trusted

76
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:53,839
the Lord, and God moved and worked in a great way.

77
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,480
After his death, however, it was an extremely rapid decline.

78
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:07,279
There are four kings that Jeremiah would serve under during his ministry.

79
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,920
Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, Jehoiakin, and Zedekiah.

80
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,239
And during the reigns of these men, some of them very short, in fact, as you read the

81
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:22,160
end of 2 Chronicles chapter 36, you begin to see how quickly some of those just reigned

82
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,160
for a very, very short period of time, and you'll see many of the interactions, specifically

83
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,799
with Zedekiah in the book of Jeremiah, but you find that he's preaching, he's ministering

84
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:35,920
on the eve of captivity, in fact, the Babylonians have besieged the city, and God is laying

85
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,640
this indictment against the people of Judah, and he's telling them about impending judgment.

86
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,760
As we begin to think about his ministry and about all that's taking place, we come to

87
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:52,519
the fifth chapter, and we find in verse number one that the Bible says this, run ye to and

88
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:56,480
fro through the streets of Jerusalem.

89
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,320
So you see that he's speaking specific about the city of Jerusalem, and notice what he

90
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:12,940
says, and see now and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man.

91
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:21,059
If there be any that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth.

92
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:27,739
Notice what God says, and I will pardon it, and I will pardon it.

93
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:34,420
We find that Jeremiah is given this instruction, now according to Jeremiah chapter number one,

94
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:39,459
we find that Jeremiah is from Anathoth, according to chapter one in verse number one, and here

95
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:45,220
he's been instructed to go to the city of Jerusalem, particularly the streets of Jerusalem.

96
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:51,899
He's told to go to the broad places, to seek in the broad places, if you can find a man.

97
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:55,899
And here's the two attributes that are given, we'll deal with it in greater detail as we

98
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:57,779
go through the message this morning.

99
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:02,660
If there be any that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth.

100
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,260
Now hold your place here in terms of the book of Ezekiel, if you will, in the 22nd chapter.

101
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:13,059
Now Ezekiel is ministering, he's a prophet of God after the captivity, so some years

102
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:19,480
have passed, he's now ministering and he's preaching to those Jews that are in Babylon

103
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,820
that have been taken and exiled, that are in captivity.

104
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:28,339
We find that God has given Ezekiel great visions, he's given him these prophecies, there's much

105
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:33,820
with regard to future restoration, with regard to the nation.

106
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,700
And we come to this 22nd chapter, and we find that in the preceding verses to the verse

107
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:46,460
that we're going to affix our attention on, that God highlights for the man of God about

108
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,780
the sin of the people.

109
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:54,979
He speaks about the prophets, the priests, the princes, and the people.

110
00:08:54,979 --> 00:08:59,780
And there's a great indictment against these individuals, and we find that as God goes

111
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,780
through beginning in verse number 23 and down through verse number 29, and he deals

112
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,340
with these different categories of people in this great indictment because of their

113
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,140
wickedness and their sin.

114
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,700
And I want you to notice what God says in verse number 30.

115
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:20,460
It says, and I sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in

116
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,539
the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it.

117
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:29,299
Notice what he says, but I found none.

118
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:32,299
Isn't that sad?

119
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:35,659
It's heartbreaking.

120
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:39,299
The people of God had the truth of God's Word.

121
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:43,739
If you go all the way back to the beginning of their entrance into the land of Canaan,

122
00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:47,219
in fact I'll be preaching this evening from the book of Deuteronomy, and you begin to

123
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:51,460
think about their entrance into the promised land, and you begin to think about all that

124
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,299
God had given them, and how God had supplied them, and given them the Word of God, and

125
00:09:56,299 --> 00:10:00,020
given them instruction that would enable them to have eternal life.

126
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,340
if you will, that measure of success

127
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,260
and prosperity in the land.

128
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,180
Remember that God says that specifically to Joshua

129
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,940
in chapter one in verse number eight

130
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,940
about the importance of the word of God

131
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,300
playing a priority in their lives.

132
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,440
But as you study the nation of Israel,

133
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,060
you study the nation of Judah,

134
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,820
you see what happens is they take the word of God

135
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,380
and they set it aside.

136
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,180
They begin to follow after idols.

137
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,860
They begin to follow after the practice of the land.

138
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,360
They begin to follow after the cultures

139
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,180
and the customs and what have you,

140
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,460
and they forsake God.

141
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,160
In fact, the indictment against the nation of Judah,

142
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,060
as Jeremiah would play it out and deal with it,

143
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,620
is that they had forsaken the Lord,

144
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,620
but the forsaking of God started

145
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,940
with a forgetting of who God is.

146
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,740
They forgot, it wasn't that they didn't know who God was,

147
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,780
it wasn't that they did not know

148
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,720
their history or their heritage,

149
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,600
but they simply set it aside.

150
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,060
It's amazing during the times of the judges,

151
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,180
how that you study the portion of scripture

152
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,540
and you see the recurring difficulties

153
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,660
that they deal with in the oppression

154
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,140
and all that takes place,

155
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,600
and how in the depth of their difficulty,

156
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,120
they cry out to God,

157
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,060
and God in His faithfulness and His grace and His mercy,

158
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,500
He would raise up a judge and He would provide deliverance,

159
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,620
but then soon after deliverance,

160
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,780
the nation of Israel would go right again

161
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,620
following after idols.

162
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,820
It is a recurring pattern throughout the Old Testament,

163
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,340
and we find that Jeremiah in chapter number five,

164
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,460
Ezekiel in chapter number 22,

165
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,740
in these two verses of scripture,

166
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,320
we find the kind of man that God is looking for.

167
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,520
Again, at least three attributes

168
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,220
of the kind of man that God is looking for,

169
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,380
beginning with this statement in Ezekiel 22,

170
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,060
if you're taking notes this morning,

171
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,100
number one, God is looking for a man

172
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,500
who will stand in the gap.

173
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,500
He's looking for a man who will stand in the gap.

174
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,140
Now, what does it mean by standing in the gap?

175
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,740
I believe there are at least two ideas or thoughts

176
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,420
that we could give with regard

177
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,640
to what it means to stand in the gap.

178
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,340
It says that He sought for a man among them

179
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:08,100
that should stand in the gap, but He found none.

180
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,660
I hope that it would never be said of us today.

181
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,660
I hope that God could not look over our congregation

182
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,620
or over our nation today and say,

183
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,380
I sought for a man, but I found none.

184
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,500
And God's looking for some individuals,

185
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,000
some people of God who would stand in the gap.

186
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,640
I think that carried in the idea of standing in the gap

187
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,740
is this thought of standing for truth and for right.

188
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,920
Oh, how we need some people to stand for truth and right.

189
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,880
Can I tell you this morning that truth is under attack?

190
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,920
Truth has always been under attack,

191
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,760
but the reality is that truth stands.

192
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,880
There's something amazing about truth.

193
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,280
Truth marches on, truth stands,

194
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,160
and so often they want us to defend truth

195
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,060
while they're following and peddling some lies

196
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,000
and some hypocrisy, but the reality is

197
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,240
that truth just stands on its own.

198
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,560
And we need some individuals,

199
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,220
we need some people of God this morning

200
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,080
that would stand for truth and stand for right.

201
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,160
Can I tell you this morning that if we're gonna stand

202
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,520
for truth, if we're gonna stand for right

203
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,400
in these last days, in these evil days,

204
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,120
we must put on the whole armor of God.

205
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,680
Turn to the book of Ephesians, if you will,

206
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,600
and look at what Paul tells these believers in Ephesus.

207
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,200
And I want you to, we're familiar with the passage

208
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
of scripture, I preached through the book of Ephesians

209
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,720
a couple of years ago on Sunday mornings,

210
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,560
but we come to the end of the book of Ephesians

211
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,280
in this sixth chapter, beginning in verse number 10,

212
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,200
and we begin to see how that God is instructing his people

213
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,240
with the importance of standing

214
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,500
and what is necessary to stand.

215
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,100
Listen, we cannot, we must never try to stand,

216
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,940
in our own strength.

217
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,780
Think about a man that will stand in the gap,

218
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,580
an individual, a child of God that would stand in the gap.

219
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,120
Notice in Ephesians six, beginning in verse number 10,

220
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,820
the Bible says this, finally, my brethren,

221
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,020
be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.

222
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:16,020
Notice verse 11, put on the whole armor of God

223
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,180
that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil

224
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,320
for we wrestle not against flesh and blood,

225
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,020
but against principalities, against powers,

226
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,640
against the rulers of the darkness of this world,

227
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,260
against spiritual wickedness in high places.

228
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,740
Listen, so many people today wanna tell us

229
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,420
that we're in a cultural war.

230
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,940
I want you to understand that we are in a spiritual war.

231
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,380
It is so much greater than a cultural war.

232
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,860
It is spiritual warfare that we're engaged in.

233
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,800
It is the enemy against our wonderful God,

234
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,280
and we find that this spiritual warfare

235
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,720
takes its place in so many different arenas,

236
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,660
but ultimately, we must understand as the people of God

237
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,600
that God has given us his word

238
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,200
and that we are in a spiritual battle.

239
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,420
He continues after he gives this great truth

240
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,800
with regard to the battle that we're engaged in.

241
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,920
He says, wherefore, verse 13,

242
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,100
take unto you the whole armor of God.

243
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,400
Isn't it interesting that he says in verse number 11

244
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,120
to put on the whole armor of God.

245
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,680
Again, in verse number 13, he says,

246
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,120
take unto you the whole armor of God.

247
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,480
Listen, we must put on every piece

248
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,960
of this armor that is mentioned.

249
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,440
We must understand the importance,

250
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,080
the imagery that God has given

251
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,600
with regard to being ready for the battle

252
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,880
that we're engaged in.

253
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,840
He says this, that you may be able to withstand

254
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,440
in the evil day, and having done all to stand.

255
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,880
Stand, therefore, in verse number 14,

256
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,920
having your loins girt about with truth.

257
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,640
Oh, how we need to know the truth.

258
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,840
Oh, how important it is that we know the truth

259
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,360
of God's holy word and having on the breastplate

260
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,080
of righteousness and your feet shod

261
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,740
with the preparation of the gospel of peace.

262
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,040
Above all, taking the shield of faith.

263
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,280
Notice, wherewith you shall be able to quench

264
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,560
all the fiery darts of the wicked.

265
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,400
Not some of them, not most of them,

266
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,320
but all of the fiery darts of the wicked.

267
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,600
And you can rest assured,

268
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,040
you can know with certainty

269
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,920
that he's gonna continue to fire

270
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,560
as many of these fiery darts as he can.

271
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,760
But we have that shield of faith.

272
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,680
The Bible continues and says this in verse 17,

273
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,440
and take the helmet of salvation

274
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,440
and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God.

275
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,140
Oh, I'm so thankful for the whole armor of God.

276
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,000
Every morning of our lives, every day of our lives,

277
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,680
we must take the admonition that God has given us

278
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,040
in his precious word, and if we're going to stand,

279
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,520
if we're going to stand in the gap,

280
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,720
we must put on the whole armor of God.

281
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,800
It'd be foolish to see someone that is in military,

282
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,800
law enforcement, to enter into their workplace

283
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,740
without the proper protection, without their armor,

284
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,380
without the items that have been provided for them

285
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,460
to give them safety, to help them in the line of work

286
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,080
in which they're engaged in.

287
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,340
You think about playing sports.

288
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,300
I played sports as a child, as a teenager,

289
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,020
and in sports, there are pieces of equipment

290
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,220
that you put on to protect yourself,

291
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,820
and playing football, listen,

292
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,740
they never let any of us go out there

293
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,240
without a helmet on and play.

294
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,680
They just didn't do it.

295
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,600
In fact, when I played high school football,

296
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,780
if someone's helmet came off during the play,

297
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,180
they had to sit out of play

298
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,860
and get some kind of equipment manager

299
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,540
to check that thing out to make sure that it was secure,

300
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,140
that they'd be able to play again.

301
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,900
And we find that, listen, as the people of God,

302
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,260
why is it that we would bypass the armor of God

303
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,060
and not understand the importance of what God has given us

304
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,660
that if we're going to stand,

305
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,740
we must put on the whole armor of God?

306
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,860
To stand in the gap,

307
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,220
we must first stand for truth and for right.

308
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,760
And in order to stand for truth and right,

309
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,980
we must have the whole armor of God.

310
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,700
There's a battle that is raging.

311
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,460
God's looking for some people that would stand in the gap,

312
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,060
that would stand for truth and for right.

313
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,060
We find that not only would a man

314
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,020
that would stand in the gap carry with it

315
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,020
the idea of standing for truth and right,

316
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,580
but I believe also it carries with it

317
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,360
the idea of standing as an intercessor.

318
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,660
It's amazing to me,

319
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,140
as you begin to think about the Old Testament,

320
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,739
you begin to think about the example,

321
00:18:37,739 --> 00:18:39,600
I'll just use the example of Moses

322
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,840
and what a great intercessor he was

323
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,640
for the nation of Israel.

324
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,360
I begin to think about the truth

325
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,059
of the passage of scripture here in Ephesians 6,

326
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,080
that we've looked at the whole armor of God

327
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,880
and how that immediately,

328
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,119
it transfers from being the whole armor of God

329
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,860
and putting on the whole armor of God

330
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,880
to the very next verse of scripture in verse number 18,

331
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,520
praying always

332
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:07,520
with all prayer and supplication in the spirit

333
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,160
and watching thereunto with all perseverance

334
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,480
and supplication.

335
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,360
Notice what the last three words of verse number 18 are,

336
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,940
for all saints.

337
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,780
You know what that is?

338
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,360
That's intercessory prayer.

339
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,280
That's praying for the brethren.

340
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,920
And I believe that if we're to stand in the gap,

341
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,500
that we stand not only for truth and right,

342
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,800
but we stand as an intercessor,

343
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,720
that we understand the importance

344
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,440
and the priority of prayer,

345
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,420
that we understand that God has ordained it,

346
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,739
that prayer moves His hand,

347
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:42,739
and we understand as we look to the scriptures,

348
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:44,320
as we look to the word of God,

349
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,340
so many examples of how God intervened

350
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,160
because somebody prayed.

351
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:55,300
Standing in the gap requires

352
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,500
that we'd stand for truth and right.

353
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,260
It requires that we'd stand as an intercessor.

354
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,920
that we would be engaged in intercessory prayer.

355
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,720
I challenged you last Sunday evening

356
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,120
as I passed out a sheet with all of those

357
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,160
that had registered at that point

358
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,620
for Vacation Bible School to take that list

359
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,840
and to pray over those names daily

360
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,780
and to pray for them specifically.

361
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,280
Oh, what a joy it was for me to be able to stand

362
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,840
before those young people on the days that I was here.

363
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,560
I was not here Tuesday for VBS,

364
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,320
but the other four days that I was here

365
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,120
to be able to say, I've prayed for you.

366
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,700
I prayed for you by name.

367
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,520
That we'd stand in the gap.

368
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,020
Standing for truth and for right.

369
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,200
Standing as an intercessor.

370
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,240
We see that God says in the book of Ezekiel

371
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,640
that he sought for a man that would stand in the gap.

372
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,680
Notice in the book of Jeremiah,

373
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,560
we find that he mentions this in Jeremiah five

374
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,620
as he now is giving the instruction in Ezekiel.

375
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,720
He says, I sought for a man here in the book of Jeremiah.

376
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,460
He's telling Jeremiah to run ye to and fro

377
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,280
through the streets of Jerusalem

378
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,460
and see now and know and seek in the broad places thereof

379
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,480
if ye can find a man, if there be any.

380
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,000
Number two, if you're taking notes,

381
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,340
a man who executeth judgment.

382
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,440
A man who executeth judgment.

383
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,400
Someone that would stand in the gap,

384
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,260
but someone that would execute judgment.

385
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,200
As we think about this statement here of scripture,

386
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,340
we would find that here it carries again,

387
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,980
just as we mentioned the two thoughts

388
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,640
with regard to standing in the gap,

389
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,500
I'll give you two thoughts with regard

390
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,180
to executing judgment.

391
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,060
One is this, one who simply does right.

392
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,780
That does right.

393
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,540
You remember that the word of God tells us

394
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,660
in the time of Israel's demise and their departure from God

395
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,480
and their slide into captivity,

396
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,220
that God says that they call evil good and good evil.

397
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,260
In fact, here in the book of Jeremiah,

398
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,140
he talks about how that they were wise to do good,

399
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,380
or to do evil, excuse me, they were wise to do evil.

400
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,460
And you begin to think about the way

401
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,020
in which we see this truth with regard

402
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,020
to one that executeth judgment.

403
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,220
Notice in verse 22 of chapter four,

404
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,020
he says, my people is foolish.

405
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,100
They have not known me.

406
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,900
They're a Sodus children,

407
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,340
and they have none understanding.

408
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,900
They are wise to do evil,

409
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,180
but to do good, they have no knowledge.

410
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,900
Listen, that's not a good thing.

411
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,740
That's not a commendation.

412
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,380
That's an indictment upon the nation of Judah

413
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,340
that they're wise to do evil.

414
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,740
And the reality is that God is saying here

415
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,020
in Jeremiah five, in verse number one,

416
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,920
that he's looking for a man that executeth judgment,

417
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,180
that does the right thing.

418
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,180
One that lives according to the word of God.

419
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,660
One that's taken the truth.

420
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,220
We've already mentioned the book of Ephesians this morning,

421
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,380
but there where God says in the book of Ephesians,

422
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,420
proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

423
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,700
What a joy that God's given us his word,

424
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,460
and we'll speak of that in just a moment.

425
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,420
But we find this morning that the one

426
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,380
that executes judgment is one who's living right.

427
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,380
It's sad to me that so many times,

428
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:24,020
many times I believe that it's inappropriate

429
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,500
to make the accusation,

430
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,900
and at other times it's completely accurate.

431
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,440
That is when the world says of the people of God

432
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,700
that they're hypocritical.

433
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,860
We ought not be hypocrites.

434
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,700
Amen?

435
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,180
We ought to do what's right.

436
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,020
If we say that this book is the sole authority

437
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,620
for our faith and practice, we ought to live this book.

438
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,320
Baptist people throughout the history,

439
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,260
many times they're referred to this way

440
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,820
as people of the book.

441
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,580
What a great way to be referred to.

442
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,700
Well, you just believe that Bible.

443
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,540
I mean, what else do you want me to believe?

444
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,380
Right?

445
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,940
Come on.

446
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,060
What a great statement that someone would accuse us

447
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,460
of just believing the Bible.

448
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,700
I'm thankful for God's word.

449
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,220
And we find here that we must live

450
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,460
according to the word of God.

451
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,660
I find not only when it speaks about executing judgment,

452
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,460
one who executes judgment,

453
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,660
not only living right in their own lives,

454
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,279
but also judging according to the word of God.

455
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,820
Developing a message, someone asked a question

456
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,059
for Sunday evenings on the Ask the Pastor series

457
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:32,660
of some misunderstandings of some verses of scripture,

458
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,700
and one of them that was listed as an example for them

459
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,500
that they wanted me to deal with was the verse judge not.

460
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,820
How many of you hear people say judge not,

461
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,220
and they do it kind of like that, right?

462
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,400
Listen, that's not what the word of God tells us.

463
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,580
It's not that, listen, we judge according

464
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,740
to the word of God.

465
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,420
We can make righteous judgment.

466
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,300
Amen?

467
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,540
Now, the reality is that I better be living by this book

468
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,220
if I'm gonna judge somebody else according to this book.

469
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,700
In fact, that's what bothers us when people wanna execute

470
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,420
and they wanna have you or someone else

471
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,580
live to a certain standard

472
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,380
that they're not willing to live to.

473
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,740
Remember in the book of Romans, Paul says to them,

474
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,300
how is it that you say don't steal, but you're stealing?

475
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,020
That's not how it's supposed to work, right?

476
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,180
Or to live right.

477
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,260
And we find here that he's speaking about the man

478
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,900
that executes judgment, one that's not only living right

479
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,140
and living in their lives according to the word of God,

480
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:33,980
but one who is judging according to the word of God.

481
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,619
Listen, God's word judges.

482
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,900
It just does.

483
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,700
And we can look at the word of God and we can,

484
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,100
people in our society today get upset about it

485
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,160
and we ought to be kind about it.

486
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,660
But notice what the Bible says in Hebrews 4

487
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,500
in verse number 12.

488
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,260
For the word of God is quick, it's alive and powerful

489
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,860
and sharper than a two-edged sword, piercing even

490
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,820
to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit

491
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,320
of the joints and marrow and is a discerner

492
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,619
of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

493
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,540
We judge according to the word of God.

494
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,180
We find this idea of a man who executes judgment.

495
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,360
Let me focus on the first aspect of this,

496
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,100
the one that lives according to the word of God.

497
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,059
Can I tell you this morning, it's not my opinion.

498
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:22,240
It's not your opinion.

499
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,619
It's not the populace.

500
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:26,860
It's not the culture, the society.

501
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,059
It's not the White House, the government, Hollywood,

502
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:32,580
or any other group of people.

503
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,540
It's not social media.

504
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,860
It is not any of those things that determine,

505
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,640
that establish right from wrong.

506
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:46,220
It is God's holy word, period.

507
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,740
Amen?

508
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,720
People want to look at, well, this is what so-and-so said.

509
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,680
What does the Bible say?

510
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,260
By the way, how is it that we know more

511
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,140
about what other people say than what God says?

512
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,339
If we're people of the book, we ought to know

513
00:26:58,339 --> 00:27:00,980
what God says, amen?

514
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,860
And here's what I found in my life.

515
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,619
If you want to do something bad enough,

516
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:06,660
you're going to find a loophole to do it.

517
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,420
Just the way it is.

518
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,200
And you're going to twist scripture any way

519
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,220
you want to twist it to appease your conscience

520
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,779
and make yourself feel good.

521
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:17,420
But listen, this book is true.

522
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,040
Here's what God said, let God be true.

523
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,619
And every man a liar.

524
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,279
That's why I love the fact that part of the responsibility

525
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:30,080
that God's given me as a pastor is to preach the word.

526
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,480
It's awesome.

527
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,800
Someone asked me a number of years ago,

528
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,580
doesn't it get hard coming up with sermons?

529
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,680
Listen, if I had to come up with my own content,

530
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,240
I'd have been done a long time ago.

531
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,320
But I get to preach the word of God.

532
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,580
It's God's word.

533
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:45,559
If you don't agree with it,

534
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:47,880
listen, you're not going to change God.

535
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,160
You better just go ahead and change your thinking about it.

536
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,800
Right?

537
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,360
That's how it works.

538
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,760
It's God's word.

539
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,680
Listen, morals, morals are established

540
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,839
by the authority of scripture.

541
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,520
So if you remove the authority,

542
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,140
what happens to the morals?

543
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,279
They just fall apart.

544
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,240
The moral compass of a society void of this book

545
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,839
is really how it summarizes itself in the book of Judges.

546
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:22,119
Every man doeth that which is right

547
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:24,900
in his own sight, his own eyes.

548
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,740
Right?

549
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,640
Because I'm my authority and you're your authority.

550
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,320
But listen, that's not what God said.

551
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,520
He said, I gave you a book.

552
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,359
I gave you the Bible.

553
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:33,720
I gave you my word.

554
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,440
And morals are established

555
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,600
through the authority of scripture.

556
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,280
So if you remove the authority,

557
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,799
if you remove the standard,

558
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:45,520
it is going to impact the morals of a society.

559
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,119
We see it in our own society today.

560
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:51,119
We see it in the nation of Israel, in Judah.

561
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:53,840
When you begin to read the Old Testament,

562
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,799
you begin to see what's happening, what's unfolding,

563
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:59,080
and you see their departure from the word of God,

564
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,280
and you see that it has a direct correlation

565
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,239
to the moral compass of the day.

566
00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:06,080
Why?

567
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,840
There's a departure from the word of God.

568
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,679
Isn't that amazing?

569
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:11,440
In Josiah's day, when they come back

570
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,280
and the scribes, they say,

571
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,559
we have found the book of the law.

572
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,479
And guess what happens when they read it?

573
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:21,600
Josiah begins to weep, man.

574
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,320
He is just beside himself.

575
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,979
He's hearing what's being read,

576
00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:28,660
and he repents, and he's in sackcloth and ashes,

577
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,940
and he sends to the prophets,

578
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,179
and he's getting some information on what's gonna happen.

579
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:35,820
And because of his response,

580
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,140
because of his humility to the word of God,

581
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,419
in Jeremiah's day, as they read the word of God,

582
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:44,340
there were some that responded appropriately.

583
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,580
But then, remember the king?

584
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,059
He cuts it with his pen knife,

585
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:48,500
and he throws it in the fire.

586
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,679
Begin to think about the moral decline

587
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,479
of the nation of Israel.

588
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:57,559
You think about some of the kings that were wicked.

589
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:59,720
You know what God said to the kings,

590
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,559
before the kings?

591
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,979
In the book of Deuteronomy, there are no kings yet, and we find that God gave the prescription

592
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:09,979
that the king was supposed to write the law of the Lord, and he was supposed to have it

593
00:30:09,979 --> 00:30:11,379
so he could read it.

594
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:16,099
Man, how would that have changed the history of Israel had they followed the commandment

595
00:30:16,099 --> 00:30:18,619
of the Lord?

596
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:20,819
They're not to increase wives unto themselves.

597
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,219
That's what the Bible says specifically about kings.

598
00:30:23,219 --> 00:30:27,619
How many kings can you think of that increased wives to themselves?

599
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:33,099
They just didn't follow the book, and begin to see a moral decline.

600
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:35,619
Guess what they're trying to do to this Bible in our society?

601
00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:40,499
It's outdated, it's irrelevant, we don't need it.

602
00:30:40,499 --> 00:30:46,059
Remove it from school, remove it from here, remove it from there, right?

603
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:47,319
You know, it's a sad thing.

604
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:50,659
You can't read it in school, but they let you read it in prison.

605
00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:56,619
Maybe if they let you read it in school, you wouldn't have as many people in prison, right?

606
00:30:56,619 --> 00:31:04,139
I mean, seriously, the moral compass of a society, the man who executeth judgment, if

607
00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:12,339
we remove the Word of God, if there's no standard, the morals are going to decline, and we see

608
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:17,500
it here in the book of Jeremiah, we see it in Ezekiel, we see it in Israel's history,

609
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:22,299
and we see it in our own land.

610
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:25,199
We need a return to the Bible.

611
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:30,399
Let me say this as we look at Jeremiah chapter 5 and verse number 1.

612
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,239
Not only does he say, if there be any that executeth judgment, but notice the statement

613
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:38,839
that seeketh the truth, and I will pardon it.

614
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:45,319
Number three, if you're taking notes, a man who seeks truth.

615
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:49,919
God's looking for some people, He's looking for some individuals that would stand in the

616
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,479
gap, standing for truth and for right.

617
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:55,479
Standing in the gap as an intercessor.

618
00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:59,279
He's looking for some individuals that would execute judgment, that would live according

619
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,439
to the Word of God, that would judge according to the Word of God, and He's looking for some

620
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:07,319
individuals who would seek truth.

621
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:12,039
Now here's what's such a joy to me of living in the United States of America and speaking

622
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:17,319
the English language, is that God has given us the Bible.

623
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:22,399
We assemble Scriptures, we're part of the Scripture assembly team that they come here

624
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:29,119
once a year and we have opportunity to be engaged in dealing with monthly putting Scriptures

625
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:35,160
together and being aware of places all across the globe where people do not have the Word

626
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,160
of God.

627
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,880
Brother Savalle stood in this very pulpit and he shared with us how that the very first

628
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:47,679
time he was able to stand in his pulpit in Samoa and say to his church, take your Bible

629
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,800
and turn to, and after so many years of ministry for the very first time, he heard the people

630
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,080
turning in their Bibles.

631
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,020
It is said, as I have spoken with Brother Hummel over the years about some of the places

632
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:06,880
in which they have sent the Bibles into, the Scriptures into, John and Romans and other

633
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,720
portions of Scripture, in some of these places around the world where the Bible is not readily

634
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,440
available, you find that it does not collect dust as it does in our day.

635
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,599
It does not collect dust as it does in our land, but we find that there oftentimes they'll

636
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:28,039
take a Scripture that we have spent time to assemble and the very first thing that they'll

637
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:31,279
do with that is they'll take it apart.

638
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,440
You say, well, that's discouraging.

639
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,080
We spent time putting it together.

640
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,599
You want to know why they take it apart?

641
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,919
Because there's not enough for everybody.

642
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,000
So here's what they do.

643
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,399
They take it apart and they say, I'm going to watch these instruments.

644
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:46,639
They say, you take a part and you take a part and you take a part and you take a part and

645
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:50,199
you take a part and I'm going to take a part and after you're done, we're going to just

646
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:51,720
rotate.

647
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:57,720
Can you imagine if you had to read your Bible that way?

648
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,000
Seriously.

649
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,360
Harlan Popov talks about in his book, Tortured for His Faith, he talks about the way in which

650
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,360
the Bible was outlawed.

651
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,520
Listen, they want to outlaw the Bible.

652
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,880
And he talks about his experience.

653
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,080
By the way, it was in the early 1900s.

654
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,160
It's not like it was 500 years ago.

655
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:22,440
It was about 100 years ago, Romania, and he's there and he's faithful.

656
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,519
He's in prison for years, but he talks about the Bible and he talks about having these

657
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:29,040
secret church meetings.

658
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,399
They had to do that for fear of persecution for all that was happening.

659
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:39,880
And by the way, let me say this, in fear of persecution, they met anyway.

660
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:49,079
They gathered anyway, knowing they could die, but knowing that he's worth it.

661
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:56,399
And he tells the story about a young lady that after they would have services, she would

662
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:02,519
say, can I take your Bible with me?

663
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:09,760
And he thought that she was taking that Bible because she wanted to read it.

664
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:13,239
And she would promise repeatedly that I'll bring it back.

665
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,239
And she would.

666
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:17,040
And then she'd ask to borrow it again.

667
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,679
And eventually, Harlan Popov said, what are you doing with the Bible?

668
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:24,720
Are you reading it all night long?

669
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:31,359
She said, no, sir, if I did that, I'd just be able to read it once.

670
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,079
I am making my own copy.

671
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:45,880
She was writing by hand the Scriptures so that she could have the Bible.

672
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,799
Jim Elliot said this, many of you know Jim Elliot, he's famous for some quotes, I'd never

673
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:51,600
heard this one before.

674
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:56,440
But he said this, one of the two indictments that he mentioned against American Christianity

675
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,519
was the dust on our Bibles.

676
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:03,239
Wow, wow.

677
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:09,200
Everyone who seeks truth, to seek to find is the idea of this word, seeketh truth, not

678
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,880
only to seek in order to find, but to desire to have.

679
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,239
Now God's given us the Bible.

680
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:17,720
He's given us truth.

681
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,959
Listen, we can stand up and we can preach messages about why we use the Bible we use

682
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:28,799
and so on and so forth, but the reality this morning is that we need to dig into the Bible.

683
00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:32,760
It's great to know why we use the Bible that we use, but we've got to know the Word of

684
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,760
God.

685
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,279
We need to use it, seek it.

686
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:38,279
Someone that seeks truth.

687
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,279
Let me say this.

688
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:41,359
Turn to the book of Psalms, if you will.

689
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,279
Make a couple of statements from the book of Psalms.

690
00:36:43,279 --> 00:36:44,279
Psalm 19.

691
00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:49,380
We'll look at Psalm 19 and Psalm 119, two wonderful passages of Scriptures with regard

692
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,380
to the Word of God.

693
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:54,320
We'll have to skip a couple of references here this morning, but let me start here in

694
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,239
Psalm 19 in verse number 7.

695
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:59,519
Notice how the Bible describes itself here.

696
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:05,040
The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.

697
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,839
Peter would say this, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, being born again,

698
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:12,359
not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the Word of God that liveth and abideth

699
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:13,359
forever.

700
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,040
The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.

701
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,320
Notice the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.

702
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,600
The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart.

703
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,720
The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.

704
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,639
The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever.

705
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:32,239
The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.

706
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:41,399
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold, sweeter also than honey

707
00:37:41,399 --> 00:37:42,399
and the honeycomb.

708
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:49,279
Moreover, by them is thy servant warned, and in keeping of them there is great reward.

709
00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:54,040
Many today are desiring gold, rich as wealth.

710
00:37:54,040 --> 00:38:00,160
And here the Word of God says of itself, more to be desired are they than gold, yea,

711
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,079
than much fine gold.

712
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:08,399
We find that in Psalm 119, I want you to notice the expression that is used every time I read

713
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:09,639
this verse of Scripture.

714
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:12,119
I'm just encouraged and challenged.

715
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:16,519
In Psalm 119, of course, the entirety of the passage deals with the Word of God, but I

716
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:21,799
want you to notice this imagery that is painted for us in verse number 162 with regard to

717
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,880
the rejoicing at thy word.

718
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,799
Notice what the Bible says, it's amazing.

719
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:31,919
The Word of God says this, I rejoice at thy word, and here's the manner in which I rejoice.

720
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:40,719
This is the imagery that God is giving us, as one that findeth great spoil.

721
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:41,960
You get that this morning?

722
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,880
I rejoice at thy word, and this is the manner by which I rejoice.

723
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,239
This is the fashion of my rejoicing.

724
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:55,599
This is the imagery that God gives us as one that findeth great spoil.

725
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,380
Listen, there's some people today that would rejoice for great spoil, but couldn't care

726
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,479
less about the Word of God.

727
00:39:01,479 --> 00:39:06,679
Oh, one that seeketh truth.

728
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:12,479
The book of Proverbs says this, and it's a very familiar verse of Scripture in Proverbs

729
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:21,960
23, in verse number 23, buy the truth and sell it not.

730
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,320
Also wisdom and instruction and understanding.

731
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,000
I'm thankful that Jesus Christ Himself is truth.

732
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,479
He said this in John 14, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

733
00:39:34,479 --> 00:39:36,919
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

734
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:39,400
I'm thankful that the Word of God is truth.

735
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,880
He says in John chapter number 17, just a few chapters later, he says this, sanctify

736
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,479
them through thy word, thy word is truth.

737
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:51,599
I'm thankful for the example, as you look to the Old Testament, you begin to think about

738
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:57,599
those that sought truth, and I want you to think about what is said of Ezra, where the

739
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,279
Bible says this.

740
00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:00,599
The Bible describes Ezra.

741
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:05,439
being a ready scribe. The Bible describes Ezra as being a man that was used of the

742
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:08,959
Lord in a great way, but I want you to understand that the Bible gives us some

743
00:40:08,959 --> 00:40:15,399
insight to the heart and the desire of this man, Ezra. The Bible says that Ezra

744
00:40:15,399 --> 00:40:23,479
prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord. Man, God says, see if you can

745
00:40:23,479 --> 00:40:30,199
find a man who seeks truth. Ezra, during his time in his life, the Bible says of

746
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:36,319
him that he had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, but not just to

747
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:42,319
seek the law of the Lord, but the Bible says to do it. Remember that execute at

748
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,559
the judgment? Listen, we're not seeking the law of the Lord so that we can tell

749
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:50,379
everybody else what to do, so that we can use it as a way of correcting somebody

750
00:40:50,379 --> 00:40:55,259
else. No, no, we're seeking the law of the Lord first and foremost to influence my

751
00:40:55,259 --> 00:41:00,379
own life, that I would take the Word of God, and as I seek the truth, and I'm

752
00:41:00,379 --> 00:41:07,419
going to live the truth, and then I'm gonna stand for truth. As we think

753
00:41:07,419 --> 00:41:11,819
about the life of Ezra, it says that he prepared his heart to seek the law

754
00:41:11,819 --> 00:41:17,339
of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.

755
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:21,579
And he didn't want to just know it for himself and apply it for himself. He

756
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:25,619
wanted to teach it to others. You know, God gave him the opportunity to do that.

757
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:29,459
If you keep reading the book of Ezra, you see how God would use him in a great way

758
00:41:29,459 --> 00:41:33,619
to be able to teach the Word of God. This morning, as we look at these two

759
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:38,539
verses of Scripture, as we think about the kind of man that God is seeking for,

760
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:42,859
looking for, I would say this morning that really the truth of these three

761
00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:48,819
thoughts this morning are applicable to every one of us as a child of God. And I

762
00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:51,099
would submit to you that as we've looked at them in this order this

763
00:41:51,099 --> 00:41:56,539
morning, number one, that one that would stand in the gap, one that would stand

764
00:41:56,539 --> 00:42:02,139
for truth and for right, one that would stand as an intercessor. As we notice,

765
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:07,339
number two, a man who executeth judgment, someone who lives according to the Word

766
00:42:07,339 --> 00:42:12,419
of God, someone who judges according to the Word of God, and then finally this

767
00:42:12,419 --> 00:42:16,739
morning, one who seeks the truth. Can I say it this way this morning? It really

768
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:23,699
works well in reverse order. If you seek the truth, God said, if you seek me,

769
00:42:23,699 --> 00:42:28,939
you'll find me. Listen, I believe with all of my heart this morning that if you

770
00:42:28,939 --> 00:42:33,579
want to know the truth, God will reveal it to you. Historically, you look at the

771
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:38,539
Word of God, He's always done that. I've had people tell me over the years, I'm

772
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:42,499
just looking for truth. I said, well, that's a wonderful place to be because

773
00:42:42,499 --> 00:42:46,979
if you're looking for truth and you're sincere, God will show it to you if you

774
00:42:46,979 --> 00:42:50,299
really want the truth. If you're just looking for something to make you feel

775
00:42:50,299 --> 00:42:56,139
good, it's another story. But if you're really seeking truth, God will show it to

776
00:42:56,139 --> 00:43:04,099
you. He'll reveal it to you. And as we seek truth, we must live that truth.

777
00:43:04,099 --> 00:43:10,779
Executeth judgment. We live by the truth that we've sought. We're doing it. And

778
00:43:11,539 --> 00:43:14,979
then we're standing in the gap. What are we standing for? We're standing for truth

779
00:43:14,979 --> 00:43:22,339
and for right. We're standing as an intercessor. This morning, as we look at

780
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:28,099
these thoughts from Jeremiah and Ezekiel, I hope this morning that we'd say, I want

781
00:43:28,099 --> 00:43:33,419
those characteristics, I want those attributes in my life. I want to be an

782
00:43:33,419 --> 00:43:38,219
individual that if God were looking for someone to stand in the gap, that I'm

783
00:43:38,259 --> 00:43:41,859
standing in the gap, that I'm standing for truth and for right, that I'm

784
00:43:41,859 --> 00:43:45,779
standing as an intercessor. If God's looking for someone that executeth

785
00:43:45,779 --> 00:43:49,779
judgment, that He can look at my life and He can see an individual that's living

786
00:43:49,779 --> 00:43:55,539
according to the Word of God, that's judging according to the Word of God, not

787
00:43:55,539 --> 00:44:01,019
allowing the culture, the populace, the social media, the opinion of my neighbor,

788
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:07,619
the opinion of myself, the opinion of my spouse to determine right and wrong. But

789
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:13,299
this book, we execute judgment. And if He's looking for someone that seeks

790
00:44:13,299 --> 00:44:21,459
truth, what do you say of us? They seek truth. They're seeking it. They're seeking

791
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:30,179
daily for truth. They've prepared their heart to seek the law of the Lord. God

792
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:35,859
says to Ezekiel, I found none. If you can continue reading Jeremiah 5, he didn't

793
00:44:35,859 --> 00:44:44,459
find any in the streets of Jerusalem. How sad. This morning, I want to be that

794
00:44:44,459 --> 00:44:49,219
kind of a person. I want to be that kind of a believer. God's still looking for

795
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:53,579
some people that would follow these three, that would have these three

796
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:57,259
attributes in their lives, these characteristics. Let's pray. Father, we

797
00:44:57,259 --> 00:45:04,419
love You. Oh, how we thank You for loving us. I thank You for Your precious Word. I

798
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:14,059
thank You for the challenge You've given to me personally. I trust that the Holy

799
00:45:14,059 --> 00:45:25,299
Spirit of God has used the Word of God this morning to convict, to encourage. God,

800
00:45:25,299 --> 00:45:28,739
I know that there are folks that are standing for right and truth, that are

801
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:33,179
standing as intercessors, that are living according to the Word of God, judging

802
00:45:33,179 --> 00:45:37,179
according to the Word of God, that are seeking Your face daily, seeking truth

803
00:45:37,179 --> 00:45:45,499
daily. God, I pray that You'd encourage them. Help them to understand that You're

804
00:45:45,499 --> 00:45:52,219
pleased with that behavior. God, would You help them to be encouraged to continue,

805
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:59,219
to not grow weary in well-doing as we see the encouragement to the brethren

806
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:08,419
in the region of Galatia? Father, perhaps this morning there's one who would

807
00:46:08,419 --> 00:46:16,099
acknowledge before You that there's some deficiencies. God, would You help us to

808
00:46:16,099 --> 00:46:25,419
get it right? Would You help us to respond as Josiah did, with a tender heart? God,

809
00:46:25,499 --> 00:46:29,219
we pray that You'd use us, help us to be aware of the fact that we're engaged in

810
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:36,539
spiritual battle, spiritual warfare, that we need the whole armor of God. I pray

811
00:46:36,539 --> 00:46:40,499
that in the moments of this invitation this morning, as Kimberly will play, Lord,

812
00:46:40,499 --> 00:46:46,099
I pray that You'd move and work. I pray that You'd seal each decision. We'll thank

813
00:46:46,099 --> 00:46:48,859
You for what You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would You stand

814
00:46:48,859 --> 00:46:53,379
with me? Heads are bowed, our eyes are closed. Have a moment of invitation. Give

815
00:46:53,379 --> 00:46:57,819
you an opportunity this morning to respond as the Holy Spirit of God has

816
00:46:57,819 --> 00:47:02,379
used His Word to minister in your heart and life. As Kimberly plays, the altar is

817
00:47:02,379 --> 00:47:04,779
open.
