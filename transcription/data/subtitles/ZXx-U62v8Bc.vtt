WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760
We must also at the same time acknowledge that in our nation we are facing a crisis.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.340
And we're facing a crisis of fatherhood in our land according, and I don't want to be

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.540
super negative this morning, I'm just going to start with some negative just reality of

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.799
what we're dealing with in our nation.

00:00:18.799 --> 00:00:24.520
But according to the United States Census Bureau, nearly 18 and a half million children

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.520
will grow up without a father.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.200
18 and a half million children, that's a lot of kids.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.400
And here's the part that was extremely sad to me as I was doing some research on this

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:43.720
subject matter, that we as the United States of America lead the industrialized world in

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.279
fatherlessness.

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:49.119
That is not a good category to be at the head.

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:50.119
Would you agree?

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:56.000
It's terrible, it's tragic, and it's not something for us to be proud of, but we understand there's

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.200
great spiritual battle that's taking place.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.319
We understand as we go to the Word of God that God has instituted the home.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:09.519
Not only has God instituted the home, but as you study the Word of God you find that

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:16.559
the same God who instituted the home has given, has provided us with instruction for the home.

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:21.000
He's given us instruction for parents, for fathers and for mothers.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.559
He's given instruction for children and he's provided for us.

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:29.800
Not only the home is an institution, but then in his grace and in his mercy he's given

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:37.120
us the instruction so that we can have homes where we have God being honored and glorified.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.279
But as we understand that God has instituted and then instructed, we understand that we

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:48.639
have an enemy and the enemy is against everything that God is for.

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:54.199
We find that as the enemy is against everything that God is for, that it is abundantly clear

00:01:54.239 --> 00:02:00.639
in our nation today that the home continues to be under satanic attack.

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:05.000
And we find that the home is under attack, it really is a relentless attack that our

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.960
home is under, and we think about what's taking place and the generations in which have passed

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.199
in this ongoing attack, this relentless attack upon the home.

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:21.919
As we think about this attack upon the home and we think about the truth that God has

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:26.960
given us in his word, even that wonderful song that the men just sang about faithful

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.399
men, and I want to preach a message this morning that I've simply entitled, The Kind of Man

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:34.080
God is Looking For.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.160
It's very interesting as you study the book of Jeremiah and the book of Ezekiel that you'll

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.360
find two comments, and we'll look at both verses this morning, Jeremiah 5 and verse

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.779
number 1 and then Ezekiel 22 and verse number 30, where the Bible's speaking about looking

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:51.899
for a man or searching for a man, and we find that God is still today looking for some men

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:53.179
that would be faithful.

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:56.339
I'm so thankful for those faithful men that have gone before us.

00:02:56.339 --> 00:03:01.940
I'm thankful for the examples that we have of biblical examples of men that have gone

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.020
before us that stood for what was right, that finished their course, that did what God called

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.020
them to do.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.740
I can think about men that God has given me an opportunity to study their lives throughout

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.380
history, and as you read about their lives and you read about how God's used them, it's

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.300
encouraging, and then even as we have the opportunity to serve God today, I am thankful

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.380
for faithful men.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.699
I am thankful for preachers that are friends of mine.

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:35.000
I had some communication with a number of preachers this morning, had a pastor's meeting

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.380
this past Tuesday, and I'm thankful that there's some faithful pastors that are serving God,

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.740
that are faithfully preaching the Word of God.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.500
I had some conversation yesterday with Brother Sommerdorf, and he sends his greetings and

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.960
they're in Idaho, and he was sharing with me about some churches that are just faithfully

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.899
preaching the Word of God in Idaho, and I was encouraged and I'm thankful that there's

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:03.580
some faithful men, but God continues to look for these faithful men, and as we look at

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.339
these two comments, these two verses of Scripture from the book of Jeremiah and from the book

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:13.779
of Ezekiel, we find that really God gives us, from these couple of verses of Scripture,

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:18.940
at least three attributes that we can look to and say, these are the kind of attributes,

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.660
these are, these are characteristics that should be true in every one of our lives.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.859
And as we begin to look at the verses of Scripture, let me just give you a little bit of background

00:04:29.859 --> 00:04:31.540
before we get into it.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.660
We'll deal with Jeremiah first.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.779
Jeremiah is prophesying historically on the eve of captivity, the Babylonian captivity,

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:42.380
and God has called him to minister.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.140
In fact, as you read Jeremiah chapter number one, you read how that God places this call

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:53.579
upon Jeremiah, and God lays out the plan that he has for Jeremiah, and God promises him

00:04:53.579 --> 00:04:59.100
that he'll be with him, and he gives him the encouragement that he needs, and we find that

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:05.299
in the next few chapters of the book of Jeremiah, the indictment upon the nation of Judah.

00:05:05.299 --> 00:05:10.779
It's very interesting as you study the life and the ministry of Jeremiah, he's ministering

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:16.820
on the eve of captivity, and his ministry actually begins with King Josiah.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.500
Now during the reign, if you know anything about the nation of Judah and their history

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.339
biblically, during the reign of King Josiah, they had great revival.

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:29.420
I mean, the word of God was going forth, I mean, it was amazing what was taking place

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.540
during the reign of Josiah.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:39.619
He really stands at the top after the divided kingdom of one of the top of the good kings.

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:44.540
If you were to put them in any type of order, you'd find Josiah right there near the top,

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.399
and God blessed, and God worked, and Josiah was a man that followed the Lord, that trusted

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:53.839
the Lord, and God moved and worked in a great way.

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:59.480
After his death, however, it was an extremely rapid decline.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:07.279
There are four kings that Jeremiah would serve under during his ministry.

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:12.920
Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, Jehoiakin, and Zedekiah.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.239
And during the reigns of these men, some of them very short, in fact, as you read the

00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:22.160
end of 2 Chronicles chapter 36, you begin to see how quickly some of those just reigned

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.160
for a very, very short period of time, and you'll see many of the interactions, specifically

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.799
with Zedekiah in the book of Jeremiah, but you find that he's preaching, he's ministering

00:06:30.799 --> 00:06:35.920
on the eve of captivity, in fact, the Babylonians have besieged the city, and God is laying

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.640
this indictment against the people of Judah, and he's telling them about impending judgment.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.760
As we begin to think about his ministry and about all that's taking place, we come to

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:52.519
the fifth chapter, and we find in verse number one that the Bible says this, run ye to and

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:56.480
fro through the streets of Jerusalem.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.320
So you see that he's speaking specific about the city of Jerusalem, and notice what he

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:12.940
says, and see now and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:21.059
If there be any that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth.

00:07:21.059 --> 00:07:27.739
Notice what God says, and I will pardon it, and I will pardon it.

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:34.420
We find that Jeremiah is given this instruction, now according to Jeremiah chapter number one,

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:39.459
we find that Jeremiah is from Anathoth, according to chapter one in verse number one, and here

00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:45.220
he's been instructed to go to the city of Jerusalem, particularly the streets of Jerusalem.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:51.899
He's told to go to the broad places, to seek in the broad places, if you can find a man.

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:55.899
And here's the two attributes that are given, we'll deal with it in greater detail as we

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:57.779
go through the message this morning.

00:07:57.779 --> 00:08:02.660
If there be any that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.260
Now hold your place here in terms of the book of Ezekiel, if you will, in the 22nd chapter.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:13.059
Now Ezekiel is ministering, he's a prophet of God after the captivity, so some years

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:19.480
have passed, he's now ministering and he's preaching to those Jews that are in Babylon

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.820
that have been taken and exiled, that are in captivity.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:28.339
We find that God has given Ezekiel great visions, he's given him these prophecies, there's much

00:08:28.339 --> 00:08:33.820
with regard to future restoration, with regard to the nation.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.700
And we come to this 22nd chapter, and we find that in the preceding verses to the verse

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:46.460
that we're going to affix our attention on, that God highlights for the man of God about

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.780
the sin of the people.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:54.979
He speaks about the prophets, the priests, the princes, and the people.

00:08:54.979 --> 00:08:59.780
And there's a great indictment against these individuals, and we find that as God goes

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.780
through beginning in verse number 23 and down through verse number 29, and he deals

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.340
with these different categories of people in this great indictment because of their

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.140
wickedness and their sin.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.700
And I want you to notice what God says in verse number 30.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:20.460
It says, and I sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:25.539
the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it.

00:09:25.539 --> 00:09:29.299
Notice what he says, but I found none.

00:09:29.299 --> 00:09:32.299
Isn't that sad?

00:09:32.299 --> 00:09:35.659
It's heartbreaking.

00:09:35.659 --> 00:09:39.299
The people of God had the truth of God's Word.

00:09:39.299 --> 00:09:43.739
If you go all the way back to the beginning of their entrance into the land of Canaan,

00:09:43.739 --> 00:09:47.219
in fact I'll be preaching this evening from the book of Deuteronomy, and you begin to

00:09:47.219 --> 00:09:51.460
think about their entrance into the promised land, and you begin to think about all that

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:56.299
God had given them, and how God had supplied them, and given them the Word of God, and

00:09:56.299 --> 00:10:00.020
given them instruction that would enable them to have eternal life.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.340
if you will, that measure of success

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.260
and prosperity in the land.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.180
Remember that God says that specifically to Joshua

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.940
in chapter one in verse number eight

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.940
about the importance of the word of God

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.300
playing a priority in their lives.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.440
But as you study the nation of Israel,

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.060
you study the nation of Judah,

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.820
you see what happens is they take the word of God

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.380
and they set it aside.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.180
They begin to follow after idols.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.860
They begin to follow after the practice of the land.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.360
They begin to follow after the cultures

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.180
and the customs and what have you,

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.460
and they forsake God.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.160
In fact, the indictment against the nation of Judah,

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.060
as Jeremiah would play it out and deal with it,

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.620
is that they had forsaken the Lord,

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.620
but the forsaking of God started

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.940
with a forgetting of who God is.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.740
They forgot, it wasn't that they didn't know who God was,

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.780
it wasn't that they did not know

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.720
their history or their heritage,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.600
but they simply set it aside.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.060
It's amazing during the times of the judges,

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.180
how that you study the portion of scripture

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.540
and you see the recurring difficulties

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.660
that they deal with in the oppression

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.140
and all that takes place,

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.600
and how in the depth of their difficulty,

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.120
they cry out to God,

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.060
and God in His faithfulness and His grace and His mercy,

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:16.500
He would raise up a judge and He would provide deliverance,

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.620
but then soon after deliverance,

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.780
the nation of Israel would go right again

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.620
following after idols.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.820
It is a recurring pattern throughout the Old Testament,

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.340
and we find that Jeremiah in chapter number five,

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.460
Ezekiel in chapter number 22,

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.740
in these two verses of scripture,

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.320
we find the kind of man that God is looking for.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.520
Again, at least three attributes

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.220
of the kind of man that God is looking for,

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.380
beginning with this statement in Ezekiel 22,

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.060
if you're taking notes this morning,

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.100
number one, God is looking for a man

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.500
who will stand in the gap.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.500
He's looking for a man who will stand in the gap.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.140
Now, what does it mean by standing in the gap?

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.740
I believe there are at least two ideas or thoughts

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.420
that we could give with regard

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.640
to what it means to stand in the gap.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.340
It says that He sought for a man among them

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:08.100
that should stand in the gap, but He found none.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.660
I hope that it would never be said of us today.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.660
I hope that God could not look over our congregation

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.620
or over our nation today and say,

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.380
I sought for a man, but I found none.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.500
And God's looking for some individuals,

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.000
some people of God who would stand in the gap.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.640
I think that carried in the idea of standing in the gap

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.740
is this thought of standing for truth and for right.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.920
Oh, how we need some people to stand for truth and right.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.880
Can I tell you this morning that truth is under attack?

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.920
Truth has always been under attack,

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.760
but the reality is that truth stands.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.880
There's something amazing about truth.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.280
Truth marches on, truth stands,

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.160
and so often they want us to defend truth

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.060
while they're following and peddling some lies

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:59.000
and some hypocrisy, but the reality is

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.240
that truth just stands on its own.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.560
And we need some individuals,

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.220
we need some people of God this morning

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.080
that would stand for truth and stand for right.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.160
Can I tell you this morning that if we're gonna stand

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.520
for truth, if we're gonna stand for right

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.400
in these last days, in these evil days,

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.120
we must put on the whole armor of God.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.680
Turn to the book of Ephesians, if you will,

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.600
and look at what Paul tells these believers in Ephesus.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.200
And I want you to, we're familiar with the passage

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.200
of scripture, I preached through the book of Ephesians

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.720
a couple of years ago on Sunday mornings,

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.560
but we come to the end of the book of Ephesians

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.280
in this sixth chapter, beginning in verse number 10,

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:44.200
and we begin to see how that God is instructing his people

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.240
with the importance of standing

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.500
and what is necessary to stand.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.100
Listen, we cannot, we must never try to stand,

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:53.940
in our own strength.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.780
Think about a man that will stand in the gap,

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.580
an individual, a child of God that would stand in the gap.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.120
Notice in Ephesians six, beginning in verse number 10,

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.820
the Bible says this, finally, my brethren,

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:11.020
be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:16.020
Notice verse 11, put on the whole armor of God

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.180
that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.320
for we wrestle not against flesh and blood,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.020
but against principalities, against powers,

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.640
against the rulers of the darkness of this world,

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.260
against spiritual wickedness in high places.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.740
Listen, so many people today wanna tell us

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.420
that we're in a cultural war.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.940
I want you to understand that we are in a spiritual war.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.380
It is so much greater than a cultural war.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.860
It is spiritual warfare that we're engaged in.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.800
It is the enemy against our wonderful God,

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.280
and we find that this spiritual warfare

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.720
takes its place in so many different arenas,

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.660
but ultimately, we must understand as the people of God

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.600
that God has given us his word

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.200
and that we are in a spiritual battle.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.420
He continues after he gives this great truth

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.800
with regard to the battle that we're engaged in.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.920
He says, wherefore, verse 13,

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.100
take unto you the whole armor of God.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.400
Isn't it interesting that he says in verse number 11

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.120
to put on the whole armor of God.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.680
Again, in verse number 13, he says,

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.120
take unto you the whole armor of God.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.480
Listen, we must put on every piece

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.960
of this armor that is mentioned.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.440
We must understand the importance,

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.080
the imagery that God has given

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.600
with regard to being ready for the battle

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.880
that we're engaged in.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.840
He says this, that you may be able to withstand

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.440
in the evil day, and having done all to stand.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.880
Stand, therefore, in verse number 14,

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.920
having your loins girt about with truth.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.640
Oh, how we need to know the truth.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.840
Oh, how important it is that we know the truth

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.360
of God's holy word and having on the breastplate

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.080
of righteousness and your feet shod

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.740
with the preparation of the gospel of peace.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:05.040
Above all, taking the shield of faith.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.280
Notice, wherewith you shall be able to quench

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.560
all the fiery darts of the wicked.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.400
Not some of them, not most of them,

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.320
but all of the fiery darts of the wicked.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.600
And you can rest assured,

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.040
you can know with certainty

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.920
that he's gonna continue to fire

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.560
as many of these fiery darts as he can.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.760
But we have that shield of faith.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.680
The Bible continues and says this in verse 17,

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.440
and take the helmet of salvation

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:33.440
and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.140
Oh, I'm so thankful for the whole armor of God.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.000
Every morning of our lives, every day of our lives,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.680
we must take the admonition that God has given us

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.040
in his precious word, and if we're going to stand,

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.520
if we're going to stand in the gap,

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.720
we must put on the whole armor of God.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.800
It'd be foolish to see someone that is in military,

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.800
law enforcement, to enter into their workplace

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.740
without the proper protection, without their armor,

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:10.380
without the items that have been provided for them

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.460
to give them safety, to help them in the line of work

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.080
in which they're engaged in.

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.340
You think about playing sports.

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:19.300
I played sports as a child, as a teenager,

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.020
and in sports, there are pieces of equipment

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.220
that you put on to protect yourself,

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.820
and playing football, listen,

00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:27.740
they never let any of us go out there

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.240
without a helmet on and play.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:31.680
They just didn't do it.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.600
In fact, when I played high school football,

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.780
if someone's helmet came off during the play,

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.180
they had to sit out of play

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.860
and get some kind of equipment manager

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.540
to check that thing out to make sure that it was secure,

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.140
that they'd be able to play again.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.900
And we find that, listen, as the people of God,

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.260
why is it that we would bypass the armor of God

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.060
and not understand the importance of what God has given us

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.660
that if we're going to stand,

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.740
we must put on the whole armor of God?

00:17:58.740 --> 00:17:59.860
To stand in the gap,

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:03.220
we must first stand for truth and for right.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.760
And in order to stand for truth and right,

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.980
we must have the whole armor of God.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.700
There's a battle that is raging.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:16.460
God's looking for some people that would stand in the gap,

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:21.060
that would stand for truth and for right.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.060
We find that not only would a man

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.020
that would stand in the gap carry with it

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.020
the idea of standing for truth and right,

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.580
but I believe also it carries with it

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.360
the idea of standing as an intercessor.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:34.660
It's amazing to me,

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.140
as you begin to think about the Old Testament,

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.739
you begin to think about the example,

00:18:37.739 --> 00:18:39.600
I'll just use the example of Moses

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.840
and what a great intercessor he was

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.640
for the nation of Israel.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.360
I begin to think about the truth

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.059
of the passage of scripture here in Ephesians 6,

00:18:48.059 --> 00:18:50.080
that we've looked at the whole armor of God

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.880
and how that immediately,

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.119
it transfers from being the whole armor of God

00:18:55.119 --> 00:18:56.860
and putting on the whole armor of God

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.880
to the very next verse of scripture in verse number 18,

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.520
praying always

00:19:04.739 --> 00:19:07.520
with all prayer and supplication in the spirit

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.160
and watching thereunto with all perseverance

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.480
and supplication.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.360
Notice what the last three words of verse number 18 are,

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.940
for all saints.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:18.780
You know what that is?

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.360
That's intercessory prayer.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.280
That's praying for the brethren.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.920
And I believe that if we're to stand in the gap,

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.500
that we stand not only for truth and right,

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.800
but we stand as an intercessor,

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.720
that we understand the importance

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.440
and the priority of prayer,

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.420
that we understand that God has ordained it,

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.739
that prayer moves His hand,

00:19:39.739 --> 00:19:42.739
and we understand as we look to the scriptures,

00:19:42.739 --> 00:19:44.320
as we look to the word of God,

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.340
so many examples of how God intervened

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.160
because somebody prayed.

00:19:52.619 --> 00:19:55.300
Standing in the gap requires

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.500
that we'd stand for truth and right.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.260
It requires that we'd stand as an intercessor.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:03.920
that we would be engaged in intercessory prayer.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.720
I challenged you last Sunday evening

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.120
as I passed out a sheet with all of those

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.160
that had registered at that point

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.620
for Vacation Bible School to take that list

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.840
and to pray over those names daily

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.780
and to pray for them specifically.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.280
Oh, what a joy it was for me to be able to stand

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.840
before those young people on the days that I was here.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.560
I was not here Tuesday for VBS,

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.320
but the other four days that I was here

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.120
to be able to say, I've prayed for you.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.700
I prayed for you by name.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.520
That we'd stand in the gap.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.020
Standing for truth and for right.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.200
Standing as an intercessor.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.240
We see that God says in the book of Ezekiel

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.640
that he sought for a man that would stand in the gap.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.680
Notice in the book of Jeremiah,

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.560
we find that he mentions this in Jeremiah five

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.620
as he now is giving the instruction in Ezekiel.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.720
He says, I sought for a man here in the book of Jeremiah.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.460
He's telling Jeremiah to run ye to and fro

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.280
through the streets of Jerusalem

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.460
and see now and know and seek in the broad places thereof

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:16.480
if ye can find a man, if there be any.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.000
Number two, if you're taking notes,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.340
a man who executeth judgment.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.440
A man who executeth judgment.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.400
Someone that would stand in the gap,

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.260
but someone that would execute judgment.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:32.200
As we think about this statement here of scripture,

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.340
we would find that here it carries again,

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.980
just as we mentioned the two thoughts

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.640
with regard to standing in the gap,

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.500
I'll give you two thoughts with regard

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.180
to executing judgment.

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:45.060
One is this, one who simply does right.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.780
That does right.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.540
You remember that the word of God tells us

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:55.660
in the time of Israel's demise and their departure from God

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.480
and their slide into captivity,

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.220
that God says that they call evil good and good evil.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.260
In fact, here in the book of Jeremiah,

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:08.140
he talks about how that they were wise to do good,

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:11.380
or to do evil, excuse me, they were wise to do evil.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.460
And you begin to think about the way

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.020
in which we see this truth with regard

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.020
to one that executeth judgment.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.220
Notice in verse 22 of chapter four,

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.020
he says, my people is foolish.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.100
They have not known me.

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.900
They're a Sodus children,

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.340
and they have none understanding.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.900
They are wise to do evil,

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.180
but to do good, they have no knowledge.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:33.900
Listen, that's not a good thing.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.740
That's not a commendation.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.380
That's an indictment upon the nation of Judah

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.340
that they're wise to do evil.

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.740
And the reality is that God is saying here

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.020
in Jeremiah five, in verse number one,

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.920
that he's looking for a man that executeth judgment,

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.180
that does the right thing.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:53.180
One that lives according to the word of God.

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:54.660
One that's taken the truth.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.220
We've already mentioned the book of Ephesians this morning,

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.380
but there where God says in the book of Ephesians,

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.420
proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:04.700
What a joy that God's given us his word,

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.460
and we'll speak of that in just a moment.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.420
But we find this morning that the one

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.380
that executes judgment is one who's living right.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:17.380
It's sad to me that so many times,

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:24.020
many times I believe that it's inappropriate

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.500
to make the accusation,

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.900
and at other times it's completely accurate.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.440
That is when the world says of the people of God

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.700
that they're hypocritical.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.860
We ought not be hypocrites.

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:37.700
Amen?

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.180
We ought to do what's right.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.020
If we say that this book is the sole authority

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:46.620
for our faith and practice, we ought to live this book.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.320
Baptist people throughout the history,

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.260
many times they're referred to this way

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.820
as people of the book.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.580
What a great way to be referred to.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:56.700
Well, you just believe that Bible.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.540
I mean, what else do you want me to believe?

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:00.380
Right?

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:01.940
Come on.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.060
What a great statement that someone would accuse us

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.460
of just believing the Bible.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.700
I'm thankful for God's word.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.220
And we find here that we must live

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:12.460
according to the word of God.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.660
I find not only when it speaks about executing judgment,

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.460
one who executes judgment,

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.660
not only living right in their own lives,

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.279
but also judging according to the word of God.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.820
Developing a message, someone asked a question

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:29.059
for Sunday evenings on the Ask the Pastor series

00:24:29.059 --> 00:24:32.660
of some misunderstandings of some verses of scripture,

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.700
and one of them that was listed as an example for them

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.500
that they wanted me to deal with was the verse judge not.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.820
How many of you hear people say judge not,

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.220
and they do it kind of like that, right?

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:46.400
Listen, that's not what the word of God tells us.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.580
It's not that, listen, we judge according

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:49.740
to the word of God.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.420
We can make righteous judgment.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:55.300
Amen?

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.540
Now, the reality is that I better be living by this book

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.220
if I'm gonna judge somebody else according to this book.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.700
In fact, that's what bothers us when people wanna execute

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.420
and they wanna have you or someone else

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:08.580
live to a certain standard

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.380
that they're not willing to live to.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.740
Remember in the book of Romans, Paul says to them,

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:17.300
how is it that you say don't steal, but you're stealing?

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.020
That's not how it's supposed to work, right?

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:20.180
Or to live right.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.260
And we find here that he's speaking about the man

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.900
that executes judgment, one that's not only living right

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.140
and living in their lives according to the word of God,

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:33.980
but one who is judging according to the word of God.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.619
Listen, God's word judges.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.900
It just does.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.700
And we can look at the word of God and we can,

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.100
people in our society today get upset about it

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.160
and we ought to be kind about it.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.660
But notice what the Bible says in Hebrews 4

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:51.500
in verse number 12.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.260
For the word of God is quick, it's alive and powerful

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.860
and sharper than a two-edged sword, piercing even

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:58.820
to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.320
of the joints and marrow and is a discerner

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.619
of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.540
We judge according to the word of God.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:11.180
We find this idea of a man who executes judgment.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.360
Let me focus on the first aspect of this,

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.100
the one that lives according to the word of God.

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:20.059
Can I tell you this morning, it's not my opinion.

00:26:20.059 --> 00:26:22.240
It's not your opinion.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.619
It's not the populace.

00:26:24.619 --> 00:26:26.860
It's not the culture, the society.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:30.059
It's not the White House, the government, Hollywood,

00:26:30.059 --> 00:26:32.580
or any other group of people.

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.540
It's not social media.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.860
It is not any of those things that determine,

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.640
that establish right from wrong.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:46.220
It is God's holy word, period.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:47.740
Amen?

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.720
People want to look at, well, this is what so-and-so said.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.680
What does the Bible say?

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.260
By the way, how is it that we know more

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.140
about what other people say than what God says?

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.339
If we're people of the book, we ought to know

00:26:58.339 --> 00:27:00.980
what God says, amen?

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:02.860
And here's what I found in my life.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:04.619
If you want to do something bad enough,

00:27:04.619 --> 00:27:06.660
you're going to find a loophole to do it.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.420
Just the way it is.

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.200
And you're going to twist scripture any way

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.220
you want to twist it to appease your conscience

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.779
and make yourself feel good.

00:27:14.779 --> 00:27:17.420
But listen, this book is true.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.040
Here's what God said, let God be true.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.619
And every man a liar.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:26.279
That's why I love the fact that part of the responsibility

00:27:26.279 --> 00:27:30.080
that God's given me as a pastor is to preach the word.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.480
It's awesome.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.800
Someone asked me a number of years ago,

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.580
doesn't it get hard coming up with sermons?

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.680
Listen, if I had to come up with my own content,

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.240
I'd have been done a long time ago.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.320
But I get to preach the word of God.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.580
It's God's word.

00:27:43.779 --> 00:27:45.559
If you don't agree with it,

00:27:45.559 --> 00:27:47.880
listen, you're not going to change God.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.160
You better just go ahead and change your thinking about it.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.800
Right?

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.360
That's how it works.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.760
It's God's word.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.680
Listen, morals, morals are established

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.839
by the authority of scripture.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.520
So if you remove the authority,

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.140
what happens to the morals?

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.279
They just fall apart.

00:28:11.279 --> 00:28:15.240
The moral compass of a society void of this book

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.839
is really how it summarizes itself in the book of Judges.

00:28:18.839 --> 00:28:22.119
Every man doeth that which is right

00:28:22.119 --> 00:28:24.900
in his own sight, his own eyes.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:25.740
Right?

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.640
Because I'm my authority and you're your authority.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.320
But listen, that's not what God said.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.520
He said, I gave you a book.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.359
I gave you the Bible.

00:28:32.359 --> 00:28:33.720
I gave you my word.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.440
And morals are established

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.600
through the authority of scripture.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.280
So if you remove the authority,

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.799
if you remove the standard,

00:28:41.799 --> 00:28:45.520
it is going to impact the morals of a society.

00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:49.119
We see it in our own society today.

00:28:49.119 --> 00:28:51.119
We see it in the nation of Israel, in Judah.

00:28:51.119 --> 00:28:53.840
When you begin to read the Old Testament,

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.799
you begin to see what's happening, what's unfolding,

00:28:55.799 --> 00:28:59.080
and you see their departure from the word of God,

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.280
and you see that it has a direct correlation

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.239
to the moral compass of the day.

00:29:05.239 --> 00:29:06.080
Why?

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.840
There's a departure from the word of God.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:08.679
Isn't that amazing?

00:29:08.679 --> 00:29:11.440
In Josiah's day, when they come back

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.280
and the scribes, they say,

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.559
we have found the book of the law.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.479
And guess what happens when they read it?

00:29:19.479 --> 00:29:21.600
Josiah begins to weep, man.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.320
He is just beside himself.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.979
He's hearing what's being read,

00:29:24.979 --> 00:29:28.660
and he repents, and he's in sackcloth and ashes,

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:29.940
and he sends to the prophets,

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:34.179
and he's getting some information on what's gonna happen.

00:29:34.179 --> 00:29:35.820
And because of his response,

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.140
because of his humility to the word of God,

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:41.419
in Jeremiah's day, as they read the word of God,

00:29:41.419 --> 00:29:44.340
there were some that responded appropriately.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:45.580
But then, remember the king?

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.059
He cuts it with his pen knife,

00:29:47.059 --> 00:29:48.500
and he throws it in the fire.

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.679
Begin to think about the moral decline

00:29:53.679 --> 00:29:55.479
of the nation of Israel.

00:29:55.479 --> 00:29:57.559
You think about some of the kings that were wicked.

00:29:57.559 --> 00:29:59.720
You know what God said to the kings,

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.559
before the kings?

00:30:00.559 --> 00:30:04.979
In the book of Deuteronomy, there are no kings yet, and we find that God gave the prescription

00:30:04.979 --> 00:30:09.979
that the king was supposed to write the law of the Lord, and he was supposed to have it

00:30:09.979 --> 00:30:11.379
so he could read it.

00:30:11.379 --> 00:30:16.099
Man, how would that have changed the history of Israel had they followed the commandment

00:30:16.099 --> 00:30:18.619
of the Lord?

00:30:18.619 --> 00:30:20.819
They're not to increase wives unto themselves.

00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:23.219
That's what the Bible says specifically about kings.

00:30:23.219 --> 00:30:27.619
How many kings can you think of that increased wives to themselves?

00:30:27.619 --> 00:30:33.099
They just didn't follow the book, and begin to see a moral decline.

00:30:33.099 --> 00:30:35.619
Guess what they're trying to do to this Bible in our society?

00:30:35.619 --> 00:30:40.499
It's outdated, it's irrelevant, we don't need it.

00:30:40.499 --> 00:30:46.059
Remove it from school, remove it from here, remove it from there, right?

00:30:46.059 --> 00:30:47.319
You know, it's a sad thing.

00:30:47.319 --> 00:30:50.659
You can't read it in school, but they let you read it in prison.

00:30:50.659 --> 00:30:56.619
Maybe if they let you read it in school, you wouldn't have as many people in prison, right?

00:30:56.619 --> 00:31:04.139
I mean, seriously, the moral compass of a society, the man who executeth judgment, if

00:31:04.139 --> 00:31:12.339
we remove the Word of God, if there's no standard, the morals are going to decline, and we see

00:31:12.339 --> 00:31:17.500
it here in the book of Jeremiah, we see it in Ezekiel, we see it in Israel's history,

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:22.299
and we see it in our own land.

00:31:22.299 --> 00:31:25.199
We need a return to the Bible.

00:31:25.199 --> 00:31:30.399
Let me say this as we look at Jeremiah chapter 5 and verse number 1.

00:31:30.399 --> 00:31:34.239
Not only does he say, if there be any that executeth judgment, but notice the statement

00:31:34.239 --> 00:31:38.839
that seeketh the truth, and I will pardon it.

00:31:38.839 --> 00:31:45.319
Number three, if you're taking notes, a man who seeks truth.

00:31:45.319 --> 00:31:49.919
God's looking for some people, He's looking for some individuals that would stand in the

00:31:49.919 --> 00:31:53.479
gap, standing for truth and for right.

00:31:53.479 --> 00:31:55.479
Standing in the gap as an intercessor.

00:31:55.479 --> 00:31:59.279
He's looking for some individuals that would execute judgment, that would live according

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:03.439
to the Word of God, that would judge according to the Word of God, and He's looking for some

00:32:03.439 --> 00:32:07.319
individuals who would seek truth.

00:32:07.319 --> 00:32:12.039
Now here's what's such a joy to me of living in the United States of America and speaking

00:32:12.039 --> 00:32:17.319
the English language, is that God has given us the Bible.

00:32:17.319 --> 00:32:22.399
We assemble Scriptures, we're part of the Scripture assembly team that they come here

00:32:22.399 --> 00:32:29.119
once a year and we have opportunity to be engaged in dealing with monthly putting Scriptures

00:32:29.119 --> 00:32:35.160
together and being aware of places all across the globe where people do not have the Word

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.160
of God.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:41.880
Brother Savalle stood in this very pulpit and he shared with us how that the very first

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:47.679
time he was able to stand in his pulpit in Samoa and say to his church, take your Bible

00:32:47.679 --> 00:32:53.800
and turn to, and after so many years of ministry for the very first time, he heard the people

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:57.080
turning in their Bibles.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:01.020
It is said, as I have spoken with Brother Hummel over the years about some of the places

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:06.880
in which they have sent the Bibles into, the Scriptures into, John and Romans and other

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:12.720
portions of Scripture, in some of these places around the world where the Bible is not readily

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:17.440
available, you find that it does not collect dust as it does in our day.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:22.599
It does not collect dust as it does in our land, but we find that there oftentimes they'll

00:33:22.599 --> 00:33:28.039
take a Scripture that we have spent time to assemble and the very first thing that they'll

00:33:28.039 --> 00:33:31.279
do with that is they'll take it apart.

00:33:31.279 --> 00:33:32.440
You say, well, that's discouraging.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.080
We spent time putting it together.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.599
You want to know why they take it apart?

00:33:35.599 --> 00:33:37.919
Because there's not enough for everybody.

00:33:37.919 --> 00:33:39.000
So here's what they do.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.399
They take it apart and they say, I'm going to watch these instruments.

00:33:41.399 --> 00:33:46.639
They say, you take a part and you take a part and you take a part and you take a part and

00:33:46.639 --> 00:33:50.199
you take a part and I'm going to take a part and after you're done, we're going to just

00:33:50.199 --> 00:33:51.720
rotate.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:57.720
Can you imagine if you had to read your Bible that way?

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:01.000
Seriously.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.360
Harlan Popov talks about in his book, Tortured for His Faith, he talks about the way in which

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.360
the Bible was outlawed.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.520
Listen, they want to outlaw the Bible.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.880
And he talks about his experience.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.080
By the way, it was in the early 1900s.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.160
It's not like it was 500 years ago.

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:22.440
It was about 100 years ago, Romania, and he's there and he's faithful.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:26.519
He's in prison for years, but he talks about the Bible and he talks about having these

00:34:26.519 --> 00:34:29.040
secret church meetings.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.399
They had to do that for fear of persecution for all that was happening.

00:34:32.399 --> 00:34:39.880
And by the way, let me say this, in fear of persecution, they met anyway.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:49.079
They gathered anyway, knowing they could die, but knowing that he's worth it.

00:34:49.079 --> 00:34:56.399
And he tells the story about a young lady that after they would have services, she would

00:34:56.399 --> 00:35:02.519
say, can I take your Bible with me?

00:35:02.519 --> 00:35:09.760
And he thought that she was taking that Bible because she wanted to read it.

00:35:10.639 --> 00:35:13.239
And she would promise repeatedly that I'll bring it back.

00:35:13.239 --> 00:35:14.239
And she would.

00:35:14.239 --> 00:35:17.040
And then she'd ask to borrow it again.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:21.679
And eventually, Harlan Popov said, what are you doing with the Bible?

00:35:21.679 --> 00:35:24.720
Are you reading it all night long?

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:31.359
She said, no, sir, if I did that, I'd just be able to read it once.

00:35:31.359 --> 00:35:35.079
I am making my own copy.

00:35:35.079 --> 00:35:45.880
She was writing by hand the Scriptures so that she could have the Bible.

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:49.799
Jim Elliot said this, many of you know Jim Elliot, he's famous for some quotes, I'd never

00:35:49.799 --> 00:35:51.600
heard this one before.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:56.440
But he said this, one of the two indictments that he mentioned against American Christianity

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.519
was the dust on our Bibles.

00:35:59.519 --> 00:36:03.239
Wow, wow.

00:36:03.239 --> 00:36:09.200
Everyone who seeks truth, to seek to find is the idea of this word, seeketh truth, not

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:13.880
only to seek in order to find, but to desire to have.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.239
Now God's given us the Bible.

00:36:16.239 --> 00:36:17.720
He's given us truth.

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:22.959
Listen, we can stand up and we can preach messages about why we use the Bible we use

00:36:22.959 --> 00:36:28.799
and so on and so forth, but the reality this morning is that we need to dig into the Bible.

00:36:28.799 --> 00:36:32.760
It's great to know why we use the Bible that we use, but we've got to know the Word of

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:33.760
God.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.279
We need to use it, seek it.

00:36:37.279 --> 00:36:38.279
Someone that seeks truth.

00:36:38.279 --> 00:36:39.279
Let me say this.

00:36:39.279 --> 00:36:41.359
Turn to the book of Psalms, if you will.

00:36:41.359 --> 00:36:43.279
Make a couple of statements from the book of Psalms.

00:36:43.279 --> 00:36:44.279
Psalm 19.

00:36:44.279 --> 00:36:49.380
We'll look at Psalm 19 and Psalm 119, two wonderful passages of Scriptures with regard

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.380
to the Word of God.

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:54.320
We'll have to skip a couple of references here this morning, but let me start here in

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.239
Psalm 19 in verse number 7.

00:36:57.239 --> 00:36:59.519
Notice how the Bible describes itself here.

00:36:59.519 --> 00:37:05.040
The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.839
Peter would say this, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, being born again,

00:37:08.839 --> 00:37:12.359
not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the Word of God that liveth and abideth

00:37:12.359 --> 00:37:13.359
forever.

00:37:13.359 --> 00:37:16.040
The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:19.320
Notice the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.600
The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.720
The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:28.639
The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever.

00:37:28.639 --> 00:37:32.239
The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.

00:37:32.239 --> 00:37:41.399
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold, sweeter also than honey

00:37:41.399 --> 00:37:42.399
and the honeycomb.

00:37:42.399 --> 00:37:49.279
Moreover, by them is thy servant warned, and in keeping of them there is great reward.

00:37:49.279 --> 00:37:54.040
Many today are desiring gold, rich as wealth.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:38:00.160
And here the Word of God says of itself, more to be desired are they than gold, yea,

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.079
than much fine gold.

00:38:03.079 --> 00:38:08.399
We find that in Psalm 119, I want you to notice the expression that is used every time I read

00:38:08.399 --> 00:38:09.639
this verse of Scripture.

00:38:09.639 --> 00:38:12.119
I'm just encouraged and challenged.

00:38:12.119 --> 00:38:16.519
In Psalm 119, of course, the entirety of the passage deals with the Word of God, but I

00:38:16.519 --> 00:38:21.799
want you to notice this imagery that is painted for us in verse number 162 with regard to

00:38:21.799 --> 00:38:23.880
the rejoicing at thy word.

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.799
Notice what the Bible says, it's amazing.

00:38:25.799 --> 00:38:31.919
The Word of God says this, I rejoice at thy word, and here's the manner in which I rejoice.

00:38:31.919 --> 00:38:40.719
This is the imagery that God is giving us, as one that findeth great spoil.

00:38:40.719 --> 00:38:41.960
You get that this morning?

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:47.880
I rejoice at thy word, and this is the manner by which I rejoice.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.239
This is the fashion of my rejoicing.

00:38:50.239 --> 00:38:55.599
This is the imagery that God gives us as one that findeth great spoil.

00:38:55.599 --> 00:38:59.380
Listen, there's some people today that would rejoice for great spoil, but couldn't care

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.479
less about the Word of God.

00:39:01.479 --> 00:39:06.679
Oh, one that seeketh truth.

00:39:06.679 --> 00:39:12.479
The book of Proverbs says this, and it's a very familiar verse of Scripture in Proverbs

00:39:12.479 --> 00:39:21.960
23, in verse number 23, buy the truth and sell it not.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.320
Also wisdom and instruction and understanding.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:29.000
I'm thankful that Jesus Christ Himself is truth.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.479
He said this in John 14, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:39:34.479 --> 00:39:36.919
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:39:36.919 --> 00:39:39.400
I'm thankful that the Word of God is truth.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.880
He says in John chapter number 17, just a few chapters later, he says this, sanctify

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:47.479
them through thy word, thy word is truth.

00:39:47.479 --> 00:39:51.599
I'm thankful for the example, as you look to the Old Testament, you begin to think about

00:39:51.599 --> 00:39:57.599
those that sought truth, and I want you to think about what is said of Ezra, where the

00:39:57.599 --> 00:39:59.279
Bible says this.

00:39:59.279 --> 00:40:00.599
The Bible describes Ezra.

00:40:00.599 --> 00:40:05.439
being a ready scribe. The Bible describes Ezra as being a man that was used of the

00:40:05.439 --> 00:40:08.959
Lord in a great way, but I want you to understand that the Bible gives us some

00:40:08.959 --> 00:40:15.399
insight to the heart and the desire of this man, Ezra. The Bible says that Ezra

00:40:15.399 --> 00:40:23.479
prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord. Man, God says, see if you can

00:40:23.479 --> 00:40:30.199
find a man who seeks truth. Ezra, during his time in his life, the Bible says of

00:40:30.199 --> 00:40:36.319
him that he had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, but not just to

00:40:36.319 --> 00:40:42.319
seek the law of the Lord, but the Bible says to do it. Remember that execute at

00:40:42.319 --> 00:40:45.559
the judgment? Listen, we're not seeking the law of the Lord so that we can tell

00:40:45.559 --> 00:40:50.379
everybody else what to do, so that we can use it as a way of correcting somebody

00:40:50.379 --> 00:40:55.259
else. No, no, we're seeking the law of the Lord first and foremost to influence my

00:40:55.259 --> 00:41:00.379
own life, that I would take the Word of God, and as I seek the truth, and I'm

00:41:00.379 --> 00:41:07.419
going to live the truth, and then I'm gonna stand for truth. As we think

00:41:07.419 --> 00:41:11.819
about the life of Ezra, it says that he prepared his heart to seek the law

00:41:11.819 --> 00:41:17.339
of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.

00:41:17.339 --> 00:41:21.579
And he didn't want to just know it for himself and apply it for himself. He

00:41:21.579 --> 00:41:25.619
wanted to teach it to others. You know, God gave him the opportunity to do that.

00:41:25.619 --> 00:41:29.459
If you keep reading the book of Ezra, you see how God would use him in a great way

00:41:29.459 --> 00:41:33.619
to be able to teach the Word of God. This morning, as we look at these two

00:41:33.619 --> 00:41:38.539
verses of Scripture, as we think about the kind of man that God is seeking for,

00:41:38.539 --> 00:41:42.859
looking for, I would say this morning that really the truth of these three

00:41:42.859 --> 00:41:48.819
thoughts this morning are applicable to every one of us as a child of God. And I

00:41:48.819 --> 00:41:51.099
would submit to you that as we've looked at them in this order this

00:41:51.099 --> 00:41:56.539
morning, number one, that one that would stand in the gap, one that would stand

00:41:56.539 --> 00:42:02.139
for truth and for right, one that would stand as an intercessor. As we notice,

00:42:02.139 --> 00:42:07.339
number two, a man who executeth judgment, someone who lives according to the Word

00:42:07.339 --> 00:42:12.419
of God, someone who judges according to the Word of God, and then finally this

00:42:12.419 --> 00:42:16.739
morning, one who seeks the truth. Can I say it this way this morning? It really

00:42:16.739 --> 00:42:23.699
works well in reverse order. If you seek the truth, God said, if you seek me,

00:42:23.699 --> 00:42:28.939
you'll find me. Listen, I believe with all of my heart this morning that if you

00:42:28.939 --> 00:42:33.579
want to know the truth, God will reveal it to you. Historically, you look at the

00:42:33.579 --> 00:42:38.539
Word of God, He's always done that. I've had people tell me over the years, I'm

00:42:38.539 --> 00:42:42.499
just looking for truth. I said, well, that's a wonderful place to be because

00:42:42.499 --> 00:42:46.979
if you're looking for truth and you're sincere, God will show it to you if you

00:42:46.979 --> 00:42:50.299
really want the truth. If you're just looking for something to make you feel

00:42:50.299 --> 00:42:56.139
good, it's another story. But if you're really seeking truth, God will show it to

00:42:56.139 --> 00:43:04.099
you. He'll reveal it to you. And as we seek truth, we must live that truth.

00:43:04.099 --> 00:43:10.779
Executeth judgment. We live by the truth that we've sought. We're doing it. And

00:43:11.539 --> 00:43:14.979
then we're standing in the gap. What are we standing for? We're standing for truth

00:43:14.979 --> 00:43:22.339
and for right. We're standing as an intercessor. This morning, as we look at

00:43:22.339 --> 00:43:28.099
these thoughts from Jeremiah and Ezekiel, I hope this morning that we'd say, I want

00:43:28.099 --> 00:43:33.419
those characteristics, I want those attributes in my life. I want to be an

00:43:33.419 --> 00:43:38.219
individual that if God were looking for someone to stand in the gap, that I'm

00:43:38.259 --> 00:43:41.859
standing in the gap, that I'm standing for truth and for right, that I'm

00:43:41.859 --> 00:43:45.779
standing as an intercessor. If God's looking for someone that executeth

00:43:45.779 --> 00:43:49.779
judgment, that He can look at my life and He can see an individual that's living

00:43:49.779 --> 00:43:55.539
according to the Word of God, that's judging according to the Word of God, not

00:43:55.539 --> 00:44:01.019
allowing the culture, the populace, the social media, the opinion of my neighbor,

00:44:01.019 --> 00:44:07.619
the opinion of myself, the opinion of my spouse to determine right and wrong. But

00:44:07.619 --> 00:44:13.299
this book, we execute judgment. And if He's looking for someone that seeks

00:44:13.299 --> 00:44:21.459
truth, what do you say of us? They seek truth. They're seeking it. They're seeking

00:44:21.459 --> 00:44:30.179
daily for truth. They've prepared their heart to seek the law of the Lord. God

00:44:30.179 --> 00:44:35.859
says to Ezekiel, I found none. If you can continue reading Jeremiah 5, he didn't

00:44:35.859 --> 00:44:44.459
find any in the streets of Jerusalem. How sad. This morning, I want to be that

00:44:44.459 --> 00:44:49.219
kind of a person. I want to be that kind of a believer. God's still looking for

00:44:49.219 --> 00:44:53.579
some people that would follow these three, that would have these three

00:44:53.579 --> 00:44:57.259
attributes in their lives, these characteristics. Let's pray. Father, we

00:44:57.259 --> 00:45:04.419
love You. Oh, how we thank You for loving us. I thank You for Your precious Word. I

00:45:04.579 --> 00:45:14.059
thank You for the challenge You've given to me personally. I trust that the Holy

00:45:14.059 --> 00:45:25.299
Spirit of God has used the Word of God this morning to convict, to encourage. God,

00:45:25.299 --> 00:45:28.739
I know that there are folks that are standing for right and truth, that are

00:45:28.739 --> 00:45:33.179
standing as intercessors, that are living according to the Word of God, judging

00:45:33.179 --> 00:45:37.179
according to the Word of God, that are seeking Your face daily, seeking truth

00:45:37.179 --> 00:45:45.499
daily. God, I pray that You'd encourage them. Help them to understand that You're

00:45:45.499 --> 00:45:52.219
pleased with that behavior. God, would You help them to be encouraged to continue,

00:45:52.219 --> 00:45:59.219
to not grow weary in well-doing as we see the encouragement to the brethren

00:45:59.219 --> 00:46:08.419
in the region of Galatia? Father, perhaps this morning there's one who would

00:46:08.419 --> 00:46:16.099
acknowledge before You that there's some deficiencies. God, would You help us to

00:46:16.099 --> 00:46:25.419
get it right? Would You help us to respond as Josiah did, with a tender heart? God,

00:46:25.499 --> 00:46:29.219
we pray that You'd use us, help us to be aware of the fact that we're engaged in

00:46:29.219 --> 00:46:36.539
spiritual battle, spiritual warfare, that we need the whole armor of God. I pray

00:46:36.539 --> 00:46:40.499
that in the moments of this invitation this morning, as Kimberly will play, Lord,

00:46:40.499 --> 00:46:46.099
I pray that You'd move and work. I pray that You'd seal each decision. We'll thank

00:46:46.099 --> 00:46:48.859
You for what You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would You stand

00:46:48.859 --> 00:46:53.379
with me? Heads are bowed, our eyes are closed. Have a moment of invitation. Give

00:46:53.379 --> 00:46:57.819
you an opportunity this morning to respond as the Holy Spirit of God has

00:46:57.819 --> 00:47:02.379
used His Word to minister in your heart and life. As Kimberly plays, the altar is

00:47:02.379 --> 00:47:04.779
open.
