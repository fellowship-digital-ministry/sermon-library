1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
book of First Thessalonians, nor the second book of Thessalonians. However, over the next

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:10,520
several months, we're going to study through these two books and really looking at the

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:16,799
concluding statements that are made in each of the books. I've titled the series, Walkworthy

4
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:22,520
and Please God. Walkworthy and Please God. And so on Wednesday nights, for the next several

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:29,520
months, we're going to have this subject matter of Walkworthy and Please God. On Sunday evening,

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,279
the last service of 2023, I preached a message from the book of Ecclesiastes, and here the

7
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:39,000
conclusion of the whole matter. This is the whole duty of man. What was it? Fear God and

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,240
keep His commandments. And we find that as we come to the New Testament, even as we mentioned

9
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,479
on Sunday evening, looking at Ephesians 5 and verse number 10, and a number of other

10
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,520
passages in the New Testament as well, that we find that in the New Testament, God has

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,240
given us instruction as a local church on how we are to behave. In fact, in 1 Timothy

12
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,919
3 and verse 15, in a few months, we'll get to that portion of Scripture. We find that

13
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:06,839
the Bible says that Timothy is receiving this instruction in Paul so that if I tarry long,

14
00:01:06,839 --> 00:01:12,040
that thou know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God. And we understand

15
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,040
that there is appropriate behavior in God's house, and there is that behavior that would

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,319
please God. As we think about the church at Thessalonica, and really this evening starting

17
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:26,639
an introductory kind of a lesson to this series of Walkworthy and Please God, I've titled

18
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:32,199
the message tonight, Simply Walkworthy. And as we think about the church at Thessalonica,

19
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:36,160
it was during the second missionary journey that the Apostle Paul was used of the Lord

20
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,680
to travel to the city of Thessalonica. As best we can tell, because of the opposition

21
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,839
that was faced, Paul was there for just a brief time. We'll look at Acts 17 here in

22
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:50,080
just a moment. But we find that God would use the Apostle Paul, under the inspiration

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,559
of the Holy Spirit of God, to write two letters to this church at Thessalonica. Notice, if

24
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:59,160
you will, in 1 Thessalonians 2 and verse number 12, and I'm going to read the two

25
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:05,160
verses that we're going to use really as theme verses as we study here on Wednesday evenings

26
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:10,160
this thought of Walkworthy and Please God. In 1 Thessalonians 2 and verse number 12,

27
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:17,199
the Bible says that you would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom

28
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,779
and glory. Then skip over, if you will, to 1 Thessalonians chapter number 4, and look

29
00:02:21,779 --> 00:02:29,179
at verse 1. The Bible says, furthermore then, we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by

30
00:02:29,179 --> 00:02:35,300
the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us, notice, how you ought to walk and to

31
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:43,339
please God, so you would abound more and more, for ye know what commandments we gave you

32
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:49,339
by the Lord Jesus. We mentioned on Sunday evening about fearing God and keeping his

33
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,460
commandments. We looked at a number of passages in the book of Deuteronomy specifically, where

34
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,860
the Bible said that we're to know all of his commandments at all times. And we find that

35
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,740
as Paul would write here to the church at Thessalonica, he says, for ye know what commandments

36
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:09,740
we gave you by the Lord Jesus in verse 2 of chapter 4. As you take the content of 1 and

37
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:16,619
2 Thessalonians and you think about this local church, God is giving this church instruction

38
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:22,380
with regard to how they can walk worthy and please God. As we begin to think about the

39
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,139
ministry in Thessalonica and the opposition that was faced, if you hold your place here

40
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:31,899
and turn back to Acts 17, we'll just look very briefly at these few verses and see what

41
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:39,539
happened there as this church was established. In Acts 17 and verse number 1, we'll just

42
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:44,059
look at a few verses here. The Bible says, now when they had passed through Amphipolis

43
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:50,779
and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica. Notice the Bible says where was a synagogue

44
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:57,100
of the Jews. And Paul, according to verse number 2, as his manner was, went in unto

45
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:03,779
them and three Sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures. He used the Old

46
00:04:03,779 --> 00:04:07,699
Testament. He used the word of God. He used the scriptures that are available. Notice

47
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:11,300
the Bible says that he did this for three Sabbath days. That's why we understand that

48
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:16,100
it was a short period of time that Paul was there in Thessalonica. Notice in verse 3,

49
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:22,220
what is he giving them? What is he teaching them? Opening and alleging that Christ must

50
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:29,140
needs have suffered and risen again from the dead. And that this Jesus whom I preach unto

51
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:35,299
you is Christ. Now there's a whole message right in verse number 3 with regard to the

52
00:04:35,299 --> 00:04:40,179
message that the Apostle Paul is delivering to these Jewish folks at this synagogue in

53
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:47,220
Thessalonica. And the name Jesus means Jehovah is salvation, God incarnate. When he, Paul,

54
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,220
would reference Jesus, they would understand that the individual, the person that he was

55
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:58,779
speaking of. And we find that he says that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ.

56
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:04,940
He is the anointed one. He is the Messiah. He is the Son of God, God in flesh. And we

57
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,820
find that the Bible says in verse number 4, some of them believed and consorted with

58
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,100
Paul and Silas, some of the devout Greeks, a great multitude, and of the chief women

59
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:21,339
not a few. But the Jews which believed not moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd

60
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:26,239
fellows of the baser sort, and gathered company, and set all the city of an uproar, and assaulted

61
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:30,980
the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people. And so we find that due

62
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,380
to the opposition, again, Paul was not there in Thessalonica for a long time. He would

63
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,980
be sent to Berea, if you continue to read through, and we're not going to take the time

64
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,940
to do so, but we find that in verse number 10, the brethren sent Paul and Silas away.

65
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:50,299
They sent him to Berea, and he's not in Berea very long. And the people from Thessalonica

66
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:56,940
that were upset, that caused the uproar, they follow him to Berea, and Paul ends up in Athens.

67
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,040
And we find that when he's in Athens, of course he's there, and his spirit is moved

68
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,019
within him because he sees a city that is wholly given to idolatry, and he preaches

69
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:10,739
to them Christ. But we find that in this brief time that the Apostle Paul was in Thessalonica,

70
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:16,019
that the gospel was preached, souls were saved, and a local church was established. And that's

71
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:21,579
exciting for us to understand how God moved and worked through this second missionary

72
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:27,899
journey to see a local church established. Now, we find that God, again, as I mentioned

73
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:33,059
a few moments ago, would use Paul to then write these two letters, 1 Thessalonians and

74
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:38,779
2 Thessalonians, back to this church that was established on this second missionary

75
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:45,420
journey. In many ways, the church in Thessalonica is a model church. We use that terminology.

76
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,540
You've heard me use it before. I've said something like this, there's no perfect church, there's

77
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:55,179
no perfect church members, there's no perfect pastor. We're all sinners saved by grace,

78
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:59,980
and we're not perfect, but we serve a perfect God. We have a perfect book, and we ought

79
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:06,059
to be thankful for that. But we understand that this church that we find in Thessalonica,

80
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:11,440
really in a number of ways, is a model church. As you study through 1 and 2 Thessalonians,

81
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,779
you will discover much for which this church will be commended for. However, in the conclusion

82
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:24,019
of each letter, in 1 Thessalonians chapter 1, excuse me, chapter 5, verses 12-28, and

83
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:30,380
2 Thessalonians chapter 3, verses 6-18, in each of the conclusions of these two letters,

84
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:37,100
we find that Paul leaves the believers with practical instruction. The practical instruction

85
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:42,420
that he gives them is so that they might walk worthy and please God. Just as we've titled

86
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,420
this mini-series over the next several months, we've looked at the verses already in 1 Thessalonians

87
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:53,059
2, 12, and chapter 4, verses 1-2, and we find that this instruction is provided so

88
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:58,940
that these believers, this church at Thessalonica, this body of believers, that they could walk

89
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:07,540
worthy and please God. God has providentially preserved this instruction for every generation

90
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,179
of believers. Now that's exciting. I'm thankful that God would give the instruction to the

91
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:17,220
church at Thessalonica, hey, here's some instruction, here's some practical instruction on how you

92
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:24,260
can walk worthy and how you can please God. But then God providentially preserved that

93
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:30,579
for every generation of believers. Therefore, we conclude that the principles in the closing

94
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:36,299
verses of each of these books are to be known and implemented by every local church. We

95
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,619
find that as God would preserve it, He didn't preserve it so that we could just look back

96
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:44,539
a couple of thousand years at a church and say, well, that was good instruction for that

97
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:50,340
church. No, our God is an eternal God. He has no beginning, no ending, and He gave instruction

98
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,580
to this local church in Thessalonica. He's preserved it for us so that we can take those

99
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:02,320
principles and we can know them and we can implement them so that we can walk worthy

100
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,679
and please God. Now, over the next several months, we will examine those principles to

101
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:13,659
ensure that we can know them and implement them. Again, chapter number 5, beginning in

102
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:17,700
verse number 12, going through the end of the chapter. And then in 2 Thessalonians chapter

103
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,419
number 3, beginning in verse number 6 and going through the end of the chapter. There

104
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:26,780
are a number of principles. In fact, as you read the latter part of 1 Thessalonians chapter

105
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:32,219
number 5, really beginning in verse number 16, it's like just, bam, bullet points almost

106
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:36,960
of just practical instruction for the church. And so we're going to take the time over the

107
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:43,960
next several months to dig into these principles so that we, as a local church, just as the

108
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:51,039
church at Thessalonica could take and incorporate these principles, abide by them, thus pleasing

109
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:57,919
God and walking worthy that we too can do that same thing. Tonight, before we jump into

110
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,799
the latter portion of these books...

111
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:04,719
Tonight I want to briefly examine this church at Thessalonica and really consider why it

112
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:10,119
is that so often we refer to this church as being a model church.

113
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:14,719
There are five truths that I want to look at briefly through these two books this evening

114
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:19,919
that would give us reason to say the church at Thessalonica is a model church.

115
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,639
Now why am I laying this groundwork?

116
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,759
We could understand if God is writing to the church in Corinth and saying, hey, here's

117
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,639
some things that you need to do to walk worthy and please God.

118
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:30,639
Why?

119
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:32,319
Because the church at Corinth was a mess.

120
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:37,079
The church at Corinth had divisions and all sorts of problems that were going on in Corinth.

121
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:41,799
In fact, you can go through the book of 1 Corinthians and you can find 12 or 15 different

122
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:47,079
things that were going on in Corinth that would help us to understand the church in

123
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,839
Corinth was in no way, shape, or form a model church.

124
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:52,279
They needed some instruction.

125
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:53,799
They needed to apply some things.

126
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,719
They were just all sorts of divisions and contentions that were prevalent within that

127
00:10:58,719 --> 00:10:59,839
local church.

128
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,719
But we look at a church like Thessalonica, we say, man, this is a model church.

129
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:05,719
This is a good church.

130
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:10,479
This is a church that's doing something for God, and they were.

131
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:18,079
And yet, at the end of each book, God gives them a list of principles and says, listen,

132
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,959
if you want to walk worthy and you want to please me, here's some things that you need

133
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,959
to be aware of and that you need to implement.

134
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:31,239
One thing that I find in our Christian life is that we never arrive.

135
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:32,479
We never arrive.

136
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,119
There's always room for spiritual growth.

137
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:38,159
We find that there's never time for days off.

138
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,679
There's never time that we can just kind of throw in the towel and say, man, we can coast

139
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,319
for a little while.

140
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:47,759
Because if you decide to do that, then before long you're going to be going backwards instead

141
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:48,919
of going forward.

142
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:54,639
Our theme, continue, the idea to persevere, to go on, to continue, to move forward.

143
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,879
We're not just sitting on the premises.

144
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,199
We're not just in a defensive posture.

145
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:04,599
We're to be going forth with the gospel of Jesus Christ, continuing, and we find that

146
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:10,439
even for a model church, a church that is commended for a number of things, we find

147
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:16,599
that there is instruction, practical principles that are given to them in each of these letters

148
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:20,319
whereby God is saying, listen, don't forget these things.

149
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:26,679
Remember to continue doing these things, and in so doing, you will walk worthy and please

150
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,679
God.

151
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:33,599
Number one on why this church, why I would say this church is a model church, number

152
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:37,319
one, they were growing spiritually.

153
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:39,539
They were growing spiritually.

154
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:44,119
So often we speak about the importance of growing numerically, and no doubt that is

155
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:50,479
a byproduct of spiritual growth, and a church should be growing numerically, and we desire

156
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:55,639
to grow numerically, but we must understand the importance of a church growing spiritually,

157
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:59,639
of individual believers growing spiritually.

158
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:04,119
The Bible tells us as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow

159
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:05,119
thereby.

160
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:09,159
And we find that this church, I would say, is a model church because they were growing

161
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,159
spiritually.

162
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:12,199
They were members of this church.

163
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:14,599
Remember the church is not a building.

164
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:19,879
The church is the believers, the people of God, and they were growing spiritually.

165
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:22,799
Look in 1 Thessalonians chapter 1.

166
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,999
Look what the Bible says in verse number 3, and then we're going to go over to 2 Thessalonians

167
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:30,939
chapter 1 and just make a quick comparison, and I want you to see how they were growing

168
00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:32,199
spiritually.

169
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:35,999
The period of time between writing the first and second book of Thessalonians is not really

170
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:42,439
that long, and we find that Paul, as he's writing these two letters, in fact many would

171
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:48,159
have these dated in the same year, maybe just a mere number of months in between the two

172
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,879
writings, and we find that in chapter 1 of the first book, in verse number 3, notice

173
00:13:52,879 --> 00:14:01,039
what Paul says, remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience

174
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:07,559
of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of God and our Father.

175
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:11,719
And so we see that their work of faith, their labor of love, their patience of hope are

176
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:13,879
referenced in verse number 3 of chapter 1.

177
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:20,940
Turn over to 2 Thessalonians chapter 1, and notice what Paul says, again mere months perhaps

178
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:26,139
between the two writings of these letters, and we find that Paul, as he's again thanking

179
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:31,099
God for these believers in Thessalonica, in 2 Thessalonians 1 and verse number 3, notice

180
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:37,440
what Paul says, we are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is me.

181
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:45,139
Notice what he says, because that your faith, did you see what it says, groweth exceedingly.

182
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:47,579
I like that verbiage, don't you?

183
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:50,959
The Bible says, and then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

184
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,419
We find that Paul, as he's writing, again under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of

185
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:59,459
God, he mentions their faith in the first book, but now as he's writing the second book,

186
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:04,839
he says, listen, we're thanking God because we're understanding that your faith groweth,

187
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:06,839
and he says it groweth exceedingly.

188
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:12,859
Now I'm not sure in your mind's eye, in your sanctified imagination, what you think of

189
00:15:12,859 --> 00:15:15,759
when you hear that term groweth exceedingly.

190
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:18,799
I appreciate that word exceedingly.

191
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,679
He doesn't just say that your faith groweth, that would be sufficient, it would help us

192
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:26,259
to see that there was some growth, there was some progress that's being made, but notice

193
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,619
Paul says that your faith groweth exceedingly.

194
00:15:29,619 --> 00:15:32,119
Man, this is exciting.

195
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:38,500
Notice he continues and says, and the charity, that's the love of every one of you all toward

196
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,459
each other, then notice the word, aboundeth.

197
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:48,500
Man, this is exciting to see the spiritual growth of this church in Thessalonica.

198
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:54,979
We begin to look at this church and we begin to say, why is it that I would say, why is

199
00:15:54,979 --> 00:16:00,459
it that theologians of yesteryear would say that the church of Thessalonica is a model

200
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,459
church?

201
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:05,339
Number one, that I've looked through these books and I've come up with is that they were

202
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,379
growing spiritually.

203
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:12,259
Number two, number two, they were examples to other believers.

204
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:16,779
Turn back to the first book, if you will, of Thessalonians, 1 Thessalonians chapter

205
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:21,379
1, and we find that they were examples.

206
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:25,619
I'm thankful that the Lord Jesus Christ is our example.

207
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:30,659
Peter mentions that, that he left us an example that we should follow his steps, but we find

208
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:35,659
that we understand the importance of being examples to others.

209
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:40,419
Remember the Apostle Paul, he mentioned about be ye followers of me even as I also am of

210
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:41,419
Christ.

211
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,119
We find that in the church at Corinth.

212
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:47,899
We find that he says to Timothy, the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses,

213
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:52,659
the same commit thou to faithful men, which we'll be able to teach others also in 2 Timothy

214
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:54,779
chapter number 2.

215
00:16:54,779 --> 00:17:00,419
And we find for this church in Thessalonica, they were examples to other believers.

216
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:06,940
Notice in 1 Thessalonians 1 and verse number 7, the Bible says so that ye, that's the church,

217
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:14,179
the believers at the church in Thessalonica, so that ye were in samples to all that believe

218
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:18,419
in Macedonia and Achaia.

219
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:24,179
Now when he says that you are in sample or an example, I find that as I look at the book

220
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,859
and I look at the context that this is given in a positive fashion.

221
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:33,699
He's not saying that you were an example of what not to do, no, you were an example of

222
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:39,299
what to do and the proper way to receive God's word.

223
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:43,859
In fact, in chapter 2 and verse number 13, the Bible says for this cause also thank we

224
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:48,819
God without ceasing because when you receive the word of God which ye heard of us, notice

225
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:54,299
you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God which effectually

226
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:58,039
worketh also in you that believe.

227
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:03,119
And so their approach and their receiving of God's word, that was an example.

228
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,720
And it was an example to these other believers, these people that heard the gospel in Macedonia

229
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:14,139
and Achaia, and Paul says that you believers in Thessalonica, you were an example.

230
00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:19,440
Number three, why is this church, the church at Thessalonica, why are they a model church?

231
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,279
Well I would say number three, they were actively sharing the gospel, they were actively sharing

232
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:25,599
the gospel.

233
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:30,159
They were growing spiritually, they were examples to other believers, but they were actively

234
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:31,679
sharing the gospel.

235
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:38,359
And what a blessing to see in verse number eight of 1 Thessalonians 1 how that God references

236
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,640
their work of sharing the gospel.

237
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,679
Paul says it this way, unto the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, for from you, again

238
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,359
remember he's writing to the church of the Thessalonians according to 1 1, he says for

239
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:56,519
from you sounded out the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also

240
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:03,519
in every place your faith to God's word is spread abroad so that we need not to speak

241
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,519
anything.

242
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:09,979
And that's pretty exciting, a church.

243
00:19:09,979 --> 00:19:15,640
The apostle Paul, best we can tell from Acts 17, is there for just a very brief time as

244
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,799
God would lead him on that second missionary journey to go to the city of Thessalonica,

245
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,359
but there was great opposition, but in those few weeks that he had the opportunity to be

246
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:30,440
there, the word of God was preached, souls were saved, a church was established, and

247
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:37,000
now as this church is being written to, and we look throughout these two letters, we find

248
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,239
that there's much for which they can be commended for.

249
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:45,279
Many reasons that we can go to this church and say this is a model church, they were

250
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,760
actively sharing the gospel, they understood the power of the gospel, they understood how

251
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,719
they had been saved, and because of their salvation and because of understanding the

252
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:59,799
power of the gospel, they then wanted to...

253
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,879
share that truth with others.

254
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:03,839
We shared a prayer letter update

255
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,279
from a missionary just a few weeks ago.

256
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:10,079
And as we talked about that missionary over in Africa,

257
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,839
and we talked about in Uganda there,

258
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,999
how this one young man trusted Christ as his savior.

259
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:17,039
And after he trusted Christ as his savior,

260
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,399
he wanted to go back to his own village

261
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:22,159
to be able to tell his friends and his family

262
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,659
about the Lord, tell them about Jesus Christ.

263
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:25,499
Why?

264
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:26,679
Because his life had been changed.

265
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:29,239
He understood what the gospel did for him,

266
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,559
and he goes back to his village there in Uganda,

267
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,799
and there's a dozen and a half people

268
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,919
that trust Christ as their savior.

269
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:38,239
That's exciting.

270
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:41,599
And we find that here, this church in Thessalonica,

271
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,959
they were actively sharing the gospel.

272
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:48,099
They understood that God had saved them,

273
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:51,159
and they had a responsibility to grow spiritually.

274
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:52,759
They had a responsibility to be an example

275
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:55,079
to other believers, but they had a responsibility

276
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:57,919
to actively share the gospel.

277
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,839
Number four, I would say this.

278
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,199
Why is the church in Thessalonica a model church?

279
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:07,319
Well, number four, they continued through opposition.

280
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:10,839
They continued through opposition.

281
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:13,519
In 1 Thessalonians 3, I want you to notice

282
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,519
what the Bible says.

283
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:17,359
In verse number one, Paul says,

284
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,719
wherefore, when we could no longer forbear,

285
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:23,079
we thought it good to be left in Athens alone,

286
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:25,879
and sent Timotheus our brother, and minister of God,

287
00:21:25,879 --> 00:21:28,999
and fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ

288
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:32,119
to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith.

289
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:34,999
Now, again, I mentioned briefly from Acts 17

290
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:37,119
the opposition that they face,

291
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:40,199
and they say these that have turned the world upside down

292
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:43,039
have come hither also in that passage of Scripture,

293
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,879
and Paul and Silas, they go down to Berea,

294
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:47,719
and then they chase them down to Berea,

295
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:49,719
and Paul ends up in Athens,

296
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:51,579
and so Paul is referencing that

297
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:53,519
in verse number one of chapter three,

298
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,759
and he says we no longer could forbear.

299
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:59,319
Paul was concerned about these believers in Thessalonica.

300
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,279
He knew that they received the gospel,

301
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,719
they had been saved, but he knew the opposition

302
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:06,639
was so great that he and others had to flee,

303
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:09,339
and so he's saying we could no longer forbear,

304
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:10,959
so what do we do?

305
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:13,239
We sent Timothy, and Timothy was gonna come,

306
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:16,759
and he was going to establish you and to comfort you.

307
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:19,679
Notice in verse number three that no man

308
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,279
should be moved by these afflictions.

309
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:28,279
For yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto,

310
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:31,559
and you think about the truth of yea,

311
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,439
all those that live godly in Christ Jesus

312
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:34,819
shall suffer persecution.

313
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:38,359
Of course, that's in second Timothy three in verse 13,

314
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:40,799
and we find here that Paul is saying listen,

315
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,359
these afflictions that you're facing,

316
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:45,999
it was our desire that you would not be moved

317
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:47,079
by these afflictions.

318
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:50,099
Again, that it would not cause you to give up,

319
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:51,279
to turn back.

320
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:53,719
In verse four, for verily when we were with you,

321
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:56,839
we told you before that we should suffer tribulation

322
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:59,599
even as it came to pass, and ye know.

323
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,439
Now remember, I mentioned this on Sunday morning,

324
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:06,699
the word persecution carries with it

325
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:09,279
of the idea of harass or trouble

326
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:13,919
with the intent or the purpose of making one run or flee,

327
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,639
and he says in verse number four that we told you before

328
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:19,799
that we should suffer tribulation

329
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,879
even as it come to pass, and ye know.

330
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:24,679
And so this tribulation, this persecution

331
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:27,079
that they were facing, Paul was concerned,

332
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,879
but I'm saying that they were a model church

333
00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:32,039
because they continued through the opposition.

334
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,159
In verse number five it says for this cause,

335
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,959
when I could no longer forbear,

336
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,799
I sent to know your faith,

337
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:41,319
lest by some means the tempter have tempted you,

338
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,279
and our labor be in vain.

339
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,579
Can you see the heart of Paul in verse number five?

340
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:46,419
Who's the tempter?

341
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:49,199
Well, that's the enemy, that's the devil,

342
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:52,399
and he says lest the tempter have tempted you,

343
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:55,219
and notice he says our labor be in vain.

344
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:00,379
But now, when Timotheus came from you unto us,

345
00:24:00,379 --> 00:24:04,159
and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity,

346
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,279
and that ye have good remembrance of us,

347
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:10,679
always desiring greatly to see us as we also to see you.

348
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:14,319
Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you

349
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:17,279
in all our affliction and distress by your faith,

350
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,239
for now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord,

351
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:23,039
for what thanks can we render to God again for you,

352
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,039
for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes

353
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,000
before our God night and day,

354
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,599
praying exceedingly that we might see your face

355
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:34,319
and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith.

356
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:36,959
And so we find that Paul is rejoicing,

357
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:40,519
he's saying listen, this church, they continued

358
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:43,079
even though they faced opposition.

359
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,959
Notice in the second letter,

360
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:47,759
2 Thessalonians chapter one,

361
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,139
notice what God tells us with regard to this church,

362
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:53,679
and they continued through opposition,

363
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,319
we see it in chapter three of the first letter,

364
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:58,679
but now in 2 Thessalonians chapter number one,

365
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:00,699
we looked at verse three a moment ago,

366
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,679
but look at verse number four,

367
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:04,519
in 2 Thessalonians one and verse four,

368
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:08,979
so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God,

369
00:25:08,979 --> 00:25:12,599
notice for your patience and faith

370
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:17,599
in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure.

371
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:24,500
Paul said, this church, God said,

372
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,779
this church, they continued through opposition,

373
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:30,799
they faced the opposition, but they didn't quit,

374
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,039
they didn't turn back, they didn't say,

375
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,599
listen, this isn't what we signed up for,

376
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,199
this isn't what we didn't, life was easy before we,

377
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:39,639
no, no, no, they continued,

378
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:41,559
even though they faced the opposition,

379
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:44,440
they dealt with the persecutions and the tribulations

380
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,759
that are mentioned in 2 Thessalonians one and verse four,

381
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:51,759
and he says that ye endure, they continued,

382
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:53,739
even though they faced the opposition,

383
00:25:53,739 --> 00:25:55,440
they were growing spiritually,

384
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,000
even though they faced the opposition,

385
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,839
they were examples to other believers,

386
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:02,239
perhaps in one particular area of continuing

387
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:06,959
in spite of opposition, though they faced opposition,

388
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:09,639
they were actively sharing the gospel,

389
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:13,079
wow, that's exciting, the fifth reason

390
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:15,359
that I would say this church is a model church

391
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:19,399
is that they love the brethren, they love the brethren,

392
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:21,639
you know, Jesus said this in John 13,

393
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:25,359
and you can take a moment and turn over there,

394
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:27,959
in John chapter 13, the Lord Jesus Christ

395
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:29,500
washed the feet of the disciples,

396
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,519
began giving instruction with regard to his departure,

397
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:35,519
and in this particular text of scripture,

398
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:38,759
he says that he's giving them a new commandment,

399
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:41,519
and it's recorded for us in John 13 in verse 34,

400
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:43,759
he says a new commandment I give unto you,

401
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:46,279
that you love one another as I have loved you,

402
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:48,319
that you also love one another,

403
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:51,059
by this shall all men know that you're my disciples,

404
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:54,000
if you have love one to another,

405
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,559
and we find that as we look at the church in Thessalonica,

406
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,539
they were a church that was known for loving the brethren,

407
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:01,959
notice what the Bible says, if you will,

408
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:04,899
in chapter number four of 1 Thessalonians,

409
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,739
in 1 Thessalonians chapter four,

410
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:11,019
we mentioned already in the first chapter,

411
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:12,500
he talked about their labor of love,

412
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,940
but now we see specifically talking about brotherly love,

413
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,500
or this loving the brethren,

414
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,199
we see the book of 1 John deals with this

415
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:22,500
quite a bit as well, but as written to a local church,

416
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,739
we find that they're commended

417
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:26,619
with regard to their brotherly love,

418
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:29,779
notice in verse number nine of 1 Thessalonians four,

419
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:31,099
the apostle Paul says this,

420
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:33,459
but as touching brotherly love,

421
00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:35,539
you need not that I write unto you,

422
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:40,359
for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another,

423
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:43,159
we can see as we just read in John 13 and verse 34,

424
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:47,059
how God, the Lord Jesus Christ gave that instruction

425
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:50,139
before his departure, and we find in verse 10,

426
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:55,139
notice what he says, and indeed ye do it,

427
00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:57,599
you do what, you love one another,

428
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:03,599
toward all the brethren, which are in all Macedonia,

429
00:28:04,879 --> 00:28:07,279
now I love the way that this is worded,

430
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,319
because he says that you do it toward all the brethren,

431
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:12,619
not just the ones that you get along with most,

432
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:16,359
amen, not just the ones that you kind of,

433
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:18,759
you know, we kind of connect with better than,

434
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:22,000
no, no, he says that you love, why?

435
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,879
Because we're taught of God to love the brethren,

436
00:28:24,879 --> 00:28:27,039
and he says here that you do it,

437
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:29,359
but then notice what he says,

438
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:31,440
but we beseech you at the end of verse number 10,

439
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,339
brethren, that ye increase more and more,

440
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:40,359
we mentioned that in 2 Thessalonians 1 and verse number 3,

441
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:42,959
he talked about how your love or your charity

442
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:46,399
of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth,

443
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,119
and we find here in chapter four of the first letter,

444
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,440
that Paul says that ye know,

445
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,640
you're taught of God with regard to brotherly love,

446
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,559
and indeed you do it,

447
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:00,599
but he says that ye increase more and more,

448
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:03,679
and we find even as I mentioned a few moments ago,

449
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,839
that we never arrive in the Christian life,

450
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:08,399
and though they're commended for their love,

451
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,080
their love for the brethren,

452
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,279
and though they're an example for us,

453
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:15,039
and they're a model church in that regard,

454
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:20,039
that Paul still says increase, increase more and more,

455
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,039
and we find that as we look at this particular church,

456
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,880
this church in Thessalonica,

457
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,719
this church that we're gonna study these principles

458
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:29,640
at the end of 1 Thessalonians 5,

459
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,320
and at the end of 2 Thessalonians 3

460
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,640
over the next several months,

461
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,119
and consider this subject matter of walk worthy,

462
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,719
and please God,

463
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:39,200
some could give the argument,

464
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,359
they're already pleasing God,

465
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,119
sure they were,

466
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,200
but they needed to continue,

467
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,880
there were some principles that were necessary

468
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,599
for them to be given,

469
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:53,399
for them to be taught that they needed to know,

470
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:55,679
and implement in their lives,

471
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,399
so that they could walk worthy.

472
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:06,439
please God. And God has providentially preserved these two letters. No, we're not the church

473
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:11,479
of the Thessalonians. We're not the church in Thessalonica, but we are a local New Testament

474
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:16,159
church. We're a church just like churches for the last couple thousand years have had

475
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:21,879
the opportunity to read and study these books and to understand that God has given instruction

476
00:30:21,879 --> 00:30:27,819
to a local church. He's preserved it for every generation of believers so that we too can

477
00:30:27,819 --> 00:30:32,579
look at this instruction and say, we need to know this and then implement this in our

478
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:40,679
lives as a body of believers so that we might walk worthy and please God. Over the next

479
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:46,059
several months, we're going to begin in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse number 12 next Wednesday,

480
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:49,519
we're going to begin there and we're going to take our time going through each of these

481
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:54,839
principles and seeking to understand them because this is, listen, the Bible says of

482
00:30:54,839 --> 00:31:00,819
itself that all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable. It's profitable.

483
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:07,119
And here we find that the instruction contained in the conclusion, in the concluding remarks

484
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:12,559
in both of these letters to the same local church is profitable instruction for each

485
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:19,039
of us still today in 2024 and we must take heed to it so that we could say, we want to

486
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:25,919
walk worthy and please God. Walk worthy and please God. Let's pray. Father, we love you.

487
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,679
We thank you for loving us. We thank you for the privilege that you've given us to gather

488
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,679
tonight. We thank you, God, for your word and for the truth that you've given us. We

489
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:40,079
thank you for the opportunity that we have to study these two important books. We thank

490
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,399
you, God, for the church at Thessalonica and as we had an opportunity just for a little

491
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:49,199
while this evening to look at these five reasons that we might conclude that this church

492
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:54,759
is a model church and Lord, we thank you for their testimony. We thank you for their example,

493
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:58,299
but Lord, we understand that over the next several months as we study these portions

494
00:31:58,299 --> 00:32:02,799
of scripture that even though they were a model church, they were still given instruction

495
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:08,819
principles that they needed to know and implement so that they might walk worthy and please

496
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:14,039
them. Lord, I pray that our heart tonight, that our heart over these next several months

497
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:20,119
as we study these principles would be a heart that would desire to walk worthy and to please

498
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:24,679
God. I pray, Lord, that you'd bless our time of prayer. We thank you for the opportunity

499
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:29,919
that we have on Wednesday evenings to gather, not only to study your word, but to pray corporately.

500
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,199
We thank you for the power of prayer. We pray that you'd work through every aspect of this

501
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:39,199
service and we'll thank you for it. In Christ's name we pray. Amen.
