WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
book of First Thessalonians, nor the second book of Thessalonians. However, over the next

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.520
several months, we're going to study through these two books and really looking at the

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.799
concluding statements that are made in each of the books. I've titled the series, Walkworthy

00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:22.520
and Please God. Walkworthy and Please God. And so on Wednesday nights, for the next several

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:29.520
months, we're going to have this subject matter of Walkworthy and Please God. On Sunday evening,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.279
the last service of 2023, I preached a message from the book of Ecclesiastes, and here the

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:39.000
conclusion of the whole matter. This is the whole duty of man. What was it? Fear God and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.240
keep His commandments. And we find that as we come to the New Testament, even as we mentioned

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.479
on Sunday evening, looking at Ephesians 5 and verse number 10, and a number of other

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:52.520
passages in the New Testament as well, that we find that in the New Testament, God has

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.240
given us instruction as a local church on how we are to behave. In fact, in 1 Timothy

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.919
3 and verse 15, in a few months, we'll get to that portion of Scripture. We find that

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:06.839
the Bible says that Timothy is receiving this instruction in Paul so that if I tarry long,

00:01:06.839 --> 00:01:12.040
that thou know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God. And we understand

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.040
that there is appropriate behavior in God's house, and there is that behavior that would

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.319
please God. As we think about the church at Thessalonica, and really this evening starting

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:26.639
an introductory kind of a lesson to this series of Walkworthy and Please God, I've titled

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:32.199
the message tonight, Simply Walkworthy. And as we think about the church at Thessalonica,

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:36.160
it was during the second missionary journey that the Apostle Paul was used of the Lord

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.680
to travel to the city of Thessalonica. As best we can tell, because of the opposition

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.839
that was faced, Paul was there for just a brief time. We'll look at Acts 17 here in

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:50.080
just a moment. But we find that God would use the Apostle Paul, under the inspiration

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.559
of the Holy Spirit of God, to write two letters to this church at Thessalonica. Notice, if

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:59.160
you will, in 1 Thessalonians 2 and verse number 12, and I'm going to read the two

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.160
verses that we're going to use really as theme verses as we study here on Wednesday evenings

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.160
this thought of Walkworthy and Please God. In 1 Thessalonians 2 and verse number 12,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.199
the Bible says that you would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:21.779
and glory. Then skip over, if you will, to 1 Thessalonians chapter number 4, and look

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:29.179
at verse 1. The Bible says, furthermore then, we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:35.300
the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us, notice, how you ought to walk and to

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:43.339
please God, so you would abound more and more, for ye know what commandments we gave you

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:49.339
by the Lord Jesus. We mentioned on Sunday evening about fearing God and keeping his

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.460
commandments. We looked at a number of passages in the book of Deuteronomy specifically, where

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.860
the Bible said that we're to know all of his commandments at all times. And we find that

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.740
as Paul would write here to the church at Thessalonica, he says, for ye know what commandments

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.740
we gave you by the Lord Jesus in verse 2 of chapter 4. As you take the content of 1 and

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:16.619
2 Thessalonians and you think about this local church, God is giving this church instruction

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:22.380
with regard to how they can walk worthy and please God. As we begin to think about the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.139
ministry in Thessalonica and the opposition that was faced, if you hold your place here

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:31.899
and turn back to Acts 17, we'll just look very briefly at these few verses and see what

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:39.539
happened there as this church was established. In Acts 17 and verse number 1, we'll just

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:44.059
look at a few verses here. The Bible says, now when they had passed through Amphipolis

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:50.779
and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica. Notice the Bible says where was a synagogue

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:57.100
of the Jews. And Paul, according to verse number 2, as his manner was, went in unto

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:03.779
them and three Sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures. He used the Old

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:07.699
Testament. He used the word of God. He used the scriptures that are available. Notice

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:11.300
the Bible says that he did this for three Sabbath days. That's why we understand that

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.100
it was a short period of time that Paul was there in Thessalonica. Notice in verse 3,

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.220
what is he giving them? What is he teaching them? Opening and alleging that Christ must

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:29.140
needs have suffered and risen again from the dead. And that this Jesus whom I preach unto

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:35.299
you is Christ. Now there's a whole message right in verse number 3 with regard to the

00:04:35.299 --> 00:04:40.179
message that the Apostle Paul is delivering to these Jewish folks at this synagogue in

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:47.220
Thessalonica. And the name Jesus means Jehovah is salvation, God incarnate. When he, Paul,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.220
would reference Jesus, they would understand that the individual, the person that he was

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.779
speaking of. And we find that he says that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ.

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:04.940
He is the anointed one. He is the Messiah. He is the Son of God, God in flesh. And we

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.820
find that the Bible says in verse number 4, some of them believed and consorted with

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.100
Paul and Silas, some of the devout Greeks, a great multitude, and of the chief women

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:21.339
not a few. But the Jews which believed not moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:26.239
fellows of the baser sort, and gathered company, and set all the city of an uproar, and assaulted

00:05:26.239 --> 00:05:30.980
the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people. And so we find that due

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.380
to the opposition, again, Paul was not there in Thessalonica for a long time. He would

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.980
be sent to Berea, if you continue to read through, and we're not going to take the time

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.940
to do so, but we find that in verse number 10, the brethren sent Paul and Silas away.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.299
They sent him to Berea, and he's not in Berea very long. And the people from Thessalonica

00:05:50.299 --> 00:05:56.940
that were upset, that caused the uproar, they follow him to Berea, and Paul ends up in Athens.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.040
And we find that when he's in Athens, of course he's there, and his spirit is moved

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.019
within him because he sees a city that is wholly given to idolatry, and he preaches

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:10.739
to them Christ. But we find that in this brief time that the Apostle Paul was in Thessalonica,

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:16.019
that the gospel was preached, souls were saved, and a local church was established. And that's

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:21.579
exciting for us to understand how God moved and worked through this second missionary

00:06:21.579 --> 00:06:27.899
journey to see a local church established. Now, we find that God, again, as I mentioned

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:33.059
a few moments ago, would use Paul to then write these two letters, 1 Thessalonians and

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:38.779
2 Thessalonians, back to this church that was established on this second missionary

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:45.420
journey. In many ways, the church in Thessalonica is a model church. We use that terminology.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.540
You've heard me use it before. I've said something like this, there's no perfect church, there's

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:55.179
no perfect church members, there's no perfect pastor. We're all sinners saved by grace,

00:06:55.179 --> 00:06:59.980
and we're not perfect, but we serve a perfect God. We have a perfect book, and we ought

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:06.059
to be thankful for that. But we understand that this church that we find in Thessalonica,

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:11.440
really in a number of ways, is a model church. As you study through 1 and 2 Thessalonians,

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.779
you will discover much for which this church will be commended for. However, in the conclusion

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:24.019
of each letter, in 1 Thessalonians chapter 1, excuse me, chapter 5, verses 12-28, and

00:07:24.019 --> 00:07:30.380
2 Thessalonians chapter 3, verses 6-18, in each of the conclusions of these two letters,

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:37.100
we find that Paul leaves the believers with practical instruction. The practical instruction

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:42.420
that he gives them is so that they might walk worthy and please God. Just as we've titled

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:47.420
this mini-series over the next several months, we've looked at the verses already in 1 Thessalonians

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:53.059
2, 12, and chapter 4, verses 1-2, and we find that this instruction is provided so

00:07:53.059 --> 00:07:58.940
that these believers, this church at Thessalonica, this body of believers, that they could walk

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:07.540
worthy and please God. God has providentially preserved this instruction for every generation

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:12.179
of believers. Now that's exciting. I'm thankful that God would give the instruction to the

00:08:12.179 --> 00:08:17.220
church at Thessalonica, hey, here's some instruction, here's some practical instruction on how you

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:24.260
can walk worthy and how you can please God. But then God providentially preserved that

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:30.579
for every generation of believers. Therefore, we conclude that the principles in the closing

00:08:30.579 --> 00:08:36.299
verses of each of these books are to be known and implemented by every local church. We

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:40.619
find that as God would preserve it, He didn't preserve it so that we could just look back

00:08:40.619 --> 00:08:44.539
a couple of thousand years at a church and say, well, that was good instruction for that

00:08:44.539 --> 00:08:50.340
church. No, our God is an eternal God. He has no beginning, no ending, and He gave instruction

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:55.580
to this local church in Thessalonica. He's preserved it for us so that we can take those

00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:02.320
principles and we can know them and we can implement them so that we can walk worthy

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:08.679
and please God. Now, over the next several months, we will examine those principles to

00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:13.659
ensure that we can know them and implement them. Again, chapter number 5, beginning in

00:09:13.659 --> 00:09:17.700
verse number 12, going through the end of the chapter. And then in 2 Thessalonians chapter

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.419
number 3, beginning in verse number 6 and going through the end of the chapter. There

00:09:21.419 --> 00:09:26.780
are a number of principles. In fact, as you read the latter part of 1 Thessalonians chapter

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:32.219
number 5, really beginning in verse number 16, it's like just, bam, bullet points almost

00:09:32.219 --> 00:09:36.960
of just practical instruction for the church. And so we're going to take the time over the

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:43.960
next several months to dig into these principles so that we, as a local church, just as the

00:09:44.039 --> 00:09:51.039
church at Thessalonica could take and incorporate these principles, abide by them, thus pleasing

00:09:51.359 --> 00:09:57.919
God and walking worthy that we too can do that same thing. Tonight, before we jump into

00:09:57.919 --> 00:09:59.799
the latter portion of these books...

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:04.719
Tonight I want to briefly examine this church at Thessalonica and really consider why it

00:10:04.719 --> 00:10:10.119
is that so often we refer to this church as being a model church.

00:10:10.119 --> 00:10:14.719
There are five truths that I want to look at briefly through these two books this evening

00:10:14.719 --> 00:10:19.919
that would give us reason to say the church at Thessalonica is a model church.

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:22.639
Now why am I laying this groundwork?

00:10:22.639 --> 00:10:26.759
We could understand if God is writing to the church in Corinth and saying, hey, here's

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:29.639
some things that you need to do to walk worthy and please God.

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:30.639
Why?

00:10:30.639 --> 00:10:32.319
Because the church at Corinth was a mess.

00:10:32.319 --> 00:10:37.079
The church at Corinth had divisions and all sorts of problems that were going on in Corinth.

00:10:37.079 --> 00:10:41.799
In fact, you can go through the book of 1 Corinthians and you can find 12 or 15 different

00:10:41.799 --> 00:10:47.079
things that were going on in Corinth that would help us to understand the church in

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:50.839
Corinth was in no way, shape, or form a model church.

00:10:50.839 --> 00:10:52.279
They needed some instruction.

00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:53.799
They needed to apply some things.

00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:58.719
They were just all sorts of divisions and contentions that were prevalent within that

00:10:58.719 --> 00:10:59.839
local church.

00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:04.719
But we look at a church like Thessalonica, we say, man, this is a model church.

00:11:04.719 --> 00:11:05.719
This is a good church.

00:11:05.719 --> 00:11:10.479
This is a church that's doing something for God, and they were.

00:11:10.479 --> 00:11:18.079
And yet, at the end of each book, God gives them a list of principles and says, listen,

00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:22.959
if you want to walk worthy and you want to please me, here's some things that you need

00:11:22.959 --> 00:11:25.959
to be aware of and that you need to implement.

00:11:25.959 --> 00:11:31.239
One thing that I find in our Christian life is that we never arrive.

00:11:31.239 --> 00:11:32.479
We never arrive.

00:11:32.479 --> 00:11:35.119
There's always room for spiritual growth.

00:11:35.119 --> 00:11:38.159
We find that there's never time for days off.

00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:41.679
There's never time that we can just kind of throw in the towel and say, man, we can coast

00:11:41.679 --> 00:11:43.319
for a little while.

00:11:43.319 --> 00:11:47.759
Because if you decide to do that, then before long you're going to be going backwards instead

00:11:47.759 --> 00:11:48.919
of going forward.

00:11:48.919 --> 00:11:54.639
Our theme, continue, the idea to persevere, to go on, to continue, to move forward.

00:11:54.639 --> 00:11:56.879
We're not just sitting on the premises.

00:11:56.879 --> 00:12:00.199
We're not just in a defensive posture.

00:12:00.199 --> 00:12:04.599
We're to be going forth with the gospel of Jesus Christ, continuing, and we find that

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:10.439
even for a model church, a church that is commended for a number of things, we find

00:12:10.439 --> 00:12:16.599
that there is instruction, practical principles that are given to them in each of these letters

00:12:16.919 --> 00:12:20.319
whereby God is saying, listen, don't forget these things.

00:12:20.319 --> 00:12:26.679
Remember to continue doing these things, and in so doing, you will walk worthy and please

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:27.679
God.

00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:33.599
Number one on why this church, why I would say this church is a model church, number

00:12:33.599 --> 00:12:37.319
one, they were growing spiritually.

00:12:37.319 --> 00:12:39.539
They were growing spiritually.

00:12:39.539 --> 00:12:44.119
So often we speak about the importance of growing numerically, and no doubt that is

00:12:44.119 --> 00:12:50.479
a byproduct of spiritual growth, and a church should be growing numerically, and we desire

00:12:50.479 --> 00:12:55.639
to grow numerically, but we must understand the importance of a church growing spiritually,

00:12:55.639 --> 00:12:59.639
of individual believers growing spiritually.

00:12:59.639 --> 00:13:04.119
The Bible tells us as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow

00:13:04.119 --> 00:13:05.119
thereby.

00:13:05.119 --> 00:13:09.159
And we find that this church, I would say, is a model church because they were growing

00:13:09.159 --> 00:13:10.159
spiritually.

00:13:10.159 --> 00:13:12.199
They were members of this church.

00:13:12.199 --> 00:13:14.599
Remember the church is not a building.

00:13:14.599 --> 00:13:19.879
The church is the believers, the people of God, and they were growing spiritually.

00:13:19.879 --> 00:13:22.799
Look in 1 Thessalonians chapter 1.

00:13:22.799 --> 00:13:26.999
Look what the Bible says in verse number 3, and then we're going to go over to 2 Thessalonians

00:13:26.999 --> 00:13:30.939
chapter 1 and just make a quick comparison, and I want you to see how they were growing

00:13:30.939 --> 00:13:32.199
spiritually.

00:13:32.199 --> 00:13:35.999
The period of time between writing the first and second book of Thessalonians is not really

00:13:35.999 --> 00:13:42.439
that long, and we find that Paul, as he's writing these two letters, in fact many would

00:13:42.439 --> 00:13:48.159
have these dated in the same year, maybe just a mere number of months in between the two

00:13:48.159 --> 00:13:52.879
writings, and we find that in chapter 1 of the first book, in verse number 3, notice

00:13:52.879 --> 00:14:01.039
what Paul says, remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience

00:14:01.039 --> 00:14:07.559
of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of God and our Father.

00:14:07.559 --> 00:14:11.719
And so we see that their work of faith, their labor of love, their patience of hope are

00:14:11.719 --> 00:14:13.879
referenced in verse number 3 of chapter 1.

00:14:13.879 --> 00:14:20.940
Turn over to 2 Thessalonians chapter 1, and notice what Paul says, again mere months perhaps

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:26.139
between the two writings of these letters, and we find that Paul, as he's again thanking

00:14:26.379 --> 00:14:31.099
God for these believers in Thessalonica, in 2 Thessalonians 1 and verse number 3, notice

00:14:31.099 --> 00:14:37.440
what Paul says, we are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is me.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:45.139
Notice what he says, because that your faith, did you see what it says, groweth exceedingly.

00:14:45.139 --> 00:14:47.579
I like that verbiage, don't you?

00:14:47.579 --> 00:14:50.959
The Bible says, and then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:54.419
We find that Paul, as he's writing, again under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of

00:14:54.419 --> 00:14:59.459
God, he mentions their faith in the first book, but now as he's writing the second book,

00:14:59.459 --> 00:15:04.839
he says, listen, we're thanking God because we're understanding that your faith groweth,

00:15:04.839 --> 00:15:06.839
and he says it groweth exceedingly.

00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:12.859
Now I'm not sure in your mind's eye, in your sanctified imagination, what you think of

00:15:12.859 --> 00:15:15.759
when you hear that term groweth exceedingly.

00:15:15.759 --> 00:15:18.799
I appreciate that word exceedingly.

00:15:18.799 --> 00:15:22.679
He doesn't just say that your faith groweth, that would be sufficient, it would help us

00:15:22.739 --> 00:15:26.259
to see that there was some growth, there was some progress that's being made, but notice

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:29.619
Paul says that your faith groweth exceedingly.

00:15:29.619 --> 00:15:32.119
Man, this is exciting.

00:15:32.119 --> 00:15:38.500
Notice he continues and says, and the charity, that's the love of every one of you all toward

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.459
each other, then notice the word, aboundeth.

00:15:41.459 --> 00:15:48.500
Man, this is exciting to see the spiritual growth of this church in Thessalonica.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:54.979
We begin to look at this church and we begin to say, why is it that I would say, why is

00:15:54.979 --> 00:16:00.459
it that theologians of yesteryear would say that the church of Thessalonica is a model

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:01.459
church?

00:16:01.459 --> 00:16:05.339
Number one, that I've looked through these books and I've come up with is that they were

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:07.379
growing spiritually.

00:16:07.379 --> 00:16:12.259
Number two, number two, they were examples to other believers.

00:16:12.259 --> 00:16:16.779
Turn back to the first book, if you will, of Thessalonians, 1 Thessalonians chapter

00:16:16.779 --> 00:16:21.379
1, and we find that they were examples.

00:16:21.379 --> 00:16:25.619
I'm thankful that the Lord Jesus Christ is our example.

00:16:25.619 --> 00:16:30.659
Peter mentions that, that he left us an example that we should follow his steps, but we find

00:16:30.659 --> 00:16:35.659
that we understand the importance of being examples to others.

00:16:35.659 --> 00:16:40.419
Remember the Apostle Paul, he mentioned about be ye followers of me even as I also am of

00:16:40.419 --> 00:16:41.419
Christ.

00:16:41.579 --> 00:16:43.119
We find that in the church at Corinth.

00:16:43.119 --> 00:16:47.899
We find that he says to Timothy, the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses,

00:16:47.899 --> 00:16:52.659
the same commit thou to faithful men, which we'll be able to teach others also in 2 Timothy

00:16:52.659 --> 00:16:54.779
chapter number 2.

00:16:54.779 --> 00:17:00.419
And we find for this church in Thessalonica, they were examples to other believers.

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:06.940
Notice in 1 Thessalonians 1 and verse number 7, the Bible says so that ye, that's the church,

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:14.179
the believers at the church in Thessalonica, so that ye were in samples to all that believe

00:17:14.179 --> 00:17:18.419
in Macedonia and Achaia.

00:17:18.419 --> 00:17:24.179
Now when he says that you are in sample or an example, I find that as I look at the book

00:17:24.179 --> 00:17:27.859
and I look at the context that this is given in a positive fashion.

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:33.699
He's not saying that you were an example of what not to do, no, you were an example of

00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:39.299
what to do and the proper way to receive God's word.

00:17:39.299 --> 00:17:43.859
In fact, in chapter 2 and verse number 13, the Bible says for this cause also thank we

00:17:43.859 --> 00:17:48.819
God without ceasing because when you receive the word of God which ye heard of us, notice

00:17:48.819 --> 00:17:54.299
you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God which effectually

00:17:54.299 --> 00:17:58.039
worketh also in you that believe.

00:17:58.039 --> 00:18:03.119
And so their approach and their receiving of God's word, that was an example.

00:18:03.119 --> 00:18:07.720
And it was an example to these other believers, these people that heard the gospel in Macedonia

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:14.139
and Achaia, and Paul says that you believers in Thessalonica, you were an example.

00:18:14.139 --> 00:18:19.440
Number three, why is this church, the church at Thessalonica, why are they a model church?

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.279
Well I would say number three, they were actively sharing the gospel, they were actively sharing

00:18:24.279 --> 00:18:25.599
the gospel.

00:18:25.599 --> 00:18:30.159
They were growing spiritually, they were examples to other believers, but they were actively

00:18:30.159 --> 00:18:31.679
sharing the gospel.

00:18:31.679 --> 00:18:38.359
And what a blessing to see in verse number eight of 1 Thessalonians 1 how that God references

00:18:38.359 --> 00:18:40.640
their work of sharing the gospel.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:45.679
Paul says it this way, unto the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, for from you, again

00:18:45.679 --> 00:18:50.359
remember he's writing to the church of the Thessalonians according to 1 1, he says for

00:18:50.359 --> 00:18:56.519
from you sounded out the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also

00:18:56.519 --> 00:19:03.519
in every place your faith to God's word is spread abroad so that we need not to speak

00:19:03.519 --> 00:19:04.519
anything.

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:09.979
And that's pretty exciting, a church.

00:19:09.979 --> 00:19:15.640
The apostle Paul, best we can tell from Acts 17, is there for just a very brief time as

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:20.799
God would lead him on that second missionary journey to go to the city of Thessalonica,

00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:25.359
but there was great opposition, but in those few weeks that he had the opportunity to be

00:19:25.359 --> 00:19:30.440
there, the word of God was preached, souls were saved, a church was established, and

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:37.000
now as this church is being written to, and we look throughout these two letters, we find

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.239
that there's much for which they can be commended for.

00:19:40.239 --> 00:19:45.279
Many reasons that we can go to this church and say this is a model church, they were

00:19:45.279 --> 00:19:50.760
actively sharing the gospel, they understood the power of the gospel, they understood how

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.719
they had been saved, and because of their salvation and because of understanding the

00:19:56.719 --> 00:19:59.799
power of the gospel, they then wanted to...

00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:01.879
share that truth with others.

00:20:01.879 --> 00:20:03.839
We shared a prayer letter update

00:20:03.839 --> 00:20:06.279
from a missionary just a few weeks ago.

00:20:06.279 --> 00:20:10.079
And as we talked about that missionary over in Africa,

00:20:10.079 --> 00:20:11.839
and we talked about in Uganda there,

00:20:11.839 --> 00:20:14.999
how this one young man trusted Christ as his savior.

00:20:14.999 --> 00:20:17.039
And after he trusted Christ as his savior,

00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:19.399
he wanted to go back to his own village

00:20:19.399 --> 00:20:22.159
to be able to tell his friends and his family

00:20:22.159 --> 00:20:24.659
about the Lord, tell them about Jesus Christ.

00:20:24.659 --> 00:20:25.499
Why?

00:20:25.499 --> 00:20:26.679
Because his life had been changed.

00:20:26.679 --> 00:20:29.239
He understood what the gospel did for him,

00:20:29.279 --> 00:20:32.559
and he goes back to his village there in Uganda,

00:20:32.559 --> 00:20:34.799
and there's a dozen and a half people

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:36.919
that trust Christ as their savior.

00:20:36.919 --> 00:20:38.239
That's exciting.

00:20:38.239 --> 00:20:41.599
And we find that here, this church in Thessalonica,

00:20:41.599 --> 00:20:44.959
they were actively sharing the gospel.

00:20:44.959 --> 00:20:48.099
They understood that God had saved them,

00:20:48.099 --> 00:20:51.159
and they had a responsibility to grow spiritually.

00:20:51.159 --> 00:20:52.759
They had a responsibility to be an example

00:20:52.759 --> 00:20:55.079
to other believers, but they had a responsibility

00:20:55.079 --> 00:20:57.919
to actively share the gospel.

00:20:57.919 --> 00:20:59.839
Number four, I would say this.

00:20:59.839 --> 00:21:03.199
Why is the church in Thessalonica a model church?

00:21:03.199 --> 00:21:07.319
Well, number four, they continued through opposition.

00:21:07.319 --> 00:21:10.839
They continued through opposition.

00:21:10.839 --> 00:21:13.519
In 1 Thessalonians 3, I want you to notice

00:21:13.519 --> 00:21:14.519
what the Bible says.

00:21:14.519 --> 00:21:17.359
In verse number one, Paul says,

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:19.719
wherefore, when we could no longer forbear,

00:21:19.719 --> 00:21:23.079
we thought it good to be left in Athens alone,

00:21:23.079 --> 00:21:25.879
and sent Timotheus our brother, and minister of God,

00:21:25.879 --> 00:21:28.999
and fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ

00:21:28.999 --> 00:21:32.119
to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith.

00:21:32.119 --> 00:21:34.999
Now, again, I mentioned briefly from Acts 17

00:21:34.999 --> 00:21:37.119
the opposition that they face,

00:21:37.119 --> 00:21:40.199
and they say these that have turned the world upside down

00:21:40.199 --> 00:21:43.039
have come hither also in that passage of Scripture,

00:21:43.039 --> 00:21:45.879
and Paul and Silas, they go down to Berea,

00:21:45.879 --> 00:21:47.719
and then they chase them down to Berea,

00:21:47.719 --> 00:21:49.719
and Paul ends up in Athens,

00:21:49.719 --> 00:21:51.579
and so Paul is referencing that

00:21:51.579 --> 00:21:53.519
in verse number one of chapter three,

00:21:53.519 --> 00:21:55.759
and he says we no longer could forbear.

00:21:56.599 --> 00:21:59.319
Paul was concerned about these believers in Thessalonica.

00:21:59.319 --> 00:22:01.279
He knew that they received the gospel,

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:03.719
they had been saved, but he knew the opposition

00:22:03.719 --> 00:22:06.639
was so great that he and others had to flee,

00:22:06.639 --> 00:22:09.339
and so he's saying we could no longer forbear,

00:22:09.339 --> 00:22:10.959
so what do we do?

00:22:10.959 --> 00:22:13.239
We sent Timothy, and Timothy was gonna come,

00:22:13.239 --> 00:22:16.759
and he was going to establish you and to comfort you.

00:22:16.759 --> 00:22:19.679
Notice in verse number three that no man

00:22:19.679 --> 00:22:23.279
should be moved by these afflictions.

00:22:23.279 --> 00:22:28.279
For yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto,

00:22:28.359 --> 00:22:31.559
and you think about the truth of yea,

00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:33.439
all those that live godly in Christ Jesus

00:22:33.439 --> 00:22:34.819
shall suffer persecution.

00:22:34.819 --> 00:22:38.359
Of course, that's in second Timothy three in verse 13,

00:22:38.359 --> 00:22:40.799
and we find here that Paul is saying listen,

00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:43.359
these afflictions that you're facing,

00:22:43.359 --> 00:22:45.999
it was our desire that you would not be moved

00:22:45.999 --> 00:22:47.079
by these afflictions.

00:22:47.079 --> 00:22:50.099
Again, that it would not cause you to give up,

00:22:50.099 --> 00:22:51.279
to turn back.

00:22:51.279 --> 00:22:53.719
In verse four, for verily when we were with you,

00:22:53.719 --> 00:22:56.839
we told you before that we should suffer tribulation

00:22:56.839 --> 00:22:59.599
even as it came to pass, and ye know.

00:22:59.599 --> 00:23:03.439
Now remember, I mentioned this on Sunday morning,

00:23:03.439 --> 00:23:06.699
the word persecution carries with it

00:23:06.699 --> 00:23:09.279
of the idea of harass or trouble

00:23:09.279 --> 00:23:13.919
with the intent or the purpose of making one run or flee,

00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:17.639
and he says in verse number four that we told you before

00:23:17.639 --> 00:23:19.799
that we should suffer tribulation

00:23:19.799 --> 00:23:21.879
even as it come to pass, and ye know.

00:23:21.879 --> 00:23:24.679
And so this tribulation, this persecution

00:23:24.679 --> 00:23:27.079
that they were facing, Paul was concerned,

00:23:27.079 --> 00:23:28.879
but I'm saying that they were a model church

00:23:28.879 --> 00:23:32.039
because they continued through the opposition.

00:23:32.039 --> 00:23:34.159
In verse number five it says for this cause,

00:23:34.159 --> 00:23:35.959
when I could no longer forbear,

00:23:35.959 --> 00:23:37.799
I sent to know your faith,

00:23:37.799 --> 00:23:41.319
lest by some means the tempter have tempted you,

00:23:41.319 --> 00:23:43.279
and our labor be in vain.

00:23:43.279 --> 00:23:45.579
Can you see the heart of Paul in verse number five?

00:23:45.579 --> 00:23:46.419
Who's the tempter?

00:23:46.419 --> 00:23:49.199
Well, that's the enemy, that's the devil,

00:23:49.199 --> 00:23:52.399
and he says lest the tempter have tempted you,

00:23:52.399 --> 00:23:55.219
and notice he says our labor be in vain.

00:23:56.279 --> 00:24:00.379
But now, when Timotheus came from you unto us,

00:24:00.379 --> 00:24:04.159
and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity,

00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:06.279
and that ye have good remembrance of us,

00:24:06.279 --> 00:24:10.679
always desiring greatly to see us as we also to see you.

00:24:10.679 --> 00:24:14.319
Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you

00:24:14.319 --> 00:24:17.279
in all our affliction and distress by your faith,

00:24:17.279 --> 00:24:20.239
for now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord,

00:24:20.239 --> 00:24:23.039
for what thanks can we render to God again for you,

00:24:23.039 --> 00:24:27.039
for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes

00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:29.000
before our God night and day,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.599
praying exceedingly that we might see your face

00:24:31.599 --> 00:24:34.319
and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith.

00:24:34.319 --> 00:24:36.959
And so we find that Paul is rejoicing,

00:24:36.959 --> 00:24:40.519
he's saying listen, this church, they continued

00:24:40.519 --> 00:24:43.079
even though they faced opposition.

00:24:43.079 --> 00:24:44.959
Notice in the second letter,

00:24:44.959 --> 00:24:47.759
2 Thessalonians chapter one,

00:24:47.759 --> 00:24:51.139
notice what God tells us with regard to this church,

00:24:51.139 --> 00:24:53.679
and they continued through opposition,

00:24:53.679 --> 00:24:56.319
we see it in chapter three of the first letter,

00:24:56.319 --> 00:24:58.679
but now in 2 Thessalonians chapter number one,

00:24:58.679 --> 00:25:00.699
we looked at verse three a moment ago,

00:25:00.699 --> 00:25:02.679
but look at verse number four,

00:25:02.679 --> 00:25:04.519
in 2 Thessalonians one and verse four,

00:25:04.519 --> 00:25:08.979
so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God,

00:25:08.979 --> 00:25:12.599
notice for your patience and faith

00:25:12.599 --> 00:25:17.599
in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure.

00:25:21.079 --> 00:25:24.500
Paul said, this church, God said,

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.779
this church, they continued through opposition,

00:25:28.779 --> 00:25:30.799
they faced the opposition, but they didn't quit,

00:25:30.799 --> 00:25:32.039
they didn't turn back, they didn't say,

00:25:32.039 --> 00:25:33.599
listen, this isn't what we signed up for,

00:25:33.599 --> 00:25:37.199
this isn't what we didn't, life was easy before we,

00:25:37.199 --> 00:25:39.639
no, no, no, they continued,

00:25:39.639 --> 00:25:41.559
even though they faced the opposition,

00:25:41.559 --> 00:25:44.440
they dealt with the persecutions and the tribulations

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.759
that are mentioned in 2 Thessalonians one and verse four,

00:25:46.759 --> 00:25:51.759
and he says that ye endure, they continued,

00:25:51.879 --> 00:25:53.739
even though they faced the opposition,

00:25:53.739 --> 00:25:55.440
they were growing spiritually,

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.000
even though they faced the opposition,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.839
they were examples to other believers,

00:25:58.839 --> 00:26:02.239
perhaps in one particular area of continuing

00:26:02.239 --> 00:26:06.959
in spite of opposition, though they faced opposition,

00:26:06.959 --> 00:26:09.639
they were actively sharing the gospel,

00:26:09.639 --> 00:26:13.079
wow, that's exciting, the fifth reason

00:26:13.079 --> 00:26:15.359
that I would say this church is a model church

00:26:16.279 --> 00:26:19.399
is that they love the brethren, they love the brethren,

00:26:19.399 --> 00:26:21.639
you know, Jesus said this in John 13,

00:26:21.639 --> 00:26:25.359
and you can take a moment and turn over there,

00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:27.959
in John chapter 13, the Lord Jesus Christ

00:26:27.959 --> 00:26:29.500
washed the feet of the disciples,

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:33.519
began giving instruction with regard to his departure,

00:26:33.519 --> 00:26:35.519
and in this particular text of scripture,

00:26:35.519 --> 00:26:38.759
he says that he's giving them a new commandment,

00:26:38.759 --> 00:26:41.519
and it's recorded for us in John 13 in verse 34,

00:26:41.519 --> 00:26:43.759
he says a new commandment I give unto you,

00:26:43.759 --> 00:26:46.279
that you love one another as I have loved you,

00:26:46.279 --> 00:26:48.319
that you also love one another,

00:26:48.319 --> 00:26:51.059
by this shall all men know that you're my disciples,

00:26:51.059 --> 00:26:54.000
if you have love one to another,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.559
and we find that as we look at the church in Thessalonica,

00:26:56.559 --> 00:27:00.539
they were a church that was known for loving the brethren,

00:27:00.539 --> 00:27:01.959
notice what the Bible says, if you will,

00:27:01.959 --> 00:27:04.899
in chapter number four of 1 Thessalonians,

00:27:05.799 --> 00:27:07.739
in 1 Thessalonians chapter four,

00:27:09.179 --> 00:27:11.019
we mentioned already in the first chapter,

00:27:11.019 --> 00:27:12.500
he talked about their labor of love,

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.940
but now we see specifically talking about brotherly love,

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.500
or this loving the brethren,

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.199
we see the book of 1 John deals with this

00:27:19.199 --> 00:27:22.500
quite a bit as well, but as written to a local church,

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.739
we find that they're commended

00:27:24.739 --> 00:27:26.619
with regard to their brotherly love,

00:27:26.619 --> 00:27:29.779
notice in verse number nine of 1 Thessalonians four,

00:27:29.779 --> 00:27:31.099
the apostle Paul says this,

00:27:31.099 --> 00:27:33.459
but as touching brotherly love,

00:27:33.459 --> 00:27:35.539
you need not that I write unto you,

00:27:35.539 --> 00:27:40.359
for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another,

00:27:40.359 --> 00:27:43.159
we can see as we just read in John 13 and verse 34,

00:27:43.159 --> 00:27:47.059
how God, the Lord Jesus Christ gave that instruction

00:27:47.059 --> 00:27:50.139
before his departure, and we find in verse 10,

00:27:50.139 --> 00:27:55.139
notice what he says, and indeed ye do it,

00:27:55.639 --> 00:27:57.599
you do what, you love one another,

00:27:58.599 --> 00:28:03.599
toward all the brethren, which are in all Macedonia,

00:28:04.879 --> 00:28:07.279
now I love the way that this is worded,

00:28:07.279 --> 00:28:10.319
because he says that you do it toward all the brethren,

00:28:10.319 --> 00:28:12.619
not just the ones that you get along with most,

00:28:13.839 --> 00:28:16.359
amen, not just the ones that you kind of,

00:28:16.359 --> 00:28:18.759
you know, we kind of connect with better than,

00:28:18.759 --> 00:28:22.000
no, no, he says that you love, why?

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.879
Because we're taught of God to love the brethren,

00:28:24.879 --> 00:28:27.039
and he says here that you do it,

00:28:27.479 --> 00:28:29.359
but then notice what he says,

00:28:29.359 --> 00:28:31.440
but we beseech you at the end of verse number 10,

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:36.339
brethren, that ye increase more and more,

00:28:37.479 --> 00:28:40.359
we mentioned that in 2 Thessalonians 1 and verse number 3,

00:28:40.359 --> 00:28:42.959
he talked about how your love or your charity

00:28:42.959 --> 00:28:46.399
of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth,

00:28:46.399 --> 00:28:49.119
and we find here in chapter four of the first letter,

00:28:49.119 --> 00:28:52.440
that Paul says that ye know,

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.640
you're taught of God with regard to brotherly love,

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.559
and indeed you do it,

00:28:57.559 --> 00:29:00.599
but he says that ye increase more and more,

00:29:00.599 --> 00:29:03.679
and we find even as I mentioned a few moments ago,

00:29:03.679 --> 00:29:05.839
that we never arrive in the Christian life,

00:29:05.839 --> 00:29:08.399
and though they're commended for their love,

00:29:08.399 --> 00:29:10.080
their love for the brethren,

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.279
and though they're an example for us,

00:29:12.279 --> 00:29:15.039
and they're a model church in that regard,

00:29:15.039 --> 00:29:20.039
that Paul still says increase, increase more and more,

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:23.039
and we find that as we look at this particular church,

00:29:23.039 --> 00:29:24.880
this church in Thessalonica,

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.719
this church that we're gonna study these principles

00:29:27.719 --> 00:29:29.640
at the end of 1 Thessalonians 5,

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.320
and at the end of 2 Thessalonians 3

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.640
over the next several months,

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:36.119
and consider this subject matter of walk worthy,

00:29:36.119 --> 00:29:37.719
and please God,

00:29:37.719 --> 00:29:39.200
some could give the argument,

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.359
they're already pleasing God,

00:29:42.239 --> 00:29:43.119
sure they were,

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.200
but they needed to continue,

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.880
there were some principles that were necessary

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.599
for them to be given,

00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:53.399
for them to be taught that they needed to know,

00:29:53.399 --> 00:29:55.679
and implement in their lives,

00:29:55.679 --> 00:29:59.399
so that they could walk worthy.

00:29:59.399 --> 00:30:06.439
please God. And God has providentially preserved these two letters. No, we're not the church

00:30:06.439 --> 00:30:11.479
of the Thessalonians. We're not the church in Thessalonica, but we are a local New Testament

00:30:11.479 --> 00:30:16.159
church. We're a church just like churches for the last couple thousand years have had

00:30:16.159 --> 00:30:21.879
the opportunity to read and study these books and to understand that God has given instruction

00:30:21.879 --> 00:30:27.819
to a local church. He's preserved it for every generation of believers so that we too can

00:30:27.819 --> 00:30:32.579
look at this instruction and say, we need to know this and then implement this in our

00:30:32.579 --> 00:30:40.679
lives as a body of believers so that we might walk worthy and please God. Over the next

00:30:40.679 --> 00:30:46.059
several months, we're going to begin in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse number 12 next Wednesday,

00:30:46.059 --> 00:30:49.519
we're going to begin there and we're going to take our time going through each of these

00:30:49.519 --> 00:30:54.839
principles and seeking to understand them because this is, listen, the Bible says of

00:30:54.839 --> 00:31:00.819
itself that all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable. It's profitable.

00:31:00.819 --> 00:31:07.119
And here we find that the instruction contained in the conclusion, in the concluding remarks

00:31:07.119 --> 00:31:12.559
in both of these letters to the same local church is profitable instruction for each

00:31:12.559 --> 00:31:19.039
of us still today in 2024 and we must take heed to it so that we could say, we want to

00:31:19.039 --> 00:31:25.919
walk worthy and please God. Walk worthy and please God. Let's pray. Father, we love you.

00:31:25.919 --> 00:31:29.679
We thank you for loving us. We thank you for the privilege that you've given us to gather

00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:33.679
tonight. We thank you, God, for your word and for the truth that you've given us. We

00:31:33.679 --> 00:31:40.079
thank you for the opportunity that we have to study these two important books. We thank

00:31:40.079 --> 00:31:44.399
you, God, for the church at Thessalonica and as we had an opportunity just for a little

00:31:44.399 --> 00:31:49.199
while this evening to look at these five reasons that we might conclude that this church

00:31:49.199 --> 00:31:54.759
is a model church and Lord, we thank you for their testimony. We thank you for their example,

00:31:54.759 --> 00:31:58.299
but Lord, we understand that over the next several months as we study these portions

00:31:58.299 --> 00:32:02.799
of scripture that even though they were a model church, they were still given instruction

00:32:02.799 --> 00:32:08.819
principles that they needed to know and implement so that they might walk worthy and please

00:32:08.819 --> 00:32:14.039
them. Lord, I pray that our heart tonight, that our heart over these next several months

00:32:14.079 --> 00:32:20.119
as we study these principles would be a heart that would desire to walk worthy and to please

00:32:20.119 --> 00:32:24.679
God. I pray, Lord, that you'd bless our time of prayer. We thank you for the opportunity

00:32:24.679 --> 00:32:29.919
that we have on Wednesday evenings to gather, not only to study your word, but to pray corporately.

00:32:29.919 --> 00:32:34.199
We thank you for the power of prayer. We pray that you'd work through every aspect of this

00:32:34.199 --> 00:32:39.199
service and we'll thank you for it. In Christ's name we pray. Amen.
