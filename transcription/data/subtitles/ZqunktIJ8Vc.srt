1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
know it, and they're working on it,

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,799
and so we're gonna be singing that

3
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:06,119
in Sunday school on Sunday.

4
00:00:06,119 --> 00:00:07,639
For those that are in Sunday school,

5
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:10,079
you know it's amazing when you put

6
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:12,260
a verse of scripture to a song,

7
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,479
how quickly you can memorize it,

8
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:16,000
and so I'm looking forward to being able

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,639
to learn that on Sunday morning.

10
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:19,600
And so let's say it together,

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,379
First Timothy 117, we'll say the reference

12
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:23,200
and then say the verse together.

13
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,200
Let's say it together.

14
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,799
First Timothy 117.

15
00:00:26,799 --> 00:00:31,120
Now unto the king eternal, immortal,

16
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,159
invisible, the only wise God,

17
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:40,159
be honor and glory forever and ever, amen.

18
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,240
Isn't that a great verse?

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,720
And certainly he is an awesome God,

20
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,040
and we certainly wanna give him the honor

21
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,599
and glory that is due unto his wonderful name.

22
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:53,240
I hope that you'd work on that,

23
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,000
and looking forward to the opportunity.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,319
I also wanna remind you that when we have

25
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:59,840
birthday fellowship here in the month of January,

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,520
a couple of weeks from this past Sunday,

27
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,680
so it won't be this upcoming Sunday,

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,839
but the following, we'll have the opportunity,

29
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:09,139
as Brother Jeff announced on Sunday night,

30
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:12,120
we're gonna have a little Bible quiz.

31
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,959
So the plan for birthday fellowship Sunday

32
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,220
is going forward is that I'll preach a shorter message.

33
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,160
Now that's the plan, amen.

34
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,080
And I'll preach a shorter message,

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,160
and we'll have 10 or 15 minutes for a Bible quiz

36
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,080
before we go over, so we'll still plan to be done

37
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,699
at seven o'clock, a normal end time on Sunday evenings.

38
00:01:30,699 --> 00:01:34,239
And this particular month, the month of January,

39
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,360
the Bible quiz will be centered around the life of Abraham,

40
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,879
the life of Abraham, and so you might wanna be doing

41
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,480
some studying in the book of Genesis

42
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,639
about the life of Abraham, and be prepared

43
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,099
to be able to answer some questions.

44
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:48,680
We'll have a great time of fellowship

45
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,800
and look forward to that, and I'm sure

46
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,400
that will be a blessing to you,

47
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,559
and I'm sure that even if you don't like the idea

48
00:01:56,559 --> 00:02:01,559
of a quiz, by you going and studying the life of Abraham,

49
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,440
it'll be beneficial for you, and so that's a blessing, amen.

50
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,520
First Thessalonians chapter five this evening.

51
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,500
First Thessalonians chapter five, verses 12 and 13.

52
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,320
We will not look at the very last phrase

53
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,759
of verse number 13, it'll be a study

54
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,800
for next Wednesday evening, but we'll look

55
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,919
at the entirety of verse 12 in the first portion

56
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,119
of verse 13.

57
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:22,919
As discussed last week, these two letters,

58
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,240
the letter of First Thessalonians,

59
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,759
letter of Second Thessalonians,

60
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,500
are written to the local church in Thessalonica.

61
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,580
By the way, I'm thankful for a local church.

62
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,960
I'm thankful that the church is not man's idea,

63
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,759
it's God's idea, and I'm thankful that this local church,

64
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:39,919
as we looked last week, we examined five characteristics

65
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:42,440
of the church at Thessalonica that really make

66
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,119
this church a model church, and I went through great lengths

67
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:49,179
last Wednesday evening to try to lay the groundwork

68
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:52,139
for this new study on Wednesday evenings.

69
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:57,139
The study, if you wanna use a title for the entire study,

70
00:02:57,339 --> 00:03:00,220
it's Walk Worthy, Please God.

71
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,539
Walk Worthy, Please God.

72
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:05,199
And we find that as Paul would be used to the Lord

73
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,979
to write to the church at Thessalonica,

74
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,419
it's a model church, a church that is commended,

75
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:11,940
a church that's doing a great work for God,

76
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,619
but we find at the end of chapter number five

77
00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:17,699
of the first letter, beginning in verse number 12,

78
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:21,460
then again in the end of the second letter

79
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,860
in chapter number three, beginning in verse number six,

80
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,539
we find that God gives this church in two different places

81
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:31,940
a list of instructions.

82
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,800
We find that the church is, that the apostle Paul

83
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,779
is being used of the Lord to give this church

84
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:43,179
these pieces of instruction, and we find that it's so

85
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:46,059
that they might walk worthy and please God.

86
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,100
As we think about this subject matter

87
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,619
and consider the instruction that God gives us,

88
00:03:51,619 --> 00:03:55,339
I believe tonight that we should rejoice in knowing

89
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:59,940
that God has providentially preserved this instruction

90
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,979
that was originally given to the church at Thessalonica,

91
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:07,979
but he has preserved it so that every local church

92
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,860
throughout the entire church age knows the instruction

93
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,820
that's been given so that we can walk worthy and please God.

94
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:19,019
And I think that's certainly reason for us to rejoice.

95
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,619
As we begin in verse 12 and 13,

96
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:24,779
the first point of instruction that is provided

97
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:26,619
to this church in Thessalonica,

98
00:04:26,619 --> 00:04:29,940
it addresses a church and its pastor.

99
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,019
I've titled the message for this evening

100
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:35,700
simply that, a church and its pastor.

101
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,359
I believe this evening it's important that we recognize

102
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:42,980
God's design and God's purpose for the local church

103
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,579
as statements, if you will, of introduction.

104
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:50,119
It's important for us to remember that it is his church.

105
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:50,959
Amen?

106
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,820
It's not my church, it's not your church,

107
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,779
though we might use that terminology of,

108
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:57,200
would you come to my church or this is our church,

109
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,980
but we understand the headship,

110
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,140
the lordship of the local church, and Jesus is the head.

111
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,179
It is his church.

112
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:08,859
Remember he said this, I will build my church.

113
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:10,220
He didn't say I'll build your church,

114
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,500
he said I'll build my church.

115
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,420
In Acts chapter number 20, the Bible speaks about

116
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,100
how he gave his blood for his church.

117
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,459
He paid for it.

118
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:21,859
He loved the church, in Ephesians chapter number five,

119
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:24,059
and gave himself for it.

120
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:26,459
And so we find that it is his church.

121
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,720
We also understand this, that we are his sheep.

122
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,579
Remember he said to Peter, feed my sheep.

123
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:35,100
He didn't tell Peter, feed your sheep,

124
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,459
he said feed my sheep.

125
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:39,420
And we find that Jesus said that we are his sheep.

126
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,019
He said my sheep hear my voice and I know them

127
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,459
and I give unto them eternal life

128
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:46,619
and they shall never perish in John chapter number 10.

129
00:05:46,619 --> 00:05:48,820
And so we understand this evening that Jesus

130
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,339
is the head of the church, it's his church,

131
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:54,660
but we also understand as we study through the New Testament

132
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,980
that God has ordained leadership.

133
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,579
And as we understand that God has ordained leadership,

134
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:06,380
we understand that the office of a pastor is God's idea.

135
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,980
It's not man's idea that oh, this church thing

136
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,040
should have a pastor.

137
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,519
No, it's the idea, the plan of God.

138
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:15,399
And God has established it such in his word

139
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,739
and he's given the instruction.

140
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:19,239
In fact, we would say this, that God calls

141
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:24,000
and equips pastors for the purpose of leading his church.

142
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,459
Understanding that the pastor must recognize,

143
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:28,760
I must recognize that it's not my church,

144
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,079
it's God's church, and he's given me

145
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:34,399
this great responsibility to fill that role

146
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,179
of being the pastor.

147
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:38,839
And as we look at this portion of scripture

148
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,040
and we understand that God has graciously provided

149
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,000
instruction to the church at Thessalonica,

150
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,220
again, by way of preservation to every local church,

151
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,059
this instruction regarding the relationship

152
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:54,000
between a church and its pastor.

153
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,760
We'll look at 1 Thessalonians 4, verse 12 and 13.

154
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,220
Before I do, let me read Ephesians chapter number four,

155
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,239
verse number 11 and 12, as we understand that again,

156
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:07,480
the pastor is God's idea, not man's idea.

157
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,640
And the Bible says in Ephesians 4, verse 11,

158
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,239
and he, speaking of the Lord, gave some apostles

159
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:15,079
and some prophets and some evangelists

160
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,799
and some pastors and teachers.

161
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:19,239
And it tells us the purpose by which he gave them

162
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,559
for the perfecting of the saints,

163
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:22,119
for the work of the ministry,

164
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:24,320
for the edifying of the body of Christ

165
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,399
in Ephesians 4, 11 and 12.

166
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,760
And so we see that God has ordained leadership.

167
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,760
It is his church, but he has called and equipped pastors

168
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:36,880
to lead his church.

169
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,359
As we look at these verses of scripture

170
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:41,000
in 1 Thessalonians 5, notice in verse number 12,

171
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,959
the Bible says this, and we beseech you, brethren,

172
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:47,859
to know them which labor among you

173
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:51,839
and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,

174
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,839
and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake.

175
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,100
Then it says, and be at peace among yourselves.

176
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,440
We'll deal with that statement in verse number 13 next week.

177
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,440
So this evening, as we look at the subject matter

178
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,820
of a church and its pastor,

179
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,500
number one, if you're taking notes,

180
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,980
notice with me the responsibility of the pastor,

181
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,739
the responsibility of the pastor.

182
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:14,700
As we look at these couple of verses of scripture,

183
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,980
the Bible says in verse number 12,

184
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,940
that we're to know them,

185
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,420
notice what the Bible says, which labor among you.

186
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,260
And so as we begin to think about

187
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,859
the responsibility of the pastor

188
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:25,500
in these two verses of scripture,

189
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,760
really as we look in verse number one specifically,

190
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,660
and then there's a reference in verse 12

191
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,859
and then in verse 13 as well,

192
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:34,960
there's really three aspects with regard

193
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,280
to the responsibility of the pastor

194
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,640
that are referenced within these two verses of scripture.

195
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,280
In verse 12, the Bible says them which labor among you.

196
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,719
And then in verse number 13, it says for their work's sake.

197
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,780
And so we see this idea of labor and work

198
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,080
that are mentioned in verse 12 and verse 13,

199
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,000
the responsibility of the pastor.

200
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,960
We'll look at a couple of verses in just a moment

201
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,840
to understand more clearly what that labor and work is

202
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,539
and what God has prescribed it to be.

203
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:07,619
Notice also in verse number 12,

204
00:09:07,619 --> 00:09:11,320
the Bible says to know them which labor among you.

205
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,020
And then the second aspect and are over you in the Lord.

206
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,799
Now understand that this is again,

207
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:21,760
God's plan of leadership between a pastor and its church

208
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,640
and understanding that the ultimately God is the head,

209
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,479
he's the leader, but again,

210
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:32,280
he equips and he calls pastors to lead his church.

211
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,719
Again, as you look at first Peter chapter five,

212
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,299
and we'll be there in just a moment,

213
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:39,359
that that leading is not the idea

214
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:41,960
of being a dictator, a ruler,

215
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,039
it's like a shepherd leads the sheep

216
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,799
and with love and with care and with compassion.

217
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,080
I've often said, and within the context

218
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,880
of speaking with pastors or ministry leaders,

219
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,359
and even speaking to those that might be interested

220
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:59,799
in the ministry, the reality is that

221
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,640
the Bible.

222
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,800
The Bible speaks about the idea of shepherding and sheep, and something that's unique about

223
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,280
that is that you lead sheep, you do not drive sheep.

224
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,720
You drive cattle, but you lead sheep.

225
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,760
And so he talks about they labor among you for their work's sake, but then it says,

226
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,620
and are over you in the Lord.

227
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:27,120
And then the third aspect of the responsibility of the pastor is this, admonish you, and admonish

228
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,120
you.

229
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,160
And the responsibility of the pastor is to warn and to instruct.

230
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
That's the responsibility.

231
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,080
You think about a shepherd and the sheep, and you think about the flock and how they

232
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,880
would provide the leadership and the guidance and the direction for their flock, but they'd

233
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,180
also provide that level of instruction.

234
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:48,720
They would lead them and they would help them to understand, and again, the truth of providing

235
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
warnings.

236
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,920
The apostle Paul, as he writes to the believers in Colossae, he speaks about his ministry

237
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:01,640
of warning, and how important that aspect of pastoral ministry is, and we understand

238
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,460
that it's biblical responsibility.

239
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,640
So we think about the responsibility of the pastor threefold, to work, to labor among

240
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,760
them for their work's sake, over you in the Lord, to provide that leadership, and then

241
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,720
to admonish, to warn, and to instruct.

242
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,560
Let's look at a couple of other verses of scriptures.

243
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,880
We compare scripture with scripture and seek to understand what this responsibility, how

244
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,320
God kind of gives more information throughout His Word with regard to this responsibility.

245
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,440
In Acts chapter number 20, and we'll look at a number of verses, and so be ready to

246
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,760
turn if you will.

247
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:40,480
Acts chapter 20, in verse number 28, and here in this verse of scripture, Paul is speaking

248
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,620
to those that are the leaders at the church at Ephesus, and notice what he tells them

249
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:53,120
with regard to their responsibility that is within alignment, and can certainly clearly

250
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,620
given in 1 Thessalonians 5.12 as well.

251
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,820
In verse 28 of Acts 20, the Bible says, take ye therefore unto yourselves, and to all the

252
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,580
flock over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers.

253
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:10,860
Remember that verse in 1 Thessalonians 5.12, that they're over you in the Lord, He's made

254
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,300
them overseers.

255
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,660
But then notice it says, to feed the church of God, and which He hath purchased with His

256
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,660
own blood.

257
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:25,060
So it's His church, but again, He's put in place the leadership, He has given that responsibility

258
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:30,260
to a pastor, and the relationship between a church and its pastor being given to this

259
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,980
church at Thessalonica.

260
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:37,220
Though they're a model church, the instruction is given why, to walk worthy and please God.

261
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,140
And so we see the responsibility.

262
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:47,460
Notice over in 1 Timothy chapter 4, in 1 Timothy chapter number 4, and again, a pastoral epistle

263
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,420
here that we look to as Paul is giving instruction, we'll be studying through the book of 1 Timothy

264
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,780
all year on Sunday mornings, as well as 2 Timothy.

265
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:01,660
And we notice in 1 Timothy 4, in verse number 6, notice what God says, using the apostle

266
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:08,020
Paul to give this instruction to Timothy, He says, if thou put the brethren in remembrance

267
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:14,980
of these things, notice what He says, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ.

268
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,580
That should be the goal of every pastor, by the way, to be a good minister of Jesus Christ.

269
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:24,140
And it says, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou

270
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,940
hast attained.

271
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:31,300
And so this would fit within the responsibility of that admonishing you, but also the responsibility

272
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:37,580
of laboring among you for their work's sake, that you are putting the brethren in remembrance

273
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,580
of these things.

274
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,700
He says, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ.

275
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,980
And what a blessing that Paul would outline that God would give the instruction that this

276
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:54,860
is the criteria by which we can determine if a pastor is fulfilling his responsibility.

277
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:00,660
Notice in chapter number 5, 1 Timothy chapter number 5, in verse 17 and 18, more information

278
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:06,020
is given to us that helps us to have a broader understanding of the responsibility of the

279
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,020
pastor.

280
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,700
He says in 1 Timothy 5 and verse 17, let the elders, those are the pastors that rule well,

281
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,700
again, that's the idea, they're over you in the Lord, the leadership, be counted worthy

282
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,260
of double honor.

283
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,700
But then notice this phrase, especially they who labor, do you remember that word from

284
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,860
1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 12, that labor among you for their work's sake?

285
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:36,660
Notice the labor, that labor in the word and doctrine.

286
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:43,940
Remember when there became some division in the book of Acts between some widows and we

287
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,780
find that there in that portion of Scripture that Peter stands up and says, listen, it's

288
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:52,380
not for us to leave the word of God and serve tables.

289
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:57,980
And they sought out among them capable men that would be able to fulfill those duties

290
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:04,820
and those responsibilities so that the pastors could give themselves to prayer and to the

291
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,400
ministry of the word.

292
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,240
And you can study that in the book of Acts and see, and here we find that Paul says,

293
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,880
they who labor in the word and doctrine.

294
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,960
Now think about that labor, it's work.

295
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:24,200
Some people have the idea that preparing a sermon is just no big deal and until they're

296
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,120
asked to do it, then all of a sudden they find out it's not as easy as they thought

297
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,120
it was.

298
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,480
And I remember when I first got here, someone asked me, pastor, I really appreciate your

299
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,480
sermons.

300
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,040
Do you have a book that you get them from?

301
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,280
That's what they said to me.

302
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
And I said, yes, sir.

303
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
It was Doug Cook.

304
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,880
He said that to me and they've moved away.

305
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,600
And he says, man, we were working on a project.

306
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,320
He's like, I really appreciate your messages, you know, do you have a book that you get

307
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,320
them from?

308
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,320
And I said, I do.

309
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
It's called the Bible.

310
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
Amen.

311
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,840
And the reality is that we're to labor.

312
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,720
Listen, there are some folks that just go and get an internet sermon and they just deliver

313
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
it.

314
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
Shame on them.

315
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,960
Shame on them.

316
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,960
And there are people that sell sermons, shame on them.

317
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,960
We're to labor in the Word and in doctrine.

318
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
And we're to be students of the Word.

319
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,280
Listen, that takes time.

320
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,960
And the reality is, even as we talked tonight about having a sign-up sheet to cut grass,

321
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,200
I'm on the schedule to cut grass.

322
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,960
But the reality is that my main labor is not to cut grass every week.

323
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
You don't...

324
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
That's not the calling.

325
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,760
The calling is to labor in the Word and in doctrine.

326
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,280
Notice verse 18 for the Scripture saying, thou shalt not muzzle the ox that turneth

327
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,320
out the corn, and the labor is worthy of his reward.

328
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,740
And so what is the labor?

329
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:47,700
What is the work with regard to the responsibility of the pastor to labor in the Word and doctrine?

330
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:55,400
And notice in 1 Peter 5, 1 Peter 5 verses 2 and 3, and we'll be done and move on from

331
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:01,540
here, but in 1 Peter 5 verses 2 and 3, Peter is giving some just additional information

332
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,540
if you will with regard to the responsibility of the pastor.

333
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,580
In verse 1, it's clear that he's speaking to the elders, to the pastors.

334
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:12,060
He says this in verse 1, the elders which are among you, I exhort, who am also an elder

335
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,300
and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall

336
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,300
be revealed.

337
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:22,620
Notice the responsibility in verse 2, feed the flock of God, which is among you, taking

338
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:27,260
the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly, not for filthy lucre, but

339
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:32,940
of a ready mind, neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being in samples to the

340
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,940
flock.

341
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,480
So do you see in verse 2 and 3 of 1 Peter 5 how that the responsibility of the pastor

342
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,820
that's listed in 1 Thessalonians 5, 12 is given further insight here in 1 Peter chapter

343
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:50,240
5, verses 2 and 3, he says, feed the flock of God.

344
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,460
The idea of admonishing, to warn, to instruct, he says, which is among you, taking the oversight

345
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,460
there over you in the Lord, that leadership, but he says, not by constraint, but willingly,

346
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:05,780
not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind, neither as being lords over God's heritage.

347
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,900
Remember it's God's church, it's his people, his sheep, but it says being examples and

348
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,300
samples to the flock.

349
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,860
And then the Bible says this in verse number 4, when the chief shepherd shall appear, we

350
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,860
shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.

351
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,580
The responsibility of the pastor is a very serious responsibility.

352
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,020
The responsibility of the pastor, listen, I've said to people, I'd say it to you about

353
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:31,340
myself, if I didn't know that God called me to be a pastor, I would want nothing to do

354
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,980
with trying to be a pastor because it's a great responsibility.

355
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:42,059
And we find that it's a biblical responsibility, it's God's plan that he calls and equips pastors

356
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:48,460
and he gives us a responsibility and one day the pastor's going to stand before God and

357
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,460
give an account.

358
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,700
And here in verse 4, the Bible says, and when the chief shepherd shall appear, you

359
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,820
shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.

360
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,580
But the reality is that when that chief shepherd appears, that's the Lord Jesus Christ, by

361
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:05,100
the way, we're only going to receive that crown of glory as a pastor if we have fulfilled

362
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,059
the responsibility that God has given us.

363
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:11,820
In Hebrews 13 and verse 17, we're not going to turn there, but the Bible speaks about

364
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,179
the pastor in this sense that they watch for your souls.

365
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,940
But then it says this, as they that must give account.

366
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:27,700
It's a great responsibility, but it's one that God calls, and I mentioned he calls and

367
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,700
equips.

368
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,660
And so as we think about the relationship and the instruction here in 1 Thessalonians

369
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:37,260
5 verses 12 and 13, we really see that God is providing instruction with regard to the

370
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,739
relationship between a church and its pastor.

371
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:45,299
And we find that immediately as we look at the verses of scripture, that God highlights

372
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:48,420
the responsibility of the pastor.

373
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:53,140
The pastor has responsibility and the pastor is accountable.

374
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,700
Number two, we see back in 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, not only the responsibility of

375
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,500
the pastor, but we also see in this text of scripture.

376
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,299
responsibility of the church.

377
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:05,000
There's a responsibility of the pastor,

378
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,800
there's a responsibility of the church.

379
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,440
Notice in these verses of scripture,

380
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,399
we're really given two thoughts with regard

381
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:12,500
to the responsibility of the church,

382
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,340
three thoughts with regard to the responsibility

383
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,180
of the pastor, but notice Paul begins in verse 12,

384
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,340
and we beseech you brethren,

385
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,780
and then notice this phrase, to know them.

386
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,620
Who's them?

387
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,479
Well, them which labor among you

388
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:28,520
and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,

389
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,979
he's talking about the pastors, the spiritual leaders,

390
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,680
and he says to know them.

391
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,779
This idea of to know them is to have regard for one,

392
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:38,259
to cherish, to pay attention to,

393
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:40,400
really if we'd use today's terminology,

394
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,619
maybe we might say it this way, to appreciate them.

395
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:46,099
And so we find that Paul is saying to this church,

396
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:48,040
remember it's the church at Thessalonica,

397
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,060
again a model church, and it's interesting

398
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,580
in verse number 27, he says I charge you by the Lord

399
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,639
that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.

400
00:20:56,659 --> 00:20:59,240
And so he wanted to make sure that he knew

401
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,159
he was writing unto the inspiration of the Holy Spirit

402
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,660
of God, and he's giving God's word and God's instruction,

403
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,739
and he says we beseech you brethren,

404
00:21:07,739 --> 00:21:10,519
to know them which labor among you

405
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,739
and are over you in the Lord and admonish you.

406
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,860
Yes, the pastor has a responsibility,

407
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,559
but the church too has a responsibility.

408
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:19,739
The first aspect is to know them,

409
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:23,720
to have that regard for one, to appreciate that one.

410
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,419
Notice in verse 13, the Bible says and to esteem them

411
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:32,419
very highly in love, why, for their work's sake.

412
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:35,980
And so we find this idea to esteem them very highly in love,

413
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,819
to esteem is to prize or to set a high value on,

414
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:41,739
to regard with reverence, respect, or friendship,

415
00:21:41,739 --> 00:21:43,180
that's what the word means.

416
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,860
And he says this, to esteem them,

417
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,500
notice, very highly in love.

418
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,980
This really carries with the idea of over and above,

419
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,720
exceeding abundant, that's the idea of the word,

420
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,239
the phraseology, now I'll be honest with you,

421
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:58,980
I said this to Bart before the service,

422
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,760
that he said good luck tonight,

423
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,239
and I said you know what's funny about that?

424
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,720
The subject I'm preaching on is my least favorite subject

425
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,739
to preach on, why, because I'm a pastor.

426
00:22:07,739 --> 00:22:09,440
It's not pleasant preaching and teaching

427
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,000
about the relationship between a church and its pastor

428
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,979
when you are the pastor of the church.

429
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:16,020
I'd rather go preach this message in another church

430
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,080
and have another pastor come preach it here.

431
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,580
That's just the way it is, right?

432
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,880
But the reality is that I'm giving you Bible,

433
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:26,300
this is what God says is the responsibility

434
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,300
between a church and its pastor.

435
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,660
And we find that here, God has given this responsibility.

436
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,880
Let's look at a few verses just as we did

437
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,660
with the responsibility of the pastor,

438
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,740
even as we look at the responsibility of the church.

439
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,740
Turn to the book of 1 Corinthians, if you will,

440
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,660
in chapter number nine.

441
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,240
1 Corinthians chapter number nine.

442
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,899
In this portion of scripture, of course,

443
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:50,559
we know that Paul is writing to a church

444
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,619
that is a carnal church, not a model church,

445
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:55,839
but again, giving them instruction.

446
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:59,320
And here, as Paul is speaking about,

447
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,119
really, his own position as an apostle,

448
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:06,160
we see the context with regard to what he's dealing with

449
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,779
and being in that position.

450
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:10,039
But he also gives us a very interesting truth,

451
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:12,639
a principle that we find in verse number 11

452
00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:14,720
of 1 Corinthians nine that is applicable

453
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,800
to what we're seeing here with regard

454
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,520
to the responsibility of the church with its pastor.

455
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,320
Notice in verse number 11, the Bible says,

456
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,720
if we have sown unto you spiritual things,

457
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,759
now, that's the responsibility of the pastor, right?

458
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:29,720
To sow unto them spiritual things, to teach them,

459
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,320
to warn them, to labor in word and doctrine.

460
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,679
It says this, is it a great thing

461
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:40,380
if we shall reap your carnal things?

462
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,119
Now, what's he referring to with carnal things?

463
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:42,940
We're talking about the things

464
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,800
that are necessary for living.

465
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,979
If you wanna talk about wages and that sort of thing,

466
00:23:46,979 --> 00:23:49,399
certainly that would be appropriate and applicable here.

467
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:52,279
And he says that if we have sown unto you spiritual things,

468
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:54,960
again, laboring in word and doctrine

469
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,520
and doing, fulfilling the responsibility,

470
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,100
the God-given responsibility within that role

471
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,360
of being pastor, he says we've sown unto you

472
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,919
the spiritual things, is it a great thing

473
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,279
if we shall reap your carnal things?

474
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:10,399
No, that's the responsibility of the church

475
00:24:10,399 --> 00:24:13,220
back to the spiritual leader, to the pastor.

476
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,639
We see that in Galatians chapter number six as well.

477
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:17,100
Turn over there if you will.

478
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,660
In Galatians chapter number six,

479
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,920
we find that this particular letter

480
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,500
is not written to a specific church,

481
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,980
it's written to the churches, plural,

482
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,540
that are in the region of Galatia.

483
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,660
We know that on the first missionary journey

484
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,600
that the Apostle Paul was used of the Lord

485
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,179
to see four churches planted there in the region of Galatia

486
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:40,859
and they were sent out of the church at Antioch

487
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:43,380
but they went into Antioch and Pisidia

488
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,140
and it was there that they planted a church

489
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,940
as well as Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe.

490
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,579
And so these four churches are planted,

491
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:50,779
they're giving instruction.

492
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:52,619
You find in chapter six in verse one,

493
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:54,899
brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault,

494
00:24:54,899 --> 00:24:57,619
so he's speaking to the churches that he's writing to

495
00:24:57,619 --> 00:24:59,399
and he's giving them this instruction.

496
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:00,940
But notice in verse number six,

497
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,980
as he deals specifically with this idea

498
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,299
of the responsibility of the churches,

499
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:09,019
it says let him that is taught in the word.

500
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:10,660
Now again, the responsibility of the pastor

501
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,519
is to communicate to them, to labor in the word

502
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:16,959
and doctrine, to warn, to admonish and instruct.

503
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:20,119
He says let him that is taught in the word

504
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:25,119
communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.

505
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,179
And so there's this responsibility of the pastor

506
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:31,440
but there's also the responsibility of the church.

507
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,260
We regularly say to churches,

508
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:37,140
and missions work is different than planting a local church

509
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,600
within the United States of America,

510
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,959
but we often say, even as I will say to this man

511
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:42,799
that will be here on Sunday evening

512
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,640
to plant a church in Chicago,

513
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,519
how long do you think it will be

514
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:48,359
that you need missionary support?

515
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,540
Why do we ask that question?

516
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,000
Because at some point, that local church that you establish

517
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,260
has the biblical responsibility

518
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:58,799
to take care of you as their pastor, right?

519
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,160
There to be an indigenous self-supporting church,

520
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,079
that's the idea.

521
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:04,959
If you plant a church, we had a church planter

522
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:07,440
that we were supporting, Zach Houser,

523
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,000
we supported him a few years ago.

524
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,279
And as we were supporting him

525
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:14,760
in the church that he was planting there up in Delaware,

526
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,959
we've had this with other church planters

527
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:18,279
that we have supported.

528
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:19,799
I have conversations with them

529
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:21,799
and I say something like this,

530
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:23,959
we will support you, we agree to support you

531
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:26,320
for X number of months or years.

532
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,519
And once we reach that point,

533
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:30,720
normally it's an 18 month commitment

534
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,279
that we as a church make to them

535
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:33,799
as they would go and start a church.

536
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:36,880
And then after 18 months, we'll evaluate,

537
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,320
where's the church, how have things progressed,

538
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,160
so on and so forth.

539
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,820
It's not a one size fits all,

540
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,000
every region is different with regard

541
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,760
to how many people will be reached

542
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,040
and so on and so forth.

543
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,959
And then what we would do is evaluate

544
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:50,559
at that 18 month point and say,

545
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,399
okay, let's continue support for six more months.

546
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:56,239
You still need support, the church isn't there

547
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,320
ready to support you as their pastor yet.

548
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,799
And I remember having a conversation

549
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:04,480
with one pastor, Brother Houser specifically,

550
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,200
and he was real sheepish and real shy

551
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,440
about trying to encourage his church

552
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,119
to understand their responsibility

553
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:12,880
to compensate him.

554
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,239
And here's what I said to him,

555
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:15,940
I said this, I said, brother,

556
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,600
the reality is that you're robbing the church

557
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,420
of doing what they're called of God to do.

558
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:25,399
That's just Bible truth.

559
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:27,760
It's not, listen, it's not for filthy lucre.

560
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,880
If it's for filthy lucre,

561
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,440
he's not fulfilling his responsibility,

562
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,179
you need to get a new pastor.

563
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:34,119
But the responsibility of the church

564
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,640
is to take care of its pastor.

565
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,880
That's just the responsibility.

566
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,239
You say, well, the pastor can get a job.

567
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,859
Well, he can, but then he can't labor

568
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,720
in word and doctrine as effectively as he could

569
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,200
if he did not work that secular job.

570
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,279
Does that make sense?

571
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,519
And we understand that.

572
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:49,519
And so we find in First Timothy five,

573
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:52,399
notice what the Bible says in First Timothy chapter five,

574
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,239
we read the verses a moment ago

575
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:57,820
with regard to the responsibility of the pastor

576
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,160
to be laboring in word and doctrine.

577
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,040
But the Bible gives us two principles

578
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,119
in this passage of scripture

579
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:06,760
with regard to the responsibility of the church.

580
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,160
Notice, again, in First Timothy five, verse 17,

581
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,000
it says, let the elders that rule well

582
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,880
be counted worthy of double honor.

583
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,839
Now, listen, there are people that are gonna take that

584
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:20,799
and twist it and say, I should be paid double.

585
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:21,760
No, that's not what he's saying.

586
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,420
They're worthy of double honor.

587
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:27,880
If they labor well, if they rule well,

588
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,600
be counted worthy of double honor,

589
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,440
then it says, especially they who labor

590
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,080
in the word and doctrine.

591
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,760
But then notice it goes on and says this,

592
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,039
for the scripture saith, thou shalt not muzzle the ox

593
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,280
that churneth out the corn,

594
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,479
and the laborer is worthy of his reward.

595
00:28:43,479 --> 00:28:44,799
It's a Bible principle

596
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,479
that the laborer is worthy of his reward.

597
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:51,260
Some people would argue, well, Paul, he made tents.

598
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,700
Sometimes he did, but sometimes he was compensated.

599
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:59,200
You can study through the life of Paul and you can see it

600
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,520
and you can understand.

601
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,640
And the reality is that as the pastor

602
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,559
and two of our deacons are in here this evening,

603
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,320
Ari's not feeling well and Pierre's not here,

604
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,080
but as the pastor, I have said to these men

605
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,440
in deacons' meetings that the reality is

606
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,400
that if things get tough financially,

607
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,880
the first thing that happens is my salary decreases.

608
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,440
You say, well, pastor, we don't like that.

609
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,440
That's what I've said to these men in meetings.

610
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,200
I hope that never happens.

611
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,919
But the reality is that that's the role of the pastor

612
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,000
is to fulfill the God-given responsibility,

613
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,039
but there is a responsibility on the side of the church.

614
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:36,520
And so as we find and we think about this portion

615
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,159
of scripture, let me say this,

616
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,760
and then I'll make some conclusion remarks.

617
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,000
We'll get into prayer time.

618
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,679
I want to say this publicly tonight.

619
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,260
Our church has been such, I would say,

620
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,640
how would I want to, they have, you have,

621
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,640
our church has done well.

622
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:56,719
I feel like our church has fulfilled

623
00:29:56,719 --> 00:30:00,599
it's God's given responsibility to take care of me.

624
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:06,059
as the pastor. Again, not an easy subject to preach on as the pastor of the church.

625
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:11,079
But the reality is, I would say, I commend our church. I often say, and I'll say in

626
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:14,079
a couple of weeks when we have our annual business meeting, I commend our church for

627
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:20,399
our missions giving, the way that we give to missions. And listen, that's a responsibility

628
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,679
to give to missions, but as we understand the responsibility that we have to give to

629
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:30,079
missions, it's not at the expense of taking care of the pastor. We've never done that,

630
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:35,639
and I thank the Lord for it. I am thankful, and I appreciate. And even as I mentioned

631
00:30:35,639 --> 00:30:39,319
about the church in Thessalonica, they're a model church. They're doing things well.

632
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:43,879
They're doing things right. But God still gives them instruction that says, hey, listen,

633
00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:49,839
remember these things. Be aware of your responsibility, not only to the church members, but also to

634
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:55,199
the pastors of the church. You have responsibility. And if you want to walk worthy and please

635
00:30:55,199 --> 00:31:00,799
God, here's where the responsibility starts, and we find it with regard to a church and

636
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:08,759
its pastor. Now, let me say this in closing. The pastor can fail, and many have. Many have.

637
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:14,319
Many pastors have not fulfilled their responsibility, their God-given responsibility that the Bible

638
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:20,399
instructs them on what their job, what their duty, what their call is, and they can fail.

639
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,479
But can I tell you this evening that not every pastor has failed? There are good pastors

640
00:31:24,479 --> 00:31:29,199
that preach and teach the Word of God that labor in word and in doctrine. There are good

641
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:36,779
pastors that feed the flock of God. I don't seek in any way, shape, or form to pat myself

642
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:41,079
this evening, but we had a visitor come here a few years ago, and they only came here because

643
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:44,879
they were looking for a church to rent. They didn't come here because they were looking

644
00:31:44,879 --> 00:31:48,919
for a church. They were trying to start a particular church in the area, and so they

645
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:52,639
came to visit to see if our church might be available for rent, which it's not because

646
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,839
we use it, amen? But they came here for that purpose, and after the service, they came

647
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:01,319
to the back, and here's, and there was actually two men. They were deacons at this particular

648
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,079
place where they were going to start this church, and they said, let me ask you a question.

649
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:15,839
Do you always feed your flock that way? Initially, I didn't know how to respond to the question,

650
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:22,039
because my job is to feed the flock of God. It's my job. It's my responsibility. I don't

651
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:26,319
want to take the shortcuts. I don't want to just do a Saturday night special, so to

652
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:31,759
speak. Labor in word and in doctrine. It's my responsibility. Pastors have failed. I'm

653
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,359
not perfect. Pastors have failed, but there are some good pastors. I was at a pastor's

654
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:40,959
meeting yesterday. There are some good pastors in Virginia that are laboring in word and

655
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:47,839
doctrine that love the church members that God has entrusted them with, and I'm thankful

656
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:53,239
for good pastors that understand the responsibility that God has given. There have been churches

657
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:59,559
that have failed, plenty of them. They don't fulfill their responsibility, but I'm thankful

658
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:04,279
this evening that our church and many others have fulfilled their responsibility, but we

659
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:09,519
must be aware of the fact that if we want to continue to walk worthy and please God,

660
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:15,959
we must be aware of the instruction that God has given, and as God provides the instruction

661
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:22,119
with regard to a pastor, or excuse me, a church and its pastor, we understand that that instruction

662
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:29,119
is given so that we might walk worthy and please God, not only as individuals, but corporately

663
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:36,159
as a local church, that we could fulfill what God has called us to fulfill. The last part

664
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:41,879
of verse 13 will be our study for next week, where the Bible says this, and be at peace

665
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:46,639
among yourselves. We'll have an entire lesson next Wednesday evening on the importance of

666
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:51,679
unity, the importance of unity. Oh, there's many churches. The church in Corinth will

667
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:57,999
be a model that we'll look at next week with regard to the divisions and the disunity that

668
00:33:57,999 --> 00:34:04,119
was prevalent there. And so we find that God is seeking to instruct not only this church

669
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:10,719
in Thessalonica, but every church throughout the church age, ours included. You want to

670
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:16,439
walk worthy? You want to please God? Here's some instruction, and it starts with a church

671
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:21,719
and its pastor. Let's pray. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. I thank You

672
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:28,719
this evening for Your Word. God, I'm humbled at the opportunity and the privilege that

673
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:36,239
You would give me to pastor Fellowship Baptist Church, 12 and a half years. Thank You, Lord.

674
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:46,999
I thank You for our church. I thank You for their heart and their spirit. I thank You

675
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:52,719
for their desire to fulfill their biblical responsibility. God, I pray that You would

676
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:59,719
help, even as we look at this portion of Scripture this evening and review and analyze the responsibility

677
00:35:00,759 --> 00:35:07,079
of the pastor and the responsibility of the church, that each of us would fulfill our

678
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:13,879
God-given responsibilities so that we could walk worthy and please You. Lord, we thank

679
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:18,039
You for the privilege of prayer. We thank You that we can enter into Your presence,

680
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:23,439
that we can bring our petitions before Thy throne, knowing that You hear us and You answer.

681
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:26,319
We pray, God, that You'd bless throughout the remainder of the service. We pray that

682
00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:30,119
all that's said and done, that You alone would be glorified. For it's in Christ's name we

683
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,599
pray. Amen.
