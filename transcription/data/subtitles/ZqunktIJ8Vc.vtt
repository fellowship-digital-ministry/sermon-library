WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
know it, and they're working on it,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.799
and so we're gonna be singing that

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:06.119
in Sunday school on Sunday.

00:00:06.119 --> 00:00:07.639
For those that are in Sunday school,

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:10.079
you know it's amazing when you put

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:12.260
a verse of scripture to a song,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.479
how quickly you can memorize it,

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:16.000
and so I'm looking forward to being able

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.639
to learn that on Sunday morning.

00:00:18.639 --> 00:00:19.600
And so let's say it together,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.379
First Timothy 117, we'll say the reference

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:23.200
and then say the verse together.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.200
Let's say it together.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.799
First Timothy 117.

00:00:26.799 --> 00:00:31.120
Now unto the king eternal, immortal,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.159
invisible, the only wise God,

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:40.159
be honor and glory forever and ever, amen.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.240
Isn't that a great verse?

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.720
And certainly he is an awesome God,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.040
and we certainly wanna give him the honor

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.599
and glory that is due unto his wonderful name.

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:53.240
I hope that you'd work on that,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.000
and looking forward to the opportunity.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.319
I also wanna remind you that when we have

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:59.840
birthday fellowship here in the month of January,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.520
a couple of weeks from this past Sunday,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.680
so it won't be this upcoming Sunday,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.839
but the following, we'll have the opportunity,

00:01:05.839 --> 00:01:09.139
as Brother Jeff announced on Sunday night,

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:12.120
we're gonna have a little Bible quiz.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.959
So the plan for birthday fellowship Sunday

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:18.220
is going forward is that I'll preach a shorter message.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.160
Now that's the plan, amen.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.080
And I'll preach a shorter message,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.160
and we'll have 10 or 15 minutes for a Bible quiz

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.080
before we go over, so we'll still plan to be done

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.699
at seven o'clock, a normal end time on Sunday evenings.

00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:34.239
And this particular month, the month of January,

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:38.360
the Bible quiz will be centered around the life of Abraham,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.879
the life of Abraham, and so you might wanna be doing

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:42.480
some studying in the book of Genesis

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.639
about the life of Abraham, and be prepared

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:47.099
to be able to answer some questions.

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:48.680
We'll have a great time of fellowship

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.800
and look forward to that, and I'm sure

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.400
that will be a blessing to you,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.559
and I'm sure that even if you don't like the idea

00:01:56.559 --> 00:02:01.559
of a quiz, by you going and studying the life of Abraham,

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:05.440
it'll be beneficial for you, and so that's a blessing, amen.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.520
First Thessalonians chapter five this evening.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.500
First Thessalonians chapter five, verses 12 and 13.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.320
We will not look at the very last phrase

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.759
of verse number 13, it'll be a study

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.800
for next Wednesday evening, but we'll look

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.919
at the entirety of verse 12 in the first portion

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:20.119
of verse 13.

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:22.919
As discussed last week, these two letters,

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.240
the letter of First Thessalonians,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.759
letter of Second Thessalonians,

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:28.500
are written to the local church in Thessalonica.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.580
By the way, I'm thankful for a local church.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.960
I'm thankful that the church is not man's idea,

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.759
it's God's idea, and I'm thankful that this local church,

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:39.919
as we looked last week, we examined five characteristics

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:42.440
of the church at Thessalonica that really make

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.119
this church a model church, and I went through great lengths

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:49.179
last Wednesday evening to try to lay the groundwork

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:52.139
for this new study on Wednesday evenings.

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:57.139
The study, if you wanna use a title for the entire study,

00:02:57.339 --> 00:03:00.220
it's Walk Worthy, Please God.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.539
Walk Worthy, Please God.

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.199
And we find that as Paul would be used to the Lord

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:06.979
to write to the church at Thessalonica,

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:09.419
it's a model church, a church that is commended,

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:11.940
a church that's doing a great work for God,

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.619
but we find at the end of chapter number five

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:17.699
of the first letter, beginning in verse number 12,

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:21.460
then again in the end of the second letter

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.860
in chapter number three, beginning in verse number six,

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.539
we find that God gives this church in two different places

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:31.940
a list of instructions.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.800
We find that the church is, that the apostle Paul

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.779
is being used of the Lord to give this church

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:43.179
these pieces of instruction, and we find that it's so

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:46.059
that they might walk worthy and please God.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:49.100
As we think about this subject matter

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.619
and consider the instruction that God gives us,

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:55.339
I believe tonight that we should rejoice in knowing

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:59.940
that God has providentially preserved this instruction

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.979
that was originally given to the church at Thessalonica,

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:07.979
but he has preserved it so that every local church

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.860
throughout the entire church age knows the instruction

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.820
that's been given so that we can walk worthy and please God.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.019
And I think that's certainly reason for us to rejoice.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.619
As we begin in verse 12 and 13,

00:04:21.619 --> 00:04:24.779
the first point of instruction that is provided

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:26.619
to this church in Thessalonica,

00:04:26.619 --> 00:04:29.940
it addresses a church and its pastor.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.019
I've titled the message for this evening

00:04:32.019 --> 00:04:35.700
simply that, a church and its pastor.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.359
I believe this evening it's important that we recognize

00:04:38.359 --> 00:04:42.980
God's design and God's purpose for the local church

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.579
as statements, if you will, of introduction.

00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:50.119
It's important for us to remember that it is his church.

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:50.959
Amen?

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:52.820
It's not my church, it's not your church,

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.779
though we might use that terminology of,

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:57.200
would you come to my church or this is our church,

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.980
but we understand the headship,

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.140
the lordship of the local church, and Jesus is the head.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.179
It is his church.

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:08.859
Remember he said this, I will build my church.

00:05:08.859 --> 00:05:10.220
He didn't say I'll build your church,

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.500
he said I'll build my church.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.420
In Acts chapter number 20, the Bible speaks about

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.100
how he gave his blood for his church.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.459
He paid for it.

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:21.859
He loved the church, in Ephesians chapter number five,

00:05:21.859 --> 00:05:24.059
and gave himself for it.

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:26.459
And so we find that it is his church.

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:29.720
We also understand this, that we are his sheep.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.579
Remember he said to Peter, feed my sheep.

00:05:33.579 --> 00:05:35.100
He didn't tell Peter, feed your sheep,

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.459
he said feed my sheep.

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:39.420
And we find that Jesus said that we are his sheep.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.019
He said my sheep hear my voice and I know them

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.459
and I give unto them eternal life

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:46.619
and they shall never perish in John chapter number 10.

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:48.820
And so we understand this evening that Jesus

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.339
is the head of the church, it's his church,

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:54.660
but we also understand as we study through the New Testament

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.980
that God has ordained leadership.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.579
And as we understand that God has ordained leadership,

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:06.380
we understand that the office of a pastor is God's idea.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.980
It's not man's idea that oh, this church thing

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.040
should have a pastor.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.519
No, it's the idea, the plan of God.

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:15.399
And God has established it such in his word

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:16.739
and he's given the instruction.

00:06:16.739 --> 00:06:19.239
In fact, we would say this, that God calls

00:06:19.239 --> 00:06:24.000
and equips pastors for the purpose of leading his church.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.459
Understanding that the pastor must recognize,

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:28.760
I must recognize that it's not my church,

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.079
it's God's church, and he's given me

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:34.399
this great responsibility to fill that role

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:36.179
of being the pastor.

00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:38.839
And as we look at this portion of scripture

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:42.040
and we understand that God has graciously provided

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.000
instruction to the church at Thessalonica,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.220
again, by way of preservation to every local church,

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.059
this instruction regarding the relationship

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:54.000
between a church and its pastor.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.760
We'll look at 1 Thessalonians 4, verse 12 and 13.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.220
Before I do, let me read Ephesians chapter number four,

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.239
verse number 11 and 12, as we understand that again,

00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:07.480
the pastor is God's idea, not man's idea.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.640
And the Bible says in Ephesians 4, verse 11,

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.239
and he, speaking of the Lord, gave some apostles

00:07:13.239 --> 00:07:15.079
and some prophets and some evangelists

00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:16.799
and some pastors and teachers.

00:07:16.799 --> 00:07:19.239
And it tells us the purpose by which he gave them

00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:20.559
for the perfecting of the saints,

00:07:20.559 --> 00:07:22.119
for the work of the ministry,

00:07:22.119 --> 00:07:24.320
for the edifying of the body of Christ

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.399
in Ephesians 4, 11 and 12.

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:29.760
And so we see that God has ordained leadership.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.760
It is his church, but he has called and equipped pastors

00:07:34.799 --> 00:07:36.880
to lead his church.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.359
As we look at these verses of scripture

00:07:38.359 --> 00:07:41.000
in 1 Thessalonians 5, notice in verse number 12,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.959
the Bible says this, and we beseech you, brethren,

00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:47.859
to know them which labor among you

00:07:47.859 --> 00:07:51.839
and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:56.839
and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.100
Then it says, and be at peace among yourselves.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.440
We'll deal with that statement in verse number 13 next week.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.440
So this evening, as we look at the subject matter

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.820
of a church and its pastor,

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.500
number one, if you're taking notes,

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.980
notice with me the responsibility of the pastor,

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.739
the responsibility of the pastor.

00:08:12.739 --> 00:08:14.700
As we look at these couple of verses of scripture,

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.980
the Bible says in verse number 12,

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:17.940
that we're to know them,

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.420
notice what the Bible says, which labor among you.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.260
And so as we begin to think about

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.859
the responsibility of the pastor

00:08:23.859 --> 00:08:25.500
in these two verses of scripture,

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.760
really as we look in verse number one specifically,

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.660
and then there's a reference in verse 12

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.859
and then in verse 13 as well,

00:08:32.859 --> 00:08:34.960
there's really three aspects with regard

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.280
to the responsibility of the pastor

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.640
that are referenced within these two verses of scripture.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.280
In verse 12, the Bible says them which labor among you.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.719
And then in verse number 13, it says for their work's sake.

00:08:49.719 --> 00:08:51.780
And so we see this idea of labor and work

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.080
that are mentioned in verse 12 and verse 13,

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.000
the responsibility of the pastor.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.960
We'll look at a couple of verses in just a moment

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.840
to understand more clearly what that labor and work is

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.539
and what God has prescribed it to be.

00:09:05.539 --> 00:09:07.619
Notice also in verse number 12,

00:09:07.619 --> 00:09:11.320
the Bible says to know them which labor among you.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:16.020
And then the second aspect and are over you in the Lord.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.799
Now understand that this is again,

00:09:17.799 --> 00:09:21.760
God's plan of leadership between a pastor and its church

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.640
and understanding that the ultimately God is the head,

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.479
he's the leader, but again,

00:09:27.479 --> 00:09:32.280
he equips and he calls pastors to lead his church.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.719
Again, as you look at first Peter chapter five,

00:09:34.719 --> 00:09:36.299
and we'll be there in just a moment,

00:09:36.299 --> 00:09:39.359
that that leading is not the idea

00:09:39.359 --> 00:09:41.960
of being a dictator, a ruler,

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.039
it's like a shepherd leads the sheep

00:09:45.039 --> 00:09:48.799
and with love and with care and with compassion.

00:09:48.799 --> 00:09:52.080
I've often said, and within the context

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.880
of speaking with pastors or ministry leaders,

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.359
and even speaking to those that might be interested

00:09:57.359 --> 00:09:59.799
in the ministry, the reality is that

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:00.640
the Bible.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.800
The Bible speaks about the idea of shepherding and sheep, and something that's unique about

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:10.280
that is that you lead sheep, you do not drive sheep.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.720
You drive cattle, but you lead sheep.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.760
And so he talks about they labor among you for their work's sake, but then it says,

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.620
and are over you in the Lord.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:27.120
And then the third aspect of the responsibility of the pastor is this, admonish you, and admonish

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.120
you.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.160
And the responsibility of the pastor is to warn and to instruct.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.160
That's the responsibility.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.080
You think about a shepherd and the sheep, and you think about the flock and how they

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:39.880
would provide the leadership and the guidance and the direction for their flock, but they'd

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.180
also provide that level of instruction.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:48.720
They would lead them and they would help them to understand, and again, the truth of providing

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.720
warnings.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.920
The apostle Paul, as he writes to the believers in Colossae, he speaks about his ministry

00:10:53.920 --> 00:11:01.640
of warning, and how important that aspect of pastoral ministry is, and we understand

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.460
that it's biblical responsibility.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.640
So we think about the responsibility of the pastor threefold, to work, to labor among

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.760
them for their work's sake, over you in the Lord, to provide that leadership, and then

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.720
to admonish, to warn, and to instruct.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.560
Let's look at a couple of other verses of scriptures.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:22.880
We compare scripture with scripture and seek to understand what this responsibility, how

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:28.320
God kind of gives more information throughout His Word with regard to this responsibility.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.440
In Acts chapter number 20, and we'll look at a number of verses, and so be ready to

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.760
turn if you will.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:40.480
Acts chapter 20, in verse number 28, and here in this verse of scripture, Paul is speaking

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:46.620
to those that are the leaders at the church at Ephesus, and notice what he tells them

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:53.120
with regard to their responsibility that is within alignment, and can certainly clearly

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.620
given in 1 Thessalonians 5.12 as well.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:01.820
In verse 28 of Acts 20, the Bible says, take ye therefore unto yourselves, and to all the

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:06.580
flock over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.860
Remember that verse in 1 Thessalonians 5.12, that they're over you in the Lord, He's made

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.300
them overseers.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:17.660
But then notice it says, to feed the church of God, and which He hath purchased with His

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.660
own blood.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:25.060
So it's His church, but again, He's put in place the leadership, He has given that responsibility

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:30.260
to a pastor, and the relationship between a church and its pastor being given to this

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.980
church at Thessalonica.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:37.220
Though they're a model church, the instruction is given why, to walk worthy and please God.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.140
And so we see the responsibility.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:47.460
Notice over in 1 Timothy chapter 4, in 1 Timothy chapter number 4, and again, a pastoral epistle

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:52.420
here that we look to as Paul is giving instruction, we'll be studying through the book of 1 Timothy

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.780
all year on Sunday mornings, as well as 2 Timothy.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:01.660
And we notice in 1 Timothy 4, in verse number 6, notice what God says, using the apostle

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:08.020
Paul to give this instruction to Timothy, He says, if thou put the brethren in remembrance

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:14.980
of these things, notice what He says, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:19.580
That should be the goal of every pastor, by the way, to be a good minister of Jesus Christ.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:24.140
And it says, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.940
hast attained.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:31.300
And so this would fit within the responsibility of that admonishing you, but also the responsibility

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:37.580
of laboring among you for their work's sake, that you are putting the brethren in remembrance

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:38.580
of these things.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.700
He says, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:46.980
And what a blessing that Paul would outline that God would give the instruction that this

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:54.860
is the criteria by which we can determine if a pastor is fulfilling his responsibility.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:14:00.660
Notice in chapter number 5, 1 Timothy chapter number 5, in verse 17 and 18, more information

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:06.020
is given to us that helps us to have a broader understanding of the responsibility of the

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.020
pastor.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:12.700
He says in 1 Timothy 5 and verse 17, let the elders, those are the pastors that rule well,

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:17.700
again, that's the idea, they're over you in the Lord, the leadership, be counted worthy

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.260
of double honor.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:23.700
But then notice this phrase, especially they who labor, do you remember that word from

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:28.860
1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 12, that labor among you for their work's sake?

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:36.660
Notice the labor, that labor in the word and doctrine.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:43.940
Remember when there became some division in the book of Acts between some widows and we

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:48.780
find that there in that portion of Scripture that Peter stands up and says, listen, it's

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.380
not for us to leave the word of God and serve tables.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:57.980
And they sought out among them capable men that would be able to fulfill those duties

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:04.820
and those responsibilities so that the pastors could give themselves to prayer and to the

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.400
ministry of the word.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:11.240
And you can study that in the book of Acts and see, and here we find that Paul says,

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:16.880
they who labor in the word and doctrine.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.960
Now think about that labor, it's work.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:24.200
Some people have the idea that preparing a sermon is just no big deal and until they're

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.120
asked to do it, then all of a sudden they find out it's not as easy as they thought

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.120
it was.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:34.480
And I remember when I first got here, someone asked me, pastor, I really appreciate your

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.480
sermons.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.040
Do you have a book that you get them from?

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.280
That's what they said to me.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.280
And I said, yes, sir.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.280
It was Doug Cook.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.880
He said that to me and they've moved away.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.600
And he says, man, we were working on a project.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.320
He's like, I really appreciate your messages, you know, do you have a book that you get

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.320
them from?

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.320
And I said, I do.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.320
It's called the Bible.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.320
Amen.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.840
And the reality is that we're to labor.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.720
Listen, there are some folks that just go and get an internet sermon and they just deliver

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.720
it.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.720
Shame on them.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.960
Shame on them.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.960
And there are people that sell sermons, shame on them.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.960
We're to labor in the Word and in doctrine.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.960
And we're to be students of the Word.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.280
Listen, that takes time.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:20.960
And the reality is, even as we talked tonight about having a sign-up sheet to cut grass,

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.200
I'm on the schedule to cut grass.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.960
But the reality is that my main labor is not to cut grass every week.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:27.960
You don't...

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.960
That's not the calling.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.760
The calling is to labor in the Word and in doctrine.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.280
Notice verse 18 for the Scripture saying, thou shalt not muzzle the ox that turneth

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.320
out the corn, and the labor is worthy of his reward.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.740
And so what is the labor?

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:47.700
What is the work with regard to the responsibility of the pastor to labor in the Word and doctrine?

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:55.400
And notice in 1 Peter 5, 1 Peter 5 verses 2 and 3, and we'll be done and move on from

00:16:55.400 --> 00:17:01.540
here, but in 1 Peter 5 verses 2 and 3, Peter is giving some just additional information

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.540
if you will with regard to the responsibility of the pastor.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.580
In verse 1, it's clear that he's speaking to the elders, to the pastors.

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:12.060
He says this in verse 1, the elders which are among you, I exhort, who am also an elder

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:16.300
and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.300
be revealed.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:22.620
Notice the responsibility in verse 2, feed the flock of God, which is among you, taking

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:27.260
the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly, not for filthy lucre, but

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:32.940
of a ready mind, neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being in samples to the

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:33.940
flock.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.480
So do you see in verse 2 and 3 of 1 Peter 5 how that the responsibility of the pastor

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:44.820
that's listed in 1 Thessalonians 5, 12 is given further insight here in 1 Peter chapter

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:50.240
5, verses 2 and 3, he says, feed the flock of God.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:55.460
The idea of admonishing, to warn, to instruct, he says, which is among you, taking the oversight

00:17:55.460 --> 00:18:00.460
there over you in the Lord, that leadership, but he says, not by constraint, but willingly,

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:05.780
not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind, neither as being lords over God's heritage.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:10.900
Remember it's God's church, it's his people, his sheep, but it says being examples and

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.300
samples to the flock.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.860
And then the Bible says this in verse number 4, when the chief shepherd shall appear, we

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.860
shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.580
The responsibility of the pastor is a very serious responsibility.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.020
The responsibility of the pastor, listen, I've said to people, I'd say it to you about

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:31.340
myself, if I didn't know that God called me to be a pastor, I would want nothing to do

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:35.980
with trying to be a pastor because it's a great responsibility.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:42.059
And we find that it's a biblical responsibility, it's God's plan that he calls and equips pastors

00:18:42.059 --> 00:18:48.460
and he gives us a responsibility and one day the pastor's going to stand before God and

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:49.460
give an account.

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:53.700
And here in verse 4, the Bible says, and when the chief shepherd shall appear, you

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.820
shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:00.580
But the reality is that when that chief shepherd appears, that's the Lord Jesus Christ, by

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:05.100
the way, we're only going to receive that crown of glory as a pastor if we have fulfilled

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.059
the responsibility that God has given us.

00:19:08.059 --> 00:19:11.820
In Hebrews 13 and verse 17, we're not going to turn there, but the Bible speaks about

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.179
the pastor in this sense that they watch for your souls.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:20.940
But then it says this, as they that must give account.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:27.700
It's a great responsibility, but it's one that God calls, and I mentioned he calls and

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.700
equips.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.660
And so as we think about the relationship and the instruction here in 1 Thessalonians

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:37.260
5 verses 12 and 13, we really see that God is providing instruction with regard to the

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.739
relationship between a church and its pastor.

00:19:40.739 --> 00:19:45.299
And we find that immediately as we look at the verses of scripture, that God highlights

00:19:45.299 --> 00:19:48.420
the responsibility of the pastor.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:53.140
The pastor has responsibility and the pastor is accountable.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:57.700
Number two, we see back in 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, not only the responsibility of

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.500
the pastor, but we also see in this text of scripture.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.299
responsibility of the church.

00:20:03.299 --> 00:20:05.000
There's a responsibility of the pastor,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.800
there's a responsibility of the church.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.440
Notice in these verses of scripture,

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.399
we're really given two thoughts with regard

00:20:10.399 --> 00:20:12.500
to the responsibility of the church,

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.340
three thoughts with regard to the responsibility

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:18.180
of the pastor, but notice Paul begins in verse 12,

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.340
and we beseech you brethren,

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:23.780
and then notice this phrase, to know them.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:24.620
Who's them?

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.479
Well, them which labor among you

00:20:26.479 --> 00:20:28.520
and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.979
he's talking about the pastors, the spiritual leaders,

00:20:30.979 --> 00:20:32.680
and he says to know them.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.779
This idea of to know them is to have regard for one,

00:20:35.779 --> 00:20:38.259
to cherish, to pay attention to,

00:20:38.259 --> 00:20:40.400
really if we'd use today's terminology,

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.619
maybe we might say it this way, to appreciate them.

00:20:43.619 --> 00:20:46.099
And so we find that Paul is saying to this church,

00:20:46.099 --> 00:20:48.040
remember it's the church at Thessalonica,

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.060
again a model church, and it's interesting

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.580
in verse number 27, he says I charge you by the Lord

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.639
that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.

00:20:56.659 --> 00:20:59.240
And so he wanted to make sure that he knew

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.159
he was writing unto the inspiration of the Holy Spirit

00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:04.660
of God, and he's giving God's word and God's instruction,

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.739
and he says we beseech you brethren,

00:21:07.739 --> 00:21:10.519
to know them which labor among you

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:12.739
and are over you in the Lord and admonish you.

00:21:12.739 --> 00:21:14.860
Yes, the pastor has a responsibility,

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.559
but the church too has a responsibility.

00:21:17.559 --> 00:21:19.739
The first aspect is to know them,

00:21:19.739 --> 00:21:23.720
to have that regard for one, to appreciate that one.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.419
Notice in verse 13, the Bible says and to esteem them

00:21:27.419 --> 00:21:32.419
very highly in love, why, for their work's sake.

00:21:33.019 --> 00:21:35.980
And so we find this idea to esteem them very highly in love,

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.819
to esteem is to prize or to set a high value on,

00:21:38.819 --> 00:21:41.739
to regard with reverence, respect, or friendship,

00:21:41.739 --> 00:21:43.180
that's what the word means.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.860
And he says this, to esteem them,

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:49.500
notice, very highly in love.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.980
This really carries with the idea of over and above,

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.720
exceeding abundant, that's the idea of the word,

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.239
the phraseology, now I'll be honest with you,

00:21:57.239 --> 00:21:58.980
I said this to Bart before the service,

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.760
that he said good luck tonight,

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.239
and I said you know what's funny about that?

00:22:02.239 --> 00:22:04.720
The subject I'm preaching on is my least favorite subject

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.739
to preach on, why, because I'm a pastor.

00:22:07.739 --> 00:22:09.440
It's not pleasant preaching and teaching

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.000
about the relationship between a church and its pastor

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.979
when you are the pastor of the church.

00:22:13.979 --> 00:22:16.020
I'd rather go preach this message in another church

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.080
and have another pastor come preach it here.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.580
That's just the way it is, right?

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.880
But the reality is that I'm giving you Bible,

00:22:23.539 --> 00:22:26.300
this is what God says is the responsibility

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.300
between a church and its pastor.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:33.660
And we find that here, God has given this responsibility.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.880
Let's look at a few verses just as we did

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.660
with the responsibility of the pastor,

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.740
even as we look at the responsibility of the church.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.740
Turn to the book of 1 Corinthians, if you will,

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.660
in chapter number nine.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.240
1 Corinthians chapter number nine.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.899
In this portion of scripture, of course,

00:22:47.899 --> 00:22:50.559
we know that Paul is writing to a church

00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:53.619
that is a carnal church, not a model church,

00:22:53.619 --> 00:22:55.839
but again, giving them instruction.

00:22:55.839 --> 00:22:59.320
And here, as Paul is speaking about,

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.119
really, his own position as an apostle,

00:23:02.119 --> 00:23:06.160
we see the context with regard to what he's dealing with

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.779
and being in that position.

00:23:07.779 --> 00:23:10.039
But he also gives us a very interesting truth,

00:23:10.039 --> 00:23:12.639
a principle that we find in verse number 11

00:23:12.639 --> 00:23:14.720
of 1 Corinthians nine that is applicable

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.800
to what we're seeing here with regard

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.520
to the responsibility of the church with its pastor.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.320
Notice in verse number 11, the Bible says,

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.720
if we have sown unto you spiritual things,

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.759
now, that's the responsibility of the pastor, right?

00:23:26.759 --> 00:23:29.720
To sow unto them spiritual things, to teach them,

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.320
to warn them, to labor in word and doctrine.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.679
It says this, is it a great thing

00:23:36.679 --> 00:23:40.380
if we shall reap your carnal things?

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.119
Now, what's he referring to with carnal things?

00:23:42.119 --> 00:23:42.940
We're talking about the things

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:44.800
that are necessary for living.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.979
If you wanna talk about wages and that sort of thing,

00:23:46.979 --> 00:23:49.399
certainly that would be appropriate and applicable here.

00:23:50.119 --> 00:23:52.279
And he says that if we have sown unto you spiritual things,

00:23:52.279 --> 00:23:54.960
again, laboring in word and doctrine

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.520
and doing, fulfilling the responsibility,

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.100
the God-given responsibility within that role

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.360
of being pastor, he says we've sown unto you

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.919
the spiritual things, is it a great thing

00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:08.279
if we shall reap your carnal things?

00:24:08.279 --> 00:24:10.399
No, that's the responsibility of the church

00:24:10.399 --> 00:24:13.220
back to the spiritual leader, to the pastor.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.639
We see that in Galatians chapter number six as well.

00:24:15.639 --> 00:24:17.100
Turn over there if you will.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.660
In Galatians chapter number six,

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.920
we find that this particular letter

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.500
is not written to a specific church,

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.980
it's written to the churches, plural,

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.540
that are in the region of Galatia.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.660
We know that on the first missionary journey

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.600
that the Apostle Paul was used of the Lord

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.179
to see four churches planted there in the region of Galatia

00:24:38.179 --> 00:24:40.859
and they were sent out of the church at Antioch

00:24:40.859 --> 00:24:43.380
but they went into Antioch and Pisidia

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.140
and it was there that they planted a church

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.940
as well as Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.579
And so these four churches are planted,

00:24:49.579 --> 00:24:50.779
they're giving instruction.

00:24:50.779 --> 00:24:52.619
You find in chapter six in verse one,

00:24:52.619 --> 00:24:54.899
brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault,

00:24:54.899 --> 00:24:57.619
so he's speaking to the churches that he's writing to

00:24:57.619 --> 00:24:59.399
and he's giving them this instruction.

00:24:59.399 --> 00:25:00.940
But notice in verse number six,

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:02.980
as he deals specifically with this idea

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.299
of the responsibility of the churches,

00:25:05.299 --> 00:25:09.019
it says let him that is taught in the word.

00:25:09.019 --> 00:25:10.660
Now again, the responsibility of the pastor

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.519
is to communicate to them, to labor in the word

00:25:13.519 --> 00:25:16.959
and doctrine, to warn, to admonish and instruct.

00:25:16.959 --> 00:25:20.119
He says let him that is taught in the word

00:25:20.119 --> 00:25:25.119
communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.179
And so there's this responsibility of the pastor

00:25:29.179 --> 00:25:31.440
but there's also the responsibility of the church.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.260
We regularly say to churches,

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:37.140
and missions work is different than planting a local church

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.600
within the United States of America,

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.959
but we often say, even as I will say to this man

00:25:40.959 --> 00:25:42.799
that will be here on Sunday evening

00:25:42.799 --> 00:25:44.640
to plant a church in Chicago,

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.519
how long do you think it will be

00:25:46.519 --> 00:25:48.359
that you need missionary support?

00:25:48.359 --> 00:25:49.540
Why do we ask that question?

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:53.000
Because at some point, that local church that you establish

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.260
has the biblical responsibility

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.799
to take care of you as their pastor, right?

00:25:58.799 --> 00:26:01.160
There to be an indigenous self-supporting church,

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.079
that's the idea.

00:26:02.079 --> 00:26:04.959
If you plant a church, we had a church planter

00:26:04.959 --> 00:26:07.440
that we were supporting, Zach Houser,

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.000
we supported him a few years ago.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.279
And as we were supporting him

00:26:10.279 --> 00:26:14.760
in the church that he was planting there up in Delaware,

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.959
we've had this with other church planters

00:26:16.959 --> 00:26:18.279
that we have supported.

00:26:18.279 --> 00:26:19.799
I have conversations with them

00:26:19.799 --> 00:26:21.799
and I say something like this,

00:26:21.799 --> 00:26:23.959
we will support you, we agree to support you

00:26:23.959 --> 00:26:26.320
for X number of months or years.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.519
And once we reach that point,

00:26:28.519 --> 00:26:30.720
normally it's an 18 month commitment

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.279
that we as a church make to them

00:26:32.279 --> 00:26:33.799
as they would go and start a church.

00:26:33.799 --> 00:26:36.880
And then after 18 months, we'll evaluate,

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.320
where's the church, how have things progressed,

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.160
so on and so forth.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:41.820
It's not a one size fits all,

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:44.000
every region is different with regard

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.760
to how many people will be reached

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.040
and so on and so forth.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.959
And then what we would do is evaluate

00:26:48.959 --> 00:26:50.559
at that 18 month point and say,

00:26:50.559 --> 00:26:54.399
okay, let's continue support for six more months.

00:26:54.399 --> 00:26:56.239
You still need support, the church isn't there

00:26:56.239 --> 00:26:58.320
ready to support you as their pastor yet.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.799
And I remember having a conversation

00:26:59.799 --> 00:27:04.480
with one pastor, Brother Houser specifically,

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.200
and he was real sheepish and real shy

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.440
about trying to encourage his church

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.119
to understand their responsibility

00:27:11.119 --> 00:27:12.880
to compensate him.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.239
And here's what I said to him,

00:27:14.239 --> 00:27:15.940
I said this, I said, brother,

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.600
the reality is that you're robbing the church

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.420
of doing what they're called of God to do.

00:27:22.579 --> 00:27:25.399
That's just Bible truth.

00:27:25.399 --> 00:27:27.760
It's not, listen, it's not for filthy lucre.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.880
If it's for filthy lucre,

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.440
he's not fulfilling his responsibility,

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.179
you need to get a new pastor.

00:27:32.179 --> 00:27:34.119
But the responsibility of the church

00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:36.640
is to take care of its pastor.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.880
That's just the responsibility.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.239
You say, well, the pastor can get a job.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:40.859
Well, he can, but then he can't labor

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:42.720
in word and doctrine as effectively as he could

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.200
if he did not work that secular job.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.279
Does that make sense?

00:27:46.279 --> 00:27:47.519
And we understand that.

00:27:47.519 --> 00:27:49.519
And so we find in First Timothy five,

00:27:49.519 --> 00:27:52.399
notice what the Bible says in First Timothy chapter five,

00:27:52.399 --> 00:27:54.239
we read the verses a moment ago

00:27:54.239 --> 00:27:57.820
with regard to the responsibility of the pastor

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:01.160
to be laboring in word and doctrine.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.040
But the Bible gives us two principles

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.119
in this passage of scripture

00:28:04.119 --> 00:28:06.760
with regard to the responsibility of the church.

00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:10.160
Notice, again, in First Timothy five, verse 17,

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.000
it says, let the elders that rule well

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.880
be counted worthy of double honor.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.839
Now, listen, there are people that are gonna take that

00:28:18.839 --> 00:28:20.799
and twist it and say, I should be paid double.

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:21.760
No, that's not what he's saying.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.420
They're worthy of double honor.

00:28:24.279 --> 00:28:27.880
If they labor well, if they rule well,

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.600
be counted worthy of double honor,

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.440
then it says, especially they who labor

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.080
in the word and doctrine.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.760
But then notice it goes on and says this,

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.039
for the scripture saith, thou shalt not muzzle the ox

00:28:38.039 --> 00:28:39.280
that churneth out the corn,

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.479
and the laborer is worthy of his reward.

00:28:43.479 --> 00:28:44.799
It's a Bible principle

00:28:44.799 --> 00:28:47.479
that the laborer is worthy of his reward.

00:28:47.479 --> 00:28:51.260
Some people would argue, well, Paul, he made tents.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.700
Sometimes he did, but sometimes he was compensated.

00:28:56.539 --> 00:28:59.200
You can study through the life of Paul and you can see it

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.520
and you can understand.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.640
And the reality is that as the pastor

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.559
and two of our deacons are in here this evening,

00:29:06.359 --> 00:29:07.320
Ari's not feeling well and Pierre's not here,

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.080
but as the pastor, I have said to these men

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.440
in deacons' meetings that the reality is

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.400
that if things get tough financially,

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.880
the first thing that happens is my salary decreases.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.440
You say, well, pastor, we don't like that.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.440
That's what I've said to these men in meetings.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.200
I hope that never happens.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:27.919
But the reality is that that's the role of the pastor

00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:31.000
is to fulfill the God-given responsibility,

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.039
but there is a responsibility on the side of the church.

00:29:34.039 --> 00:29:36.520
And so as we find and we think about this portion

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.159
of scripture, let me say this,

00:29:38.159 --> 00:29:39.760
and then I'll make some conclusion remarks.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.000
We'll get into prayer time.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.679
I want to say this publicly tonight.

00:29:43.679 --> 00:29:47.260
Our church has been such, I would say,

00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:50.640
how would I want to, they have, you have,

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.640
our church has done well.

00:29:54.479 --> 00:29:56.719
I feel like our church has fulfilled

00:29:56.719 --> 00:30:00.599
it's God's given responsibility to take care of me.

00:30:00.599 --> 00:30:06.059
as the pastor. Again, not an easy subject to preach on as the pastor of the church.

00:30:06.059 --> 00:30:11.079
But the reality is, I would say, I commend our church. I often say, and I'll say in

00:30:11.079 --> 00:30:14.079
a couple of weeks when we have our annual business meeting, I commend our church for

00:30:14.079 --> 00:30:20.399
our missions giving, the way that we give to missions. And listen, that's a responsibility

00:30:20.399 --> 00:30:24.679
to give to missions, but as we understand the responsibility that we have to give to

00:30:24.679 --> 00:30:30.079
missions, it's not at the expense of taking care of the pastor. We've never done that,

00:30:30.079 --> 00:30:35.639
and I thank the Lord for it. I am thankful, and I appreciate. And even as I mentioned

00:30:35.639 --> 00:30:39.319
about the church in Thessalonica, they're a model church. They're doing things well.

00:30:39.319 --> 00:30:43.879
They're doing things right. But God still gives them instruction that says, hey, listen,

00:30:43.879 --> 00:30:49.839
remember these things. Be aware of your responsibility, not only to the church members, but also to

00:30:49.839 --> 00:30:55.199
the pastors of the church. You have responsibility. And if you want to walk worthy and please

00:30:55.199 --> 00:31:00.799
God, here's where the responsibility starts, and we find it with regard to a church and

00:31:00.799 --> 00:31:08.759
its pastor. Now, let me say this in closing. The pastor can fail, and many have. Many have.

00:31:08.759 --> 00:31:14.319
Many pastors have not fulfilled their responsibility, their God-given responsibility that the Bible

00:31:14.319 --> 00:31:20.399
instructs them on what their job, what their duty, what their call is, and they can fail.

00:31:20.399 --> 00:31:24.479
But can I tell you this evening that not every pastor has failed? There are good pastors

00:31:24.479 --> 00:31:29.199
that preach and teach the Word of God that labor in word and in doctrine. There are good

00:31:29.199 --> 00:31:36.779
pastors that feed the flock of God. I don't seek in any way, shape, or form to pat myself

00:31:36.779 --> 00:31:41.079
this evening, but we had a visitor come here a few years ago, and they only came here because

00:31:41.079 --> 00:31:44.879
they were looking for a church to rent. They didn't come here because they were looking

00:31:44.879 --> 00:31:48.919
for a church. They were trying to start a particular church in the area, and so they

00:31:48.919 --> 00:31:52.639
came to visit to see if our church might be available for rent, which it's not because

00:31:52.679 --> 00:31:56.839
we use it, amen? But they came here for that purpose, and after the service, they came

00:31:56.839 --> 00:32:01.319
to the back, and here's, and there was actually two men. They were deacons at this particular

00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:05.079
place where they were going to start this church, and they said, let me ask you a question.

00:32:05.079 --> 00:32:15.839
Do you always feed your flock that way? Initially, I didn't know how to respond to the question,

00:32:15.839 --> 00:32:22.039
because my job is to feed the flock of God. It's my job. It's my responsibility. I don't

00:32:22.039 --> 00:32:26.319
want to take the shortcuts. I don't want to just do a Saturday night special, so to

00:32:26.319 --> 00:32:31.759
speak. Labor in word and in doctrine. It's my responsibility. Pastors have failed. I'm

00:32:31.759 --> 00:32:36.359
not perfect. Pastors have failed, but there are some good pastors. I was at a pastor's

00:32:36.359 --> 00:32:40.959
meeting yesterday. There are some good pastors in Virginia that are laboring in word and

00:32:40.959 --> 00:32:47.839
doctrine that love the church members that God has entrusted them with, and I'm thankful

00:32:47.839 --> 00:32:53.239
for good pastors that understand the responsibility that God has given. There have been churches

00:32:53.239 --> 00:32:59.559
that have failed, plenty of them. They don't fulfill their responsibility, but I'm thankful

00:32:59.559 --> 00:33:04.279
this evening that our church and many others have fulfilled their responsibility, but we

00:33:04.279 --> 00:33:09.519
must be aware of the fact that if we want to continue to walk worthy and please God,

00:33:09.519 --> 00:33:15.959
we must be aware of the instruction that God has given, and as God provides the instruction

00:33:16.079 --> 00:33:22.119
with regard to a pastor, or excuse me, a church and its pastor, we understand that that instruction

00:33:22.119 --> 00:33:29.119
is given so that we might walk worthy and please God, not only as individuals, but corporately

00:33:30.379 --> 00:33:36.159
as a local church, that we could fulfill what God has called us to fulfill. The last part

00:33:36.159 --> 00:33:41.879
of verse 13 will be our study for next week, where the Bible says this, and be at peace

00:33:41.879 --> 00:33:46.639
among yourselves. We'll have an entire lesson next Wednesday evening on the importance of

00:33:46.639 --> 00:33:51.679
unity, the importance of unity. Oh, there's many churches. The church in Corinth will

00:33:51.679 --> 00:33:57.999
be a model that we'll look at next week with regard to the divisions and the disunity that

00:33:57.999 --> 00:34:04.119
was prevalent there. And so we find that God is seeking to instruct not only this church

00:34:04.119 --> 00:34:10.719
in Thessalonica, but every church throughout the church age, ours included. You want to

00:34:10.839 --> 00:34:16.439
walk worthy? You want to please God? Here's some instruction, and it starts with a church

00:34:16.439 --> 00:34:21.719
and its pastor. Let's pray. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. I thank You

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:28.719
this evening for Your Word. God, I'm humbled at the opportunity and the privilege that

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:36.239
You would give me to pastor Fellowship Baptist Church, 12 and a half years. Thank You, Lord.

00:34:40.919 --> 00:34:46.999
I thank You for our church. I thank You for their heart and their spirit. I thank You

00:34:46.999 --> 00:34:52.719
for their desire to fulfill their biblical responsibility. God, I pray that You would

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:59.719
help, even as we look at this portion of Scripture this evening and review and analyze the responsibility

00:35:00.759 --> 00:35:07.079
of the pastor and the responsibility of the church, that each of us would fulfill our

00:35:07.119 --> 00:35:13.879
God-given responsibilities so that we could walk worthy and please You. Lord, we thank

00:35:13.879 --> 00:35:18.039
You for the privilege of prayer. We thank You that we can enter into Your presence,

00:35:18.039 --> 00:35:23.439
that we can bring our petitions before Thy throne, knowing that You hear us and You answer.

00:35:23.439 --> 00:35:26.319
We pray, God, that You'd bless throughout the remainder of the service. We pray that

00:35:26.319 --> 00:35:30.119
all that's said and done, that You alone would be glorified. For it's in Christ's name we

00:35:30.119 --> 00:35:31.599
pray. Amen.
