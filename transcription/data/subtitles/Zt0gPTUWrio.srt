1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Chapter number 21, and we'll be looking at verses 8 through 21 this evening as we look

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,860
at this portion of Scripture.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,920
And I'll just read a couple of verses and we'll get right into the message.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,559
Of course, if you were here last Sunday evening, we looked at the first seven verses of this

5
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:22,680
chapter and we dealt with the fact that Isaac's birth is recorded here, and we noted as we

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,840
studied that portion of Scripture, the faithfulness of God and the obedience of Abraham.

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,560
I mentioned this, that I believe that this probably was one of the highest points in

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,840
Abraham's life, the birth of Isaac.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,939
After 25 years of being promised and looking forward to that seed, that promise that would

10
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:48,439
come to see it fulfilled and to hold little Isaac, can you imagine just the joy?

11
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:52,500
Obviously, those of us that have had the privilege of having children, you think about the joy

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,419
of holding that newborn baby and what precious joy that is.

13
00:00:57,419 --> 00:01:02,740
And to think about Abraham at this point in his life, 25 years again, from the time the

14
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:09,660
initial promise, of course, repeated often, but God always does what He says He will do.

15
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,620
And we're thankful for the faithfulness of God, thankful for the obedience of Abraham.

16
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,139
As we continue into the passage of Scripture, we find that the Bible tells us that Isaac

17
00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:20,839
was weaned and Abraham made a great feast.

18
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:26,440
Notice in verse number 8, the Bible says, and a child grew, speaking of Isaac, and was

19
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:33,639
weaned, and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.

20
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:38,440
I want to preach a message that I've titled this evening from verse number 8, Abraham

21
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,160
made a great feast.

22
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,080
Abraham made a great feast.

23
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,720
Traditionally, it is believed and held that children in this particular culture would

24
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,720
be weaned between the ages of 2 and 3.

25
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,680
And 2 to 3 years old would be the age in which a child would be weaned.

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,919
Most scholars would lean towards 3 as being the age specifically.

27
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:05,220
And I say that by way of introduction so that we can build a little timeline here to understand

28
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,080
as we begin to look at the remainder of this passage.

29
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,479
And so if we go with the age of 3, then that would mean that Abraham at this time, when

30
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,720
he made this great feast, that he was 103 years old.

31
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,479
And so remember, Abraham was 100 when Isaac was born.

32
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:24,679
And so that's pretty easy math, 100 plus 3.

33
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:27,399
And so Abraham's 103 years old.

34
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:32,679
But we also would find that the Bible tells us back in Genesis chapter number 16 and verse

35
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:38,399
number 16 that Abraham was 86 when Ishmael was born.

36
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:43,800
And so he was 86 years old when Ishmael was born, and that would lead us to understanding

37
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,440
as we study this passage of Scripture that Ishmael is now 17 years old.

38
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,119
And so he's either 16 or 17 if you want to go with the 2 or the 3, however you want to

39
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:55,119
look at that.

40
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:59,880
But he's either 16 or 17 years old because Abraham was 86 when Ishmael was born according

41
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,440
to Genesis 16 and verse number 16.

42
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,320
And so as we understand kind of the timeline of what's going on, again the ages of these

43
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,479
folks, it helps us to kind of understand the full context of what's going to happen and

44
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,500
put it in proper perspective.

45
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,979
If you're taking notes, number one this evening, I just want you to note the historical account.

46
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:22,460
I'm really just going to read through it and make some comments, really verses 9 through

47
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,020
21, and look at the historical account that God gives us.

48
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,039
And then we'll go over to the New Testament and begin to look at an application.

49
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:34,460
But notice with me as we look and begin in verse number 8, the first highlight, if you

50
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,119
will, if you want to kind of put some things down.

51
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:41,139
Number one, we see that Isaac is weaned, and that's given to us in verse number 8.

52
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:46,360
And that's really the beginning of this historical context account that God is giving us.

53
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,500
And at that time of his weaning, we find that Abraham makes this great feast.

54
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:57,059
Now this was customary in this particular culture to behave in this manner and to celebrate

55
00:03:57,059 --> 00:04:01,300
the growth and development of a child and to kind of make that next step and so on and

56
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,660
so forth.

57
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,740
And what a blessing that they would follow in that and understand those things.

58
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,380
In verse number 9, as we continue to read, we find that the Bible says,

59
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:17,859
And Sarah saw the son of Hagar, the Egyptian, which she had borne unto Abraham, mocking.

60
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:22,779
Now as we look at verse number 9, we note two additional aspects of this content in

61
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:24,660
this account that God is giving us.

62
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,980
Number one, we find that Ishmael is mocking.

63
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,700
The word mock here, it means to tease or laugh at in a scornful manner.

64
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,500
And we find that he is mocking, and Sarah observes this behavior.

65
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,420
It says in verse number 9 that Sarah saw the son of Hagar, the Egyptian.

66
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,359
We know that to be Ishmael contextually as you look through the book of Genesis and the

67
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:47,540
preceding chapters.

68
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:53,660
And so you find here that on this momentous occasion, you see what's happening, and Isaac

69
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,100
is weaned, and Abraham's making this great feast.

70
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:04,739
And there's this 17-year-old that has been to this point the only offspring of Abraham.

71
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:05,739
He'd been the only son.

72
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:11,420
Remember, Abraham cried out to God, O that Ishmael might live before thee.

73
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,739
Abraham no doubt loved Ishmael, and no doubt they had a relationship.

74
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:20,859
And now Ishmael's 17 years old, and the Bible says that at this momentous occasion that

75
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:25,700
he's mocking, and Sarah observes this.

76
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,500
Sarah's not very happy at what she sees happening.

77
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
She's not delighted with the circumstances.

78
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,880
We find that it begins conflict here.

79
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,339
It's very similar to what we find in the account back in Genesis chapter number 16, when she

80
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:46,179
had the idea that Abraham go and be married to Hagar, and then when Hagar was expecting,

81
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,179
there was strife.

82
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:50,899
There was contention between Hagar and Sarah.

83
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:55,779
And so we find here that as Sarah observes what's going on, she then responds, and notice

84
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:58,140
the response in verses 10 and 11.

85
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:05,160
The Bible says, Wherefore, she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son.

86
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,859
For the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.

87
00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:16,059
And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.

88
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:19,660
Again, you can understand the context of verse number 11.

89
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,660
That's where I mentioned the age.

90
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,660
He's 17 years old.

91
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:27,579
I mean, you think about the bond and the time that has been taken, and you find that Sarah

92
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:35,739
is not happy, and she responds, and her response is to cast out this bondwoman and her son.

93
00:06:35,739 --> 00:06:41,220
She says that he, Ishmael, will not be heir with my son, with Isaac.

94
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,339
Now we understand contextually as we're reading this account, we understand a lot of what

95
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:52,660
God has already said with regard to the promises that God has made, that it was in the promised

96
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,459
seed of that God was going to bless Isaac.

97
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:58,339
His blessing would be in Isaac.

98
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:02,500
And we understand those things as we study the Scriptures, but as we know what's taking

99
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,660
place here, we can see the conflict within the family and the emotions that are going

100
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:12,579
on, and it's grievous in the sight of Abraham and all that's taking place.

101
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:19,660
But we find that as Abraham's trying to take in everything that Sarah has said, now God

102
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,579
speaks.

103
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:27,899
And the Bible says in verse number 12, and God said unto Abraham, I'm thankful that God

104
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:29,540
spoke to Abraham.

105
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,140
And as we look at the passage of Scripture, I'll say right at the beginning of really

106
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:39,940
this point of the message this evening, that I understand that we can get ourselves emotionally

107
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:45,140
involved within the content of what's going on here, and we can have all sorts of emotions

108
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,299
on whether we think it was right or wrong or why and all of that sort of thing.

109
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:53,059
But as we draw the conclusion this evening and go over to the book of Galatians and see

110
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:59,299
the application that God gives us, we see how God is providing for us this beautiful

111
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:06,220
picture of really the spiritual conflict that we can deal with, that we do deal with.

112
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:11,019
And so we see that God speaks, and He says unto Abraham, notice what He says, let it

113
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:17,899
not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman, and all

114
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:23,380
that Sarah hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice.

115
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,299
For in Isaac shall thy seed be called.

116
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:30,500
You understand that God's plan does not change.

117
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,219
This has been the plan that God has given from the beginning.

118
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:38,500
We find that as Abraham would cry out in chapter number 17, as I mentioned a moment

119
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,619
ago, O that Ishmael might live before thee, that God says, I've heard what you've said,

120
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:49,219
I've heard thee, and I will bless him, and I will make of him a great nation, but my

121
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:52,539
covenant will I establish with Isaac.

122
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:57,619
And so here in chapter number 21, God reaffirms His plan that He's already given.

123
00:08:57,619 --> 00:09:01,479
He says, for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.

124
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:06,799
And we find that He, God, gives instruction that Abraham, the first aspect of the instruction

125
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:12,440
is that He is to hearken unto the voice of Sarah, that He is to do what Sarah has said.

126
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,239
Notice it says here in the verse, it says, and all that Sarah hath said unto thee hearken

127
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:19,239
unto her voice.

128
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:21,400
Well, what was it that Sarah said?

129
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,719
Cast out this bondwoman and her son.

130
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:26,320
That's what Sarah said.

131
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,039
And God says, hearken unto her voice.

132
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,760
And He says this, for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.

133
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,799
Notice that God not only says hearken unto the voice of Sarah, He says that in Isaac

134
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,799
shall thy seed be called.

135
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:45,159
But I want you to notice what He says in verse number 13 with regard to Ishmael.

136
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:53,840
He says, and also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation because he is thy seed.

137
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:59,200
And so again, it's consistent with what God has already communicated to Abraham back in

138
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,359
chapter 17.

139
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:04,579
God had made this declaration, this promise. In fact, if you go all the way

140
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:09,099
back to chapter number 16 and you read what's taking place there after the

141
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:15,019
birth of Ishmael, you find that God had given promise there with regard to

142
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:20,459
Ishmael as well. And so as we look here at the context, we find again this

143
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:29,579
historical account that God speaks. Now when God speaks, we have to respond. We

144
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:34,939
have to respond. And we're gonna respond in one of two ways. Obedience or

145
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:40,939
disobedience. There's no middle ground. There's no halfway point. There's no

146
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:45,459
partial. We've said often, and perhaps you've said it to your children, partial

147
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:53,579
obedience is disobedience, right? To obey is better than sacrifice. That's what

148
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:58,939
Samuel tells Saul. And we find that here as Abraham would receive this

149
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:04,899
instruction from God, he now is left at a moment of decision. What is it that

150
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:10,579
he's going to do? Is he gonna obey or is he gonna disobey? Now, the reality is that

151
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:14,499
there are times in our lives in which God may ask us to do something that's

152
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:21,219
not easy to do. Which path are we gonna choose? See, this was a

153
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:26,939
relationship, his son, that had been built 17 years and God saying, no, hearken to

154
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:31,099
the voice of Sarah and this is how you're supposed to go forward. And we

155
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:36,619
find that Abraham is now left in this place of decision. We noted last week the

156
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:40,339
obedience of Abraham and we've noted that it really, if you study throughout

157
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:44,219
the scriptures, that you'll find often that the Bible speaks about the

158
00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:49,899
obedience of Abraham. The reality is that Hebrews 11, when it speaks about Abraham,

159
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:55,379
it says that he obeyed after God called. He obeyed and he went out not knowing

160
00:11:55,419 --> 00:12:01,579
whither he went. And so we find here that Abraham is going to then act, we notice

161
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:06,099
in verse number 14, the Bible says, and Abraham rose up early in the morning. He

162
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:12,779
didn't waste any time. There's no delay. See, sometimes we delay, right? Delayed

163
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:17,699
obedience. Well, I'll get to it when I get to it. And you know one of the problems

164
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:23,779
with delayed obedience is that sometimes we never actually get to it, right? We

165
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:26,899
just don't ever get to doing what we're supposed to do because something else

166
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:31,819
creeps in and something else does. And when God shows us, when God reveals to us

167
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:37,099
truth, as hard as it may be, as difficult and as challenging as it might be, we

168
00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:41,939
need to obey. We need to obey immediately. And we find that the Bible says that he

169
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:45,739
rose up early in the morning, notice it says, and took bread and a bottle of

170
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:50,899
water and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder and the child and sent

171
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:56,259
her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. Again, I

172
00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:00,499
understand the emotions that we could have as we read an account such as this

173
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:04,219
and we could question all that we want to question, but the reality is that

174
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:09,099
God's ways are not our ways. His thoughts are not our thoughts. And we find that

175
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:13,099
this is indeed the actual instruction that God has provided to Abraham and

176
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:18,419
would be later used as a great truth, a great spiritual truth for us to

177
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:22,939
understand. We find that as Abraham acted in verse number 14, that then we

178
00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:26,699
continue throughout the context here looking at this historical account that

179
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:31,379
is provided, and we find that the water was spent and Hagar wept. It says in

180
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:35,499
verse number 16, excuse me, verse number 15, and the water was spent in the bottle

181
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:39,339
and she cast the child under one of the shrubs and she went and sat her down

182
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:44,699
over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot, for she said, let me not

183
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:49,139
see the death of the child. And she sat over against him and lift up her voice

184
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:55,539
and wept. Again, what a difficult situation. She didn't want to see the

185
00:13:55,539 --> 00:14:00,219
death of Ishmael and no doubt if you can put yourself in this position you

186
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:04,619
wouldn't want to see the death of your child either. And we find here that as

187
00:14:04,619 --> 00:14:09,299
that water was spent and as she wept, we find that an angel of God

188
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:15,659
spake unto her. In verse number 17, the Bible says in, it says, and God heard the

189
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:20,539
voice of the lad. And the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven and said

190
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:26,500
unto her, what aileth thee, Hagar? Fear not, for God hath heard the voice of the

191
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,979
lad where he is. Notice in verse number 18 that God is going to provide once

192
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:36,979
again a promise that has been oft repeated with regard to Ishmael. It says,

193
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:43,099
Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand, for I will make him a great

194
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:50,339
nation. As a side note, let me say this, God did. He fulfilled the promise that he

195
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:56,099
made with regard to Ishmael. And we find that he not only has made of him a great

196
00:14:56,099 --> 00:15:01,619
nation, we do understand, and of course there's a bunch of confusion with

197
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:05,819
regard to the seed and so on and so forth, with regard to if you speak to

198
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:09,579
some within the Muslim faith and they believe that it's through Ishmael, not

199
00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:14,939
through Isaac, but we understand without any controversy that God has explicitly

200
00:15:14,939 --> 00:15:22,299
said in his word that the blessing would go through Isaac. But he said he would

201
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:27,539
bless Ishmael, and he has. Now we understand that there's much history

202
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:30,899
that could be looked at and so on and so forth, and we'll save that for another

203
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:35,699
discussion, but we find here that as we continue with this historical content in

204
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:39,459
the account that's given to us here, that not only is there a promise given

205
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:43,259
in verse number 18, but we find that provision is given in verse number 19.

206
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:49,059
The Bible says, And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went

207
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:55,379
and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. In verses 20 and 21,

208
00:15:55,379 --> 00:16:00,299
the Bible tells us of the development and marriage of Ishmael. The Bible says

209
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:05,419
that God was with the lad, again Ishmael, and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness

210
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:10,219
and became an archer, and he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother

211
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:15,619
took him a wife out of the land of Egypt. Now we understand that Hagar, remember,

212
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:19,619
she was an Egyptian, right? If you go all the way back and you find in Genesis

213
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:23,899
chapter number 12, during that time in which they had that great famine, that

214
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:28,259
difficulty that was faced, and the first time in which Abraham said that Sarah

215
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:32,819
was his sister to Pharaoh, and so on and so forth, when they come back, they come

216
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:38,179
back with Hagar, according to what we find in the portion of Scripture. And so

217
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:43,539
as we look at the the historical account that is given, we find that now Ishmael

218
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:48,739
is married, and he's married to an Egyptian. Now we understand that as we

219
00:16:48,739 --> 00:16:53,219
look at the historical content, the account that is provided to us, much

220
00:16:53,219 --> 00:16:57,979
discussion could be made. But instead of us making discussion with regard to the

221
00:16:57,979 --> 00:17:03,259
content that is here, I'd rather let God's Word give us insight as to that

222
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:08,459
which is provided to us here in Genesis 21. And so we find that, yes, we know the

223
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,500
historical account, but number two, I want you to note the spiritual

224
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,859
application. In order to note the spiritual application, we must go to the

225
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:19,739
book of Galatians in chapter number four. In Galatians chapter number four, the

226
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:25,099
book of Galatians is just a power-filled book with so much wonderful truth with

227
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:29,500
regard to the the early church and all that was happening with the Judaizers

228
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,819
and all that was taking place. Of course, the book of Galatians is written to the

229
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:38,939
churches that are in the region of Galatia. These churches were planted,

230
00:17:38,939 --> 00:17:42,779
established, if you will, during the first missionary journey of the Apostle Paul,

231
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:47,379
and we find that that could be recorded, or it is recorded, and can be reviewed in

232
00:17:47,379 --> 00:17:53,179
Acts 13 and 14. And in these cities, Antioch and Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, and

233
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:57,699
Derbe, these churches were established, and these Judaizers come in, and there's

234
00:17:57,699 --> 00:18:03,539
all kinds of crazy teaching that's going on. And we understand that, really, as you

235
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:07,779
begin looking in the beginning of chapter number two, that it really points

236
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:12,339
us back to Acts chapter number 15, when they had that council at Jerusalem, and

237
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:16,099
there were some that were saying this, except you be circumcised after the

238
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:21,379
manner of Moses, you cannot be saved. And we know that's not true, and that was

239
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:25,019
something that these Judaizers were bringing into these churches in the

240
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:30,099
region of Galatia, and so Paul is seeking to provide them with instruction, and God

241
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:34,979
is faithful to give the truth of His Word to these believers in these

242
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:41,299
churches. And we find that in verses 21 through 31 of Galatians 4, that the

243
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:46,459
spiritual application is provided for us with regard to that account that we read

244
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,779
in Genesis 21. Notice what it says here in verse number 21,

245
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:58,899
tell me ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? And then

246
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:03,260
notice this, he says, for it is written. Now he'll say for it is written again in

247
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,659
verse 27, and then he'll say in verse number 30, what saith the scripture? See,

248
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:13,059
Paul was well-versed within the Old Testament, he understood the teaching of

249
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:16,140
the Old Testament, he was well-versed in it, and we understand the Old Testament has

250
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:22,299
been given for our learning, for our admonition, and there are some today that

251
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:25,700
take the approach that we really don't need the Old Testament because we're

252
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:30,820
New Testament believers, and that's a bad approach because God Himself tells us

253
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:36,500
that the Old Testament has been given for our admonition, for our learning, and

254
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,899
no doubt there's great truth for us to understand. And so we find that Paul

255
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:45,539
makes an appeal to the scriptures, and he says this in verse 22, for it is

256
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:53,820
written that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a free

257
00:19:53,820 --> 00:20:00,179
woman. So we find immediately that Paul is going back to this passage of

258
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:00,679
scripture.

259
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:05,519
in Genesis chapter 21 where we see the birth of Isaac. Of course Ishmael was

260
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:13,839
born 16 years, 14 years earlier than the birth of Isaac and we find here that

261
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:19,279
that he's referring to these two sons Ishmael and Isaac. Ishmael from the

262
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:24,679
bondmaid and Isaac from the free woman. Notice in verse 23, but he who was of the

263
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:31,799
bondwoman was born, notice what it says, after the flesh but he of the free woman

264
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:38,799
was by promise or shall I say by faith. It says in verse number 24, notice this,

265
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:45,919
which things are an allegory, which things are an allegory for these are the

266
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,159
two covenants, the one from the Mount Sinai which gendereth to bondage which

267
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:56,199
is Hagar, for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to Jerusalem

268
00:20:56,199 --> 00:21:01,279
which now is and is in bondage with her children. But Jerusalem which is above

269
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:07,119
is free which is the mother of us all. For it is written, rejoice thou barren

270
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,299
that bearest not, break forth and cry thou that travailest not, for the

271
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:15,479
desolate hath many more children than she which hath not a husband. Notice

272
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:23,519
verse 28, now he says now we brethren as Isaac was are the children of promise.

273
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,359
Now you see how he's gonna make the application this allegory, he says these

274
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:32,359
things are an allegory, this passage of Scripture in Genesis 21, as you hold on

275
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,519
here in just a couple of more verses we're gonna see how we know exactly that

276
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,959
he's speaking about Genesis 21. He's mentioned the two sons, he's mentioned of

277
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:46,479
course Hagar and Sarah, and now we find that he says that we brethren as Isaac

278
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:54,159
was in verse 28 are the children of promise. He says this in verse 29, but as

279
00:21:54,159 --> 00:22:00,439
then he that was born after the flesh, who's that? That's Ishmael, right? That's

280
00:22:00,439 --> 00:22:05,119
who he's referring to. He says he that was born after the flesh persecuted him

281
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:12,679
that was born after the Spirit. Then notice these words, even so it is now. And

282
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:18,839
so he's making, he's unfolding for us this wonderful spiritual application

283
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:22,919
with regard to the historical account that is given to us in Genesis chapter

284
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:28,399
21. He goes on further and he says nevertheless, notice in verse 30, what

285
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:32,799
saith the Scripture? Again he's appealing back to the Word of God. Notice what he

286
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,639
says, cast out the bondwoman and her son. No doubt now that we're speaking

287
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:43,000
specifically about Genesis 21 in the historical account that we just read. He

288
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,519
says for the son of the bondwoman, notice, shall not be heir with the son of the

289
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:57,639
free woman. So then, here's the conclusion, so then brethren we are not children of

290
00:22:57,639 --> 00:23:06,039
the bondwoman but of the free. See, the law cannot save. All the law can do is

291
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:12,679
condemn. That's all the law can do. In fact, if you look back in Galatians 3, he

292
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:16,759
says, is the law then, in verse number 21, is the law then against the promises of

293
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:22,119
God? God forbid. For if there had been a law given which could have given life,

294
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:27,959
verily righteousness should have been by the law. But what saith the Scripture? He

295
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:32,519
says, but the Scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise by faith

296
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:37,559
of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. In chapter number 2, in

297
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,959
verse number 21, he says, I do not frustrate the grace of God, for if

298
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:47,079
righteousness came by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. And so he began

299
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:51,879
this passage of Scripture in Galatians 4, in verse number 21, by saying this,

300
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:59,000
tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? And so there

301
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,479
were some that were trying to put themselves back under the law, these

302
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:04,599
Judaizers that were coming in and saying, hey, you got to be under the law, you got

303
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:09,479
to be under the law. Now, if you've read the law, you probably don't want to be

304
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:16,279
under the law. Amen? I'm glad to be in the dispensation, if you will, of grace. Amen?

305
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:22,119
I'm thankful that we're not under the law, that Christ has fulfilled the law.

306
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm thankful for that. And we find that Paul is explaining this allegory that is

307
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,759
given to us. This historical account in Genesis chapter number 21 has this

308
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:39,600
wonderful, powerful spiritual application that is unfolded to us in Galatians

309
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,759
chapter number 4. And really, there's two aspects to this allegory. Number one is

310
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:50,839
this, there are two covenants. There's an old covenant, and there's a new covenant.

311
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:57,000
The old covenant is under Hagar, or after the flesh. You find that it says in

312
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:04,279
verse number 23, but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh, but

313
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:08,639
he of the free woman was by promise. And so we see that this old

314
00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:13,919
covenant, Hagar, of course he'll get into the law, we understand that no doubt

315
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,919
contextually, Paul has clear understanding that Abraham and Hagar

316
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:24,559
and Sarah, Ishmael and Isaac, they predate the law. We understand that. But the law

317
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,720
would come many years later, and it would show, it would be the revelation to the

318
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:36,759
people of God that there's no way you can keep this. It condemns. It

319
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:41,639
proves that we're guilty. And so we find here that he's showing us, he says in

320
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:46,600
verse number 24, which things are an allegory, for these are the two covenants.

321
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,239
The one for Mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Hagar, and so we see

322
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:56,919
that being the flesh. And it only leads to bondage. Notice he says in verse 25,

323
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:01,880
for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabian, answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and

324
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:09,239
is in bondage with her children. You know that before salvation, we're in bondage

325
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:13,039
to our sin. It's what the Word of God teaches in Romans chapter number 6, we

326
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:20,559
are bound by sin. And so we find that as we think about this old covenant that is

327
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,000
mentioned in this allegory that is being explained to us, that there are two

328
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,160
covenants, that this bondage that is mentioned, we find that it's there for us

329
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:35,519
in verses 24 and 25, we find that this old covenant, it brings death.

330
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:41,519
Ephesians chapter number 2 tells us that we were dead in our trespasses and sins

331
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:46,759
in Ephesians 2 and verse number 1. You know in Romans chapter number 8, I am so

332
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:53,720
thankful for the truth of just the fact that there is no condemnation. It says

333
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,039
this in Romans 8 and verse number 1, there is therefore now no condemnation

334
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:02,459
to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh but after the

335
00:27:02,459 --> 00:27:08,220
Spirit. But the reality is that for those that are not in Christ Jesus, there

336
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:15,380
is condemnation, right? Remember, we find that the Bible tells us and oftentimes we

337
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:20,619
quote, and rightly so, the truth of John 3, and so many people are familiar with

338
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:26,500
John 3 in verse number 16, and I'm so thankful that God did love the world. It

339
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,739
says, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever

340
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,739
believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. It says, for God

341
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:37,259
sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world but that the world

342
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:42,380
through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned, verse

343
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:52,259
18, but he that believeth not is condemned already. Why? Because he hath

344
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:58,100
not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. Verse 36 of John 3

345
00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:02,220
says, he that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life, and he that believeth

346
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:10,699
not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. I have not

347
00:28:10,699 --> 00:28:15,699
ever personally used the gospel tract, but there was a gospel tract many years

348
00:28:15,699 --> 00:28:20,299
ago that said something to the effect of, what do I have to do to go to hell? And

349
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:26,059
you opened it up and it said nothing. Nothing. Why? Because you're condemned

350
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:31,859
already. See, the allegory that is explained of this historical account in

351
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:35,539
Genesis 21 provides us with the understanding of this old covenant. He

352
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:41,179
says there are two covenants. The one from Mount Sinai, this old covenant, the

353
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:47,260
law, the flesh, the bondage, the death, the condemnation. But then we understand

354
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,820
that there's a new covenant. It says in verse 26, back in Galatians 4, but

355
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:58,739
Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all. He said back in

356
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:03,179
verse number 23, but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh, but

357
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:08,619
then notice, he of the free woman was by promise. He then says this in verse 28,

358
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:13,739
now we brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise. Now remember, we

359
00:29:13,739 --> 00:29:17,339
looked at this last week as we looked at the first seven verses of Genesis 21,

360
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:20,820
this promise that had been made. I mentioned it by way of introduction this

361
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:26,700
evening. For 25 years before the promise was fulfilled, I mean from the time the

362
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,219
first giving of the promise to Abraham with regard to, I will give you a land

363
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:36,779
and I will give you a seed. And we find that God kept his word, but it was 25

364
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:43,460
years later, but he no doubt, Isaac, is the result of this promise that God

365
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:50,500
had made. And so we see in the new covenant, it's grace. It's grace. We find

366
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:56,580
it in the new covenant, it's freedom. As is mentioned in verse 26, that Jerusalem

367
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:02,539
which is above is free. Notice what he says in verse number 31, so then brethren,

368
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:08,619
Brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.

369
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:11,819
The truth shall make you free.

370
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:12,819
Right?

371
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:18,859
Remember, Jesus, as He makes that declaration, He's speaking to those Jews and they're saying,

372
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,899
we've not been in bondage to anybody.

373
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:25,979
They were in bondage at the time that they said that.

374
00:30:25,979 --> 00:30:29,299
I mean, just look around and you can see the Romans all over the place, right?

375
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:32,859
I mean, that was what was going on.

376
00:30:32,859 --> 00:30:37,019
No doubt, you don't have to go far into their history to see about the Babylonian captivity

377
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:39,979
and the Assyrian captivity and so on and so forth.

378
00:30:39,979 --> 00:30:44,379
And certainly they had been in captivity, they'd been in bondage, and Jesus is making

379
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:52,339
this truth, of course, with regard to the freedom from sin, the power of sin, the bondage

380
00:30:52,339 --> 00:30:53,339
of sin.

381
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:58,219
And so we find that this new covenant, as we look at this allegory and it provides this

382
00:30:58,219 --> 00:31:03,299
truth of these two covenants and it being of grace and providing freedom, we understand

383
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:05,019
the life.

384
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:10,299
The Bible says that the wage of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through

385
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:12,579
Jesus Christ our Lord.

386
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,939
I'm thankful for the life.

387
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:18,419
Remember what Jesus said in John chapter number 10, I've come to give them life, and He says

388
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:22,699
this, that they would have it more abundantly.

389
00:31:22,699 --> 00:31:26,459
The abundant life through the Lord Jesus Christ.

390
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:30,379
The grace that He provides, we mentioned this morning about being forgiven, and we

391
00:31:30,379 --> 00:31:35,299
find that this new covenant allows us to understand our acceptance.

392
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:40,059
It's a wonderful thing to be accepted by God, to know that we're accepted in the Beloved,

393
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:44,979
to know that we are the people of God, the children of God, that we are joint heirs with

394
00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:46,539
Jesus Christ.

395
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:48,179
It's grace.

396
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:49,899
It's grace.

397
00:31:49,899 --> 00:31:55,179
And so as we look at the truth that's given here, we find no doubt that there can be no

398
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,139
mixture of law and grace.

399
00:31:57,139 --> 00:31:59,459
It will not work.

400
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:03,899
Law and grace cannot, they can't mix, it doesn't work.

401
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:09,299
He says in verse number 30, nevertheless, what saith the Scripture?

402
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:13,739
Cast out the bondwoman and her son, the flesh.

403
00:32:13,739 --> 00:32:14,739
Cast that out.

404
00:32:14,739 --> 00:32:15,739
Why?

405
00:32:15,739 --> 00:32:22,419
For the law and the flesh, he says this, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir

406
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:24,779
with the son of the free woman.

407
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:28,219
And so we see that the mixture of law and grace, that first covenant and that second

408
00:32:28,219 --> 00:32:35,099
covenant, the old is done away, Christ fulfilled the law, and we're so thankful for that.

409
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:39,899
Remember as you look in Hebrews chapter number 10, those priests, they came daily ministering

410
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:42,139
and offering the same sacrifices.

411
00:32:42,139 --> 00:32:46,019
The Bible says that could never take away sin.

412
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:50,139
You make the offering today, you've got to come back and make the offering again tomorrow.

413
00:32:50,139 --> 00:32:56,019
Basically it was a constant reminder of their sin.

414
00:32:56,019 --> 00:33:02,299
But this man, after he made one sacrifice for sin forever, who is this man?

415
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:03,539
It's the Lord Jesus Christ.

416
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:05,459
He fulfilled it.

417
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:10,939
That's the second, or the new covenant, the grace that is given.

418
00:33:10,939 --> 00:33:15,579
And we find this allegory explained, the allegory having the first aspect of the two covenants,

419
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:19,699
but I also want you to consider this evening from this passage of Scripture, not only the

420
00:33:19,699 --> 00:33:22,579
two covenants, but the two natures.

421
00:33:22,579 --> 00:33:26,059
We see the contrast between Hagar and Sarah.

422
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:30,779
We see the explanation between the bondwoman and the free woman.

423
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:35,179
We see the law and the grace, the flesh and the promise.

424
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,579
We see that.

425
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:40,959
But then we see the two natures.

426
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:46,419
Not necessarily explained by Hagar and Sarah, but seen through Ishmael and Isaac.

427
00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:52,059
We think about those two natures as we think about what's happening here in the truth that

428
00:33:52,059 --> 00:33:59,179
God has given, we find that Ishmael would best represent the flesh, right?

429
00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:06,459
After Abraham and Sarah, at the time, Abram and Sarai, after they'd received the promise

430
00:34:06,459 --> 00:34:10,899
and they wait ten years and there's no children, they begin to rely on their own understanding.

431
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:15,699
Sarai says, hey, go in, there's Hagar, marry her, go in and have seed, and so on and so

432
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:21,299
forth, and it's the result of their leaning on their own understanding and following in

433
00:34:21,299 --> 00:34:27,739
that manner the birth of Ishmael, it no doubt represents for us the flesh.

434
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:31,339
But we find that Isaac would represent the spirit.

435
00:34:31,339 --> 00:34:37,579
Now, as we look at this, we find that in verse 28 and verse number 31, it's so interesting

436
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:43,159
how that the application is made directly to us as the people of God today.

437
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:48,479
He says in verse number 28, now we, brethren, he's speaking to these believers in Galatia

438
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:52,739
that have been saved, now these ones that said, or at least that they were thinking

439
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:58,359
they'd been influenced by these Judaizers, ye that desire to be under the law.

440
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:02,039
He's saying, listen, why would you want to go, that's going backwards.

441
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:03,379
Why would you want to do that?

442
00:35:03,379 --> 00:35:09,879
You've already been delivered, you've already been given the deliverance from that law and

443
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:15,559
that bondage that it represents, and you've been given the freedom through grace, and

444
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:18,079
this has been preached to you, and so he says, why would you want to do this?

445
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:25,079
But then he says in verse 28, now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.

446
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:29,359
Now, if you take out the parenthetical, if you will, he just says, now we are the children

447
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,359
of promise.

448
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:32,759
We are the children of promise.

449
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:39,159
Notice what he says back in chapter number, look in verse number, chapter number three

450
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:41,759
in verse number six.

451
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:45,439
It speaks about Abraham believing God, it being accounted to him for righteousness,

452
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:50,999
but look over at verse number 13, it says this, Christ hath redeemed us from the curse

453
00:35:50,999 --> 00:35:56,639
of the law being made a curse for us, for it is written, cursed is everyone that hangeth

454
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:02,159
on a tree, that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ,

455
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:05,679
that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

456
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:10,639
He then says this, and as we're looking in chapter number four, he's speaking about this

457
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:17,039
truth that we, just as Isaac was, we are the children of promise.

458
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:18,039
This truth of redemption.

459
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:21,679
We've been dealing with this in Colossians, it's really interesting how God has brought

460
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,879
all these things together at this same time with what we've been looking at in Colossians

461
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:30,759
3, verses 5, now through verse number 14, with regard to the put off and the put on

462
00:36:30,759 --> 00:36:36,239
and all that's going on and dealing with that conflict between the flesh and the Spirit,

463
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:41,399
and so we find that Paul is making this application directly to these believers, and he's saying,

464
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:46,919
listen, we are the children of promise, notice in verse 31, so then, brethren, we are not

465
00:36:46,919 --> 00:36:50,519
children of the bondwoman, but of the free.

466
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:51,519
Why?

467
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:53,199
Because we've been born again.

468
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:58,199
So we have this new nature, no longer are we under that death and condemnation, but

469
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:02,999
now there is no condemnation for them that are in Christ Jesus.

470
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:07,959
Now we have the truth of eternal life, we've been accepted in the Beloved, and so we find

471
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:14,519
that there's now this flesh and this Spirit, these two natures, and we find that he tells

472
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:20,199
us in chapter number 5, in verse number 17, for the flesh lusteth against the Spirit and

473
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:25,239
the Spirit against the flesh, and these are contrary to one to the other, so that ye cannot

474
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:27,839
do the things that ye would.

475
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,879
Man, it makes full circle with what we've been dealing with in Colossians, and we find

476
00:37:32,879 --> 00:37:37,799
that Paul is saying to these believers here in the region of Galatia, listen, this truth

477
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:43,719
of Genesis 21, this historical account that you're perhaps familiar with, many of us are

478
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,599
familiar with Genesis 21.

479
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:51,039
Of course, those that were Jewish, they would have been very familiar, no doubt, with the

480
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:53,319
account in Genesis 21.

481
00:37:53,319 --> 00:37:58,199
Those that were Gentiles that had been saved, maybe not the same level of knowledge of that

482
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:04,259
passage of Scripture, and thus we find that Paul is making this application, he's explaining,

483
00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:10,439
he says these things are an allegory, and so therefore, what is it that the Scripture says,

484
00:38:10,439 --> 00:38:14,479
what is it that we follow, how is it that we behave?

485
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:17,879
Cast out the bondwoman and her son.

486
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:22,999
Not only are we casting out the old covenant, but we're casting out the flesh.

487
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:25,519
Does that make sense tonight?

488
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:29,599
And we find that, why, why do they have to be cast out?

489
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,279
Because they can't coexist.

490
00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:33,279
They can't coexist.

491
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:38,839
Listen, you're either walking in the flesh or you're walking in the Spirit.

492
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:41,799
It's just, it's one or the other, I mean, you're either following God and obeying Him

493
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:42,799
or you're disobeying Him.

494
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:47,559
Remember, I said that when God spoke to Abraham there in Genesis chapter number 21, after

495
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:53,359
Sarah had said what she said, after her observance of Ishmael mocking, and God says to Abraham,

496
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,719
hearken unto her voice.

497
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:56,719
What was her voice?

498
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:59,119
Cast him out.

499
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,119
He has a decision to make.

500
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,639
He has a decision to make.

501
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,799
Because Ishmael and Isaac could not be in the same house.

502
00:39:08,799 --> 00:39:10,839
It just wasn't going to work.

503
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:14,500
And for us as the people of God, as Paul, through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit

504
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:21,099
of God, would give us the truth here in Galatians chapter number 4, which gives us great insight

505
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:29,619
to Genesis chapter number 21, we find this evening that we have to cast out the flesh.

506
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:32,019
How did Paul say it to the believers in Colossae?

507
00:39:32,019 --> 00:39:36,940
Mortify therefore your members upon the earth, right?

508
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,019
Colossians 3 and verse number 5.

509
00:39:39,019 --> 00:39:42,059
We started that two, three weeks ago now.

510
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:46,019
And so as we look at this passage of scripture in Genesis chapter 21, the Bible's awesome

511
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:47,019
by the way, isn't it?

512
00:39:47,019 --> 00:39:48,419
I mean, it's amazing.

513
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:51,139
Listen, no scriptures have any private interpretation.

514
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,380
The best commentary on the Bible is the Bible.

515
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,539
It really is.

516
00:39:55,539 --> 00:40:00,219
And I'm so thankful that as you look here in Galatians chapter number 4 and you begin

517
00:40:00,219 --> 00:40:02,579
to read and understand, and now we get

518
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:07,939
some insight as to what's going on. He says, "'Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the

519
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:14,179
son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.' So then, brethren,

520
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:19,379
we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.'" Why? Because we've been born again.

521
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:24,659
Because we've been born again. And so therefore, we've got to deal with the flesh.

522
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:31,779
And so I'm thankful this evening that we have not only the historical account of Genesis 21,

523
00:40:32,419 --> 00:40:39,059
but the spiritual application of Galatians 4. And it helps us to understand how serious this

524
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:44,179
thing is. Listen, we can try to play the game and try to think that we can have them coexist,

525
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:52,419
but it just isn't going to work. It's just not going to work. And at some point in our lives,

526
00:40:52,419 --> 00:40:58,499
we're going to get so frustrated trying to do the things that we ought to do and behave the

527
00:40:58,499 --> 00:41:03,779
way that we ought to behave, but still feeding the flesh and still giving to the desires of the

528
00:41:03,779 --> 00:41:08,419
flesh. And it's going to come to the point in our lives where we just are just fed up and we're

529
00:41:08,419 --> 00:41:16,419
frustrated. We need to just wave that white flag of surrender and say, I got to mortify my members

530
00:41:16,419 --> 00:41:24,339
which are upon the earth. I have to crucify my flesh. Because the flesh is contrary to the Spirit.

531
00:41:24,339 --> 00:41:33,059
These two cannot coexist. I say they cannot coexist in the fact that we're not going to be

532
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:40,659
able to please God as we're walking in the flesh. Listen, the carnal man, he is not the spiritual

533
00:41:40,659 --> 00:41:44,579
man, right? Why does Paul say to the believers in Corinth, I could not speak to you as unto

534
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:52,659
spiritual, as unto mature, but as babes, as immature, as carnal. And so this evening,

535
00:41:52,659 --> 00:41:58,259
as we look at this great truth and this historical account in Genesis 21,

536
00:41:58,259 --> 00:42:04,739
oh, we make wonderful application with regard to what God gives us in Galatians 4, and we make

537
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:12,499
that decision that we too must cast out the bond woman and her son. We must cast out that old

538
00:42:12,499 --> 00:42:19,779
covenant. I'm so thankful I'm not under the law. So thankful. And we must cast out that old nature,

539
00:42:19,779 --> 00:42:27,859
the flesh. But lest we misunderstand, and I do not have time to develop all of it,

540
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:34,579
but there are some today that misapply the truth of casting out we're not under the law anymore,

541
00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:36,659
and they think, oh, well, then I can live however I want to live.

542
00:42:37,779 --> 00:42:42,099
Well, so just in case you had that thought, just continue reading in Galatians 5,

543
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:46,019
because verse number one says, stand fast, therefore, in the liberty wherewith Christ

544
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:52,099
hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. If you skip over to

545
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:58,019
verse number 13, he says, for brethren, ye have been called unto liberty, notice this,

546
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:08,179
only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.

547
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:15,219
Too often today, we live in a time in which there are people that have peddled this idea

548
00:43:15,779 --> 00:43:19,299
that we can live however we want to live because we're no longer under the law.

549
00:43:20,659 --> 00:43:24,259
That's not true. Now, you may be able to live however you want to live,

550
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:31,219
but there are consequences for it. Amen? There are consequences for it. He says,

551
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:38,579
only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh. You know, truly, our freedom in Christ

552
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:44,419
and our liberty that we have in Christ is a freedom and a liberty that allows us to serve Him.

553
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:52,179
That's what it is. It gives us that opportunity to serve Him and to walk with Him and to do all

554
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:55,939
that He's called us to do. It's not a freedom or a liberty that says, hey, man, I can do what I

555
00:43:55,939 --> 00:44:02,579
want to do because I'm going to heaven when I die. If that's the approach, then we've grossly

556
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:07,859
misunderstood and misinterpreted what God tells us in His Word because He says that we're to

557
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:15,299
mortify our members upon the earth, we're to crucify the old man, we're to walk in the Spirit

558
00:44:15,299 --> 00:44:23,139
so that we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh. Your flesh has desire. All of our flesh has desire,

559
00:44:23,139 --> 00:44:29,619
has an appetite. The Bible tells us the flesh is contrary to the Spirit. And so, this evening,

560
00:44:29,619 --> 00:44:36,979
we have to cast out. We have to understand that we're under that new covenant and that the flesh

561
00:44:36,979 --> 00:44:41,859
and the Spirit are not going to be able to coexist. And so, therefore, we must crucify the

562
00:44:41,859 --> 00:44:49,299
old man. What great truth that God gives us in Galatians 4 that helps us understand clearly

563
00:44:50,179 --> 00:44:54,979
what happens back in Genesis 21. Next week, we'll continue with Genesis 21. Actually,

564
00:44:54,979 --> 00:44:58,659
next week, we've got a missionary. And so, he'll be preaching in the evening. And so,

565
00:44:58,659 --> 00:45:02,979
we'll be off from Genesis next week, but we look forward to finishing up Genesis 21.

566
00:45:02,979 --> 00:45:07,299
Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we love You, and we thank You for loving us. Thank You

567
00:45:07,299 --> 00:45:14,979
for the content that You've given us in Your Word with regard to this account and this time in the

568
00:45:14,979 --> 00:45:21,859
life of Abraham and Sarah. And we see the conflict there between Sarah and Hagar and between Ishmael

569
00:45:21,859 --> 00:45:27,379
and Isaac. And God, we thank You for the spiritual insight, the application that is provided to us in

570
00:45:27,379 --> 00:45:33,939
Galatians 4. And I'm so thankful to be born again. I'm so thankful to be saved. And God,

571
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:38,099
I pray that You'd help me to understand this allegory and help each of us to understand this

572
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:44,579
evening this, not only the two covenants, but the two natures and the flesh and the Spirit.

573
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:50,499
And God, I pray that even as we've heard many times in recent weeks, that You would help us to

574
00:45:50,499 --> 00:45:54,739
walk in the Spirit so that we would not fulfill the lust of the flesh. Would You help us to

575
00:45:54,739 --> 00:45:59,859
mortify our members which are upon the earth? Would You help us to live that crucified life?

576
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:05,299
Would You work in hearts and lives as only You can? We'll give You the glory for every

577
00:46:05,299 --> 00:46:08,339
decision that's made. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would You stand with us?
