WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960
Chapter number 21, and we'll be looking at verses 8 through 21 this evening as we look

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.860
at this portion of Scripture.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.920
And I'll just read a couple of verses and we'll get right into the message.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.559
Of course, if you were here last Sunday evening, we looked at the first seven verses of this

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:22.680
chapter and we dealt with the fact that Isaac's birth is recorded here, and we noted as we

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.840
studied that portion of Scripture, the faithfulness of God and the obedience of Abraham.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.560
I mentioned this, that I believe that this probably was one of the highest points in

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.840
Abraham's life, the birth of Isaac.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.939
After 25 years of being promised and looking forward to that seed, that promise that would

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:48.439
come to see it fulfilled and to hold little Isaac, can you imagine just the joy?

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:52.500
Obviously, those of us that have had the privilege of having children, you think about the joy

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.419
of holding that newborn baby and what precious joy that is.

00:00:57.419 --> 00:01:02.740
And to think about Abraham at this point in his life, 25 years again, from the time the

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:09.660
initial promise, of course, repeated often, but God always does what He says He will do.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.620
And we're thankful for the faithfulness of God, thankful for the obedience of Abraham.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.139
As we continue into the passage of Scripture, we find that the Bible tells us that Isaac

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:20.839
was weaned and Abraham made a great feast.

00:01:20.839 --> 00:01:26.440
Notice in verse number 8, the Bible says, and a child grew, speaking of Isaac, and was

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:33.639
weaned, and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:38.440
I want to preach a message that I've titled this evening from verse number 8, Abraham

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.160
made a great feast.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.080
Abraham made a great feast.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.720
Traditionally, it is believed and held that children in this particular culture would

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.720
be weaned between the ages of 2 and 3.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.680
And 2 to 3 years old would be the age in which a child would be weaned.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.919
Most scholars would lean towards 3 as being the age specifically.

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:05.220
And I say that by way of introduction so that we can build a little timeline here to understand

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.080
as we begin to look at the remainder of this passage.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.479
And so if we go with the age of 3, then that would mean that Abraham at this time, when

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:18.720
he made this great feast, that he was 103 years old.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.479
And so remember, Abraham was 100 when Isaac was born.

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.679
And so that's pretty easy math, 100 plus 3.

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:27.399
And so Abraham's 103 years old.

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:32.679
But we also would find that the Bible tells us back in Genesis chapter number 16 and verse

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:38.399
number 16 that Abraham was 86 when Ishmael was born.

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:43.800
And so he was 86 years old when Ishmael was born, and that would lead us to understanding

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.440
as we study this passage of Scripture that Ishmael is now 17 years old.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.119
And so he's either 16 or 17 if you want to go with the 2 or the 3, however you want to

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:55.119
look at that.

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:59.880
But he's either 16 or 17 years old because Abraham was 86 when Ishmael was born according

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.440
to Genesis 16 and verse number 16.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.320
And so as we understand kind of the timeline of what's going on, again the ages of these

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.479
folks, it helps us to kind of understand the full context of what's going to happen and

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:13.500
put it in proper perspective.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.979
If you're taking notes, number one this evening, I just want you to note the historical account.

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:22.460
I'm really just going to read through it and make some comments, really verses 9 through

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.020
21, and look at the historical account that God gives us.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.039
And then we'll go over to the New Testament and begin to look at an application.

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:34.460
But notice with me as we look and begin in verse number 8, the first highlight, if you

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.119
will, if you want to kind of put some things down.

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:41.139
Number one, we see that Isaac is weaned, and that's given to us in verse number 8.

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:46.360
And that's really the beginning of this historical context account that God is giving us.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.500
And at that time of his weaning, we find that Abraham makes this great feast.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.059
Now this was customary in this particular culture to behave in this manner and to celebrate

00:03:57.059 --> 00:04:01.300
the growth and development of a child and to kind of make that next step and so on and

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.660
so forth.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.740
And what a blessing that they would follow in that and understand those things.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.380
In verse number 9, as we continue to read, we find that the Bible says,

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:17.859
And Sarah saw the son of Hagar, the Egyptian, which she had borne unto Abraham, mocking.

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.779
Now as we look at verse number 9, we note two additional aspects of this content in

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:24.660
this account that God is giving us.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.980
Number one, we find that Ishmael is mocking.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.700
The word mock here, it means to tease or laugh at in a scornful manner.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.500
And we find that he is mocking, and Sarah observes this behavior.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.420
It says in verse number 9 that Sarah saw the son of Hagar, the Egyptian.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.359
We know that to be Ishmael contextually as you look through the book of Genesis and the

00:04:46.359 --> 00:04:47.540
preceding chapters.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.660
And so you find here that on this momentous occasion, you see what's happening, and Isaac

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.100
is weaned, and Abraham's making this great feast.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:04.739
And there's this 17-year-old that has been to this point the only offspring of Abraham.

00:05:04.739 --> 00:05:05.739
He'd been the only son.

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:11.420
Remember, Abraham cried out to God, O that Ishmael might live before thee.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.739
Abraham no doubt loved Ishmael, and no doubt they had a relationship.

00:05:15.739 --> 00:05:20.859
And now Ishmael's 17 years old, and the Bible says that at this momentous occasion that

00:05:20.859 --> 00:05:25.700
he's mocking, and Sarah observes this.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.500
Sarah's not very happy at what she sees happening.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.500
She's not delighted with the circumstances.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.880
We find that it begins conflict here.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.339
It's very similar to what we find in the account back in Genesis chapter number 16, when she

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:46.179
had the idea that Abraham go and be married to Hagar, and then when Hagar was expecting,

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:47.179
there was strife.

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:50.899
There was contention between Hagar and Sarah.

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:55.779
And so we find here that as Sarah observes what's going on, she then responds, and notice

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:58.140
the response in verses 10 and 11.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:05.160
The Bible says, Wherefore, she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.859
For the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.

00:06:11.859 --> 00:06:16.059
And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:19.660
Again, you can understand the context of verse number 11.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.660
That's where I mentioned the age.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.660
He's 17 years old.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:27.579
I mean, you think about the bond and the time that has been taken, and you find that Sarah

00:06:27.579 --> 00:06:35.739
is not happy, and she responds, and her response is to cast out this bondwoman and her son.

00:06:35.739 --> 00:06:41.220
She says that he, Ishmael, will not be heir with my son, with Isaac.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.339
Now we understand contextually as we're reading this account, we understand a lot of what

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:52.660
God has already said with regard to the promises that God has made, that it was in the promised

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.459
seed of that God was going to bless Isaac.

00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:58.339
His blessing would be in Isaac.

00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:02.500
And we understand those things as we study the Scriptures, but as we know what's taking

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:07.660
place here, we can see the conflict within the family and the emotions that are going

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.579
on, and it's grievous in the sight of Abraham and all that's taking place.

00:07:12.579 --> 00:07:19.660
But we find that as Abraham's trying to take in everything that Sarah has said, now God

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.579
speaks.

00:07:21.579 --> 00:07:27.899
And the Bible says in verse number 12, and God said unto Abraham, I'm thankful that God

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:29.540
spoke to Abraham.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:34.140
And as we look at the passage of Scripture, I'll say right at the beginning of really

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:39.940
this point of the message this evening, that I understand that we can get ourselves emotionally

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:45.140
involved within the content of what's going on here, and we can have all sorts of emotions

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.299
on whether we think it was right or wrong or why and all of that sort of thing.

00:07:49.299 --> 00:07:53.059
But as we draw the conclusion this evening and go over to the book of Galatians and see

00:07:53.059 --> 00:07:59.299
the application that God gives us, we see how God is providing for us this beautiful

00:07:59.299 --> 00:08:06.220
picture of really the spiritual conflict that we can deal with, that we do deal with.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:11.019
And so we see that God speaks, and He says unto Abraham, notice what He says, let it

00:08:11.019 --> 00:08:17.899
not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman, and all

00:08:17.899 --> 00:08:23.380
that Sarah hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.299
For in Isaac shall thy seed be called.

00:08:27.299 --> 00:08:30.500
You understand that God's plan does not change.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.219
This has been the plan that God has given from the beginning.

00:08:34.219 --> 00:08:38.500
We find that as Abraham would cry out in chapter number 17, as I mentioned a moment

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.619
ago, O that Ishmael might live before thee, that God says, I've heard what you've said,

00:08:43.619 --> 00:08:49.219
I've heard thee, and I will bless him, and I will make of him a great nation, but my

00:08:49.219 --> 00:08:52.539
covenant will I establish with Isaac.

00:08:52.539 --> 00:08:57.619
And so here in chapter number 21, God reaffirms His plan that He's already given.

00:08:57.619 --> 00:09:01.479
He says, for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.

00:09:01.479 --> 00:09:06.799
And we find that He, God, gives instruction that Abraham, the first aspect of the instruction

00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:12.440
is that He is to hearken unto the voice of Sarah, that He is to do what Sarah has said.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:18.239
Notice it says here in the verse, it says, and all that Sarah hath said unto thee hearken

00:09:18.239 --> 00:09:19.239
unto her voice.

00:09:19.239 --> 00:09:21.400
Well, what was it that Sarah said?

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.719
Cast out this bondwoman and her son.

00:09:24.719 --> 00:09:26.320
That's what Sarah said.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.039
And God says, hearken unto her voice.

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:34.760
And He says this, for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:39.799
Notice that God not only says hearken unto the voice of Sarah, He says that in Isaac

00:09:39.799 --> 00:09:40.799
shall thy seed be called.

00:09:40.799 --> 00:09:45.159
But I want you to notice what He says in verse number 13 with regard to Ishmael.

00:09:45.159 --> 00:09:53.840
He says, and also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation because he is thy seed.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:59.200
And so again, it's consistent with what God has already communicated to Abraham back in

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.359
chapter 17.

00:10:00.359 --> 00:10:04.579
God had made this declaration, this promise. In fact, if you go all the way

00:10:04.579 --> 00:10:09.099
back to chapter number 16 and you read what's taking place there after the

00:10:09.099 --> 00:10:15.019
birth of Ishmael, you find that God had given promise there with regard to

00:10:15.019 --> 00:10:20.459
Ishmael as well. And so as we look here at the context, we find again this

00:10:20.459 --> 00:10:29.579
historical account that God speaks. Now when God speaks, we have to respond. We

00:10:29.579 --> 00:10:34.939
have to respond. And we're gonna respond in one of two ways. Obedience or

00:10:34.939 --> 00:10:40.939
disobedience. There's no middle ground. There's no halfway point. There's no

00:10:40.939 --> 00:10:45.459
partial. We've said often, and perhaps you've said it to your children, partial

00:10:45.459 --> 00:10:53.579
obedience is disobedience, right? To obey is better than sacrifice. That's what

00:10:53.579 --> 00:10:58.939
Samuel tells Saul. And we find that here as Abraham would receive this

00:10:58.939 --> 00:11:04.899
instruction from God, he now is left at a moment of decision. What is it that

00:11:04.899 --> 00:11:10.579
he's going to do? Is he gonna obey or is he gonna disobey? Now, the reality is that

00:11:10.579 --> 00:11:14.499
there are times in our lives in which God may ask us to do something that's

00:11:14.499 --> 00:11:21.219
not easy to do. Which path are we gonna choose? See, this was a

00:11:21.219 --> 00:11:26.939
relationship, his son, that had been built 17 years and God saying, no, hearken to

00:11:26.939 --> 00:11:31.099
the voice of Sarah and this is how you're supposed to go forward. And we

00:11:31.099 --> 00:11:36.619
find that Abraham is now left in this place of decision. We noted last week the

00:11:36.619 --> 00:11:40.339
obedience of Abraham and we've noted that it really, if you study throughout

00:11:40.339 --> 00:11:44.219
the scriptures, that you'll find often that the Bible speaks about the

00:11:44.219 --> 00:11:49.899
obedience of Abraham. The reality is that Hebrews 11, when it speaks about Abraham,

00:11:49.899 --> 00:11:55.379
it says that he obeyed after God called. He obeyed and he went out not knowing

00:11:55.419 --> 00:12:01.579
whither he went. And so we find here that Abraham is going to then act, we notice

00:12:01.579 --> 00:12:06.099
in verse number 14, the Bible says, and Abraham rose up early in the morning. He

00:12:06.099 --> 00:12:12.779
didn't waste any time. There's no delay. See, sometimes we delay, right? Delayed

00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:17.699
obedience. Well, I'll get to it when I get to it. And you know one of the problems

00:12:17.699 --> 00:12:23.779
with delayed obedience is that sometimes we never actually get to it, right? We

00:12:23.779 --> 00:12:26.899
just don't ever get to doing what we're supposed to do because something else

00:12:26.899 --> 00:12:31.819
creeps in and something else does. And when God shows us, when God reveals to us

00:12:31.819 --> 00:12:37.099
truth, as hard as it may be, as difficult and as challenging as it might be, we

00:12:37.099 --> 00:12:41.939
need to obey. We need to obey immediately. And we find that the Bible says that he

00:12:41.939 --> 00:12:45.739
rose up early in the morning, notice it says, and took bread and a bottle of

00:12:45.739 --> 00:12:50.899
water and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder and the child and sent

00:12:50.939 --> 00:12:56.259
her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. Again, I

00:12:56.259 --> 00:13:00.499
understand the emotions that we could have as we read an account such as this

00:13:00.499 --> 00:13:04.219
and we could question all that we want to question, but the reality is that

00:13:04.219 --> 00:13:09.099
God's ways are not our ways. His thoughts are not our thoughts. And we find that

00:13:09.099 --> 00:13:13.099
this is indeed the actual instruction that God has provided to Abraham and

00:13:13.099 --> 00:13:18.419
would be later used as a great truth, a great spiritual truth for us to

00:13:18.419 --> 00:13:22.939
understand. We find that as Abraham acted in verse number 14, that then we

00:13:22.939 --> 00:13:26.699
continue throughout the context here looking at this historical account that

00:13:26.699 --> 00:13:31.379
is provided, and we find that the water was spent and Hagar wept. It says in

00:13:31.379 --> 00:13:35.499
verse number 16, excuse me, verse number 15, and the water was spent in the bottle

00:13:35.499 --> 00:13:39.339
and she cast the child under one of the shrubs and she went and sat her down

00:13:39.339 --> 00:13:44.699
over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot, for she said, let me not

00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:49.139
see the death of the child. And she sat over against him and lift up her voice

00:13:49.139 --> 00:13:55.539
and wept. Again, what a difficult situation. She didn't want to see the

00:13:55.539 --> 00:14:00.219
death of Ishmael and no doubt if you can put yourself in this position you

00:14:00.219 --> 00:14:04.619
wouldn't want to see the death of your child either. And we find here that as

00:14:04.619 --> 00:14:09.299
that water was spent and as she wept, we find that an angel of God

00:14:09.299 --> 00:14:15.659
spake unto her. In verse number 17, the Bible says in, it says, and God heard the

00:14:15.659 --> 00:14:20.539
voice of the lad. And the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven and said

00:14:20.539 --> 00:14:26.500
unto her, what aileth thee, Hagar? Fear not, for God hath heard the voice of the

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:31.979
lad where he is. Notice in verse number 18 that God is going to provide once

00:14:31.979 --> 00:14:36.979
again a promise that has been oft repeated with regard to Ishmael. It says,

00:14:36.979 --> 00:14:43.099
Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand, for I will make him a great

00:14:43.099 --> 00:14:50.339
nation. As a side note, let me say this, God did. He fulfilled the promise that he

00:14:50.339 --> 00:14:56.099
made with regard to Ishmael. And we find that he not only has made of him a great

00:14:56.099 --> 00:15:01.619
nation, we do understand, and of course there's a bunch of confusion with

00:15:01.619 --> 00:15:05.819
regard to the seed and so on and so forth, with regard to if you speak to

00:15:05.819 --> 00:15:09.579
some within the Muslim faith and they believe that it's through Ishmael, not

00:15:09.579 --> 00:15:14.939
through Isaac, but we understand without any controversy that God has explicitly

00:15:14.939 --> 00:15:22.299
said in his word that the blessing would go through Isaac. But he said he would

00:15:22.299 --> 00:15:27.539
bless Ishmael, and he has. Now we understand that there's much history

00:15:27.539 --> 00:15:30.899
that could be looked at and so on and so forth, and we'll save that for another

00:15:30.899 --> 00:15:35.699
discussion, but we find here that as we continue with this historical content in

00:15:35.699 --> 00:15:39.459
the account that's given to us here, that not only is there a promise given

00:15:39.459 --> 00:15:43.259
in verse number 18, but we find that provision is given in verse number 19.

00:15:43.259 --> 00:15:49.059
The Bible says, And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went

00:15:49.059 --> 00:15:55.379
and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. In verses 20 and 21,

00:15:55.379 --> 00:16:00.299
the Bible tells us of the development and marriage of Ishmael. The Bible says

00:16:00.299 --> 00:16:05.419
that God was with the lad, again Ishmael, and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness

00:16:05.419 --> 00:16:10.219
and became an archer, and he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother

00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:15.619
took him a wife out of the land of Egypt. Now we understand that Hagar, remember,

00:16:15.619 --> 00:16:19.619
she was an Egyptian, right? If you go all the way back and you find in Genesis

00:16:19.619 --> 00:16:23.899
chapter number 12, during that time in which they had that great famine, that

00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:28.259
difficulty that was faced, and the first time in which Abraham said that Sarah

00:16:28.259 --> 00:16:32.819
was his sister to Pharaoh, and so on and so forth, when they come back, they come

00:16:33.019 --> 00:16:38.179
back with Hagar, according to what we find in the portion of Scripture. And so

00:16:38.179 --> 00:16:43.539
as we look at the the historical account that is given, we find that now Ishmael

00:16:43.539 --> 00:16:48.739
is married, and he's married to an Egyptian. Now we understand that as we

00:16:48.739 --> 00:16:53.219
look at the historical content, the account that is provided to us, much

00:16:53.219 --> 00:16:57.979
discussion could be made. But instead of us making discussion with regard to the

00:16:57.979 --> 00:17:03.259
content that is here, I'd rather let God's Word give us insight as to that

00:17:03.259 --> 00:17:08.459
which is provided to us here in Genesis 21. And so we find that, yes, we know the

00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:11.500
historical account, but number two, I want you to note the spiritual

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.859
application. In order to note the spiritual application, we must go to the

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:19.739
book of Galatians in chapter number four. In Galatians chapter number four, the

00:17:19.739 --> 00:17:25.099
book of Galatians is just a power-filled book with so much wonderful truth with

00:17:25.139 --> 00:17:29.500
regard to the the early church and all that was happening with the Judaizers

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.819
and all that was taking place. Of course, the book of Galatians is written to the

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:38.939
churches that are in the region of Galatia. These churches were planted,

00:17:38.939 --> 00:17:42.779
established, if you will, during the first missionary journey of the Apostle Paul,

00:17:42.779 --> 00:17:47.379
and we find that that could be recorded, or it is recorded, and can be reviewed in

00:17:47.379 --> 00:17:53.179
Acts 13 and 14. And in these cities, Antioch and Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, and

00:17:53.179 --> 00:17:57.699
Derbe, these churches were established, and these Judaizers come in, and there's

00:17:57.699 --> 00:18:03.539
all kinds of crazy teaching that's going on. And we understand that, really, as you

00:18:03.539 --> 00:18:07.779
begin looking in the beginning of chapter number two, that it really points

00:18:07.779 --> 00:18:12.339
us back to Acts chapter number 15, when they had that council at Jerusalem, and

00:18:12.339 --> 00:18:16.099
there were some that were saying this, except you be circumcised after the

00:18:16.099 --> 00:18:21.379
manner of Moses, you cannot be saved. And we know that's not true, and that was

00:18:21.379 --> 00:18:25.019
something that these Judaizers were bringing into these churches in the

00:18:25.019 --> 00:18:30.099
region of Galatia, and so Paul is seeking to provide them with instruction, and God

00:18:30.099 --> 00:18:34.979
is faithful to give the truth of His Word to these believers in these

00:18:34.979 --> 00:18:41.299
churches. And we find that in verses 21 through 31 of Galatians 4, that the

00:18:41.299 --> 00:18:46.459
spiritual application is provided for us with regard to that account that we read

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:50.779
in Genesis 21. Notice what it says here in verse number 21,

00:18:50.779 --> 00:18:58.899
tell me ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? And then

00:18:58.899 --> 00:19:03.260
notice this, he says, for it is written. Now he'll say for it is written again in

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:08.659
verse 27, and then he'll say in verse number 30, what saith the scripture? See,

00:19:08.659 --> 00:19:13.059
Paul was well-versed within the Old Testament, he understood the teaching of

00:19:13.059 --> 00:19:16.140
the Old Testament, he was well-versed in it, and we understand the Old Testament has

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:22.299
been given for our learning, for our admonition, and there are some today that

00:19:22.299 --> 00:19:25.700
take the approach that we really don't need the Old Testament because we're

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:30.820
New Testament believers, and that's a bad approach because God Himself tells us

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:36.500
that the Old Testament has been given for our admonition, for our learning, and

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:40.899
no doubt there's great truth for us to understand. And so we find that Paul

00:19:40.899 --> 00:19:45.539
makes an appeal to the scriptures, and he says this in verse 22, for it is

00:19:45.579 --> 00:19:53.820
written that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a free

00:19:53.820 --> 00:20:00.179
woman. So we find immediately that Paul is going back to this passage of

00:20:00.179 --> 00:20:00.679
scripture.

00:20:00.679 --> 00:20:05.519
in Genesis chapter 21 where we see the birth of Isaac. Of course Ishmael was

00:20:05.519 --> 00:20:13.839
born 16 years, 14 years earlier than the birth of Isaac and we find here that

00:20:13.839 --> 00:20:19.279
that he's referring to these two sons Ishmael and Isaac. Ishmael from the

00:20:19.279 --> 00:20:24.679
bondmaid and Isaac from the free woman. Notice in verse 23, but he who was of the

00:20:24.679 --> 00:20:31.799
bondwoman was born, notice what it says, after the flesh but he of the free woman

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:38.799
was by promise or shall I say by faith. It says in verse number 24, notice this,

00:20:38.799 --> 00:20:45.919
which things are an allegory, which things are an allegory for these are the

00:20:45.919 --> 00:20:51.159
two covenants, the one from the Mount Sinai which gendereth to bondage which

00:20:51.159 --> 00:20:56.199
is Hagar, for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to Jerusalem

00:20:56.199 --> 00:21:01.279
which now is and is in bondage with her children. But Jerusalem which is above

00:21:01.279 --> 00:21:07.119
is free which is the mother of us all. For it is written, rejoice thou barren

00:21:07.119 --> 00:21:11.299
that bearest not, break forth and cry thou that travailest not, for the

00:21:11.299 --> 00:21:15.479
desolate hath many more children than she which hath not a husband. Notice

00:21:15.479 --> 00:21:23.519
verse 28, now he says now we brethren as Isaac was are the children of promise.

00:21:23.519 --> 00:21:27.359
Now you see how he's gonna make the application this allegory, he says these

00:21:27.359 --> 00:21:32.359
things are an allegory, this passage of Scripture in Genesis 21, as you hold on

00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:35.519
here in just a couple of more verses we're gonna see how we know exactly that

00:21:35.519 --> 00:21:39.959
he's speaking about Genesis 21. He's mentioned the two sons, he's mentioned of

00:21:39.959 --> 00:21:46.479
course Hagar and Sarah, and now we find that he says that we brethren as Isaac

00:21:46.479 --> 00:21:54.159
was in verse 28 are the children of promise. He says this in verse 29, but as

00:21:54.159 --> 00:22:00.439
then he that was born after the flesh, who's that? That's Ishmael, right? That's

00:22:00.439 --> 00:22:05.119
who he's referring to. He says he that was born after the flesh persecuted him

00:22:05.119 --> 00:22:12.679
that was born after the Spirit. Then notice these words, even so it is now. And

00:22:12.679 --> 00:22:18.839
so he's making, he's unfolding for us this wonderful spiritual application

00:22:18.839 --> 00:22:22.919
with regard to the historical account that is given to us in Genesis chapter

00:22:22.919 --> 00:22:28.399
21. He goes on further and he says nevertheless, notice in verse 30, what

00:22:28.399 --> 00:22:32.799
saith the Scripture? Again he's appealing back to the Word of God. Notice what he

00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:37.639
says, cast out the bondwoman and her son. No doubt now that we're speaking

00:22:37.639 --> 00:22:43.000
specifically about Genesis 21 in the historical account that we just read. He

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.519
says for the son of the bondwoman, notice, shall not be heir with the son of the

00:22:49.519 --> 00:22:57.639
free woman. So then, here's the conclusion, so then brethren we are not children of

00:22:57.639 --> 00:23:06.039
the bondwoman but of the free. See, the law cannot save. All the law can do is

00:23:06.039 --> 00:23:12.679
condemn. That's all the law can do. In fact, if you look back in Galatians 3, he

00:23:12.679 --> 00:23:16.759
says, is the law then, in verse number 21, is the law then against the promises of

00:23:16.759 --> 00:23:22.119
God? God forbid. For if there had been a law given which could have given life,

00:23:22.239 --> 00:23:27.959
verily righteousness should have been by the law. But what saith the Scripture? He

00:23:27.959 --> 00:23:32.519
says, but the Scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise by faith

00:23:32.519 --> 00:23:37.559
of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. In chapter number 2, in

00:23:37.559 --> 00:23:40.959
verse number 21, he says, I do not frustrate the grace of God, for if

00:23:40.959 --> 00:23:47.079
righteousness came by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. And so he began

00:23:47.079 --> 00:23:51.879
this passage of Scripture in Galatians 4, in verse number 21, by saying this,

00:23:51.879 --> 00:23:59.000
tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? And so there

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.479
were some that were trying to put themselves back under the law, these

00:24:01.479 --> 00:24:04.599
Judaizers that were coming in and saying, hey, you got to be under the law, you got

00:24:04.599 --> 00:24:09.479
to be under the law. Now, if you've read the law, you probably don't want to be

00:24:09.479 --> 00:24:16.279
under the law. Amen? I'm glad to be in the dispensation, if you will, of grace. Amen?

00:24:16.279 --> 00:24:22.119
I'm thankful that we're not under the law, that Christ has fulfilled the law.

00:24:22.119 --> 00:24:29.000
I'm thankful for that. And we find that Paul is explaining this allegory that is

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.759
given to us. This historical account in Genesis chapter number 21 has this

00:24:33.759 --> 00:24:39.600
wonderful, powerful spiritual application that is unfolded to us in Galatians

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:44.759
chapter number 4. And really, there's two aspects to this allegory. Number one is

00:24:44.759 --> 00:24:50.839
this, there are two covenants. There's an old covenant, and there's a new covenant.

00:24:50.839 --> 00:24:57.000
The old covenant is under Hagar, or after the flesh. You find that it says in

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:04.279
verse number 23, but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh, but

00:25:04.279 --> 00:25:08.639
he of the free woman was by promise. And so we see that this old

00:25:08.639 --> 00:25:13.919
covenant, Hagar, of course he'll get into the law, we understand that no doubt

00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:18.919
contextually, Paul has clear understanding that Abraham and Hagar

00:25:18.919 --> 00:25:24.559
and Sarah, Ishmael and Isaac, they predate the law. We understand that. But the law

00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:29.720
would come many years later, and it would show, it would be the revelation to the

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:36.759
people of God that there's no way you can keep this. It condemns. It

00:25:36.759 --> 00:25:41.639
proves that we're guilty. And so we find here that he's showing us, he says in

00:25:41.639 --> 00:25:46.600
verse number 24, which things are an allegory, for these are the two covenants.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:51.239
The one for Mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Hagar, and so we see

00:25:51.239 --> 00:25:56.919
that being the flesh. And it only leads to bondage. Notice he says in verse 25,

00:25:56.919 --> 00:26:01.880
for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabian, answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:09.239
is in bondage with her children. You know that before salvation, we're in bondage

00:26:09.239 --> 00:26:13.039
to our sin. It's what the Word of God teaches in Romans chapter number 6, we

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:20.559
are bound by sin. And so we find that as we think about this old covenant that is

00:26:20.559 --> 00:26:24.000
mentioned in this allegory that is being explained to us, that there are two

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.160
covenants, that this bondage that is mentioned, we find that it's there for us

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:35.519
in verses 24 and 25, we find that this old covenant, it brings death.

00:26:35.559 --> 00:26:41.519
Ephesians chapter number 2 tells us that we were dead in our trespasses and sins

00:26:41.519 --> 00:26:46.759
in Ephesians 2 and verse number 1. You know in Romans chapter number 8, I am so

00:26:46.759 --> 00:26:53.720
thankful for the truth of just the fact that there is no condemnation. It says

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:58.039
this in Romans 8 and verse number 1, there is therefore now no condemnation

00:26:58.039 --> 00:27:02.459
to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh but after the

00:27:02.459 --> 00:27:08.220
Spirit. But the reality is that for those that are not in Christ Jesus, there

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:15.380
is condemnation, right? Remember, we find that the Bible tells us and oftentimes we

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:20.619
quote, and rightly so, the truth of John 3, and so many people are familiar with

00:27:20.619 --> 00:27:26.500
John 3 in verse number 16, and I'm so thankful that God did love the world. It

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.739
says, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:33.739
believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. It says, for God

00:27:33.739 --> 00:27:37.259
sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world but that the world

00:27:37.259 --> 00:27:42.380
through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned, verse

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:52.259
18, but he that believeth not is condemned already. Why? Because he hath

00:27:52.259 --> 00:27:58.100
not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. Verse 36 of John 3

00:27:58.139 --> 00:28:02.220
says, he that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life, and he that believeth

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:10.699
not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. I have not

00:28:10.699 --> 00:28:15.699
ever personally used the gospel tract, but there was a gospel tract many years

00:28:15.699 --> 00:28:20.299
ago that said something to the effect of, what do I have to do to go to hell? And

00:28:20.299 --> 00:28:26.059
you opened it up and it said nothing. Nothing. Why? Because you're condemned

00:28:26.059 --> 00:28:31.859
already. See, the allegory that is explained of this historical account in

00:28:31.859 --> 00:28:35.539
Genesis 21 provides us with the understanding of this old covenant. He

00:28:35.539 --> 00:28:41.179
says there are two covenants. The one from Mount Sinai, this old covenant, the

00:28:41.179 --> 00:28:47.260
law, the flesh, the bondage, the death, the condemnation. But then we understand

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:51.820
that there's a new covenant. It says in verse 26, back in Galatians 4, but

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:58.739
Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all. He said back in

00:28:58.739 --> 00:29:03.179
verse number 23, but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh, but

00:29:03.179 --> 00:29:08.619
then notice, he of the free woman was by promise. He then says this in verse 28,

00:29:08.619 --> 00:29:13.739
now we brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise. Now remember, we

00:29:13.739 --> 00:29:17.339
looked at this last week as we looked at the first seven verses of Genesis 21,

00:29:17.339 --> 00:29:20.820
this promise that had been made. I mentioned it by way of introduction this

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:26.700
evening. For 25 years before the promise was fulfilled, I mean from the time the

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:31.219
first giving of the promise to Abraham with regard to, I will give you a land

00:29:31.219 --> 00:29:36.779
and I will give you a seed. And we find that God kept his word, but it was 25

00:29:36.779 --> 00:29:43.460
years later, but he no doubt, Isaac, is the result of this promise that God

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:50.500
had made. And so we see in the new covenant, it's grace. It's grace. We find

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:56.580
it in the new covenant, it's freedom. As is mentioned in verse 26, that Jerusalem

00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:02.539
which is above is free. Notice what he says in verse number 31, so then brethren,

00:30:02.539 --> 00:30:08.619
Brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.

00:30:08.619 --> 00:30:11.819
The truth shall make you free.

00:30:11.819 --> 00:30:12.819
Right?

00:30:12.819 --> 00:30:18.859
Remember, Jesus, as He makes that declaration, He's speaking to those Jews and they're saying,

00:30:18.859 --> 00:30:21.899
we've not been in bondage to anybody.

00:30:21.899 --> 00:30:25.979
They were in bondage at the time that they said that.

00:30:25.979 --> 00:30:29.299
I mean, just look around and you can see the Romans all over the place, right?

00:30:29.299 --> 00:30:32.859
I mean, that was what was going on.

00:30:32.859 --> 00:30:37.019
No doubt, you don't have to go far into their history to see about the Babylonian captivity

00:30:37.019 --> 00:30:39.979
and the Assyrian captivity and so on and so forth.

00:30:39.979 --> 00:30:44.379
And certainly they had been in captivity, they'd been in bondage, and Jesus is making

00:30:44.379 --> 00:30:52.339
this truth, of course, with regard to the freedom from sin, the power of sin, the bondage

00:30:52.339 --> 00:30:53.339
of sin.

00:30:53.339 --> 00:30:58.219
And so we find that this new covenant, as we look at this allegory and it provides this

00:30:58.219 --> 00:31:03.299
truth of these two covenants and it being of grace and providing freedom, we understand

00:31:03.299 --> 00:31:05.019
the life.

00:31:05.019 --> 00:31:10.299
The Bible says that the wage of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through

00:31:10.299 --> 00:31:12.579
Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:31:12.579 --> 00:31:14.939
I'm thankful for the life.

00:31:14.939 --> 00:31:18.419
Remember what Jesus said in John chapter number 10, I've come to give them life, and He says

00:31:18.419 --> 00:31:22.699
this, that they would have it more abundantly.

00:31:22.699 --> 00:31:26.459
The abundant life through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:31:26.459 --> 00:31:30.379
The grace that He provides, we mentioned this morning about being forgiven, and we

00:31:30.379 --> 00:31:35.299
find that this new covenant allows us to understand our acceptance.

00:31:35.299 --> 00:31:40.059
It's a wonderful thing to be accepted by God, to know that we're accepted in the Beloved,

00:31:40.059 --> 00:31:44.979
to know that we are the people of God, the children of God, that we are joint heirs with

00:31:44.979 --> 00:31:46.539
Jesus Christ.

00:31:46.539 --> 00:31:48.179
It's grace.

00:31:48.179 --> 00:31:49.899
It's grace.

00:31:49.899 --> 00:31:55.179
And so as we look at the truth that's given here, we find no doubt that there can be no

00:31:55.179 --> 00:31:57.139
mixture of law and grace.

00:31:57.139 --> 00:31:59.459
It will not work.

00:31:59.459 --> 00:32:03.899
Law and grace cannot, they can't mix, it doesn't work.

00:32:03.899 --> 00:32:09.299
He says in verse number 30, nevertheless, what saith the Scripture?

00:32:09.299 --> 00:32:13.739
Cast out the bondwoman and her son, the flesh.

00:32:13.739 --> 00:32:14.739
Cast that out.

00:32:14.739 --> 00:32:15.739
Why?

00:32:15.739 --> 00:32:22.419
For the law and the flesh, he says this, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir

00:32:22.419 --> 00:32:24.779
with the son of the free woman.

00:32:24.779 --> 00:32:28.219
And so we see that the mixture of law and grace, that first covenant and that second

00:32:28.219 --> 00:32:35.099
covenant, the old is done away, Christ fulfilled the law, and we're so thankful for that.

00:32:35.099 --> 00:32:39.899
Remember as you look in Hebrews chapter number 10, those priests, they came daily ministering

00:32:39.899 --> 00:32:42.139
and offering the same sacrifices.

00:32:42.139 --> 00:32:46.019
The Bible says that could never take away sin.

00:32:46.019 --> 00:32:50.139
You make the offering today, you've got to come back and make the offering again tomorrow.

00:32:50.139 --> 00:32:56.019
Basically it was a constant reminder of their sin.

00:32:56.019 --> 00:33:02.299
But this man, after he made one sacrifice for sin forever, who is this man?

00:33:02.299 --> 00:33:03.539
It's the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:33:03.539 --> 00:33:05.459
He fulfilled it.

00:33:05.459 --> 00:33:10.939
That's the second, or the new covenant, the grace that is given.

00:33:10.939 --> 00:33:15.579
And we find this allegory explained, the allegory having the first aspect of the two covenants,

00:33:15.579 --> 00:33:19.699
but I also want you to consider this evening from this passage of Scripture, not only the

00:33:19.699 --> 00:33:22.579
two covenants, but the two natures.

00:33:22.579 --> 00:33:26.059
We see the contrast between Hagar and Sarah.

00:33:26.059 --> 00:33:30.779
We see the explanation between the bondwoman and the free woman.

00:33:30.779 --> 00:33:35.179
We see the law and the grace, the flesh and the promise.

00:33:35.179 --> 00:33:36.579
We see that.

00:33:36.579 --> 00:33:40.959
But then we see the two natures.

00:33:40.959 --> 00:33:46.419
Not necessarily explained by Hagar and Sarah, but seen through Ishmael and Isaac.

00:33:47.419 --> 00:33:52.059
We think about those two natures as we think about what's happening here in the truth that

00:33:52.059 --> 00:33:59.179
God has given, we find that Ishmael would best represent the flesh, right?

00:33:59.179 --> 00:34:06.459
After Abraham and Sarah, at the time, Abram and Sarai, after they'd received the promise

00:34:06.459 --> 00:34:10.899
and they wait ten years and there's no children, they begin to rely on their own understanding.

00:34:10.899 --> 00:34:15.699
Sarai says, hey, go in, there's Hagar, marry her, go in and have seed, and so on and so

00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:21.299
forth, and it's the result of their leaning on their own understanding and following in

00:34:21.299 --> 00:34:27.739
that manner the birth of Ishmael, it no doubt represents for us the flesh.

00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:31.339
But we find that Isaac would represent the spirit.

00:34:31.339 --> 00:34:37.579
Now, as we look at this, we find that in verse 28 and verse number 31, it's so interesting

00:34:37.579 --> 00:34:43.159
how that the application is made directly to us as the people of God today.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:48.479
He says in verse number 28, now we, brethren, he's speaking to these believers in Galatia

00:34:48.479 --> 00:34:52.739
that have been saved, now these ones that said, or at least that they were thinking

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:58.359
they'd been influenced by these Judaizers, ye that desire to be under the law.

00:34:58.359 --> 00:35:02.039
He's saying, listen, why would you want to go, that's going backwards.

00:35:02.039 --> 00:35:03.379
Why would you want to do that?

00:35:03.379 --> 00:35:09.879
You've already been delivered, you've already been given the deliverance from that law and

00:35:10.119 --> 00:35:15.559
that bondage that it represents, and you've been given the freedom through grace, and

00:35:15.559 --> 00:35:18.079
this has been preached to you, and so he says, why would you want to do this?

00:35:18.079 --> 00:35:25.079
But then he says in verse 28, now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.

00:35:25.079 --> 00:35:29.359
Now, if you take out the parenthetical, if you will, he just says, now we are the children

00:35:29.359 --> 00:35:30.359
of promise.

00:35:30.359 --> 00:35:32.759
We are the children of promise.

00:35:32.759 --> 00:35:39.159
Notice what he says back in chapter number, look in verse number, chapter number three

00:35:39.159 --> 00:35:41.759
in verse number six.

00:35:41.759 --> 00:35:45.439
It speaks about Abraham believing God, it being accounted to him for righteousness,

00:35:45.439 --> 00:35:50.999
but look over at verse number 13, it says this, Christ hath redeemed us from the curse

00:35:50.999 --> 00:35:56.639
of the law being made a curse for us, for it is written, cursed is everyone that hangeth

00:35:56.639 --> 00:36:02.159
on a tree, that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ,

00:36:02.159 --> 00:36:05.679
that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

00:36:05.679 --> 00:36:10.639
He then says this, and as we're looking in chapter number four, he's speaking about this

00:36:10.639 --> 00:36:17.039
truth that we, just as Isaac was, we are the children of promise.

00:36:17.039 --> 00:36:18.039
This truth of redemption.

00:36:18.039 --> 00:36:21.679
We've been dealing with this in Colossians, it's really interesting how God has brought

00:36:21.679 --> 00:36:25.879
all these things together at this same time with what we've been looking at in Colossians

00:36:25.879 --> 00:36:30.759
3, verses 5, now through verse number 14, with regard to the put off and the put on

00:36:30.759 --> 00:36:36.239
and all that's going on and dealing with that conflict between the flesh and the Spirit,

00:36:36.239 --> 00:36:41.399
and so we find that Paul is making this application directly to these believers, and he's saying,

00:36:41.399 --> 00:36:46.919
listen, we are the children of promise, notice in verse 31, so then, brethren, we are not

00:36:46.919 --> 00:36:50.519
children of the bondwoman, but of the free.

00:36:50.519 --> 00:36:51.519
Why?

00:36:51.519 --> 00:36:53.199
Because we've been born again.

00:36:53.199 --> 00:36:58.199
So we have this new nature, no longer are we under that death and condemnation, but

00:36:58.199 --> 00:37:02.999
now there is no condemnation for them that are in Christ Jesus.

00:37:02.999 --> 00:37:07.959
Now we have the truth of eternal life, we've been accepted in the Beloved, and so we find

00:37:07.959 --> 00:37:14.519
that there's now this flesh and this Spirit, these two natures, and we find that he tells

00:37:14.519 --> 00:37:20.199
us in chapter number 5, in verse number 17, for the flesh lusteth against the Spirit and

00:37:20.199 --> 00:37:25.239
the Spirit against the flesh, and these are contrary to one to the other, so that ye cannot

00:37:25.239 --> 00:37:27.839
do the things that ye would.

00:37:27.839 --> 00:37:32.879
Man, it makes full circle with what we've been dealing with in Colossians, and we find

00:37:32.879 --> 00:37:37.799
that Paul is saying to these believers here in the region of Galatia, listen, this truth

00:37:37.799 --> 00:37:43.719
of Genesis 21, this historical account that you're perhaps familiar with, many of us are

00:37:43.719 --> 00:37:46.599
familiar with Genesis 21.

00:37:46.599 --> 00:37:51.039
Of course, those that were Jewish, they would have been very familiar, no doubt, with the

00:37:51.039 --> 00:37:53.319
account in Genesis 21.

00:37:53.319 --> 00:37:58.199
Those that were Gentiles that had been saved, maybe not the same level of knowledge of that

00:37:58.199 --> 00:38:04.259
passage of Scripture, and thus we find that Paul is making this application, he's explaining,

00:38:04.259 --> 00:38:10.439
he says these things are an allegory, and so therefore, what is it that the Scripture says,

00:38:10.439 --> 00:38:14.479
what is it that we follow, how is it that we behave?

00:38:14.479 --> 00:38:17.879
Cast out the bondwoman and her son.

00:38:17.879 --> 00:38:22.999
Not only are we casting out the old covenant, but we're casting out the flesh.

00:38:22.999 --> 00:38:25.519
Does that make sense tonight?

00:38:25.519 --> 00:38:29.599
And we find that, why, why do they have to be cast out?

00:38:29.599 --> 00:38:32.279
Because they can't coexist.

00:38:32.279 --> 00:38:33.279
They can't coexist.

00:38:33.279 --> 00:38:38.839
Listen, you're either walking in the flesh or you're walking in the Spirit.

00:38:38.839 --> 00:38:41.799
It's just, it's one or the other, I mean, you're either following God and obeying Him

00:38:41.799 --> 00:38:42.799
or you're disobeying Him.

00:38:42.799 --> 00:38:47.559
Remember, I said that when God spoke to Abraham there in Genesis chapter number 21, after

00:38:47.559 --> 00:38:53.359
Sarah had said what she said, after her observance of Ishmael mocking, and God says to Abraham,

00:38:53.359 --> 00:38:55.719
hearken unto her voice.

00:38:55.719 --> 00:38:56.719
What was her voice?

00:38:56.719 --> 00:38:59.119
Cast him out.

00:38:59.119 --> 00:39:01.119
He has a decision to make.

00:39:01.119 --> 00:39:04.639
He has a decision to make.

00:39:04.639 --> 00:39:08.799
Because Ishmael and Isaac could not be in the same house.

00:39:08.799 --> 00:39:10.839
It just wasn't going to work.

00:39:10.839 --> 00:39:14.500
And for us as the people of God, as Paul, through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:21.099
of God, would give us the truth here in Galatians chapter number 4, which gives us great insight

00:39:21.099 --> 00:39:29.619
to Genesis chapter number 21, we find this evening that we have to cast out the flesh.

00:39:29.619 --> 00:39:32.019
How did Paul say it to the believers in Colossae?

00:39:32.019 --> 00:39:36.940
Mortify therefore your members upon the earth, right?

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.019
Colossians 3 and verse number 5.

00:39:39.019 --> 00:39:42.059
We started that two, three weeks ago now.

00:39:42.059 --> 00:39:46.019
And so as we look at this passage of scripture in Genesis chapter 21, the Bible's awesome

00:39:46.019 --> 00:39:47.019
by the way, isn't it?

00:39:47.019 --> 00:39:48.419
I mean, it's amazing.

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:51.139
Listen, no scriptures have any private interpretation.

00:39:51.139 --> 00:39:53.380
The best commentary on the Bible is the Bible.

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.539
It really is.

00:39:55.539 --> 00:40:00.219
And I'm so thankful that as you look here in Galatians chapter number 4 and you begin

00:40:00.219 --> 00:40:02.579
to read and understand, and now we get

00:40:02.579 --> 00:40:07.939
some insight as to what's going on. He says, "'Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the

00:40:07.939 --> 00:40:14.179
son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.' So then, brethren,

00:40:14.179 --> 00:40:19.379
we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.'" Why? Because we've been born again.

00:40:21.059 --> 00:40:24.659
Because we've been born again. And so therefore, we've got to deal with the flesh.

00:40:26.259 --> 00:40:31.779
And so I'm thankful this evening that we have not only the historical account of Genesis 21,

00:40:32.419 --> 00:40:39.059
but the spiritual application of Galatians 4. And it helps us to understand how serious this

00:40:39.059 --> 00:40:44.179
thing is. Listen, we can try to play the game and try to think that we can have them coexist,

00:40:45.459 --> 00:40:52.419
but it just isn't going to work. It's just not going to work. And at some point in our lives,

00:40:52.419 --> 00:40:58.499
we're going to get so frustrated trying to do the things that we ought to do and behave the

00:40:58.499 --> 00:41:03.779
way that we ought to behave, but still feeding the flesh and still giving to the desires of the

00:41:03.779 --> 00:41:08.419
flesh. And it's going to come to the point in our lives where we just are just fed up and we're

00:41:08.419 --> 00:41:16.419
frustrated. We need to just wave that white flag of surrender and say, I got to mortify my members

00:41:16.419 --> 00:41:24.339
which are upon the earth. I have to crucify my flesh. Because the flesh is contrary to the Spirit.

00:41:24.339 --> 00:41:33.059
These two cannot coexist. I say they cannot coexist in the fact that we're not going to be

00:41:33.059 --> 00:41:40.659
able to please God as we're walking in the flesh. Listen, the carnal man, he is not the spiritual

00:41:40.659 --> 00:41:44.579
man, right? Why does Paul say to the believers in Corinth, I could not speak to you as unto

00:41:45.459 --> 00:41:52.659
spiritual, as unto mature, but as babes, as immature, as carnal. And so this evening,

00:41:52.659 --> 00:41:58.259
as we look at this great truth and this historical account in Genesis 21,

00:41:58.259 --> 00:42:04.739
oh, we make wonderful application with regard to what God gives us in Galatians 4, and we make

00:42:04.739 --> 00:42:12.499
that decision that we too must cast out the bond woman and her son. We must cast out that old

00:42:12.499 --> 00:42:19.779
covenant. I'm so thankful I'm not under the law. So thankful. And we must cast out that old nature,

00:42:19.779 --> 00:42:27.859
the flesh. But lest we misunderstand, and I do not have time to develop all of it,

00:42:27.859 --> 00:42:34.579
but there are some today that misapply the truth of casting out we're not under the law anymore,

00:42:34.579 --> 00:42:36.659
and they think, oh, well, then I can live however I want to live.

00:42:37.779 --> 00:42:42.099
Well, so just in case you had that thought, just continue reading in Galatians 5,

00:42:42.099 --> 00:42:46.019
because verse number one says, stand fast, therefore, in the liberty wherewith Christ

00:42:46.019 --> 00:42:52.099
hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. If you skip over to

00:42:52.099 --> 00:42:58.019
verse number 13, he says, for brethren, ye have been called unto liberty, notice this,

00:42:58.579 --> 00:43:08.179
only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.

00:43:09.059 --> 00:43:15.219
Too often today, we live in a time in which there are people that have peddled this idea

00:43:15.779 --> 00:43:19.299
that we can live however we want to live because we're no longer under the law.

00:43:20.659 --> 00:43:24.259
That's not true. Now, you may be able to live however you want to live,

00:43:25.139 --> 00:43:31.219
but there are consequences for it. Amen? There are consequences for it. He says,

00:43:31.219 --> 00:43:38.579
only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh. You know, truly, our freedom in Christ

00:43:38.579 --> 00:43:44.419
and our liberty that we have in Christ is a freedom and a liberty that allows us to serve Him.

00:43:45.459 --> 00:43:52.179
That's what it is. It gives us that opportunity to serve Him and to walk with Him and to do all

00:43:52.179 --> 00:43:55.939
that He's called us to do. It's not a freedom or a liberty that says, hey, man, I can do what I

00:43:55.939 --> 00:44:02.579
want to do because I'm going to heaven when I die. If that's the approach, then we've grossly

00:44:02.579 --> 00:44:07.859
misunderstood and misinterpreted what God tells us in His Word because He says that we're to

00:44:08.819 --> 00:44:15.299
mortify our members upon the earth, we're to crucify the old man, we're to walk in the Spirit

00:44:15.299 --> 00:44:23.139
so that we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh. Your flesh has desire. All of our flesh has desire,

00:44:23.139 --> 00:44:29.619
has an appetite. The Bible tells us the flesh is contrary to the Spirit. And so, this evening,

00:44:29.619 --> 00:44:36.979
we have to cast out. We have to understand that we're under that new covenant and that the flesh

00:44:36.979 --> 00:44:41.859
and the Spirit are not going to be able to coexist. And so, therefore, we must crucify the

00:44:41.859 --> 00:44:49.299
old man. What great truth that God gives us in Galatians 4 that helps us understand clearly

00:44:50.179 --> 00:44:54.979
what happens back in Genesis 21. Next week, we'll continue with Genesis 21. Actually,

00:44:54.979 --> 00:44:58.659
next week, we've got a missionary. And so, he'll be preaching in the evening. And so,

00:44:58.659 --> 00:45:02.979
we'll be off from Genesis next week, but we look forward to finishing up Genesis 21.

00:45:02.979 --> 00:45:07.299
Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we love You, and we thank You for loving us. Thank You

00:45:07.299 --> 00:45:14.979
for the content that You've given us in Your Word with regard to this account and this time in the

00:45:14.979 --> 00:45:21.859
life of Abraham and Sarah. And we see the conflict there between Sarah and Hagar and between Ishmael

00:45:21.859 --> 00:45:27.379
and Isaac. And God, we thank You for the spiritual insight, the application that is provided to us in

00:45:27.379 --> 00:45:33.939
Galatians 4. And I'm so thankful to be born again. I'm so thankful to be saved. And God,

00:45:33.939 --> 00:45:38.099
I pray that You'd help me to understand this allegory and help each of us to understand this

00:45:38.099 --> 00:45:44.579
evening this, not only the two covenants, but the two natures and the flesh and the Spirit.

00:45:44.579 --> 00:45:50.499
And God, I pray that even as we've heard many times in recent weeks, that You would help us to

00:45:50.499 --> 00:45:54.739
walk in the Spirit so that we would not fulfill the lust of the flesh. Would You help us to

00:45:54.739 --> 00:45:59.859
mortify our members which are upon the earth? Would You help us to live that crucified life?

00:46:01.219 --> 00:46:05.299
Would You work in hearts and lives as only You can? We'll give You the glory for every

00:46:05.299 --> 00:46:08.339
decision that's made. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would You stand with us?
