1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
Continue, amen, continue, don't give up,

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,460
don't throw in the towel, continue.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,279
And we have a great cause, we have a great savior,

4
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,239
and we are on the winning side, amen.

5
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:14,760
Continue, continue.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,540
First Thessalonians chapter number five this evening.

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,379
This is our 15th lesson through this portion of scripture.

8
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:24,920
I've titled the series Walk Worthy, Please God.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,319
And here on Wednesday evenings,

10
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:29,920
we've had the opportunity to go through this bullet point

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,739
if you will, type of instruction

12
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:34,240
that begins in verse number 12

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,680
and goes through the end of the chapter.

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,400
We do find that some of these verses

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,680
we'll look at in the next few weeks

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,840
have some greetings and so on and so forth.

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,119
We find that in second Thessalonians chapter number three,

18
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,200
there's also some similar type of instruction

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,040
at the end of the book.

20
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,119
And so once we finish here

21
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:52,180
in the fifth chapter of first Thessalonians,

22
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,919
we will go over to the third chapter of second Thessalonians

23
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:58,040
and continue our study of Walk Worthy, Please God.

24
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,220
I hope that your heart's desire is to please the Lord.

25
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,599
I hope that you desire in your life

26
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:06,120
that I want my life to count for Christ

27
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,440
and I want Christ to be pleased with me.

28
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,279
You know, it's interesting,

29
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,120
in the book of first Corinthians in the 10th chapter,

30
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,760
you read that God tells us

31
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,760
of the children of Israel in the Old Testament

32
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,919
that with many of them, God was not well pleased.

33
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:23,040
That's a statement of scripture that really frightens me

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,080
because I would not want it to be said of me

35
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,199
or of us corporately as a church

36
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:30,279
that God is not well pleased with us.

37
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:31,959
I want God to be pleased with me.

38
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,680
I hope that you have that same desire

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,239
and corporately as a church,

40
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:37,739
we desire God's blessing upon us.

41
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:39,839
We find that as we look at this passage of scripture,

42
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:42,559
the instruction that's been given as we've gone through it,

43
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:45,480
I've mentioned often that it's concise instruction,

44
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,919
it's bullet point type instruction.

45
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:50,959
And we find that with each of the pieces of instruction

46
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,959
that God gives us, there's a response of the hearer.

47
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:59,319
We often say that we ought to be doers of the word

48
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,040
and not hearers only.

49
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,000
And so this instruction is given to us

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,059
not so that we can answer a quiz question,

51
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,680
not so that we can say that we have,

52
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,119
no, it's so that we would apply it in our lives,

53
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,320
that we would be doers of the word and not hearers only.

54
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,360
Why do I say that?

55
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,759
Because we come to verse 23,

56
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,759
the verse that we'll be studying this evening,

57
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,399
and the subject matter that is before us

58
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:21,520
is that really of sanctification.

59
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,740
And I believe that as you look at the passage of scripture,

60
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,940
verses 12 down through verse 22,

61
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,539
that as God is giving all of this instruction,

62
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:31,460
it's pointing to this is the process,

63
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,020
if you will, of sanctification.

64
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,419
Now, it's interesting to me,

65
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:40,419
the subject of salvation is often discussed,

66
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,100
as it should be, amen?

67
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,500
I'm thankful to be saved by the grace of God, aren't you?

68
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,259
I'm thankful to know Christ as my savior, I'm heaven bound.

69
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:50,380
I'm thankful that I can have confidence.

70
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,460
I spoke about that on Sunday evening, and what a blessing.

71
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,419
And I'm so thankful for the subject of salvation

72
00:02:56,419 --> 00:03:01,419
that we can regularly discuss the truth of God's salvation

73
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,059
and how we can be saved and know that we're saved

74
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:08,779
and how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation,

75
00:03:08,779 --> 00:03:10,160
the writer of Hebrews says,

76
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,899
and no doubt it's a precious subject.

77
00:03:13,899 --> 00:03:15,059
But I would say to you this evening

78
00:03:15,059 --> 00:03:17,820
that the subject of sanctification

79
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,380
is also of significant importance.

80
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,339
I would say that the subject of sanctification

81
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:24,979
must be understood,

82
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:28,699
but it's not one that we speak about maybe as often

83
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:31,100
as we speak about salvation.

84
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,100
God saved you, if you're saved this evening,

85
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,059
God saved you by his grace.

86
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:40,820
And as a new creature, we are to be sanctified.

87
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,539
Now, let me explain this evening

88
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:44,979
because it's important for us to understand

89
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:46,820
the biblical aspects of the subject

90
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,460
that is before us this evening of sanctification.

91
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,380
I've titled the message simply that, sanctification.

92
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:53,820
The Bible says in verse 23,

93
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,820
and the very God of peace sanctify you wholly, completely.

94
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:03,660
And I pray God, your whole spirit and soul and body

95
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:08,100
be preserved blameless unto the coming

96
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,100
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

97
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,699
As we look at this verse of scripture

98
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:14,100
and begin to think about the subject matter

99
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,619
of sanctification, we understand that the Bible

100
00:04:16,619 --> 00:04:19,980
gives us really some aspects of sanctification

101
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,480
that are important for us to understand.

102
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,160
The first aspect of sanctification

103
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,980
that's important for us to understand

104
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,320
is that of positional sanctification.

105
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,320
The Bible says of the believers in Corinth,

106
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,980
now we know some things about the church in Corinth, right?

107
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,920
The church in Corinth is a carnal church, do you agree?

108
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,440
The Bible says that Paul says to them in the third chapter,

109
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,920
I can't speak unto you as unto spiritual,

110
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,540
but as unto carnal, why?

111
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,619
They were immature spiritually, they were babes,

112
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,079
they had divisions and contentions and so on and so forth.

113
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,760
So they were a people in the church in Corinth

114
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,880
that had some carnal issues, some problems,

115
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,399
but you know that God refers to them as being sanctified.

116
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,359
In 1 Corinthians chapter number one,

117
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:06,359
if you wanna run over there very quickly,

118
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:08,799
I want you to notice that as Paul was writing

119
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:10,880
the introduction unto the inspiration of the Holy Spirit

120
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,079
of God to these members of the church at Corinth,

121
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,559
we find here that God is saying to these individuals

122
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:20,739
in verse number two, unto the church of God,

123
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:24,000
which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified

124
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,679
in Christ Jesus, called to be saints,

125
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:28,239
with all that in every place,

126
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:30,440
call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord,

127
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,859
both theirs and ours.

128
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:37,040
In chapter number six, he says this in verse number 11,

129
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,079
he says, and such were some of you.

130
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,959
What's he talking about?

131
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,600
Well, he goes through in verse nine and 10,

132
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,720
we don't have time to read all of it,

133
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,700
but he mentions a number of wicked lifestyles

134
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,200
and he says, and such were some of you,

135
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,359
but aren't you thankful for that great conjunction?

136
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:53,399
Ye are washed, but ye are sanctified,

137
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,320
but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus

138
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,600
and by the Spirit of our God.

139
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,880
I would say of those in Corinth,

140
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,839
that the reality is that there were some,

141
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,519
all of the believers in Corinth

142
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,859
were sanctified positionally.

143
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,640
But not every believer in Corinth

144
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,720
was sanctified practically.

145
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,320
Sometimes we use the term progressive sanctification,

146
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,200
this ongoing process of becoming more like Christ.

147
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,679
We find in the book of Ephesians,

148
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:26,320
it's a great book to study

149
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,000
with regard to the subject matter of sanctification.

150
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,600
The first three chapters of the book of Ephesians

151
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,500
deal specifically with our position in Christ.

152
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,160
In fact, you find that in Christ is used repeatedly

153
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,720
in those first few chapters of the book of Ephesians, why?

154
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,079
Because that is our position in Christ.

155
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,519
Then you come to chapter number four and five and six,

156
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,640
and you start reading this word about walk.

157
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,679
Now that this is your position

158
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,320
and we've established your position in Christ,

159
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,920
here is practically what it's supposed to look like.

160
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,160
Does that make sense?

161
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,399
And so we find this evening,

162
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,160
if we were to look at some biblical phrases

163
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,119
in the book of Ephesians in the fourth chapter,

164
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:09,720
the book of Colossians in the third chapter,

165
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,760
in both of those chapters,

166
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,559
there's this put off and put on

167
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:16,500
that you'll read of.

168
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,480
Put off these things, what are these things?

169
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,720
The works of the flesh.

170
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,160
Put on, what are these things?

171
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,640
The fruit of the spirit, the obedience to Christ.

172
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,160
And you'll see this put off, put on

173
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,279
that you find in those two portions of scripture.

174
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,000
And that's what I would refer to

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,500
as being practical or progressive sanctification.

176
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,200
The word sanctify is a word

177
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,799
that means to cleanse or purify, to make holy,

178
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,239
but that could be referred to a number of different things.

179
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:44,399
You look in the Old Testament,

180
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,579
you talk about the furniture in the tabernacle,

181
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:50,839
it was sanctified, it was set apart for a sacred use.

182
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,480
But I want you to understand this definition.

183
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,760
I thought it was a great definition

184
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,160
from Noah Webster's 1828.

185
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,679
It says this, here's how he defined the word sanctify,

186
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:04,679
to make holy by detaching the affections

187
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:08,480
from the world and its defilements

188
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,480
and exalting them to a supreme love to God.

189
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,500
I think it's a great, great definition.

190
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,500
To then piggyback on sanctify, then sanctification,

191
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:22,679
he says it this way,

192
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:24,720
here's how he defines it in that dictionary,

193
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,519
the act of God's grace,

194
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:29,380
by which the affections of men are purified

195
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,400
or alienated from sin and the world

196
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,200
and exalted to a supreme love to God.

197
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,599
I said at the beginning of the message

198
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,200
that the subject of salvation is often discussed

199
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,619
as it should be,

200
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:47,320
but the subject matter of sanctification

201
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,000
sometimes isn't discussed as often.

202
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,460
Can I tell you that it's missing in our churches today

203
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,659
this understanding of sanctification

204
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:58,200
and what God's plan, and let me say it this way,

205
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,200
God's will is for every child of his to be sanctified.

206
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,000
To be sanctified.

207
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,299
Some people say, man, I'm saved

208
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,979
and I'm going to heaven

209
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:11,460
and I can just do whatever I want to do.

210
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,099
I can live however I want to live.

211
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:16,640
I can just whatever because, man, I'm going to heaven.

212
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,820
That's not the kind of salvation I got.

213
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,659
Amen, I'm just being honest with you.

214
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,659
When I got saved, the Bible says in Christ,

215
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:25,940
he's a new creature.

216
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,859
Old things are passed away.

217
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:28,559
Behold, all things are become new.

218
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:31,239
Do I still have the desires of the flesh?

219
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:32,299
All of us do.

220
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:34,059
But I'll tell you what,

221
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:36,700
when you start understanding the truth of this book

222
00:09:36,739 --> 00:09:38,460
and the Holy Spirit of God

223
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,280
who indwells every child of God works in your life,

224
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,099
you understand the process of sanctification.

225
00:09:45,099 --> 00:09:47,859
All of a sudden, the things that you did

226
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:49,059
before you got saved,

227
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:51,140
now the Holy Spirit of God is convicting you

228
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,539
for doing those things after you got saved.

229
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:54,380
Why?

230
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,700
Because you're a new creature, amen?

231
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,820
And we understand this.

232
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,979
And listen, we have,

233
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:04,099
in our world today, this situation where

234
00:10:04,099 --> 00:10:06,899
this subject of sanctification is really foreign

235
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,019
to Christendom.

236
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:10,259
Man, just live how you wanna live.

237
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:11,899
I mean, God understands.

238
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:14,439
Listen, God wants you to be happy.

239
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:16,339
Where did you find that in the Bible?

240
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:19,299
I mean, honestly.

241
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:21,299
I've not read, no, I understand the Bible

242
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:23,459
used the word happy, used the word blessed,

243
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,739
but listen, your definition of what you think

244
00:10:25,739 --> 00:10:28,219
makes you happy and what God talks about

245
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:31,139
being blessed or happy are different.

246
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:32,339
Amen?

247
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:35,179
It makes me happy to live in this promiscuous lifestyle.

248
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:38,139
That's not what God meant for you.

249
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:40,179
Amen, can we agree tonight?

250
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:43,419
And so we understand, listen, to be separate

251
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:46,759
from profane things and dedicated to God.

252
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,259
The same Greek word in the New Testament

253
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:52,459
is often translated, the same Greek word

254
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:54,359
that's translated sanctification

255
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:57,019
is often translated holiness.

256
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:58,299
It's the same Greek word.

257
00:10:58,299 --> 00:10:59,119
They're synonymous.

258
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:00,179
As you read through the scriptures,

259
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:02,419
you'll see those words, you'll see that.

260
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:06,059
Someone said this, a preacher of yesteryear,

261
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:07,099
and he said it this way.

262
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,299
Salvation is the miracle of a moment.

263
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:13,039
Sanctification is the process of a lifetime.

264
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:16,619
I think it's a good quote.

265
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:18,339
I'm thankful to be saved.

266
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:21,339
I'm thankful that positionally I'm sanctified.

267
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:22,499
I'm seated in the heavenlies.

268
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:24,059
I mean, positionally.

269
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:27,859
But practically, it's a process of a lifetime.

270
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:30,259
You know what it is?

271
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:33,099
It is daily abiding in Christ.

272
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:33,919
You know what it is?

273
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,859
It's walking in the spirit.

274
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:36,699
You know what it is?

275
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:39,239
It's crucifying the old man with its affections

276
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:41,219
and its lust, it's understanding,

277
00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:44,379
as Paul says to the believers there in Colossae,

278
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:47,139
that we're to mortify our members.

279
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:49,659
If ye then be risen with Christ,

280
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:53,139
seek those things which are above, amen.

281
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:54,979
And it's that process of sanctification.

282
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:58,339
It's yielding to God's work in your life.

283
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:00,219
It's really the subject of surrender.

284
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:03,059
As we look at this passage of Scripture

285
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:06,259
in 1 Thessalonians chapter five and verse 23,

286
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,499
we find that the Apostle Paul, being used of God,

287
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:11,979
gives all of this instruction.

288
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:14,399
He's giving them instruction with regard

289
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,019
to how they can walk worthy,

290
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:18,179
how they can please God with their lives.

291
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:19,859
And he goes through all of this,

292
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:21,859
and we've studied it now for 14 weeks,

293
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:24,979
and we've gone through all of these pieces of instruction,

294
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:27,179
and we find that we come to verse 23,

295
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,419
and notice what he says,

296
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:30,979
and the very God of peace,

297
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:33,139
by the way, aren't you thankful for the peace of God?

298
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:36,059
He is the God of peace, as it says here.

299
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:38,659
Sanctify you wholly.

300
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:41,979
Notice, it's the entirety of us.

301
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:43,459
It's not to separate these,

302
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:45,619
but to talk about the whole of our being.

303
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:49,419
I pray, God, your whole spirit, soul, and body

304
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:51,659
be preserved blameless

305
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:55,859
under the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

306
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,579
On Sunday morning, I preached a message

307
00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:00,499
about the qualifications for pastors and for deacons,

308
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:01,779
and I made this statement

309
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,739
in the introduction of that message

310
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:06,819
that though that passage of Scripture specifically

311
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:10,619
is addressing the qualifications for those two offices,

312
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:15,619
that the information, the qualifications listed therein

313
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:19,779
are really what every child of God should attain to be.

314
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:21,099
Amen?

315
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:22,819
It's not that we attain to be that

316
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:24,859
so that we can hold an office.

317
00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:27,659
No, it's that that's what we should desire to be.

318
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:30,979
We should desire that what is said in those qualifications

319
00:13:30,979 --> 00:13:33,459
would be true of every one of us.

320
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:35,379
Why? Because we're a child of God.

321
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:38,379
As we look at this passage of Scripture,

322
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:40,539
and we notice the subject of sanctification,

323
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:41,779
two thoughts for you this evening.

324
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:45,979
Number one, there is an example.

325
00:13:45,979 --> 00:13:47,579
Number one, there's an example.

326
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,619
The greatest example in every area,

327
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:53,579
any area of your life or my life is the Lord Jesus Christ.

328
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:57,279
We're gonna deal with that last in this particular point

329
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,259
because the reality is that sometimes

330
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:01,939
as I've had interactions with people over the years,

331
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:05,219
and I've shown, listen, Peter says in 1 Peter

332
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,759
that Christ left us an example

333
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:08,539
that we should follow his steps.

334
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:11,579
But some would argue, well, he's God, he's perfect,

335
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:14,579
and I just can't attain to that, okay?

336
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,979
And I understand the argument,

337
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:20,539
but God is, he has given us an example

338
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:21,499
that we should follow his steps,

339
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:25,659
and the best example that we could ever go to in Scripture

340
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:28,259
is the Lord Jesus Christ.

341
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:30,779
But I find that even in the text of Scripture

342
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,259
that in here as we think about there's an example

343
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:36,059
that the apostle Paul was an example

344
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:38,579
of the truth that he's setting forth.

345
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,939
Notice what the Bible says a few chapters before

346
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:42,139
to the same that he's writing to

347
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:44,139
in 1 Thessalonians chapter two.

348
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:45,699
Notice what the Bible says.

349
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,259
In 1 Thessalonians chapter two, of course,

350
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:50,619
Paul was used of the Lord

351
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:52,019
during the second missionary journey

352
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,879
to see this church at Thessalonica established.

353
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,299
God allowed him, God called him, God equipped him,

354
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:00,019
and this church is established.

355
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:02,379
As best we can tell as you read through the book of Acts,

356
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:05,939
it was a short period of time that Paul was in Thessalonica.

357
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,819
They ran him out of town just as they did

358
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:09,979
in previous places where he ministered,

359
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:11,859
and we find that he's not there long,

360
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:13,699
but there's a church established.

361
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:15,379
Paul, as we mentioned at the very beginning

362
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:19,139
of our study here, he was yearning for these individuals,

363
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,539
concerned for them of how they're doing,

364
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:23,919
and notice what he says in the second chapter

365
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,259
in verse number 10.

366
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,559
He says, ye are witnesses.

367
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,059
Not only were they the members of the church

368
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:34,099
that he's writing to, but he says, and God also.

369
00:15:35,099 --> 00:15:40,099
How wholly and justly and unblameably

370
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:46,739
we behaved ourselves among you that believe.

371
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:51,259
As ye know how we exhorted and comforted

372
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:55,139
and charged every one of you as a father doth his children

373
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:58,219
that ye would walk worthy of God

374
00:15:58,219 --> 00:16:03,059
who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.

375
00:16:03,099 --> 00:16:05,819
Paul was not simply preaching a message

376
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:08,139
to a church about sanctification

377
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:12,739
that he himself was not applying in his own life.

378
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:13,779
That's important.

379
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:16,059
You've heard people say, I've said it

380
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,179
from the pulpit plenty of times,

381
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:19,899
the message of your lips is more powerful than the,

382
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:22,219
or excuse me, the message of your life is more powerful

383
00:16:22,219 --> 00:16:24,379
than the message of your lips.

384
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:27,699
What you do is much more impactful than what you say.

385
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:31,059
You can say whatever you wanna say.

386
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,099
That's why Paul said when he was writing

387
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:35,379
to the believers in Philippi,

388
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:37,619
the things that you've heard,

389
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:41,139
but he says, and seen in me, do.

390
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:45,099
He didn't just preach a message, he lived a message.

391
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:47,339
In fact, he says it this way to the believers in Corinth

392
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,619
in 1 Corinthians 11, one, you don't need to turn there,

393
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:51,979
but he tells them to be followers of him,

394
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:55,539
but it's based upon the fact that he is a follower of God.

395
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:57,539
That's important.

396
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:01,259
You don't blindly follow someone

397
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,859
unless you know that that someone is following God.

398
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:09,299
Paul says this in 2 Timothy 3 in verse number 10,

399
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:12,179
again, with regard to his example,

400
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,619
he says, and we don't have time to look through all of it,

401
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:17,339
but he's talking about the last days

402
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,659
and the perilous times, and he's going through

403
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:21,779
and he's giving some examples,

404
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:24,179
and he comes to verse number 10,

405
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:29,419
and he says this, but thou hast fully known my doctrine,

406
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:32,059
but then notice what he says, matter of life.

407
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:36,899
You better know the doctrine of the spiritual leader,

408
00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:39,379
but he says, you've not only known my doctrine,

409
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:41,179
but my matter of life.

410
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:43,899
Paul understood the importance of sanctification.

411
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:45,739
He understood that it was important that,

412
00:17:45,739 --> 00:17:47,019
listen, he's the one that writes,

413
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:49,499
I am crucified with Christ, I die daily,

414
00:17:49,499 --> 00:17:51,299
walk in the spirit so that you would not

415
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:52,539
fulfill the lust of the flesh.

416
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:56,059
He's living that, and he says that you have

417
00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:00,579
fully known my doctrine, matter of life,

418
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:05,179
purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity,

419
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:08,539
patience, persecutions, afflictions,

420
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:10,859
which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium,

421
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:14,219
at Lystra, what persecutions I endured,

422
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:17,019
but out of them all the Lord delivered me.

423
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:17,939
Hallelujah.

424
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,659
Paul says you've known.

425
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:23,499
See, Paul was an example as he writes to these believers

426
00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:26,899
in Thessalonica about the importance of sanctification.

427
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:29,419
We understand that Paul was an example.

428
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:31,459
The greatest example, of course, the Lord Jesus Christ.

429
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:33,179
I mentioned that at the very beginning.

430
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,459
The Bible tells us that the just for the unjust,

431
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:37,500
there's no guile found in him.

432
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,339
He's perfect, he's sinless, he did the will of the Father.

433
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:41,859
We understand, the Bible says,

434
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:43,699
God says in the book of Leviticus,

435
00:18:43,699 --> 00:18:45,659
we read it again in the book of 1 Peter,

436
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:47,219
that we are to be holy, why?

437
00:18:47,219 --> 00:18:48,820
Because he is holy.

438
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,539
In fact, look at 1 Peter chapter one,

439
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,979
if you will, in verses 13 through 16,

440
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:56,380
and notice what the Bible says with regard

441
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,859
to this matter of holiness or sanctification.

442
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:03,699
Notice, Peter says in verse number 13,

443
00:19:03,699 --> 00:19:05,859
1 Peter one and verse 13,

444
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:08,339
wherefore, gird up the loins of your mind,

445
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:11,579
be sober and hope to the end for the grace

446
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:13,179
that is to be brought unto you

447
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:15,380
at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

448
00:19:16,219 --> 00:19:18,619
As obedient children,

449
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:21,659
not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust

450
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:23,339
in your ignorance,

451
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:27,219
but as he which hath called you is holy,

452
00:19:27,219 --> 00:19:32,219
so be ye holy in all manner of conversation,

453
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:36,699
because it is written, be holy for I am holy.

454
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:40,940
What a great charge, what a great piece of instruction

455
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,219
with regard to holiness and sanctification.

456
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:46,139
And we understand again that there were false teachers

457
00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:48,339
during the time of the writing of the New Testament,

458
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:50,299
and we understand that the false teacher

459
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:51,979
still exists to this very day,

460
00:19:51,979 --> 00:19:56,179
and they would deny the truth of God's word,

461
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:57,739
and we find that they would creep in

462
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,219
and they would deny the grace,

463
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:00,059
they would turn.

464
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:03,799
excuse me, the grace of God into lasciviousness,

465
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:05,739
according to the book of Jude.

466
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:07,139
Unbridled lust.

467
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,559
Listen, you can find today, antinomianism is popular.

468
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,399
You can read of it.

469
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:12,559
Just, man, you're saved by grace.

470
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,119
You do what you wanna do.

471
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:14,959
We're not under the law.

472
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:16,859
Look, I'm glad that we're not under the law.

473
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:18,679
Christ fulfilled the law.

474
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:21,159
But I said this a few weeks ago.

475
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:23,519
The standard is actually higher.

476
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:26,879
In the Old Testament, remember, he said, do no evil.

477
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:29,919
But we come to 1 Thessalonians 5.22,

478
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,519
and he says, abstain from all appearance of evil.

479
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:37,719
It doesn't mean that we should engage in evil.

480
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:41,279
We understand the instruction to do no evil still stands,

481
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:43,479
but he takes it to a higher plane,

482
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:45,759
and he says, not only are you to do no evil,

483
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:49,139
but you're to abstain from all appearance of evil.

484
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:52,079
Wow.

485
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,719
There's an example.

486
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,159
Paul was not perfect.

487
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:57,019
He was a man like you and like me.

488
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:59,559
He was a human being.

489
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:02,359
There are times in which I've heard people say,

490
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:04,479
man, I wanna be used like Paul.

491
00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:07,439
You better read what Paul did

492
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:11,360
in order to be used the way that he was used.

493
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,399
He was surrendered, he was yielded,

494
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:15,519
he was crucified with Christ.

495
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:17,879
He was a man that was fully surrendered to God,

496
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:20,279
and therefore God used him in the manner in which he did.

497
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,680
We can read of other missionaries

498
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,759
and preachers of yesteryear that God used in a great way.

499
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:27,559
God is no respecter of persons.

500
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:30,279
God will use you if you're usable.

501
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:35,199
God will use you if you're usable.

502
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:37,659
Understand God doesn't use dirty vessels.

503
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,879
We're to be sanctified and meet for the master's use.

504
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:48,079
Sanctification is important.

505
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:50,159
Doesn't matter, man, just,

506
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,159
remember the girl that was saying

507
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,599
these are the servants of the Lord

508
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,500
that tell us about the way of salvation,

509
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,299
and Paul rebuked and caused that demon,

510
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:01,619
was it a right message?

511
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:02,619
It was the right message.

512
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:05,860
They were the servants of the most high God,

513
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,819
and they were speaking the way of salvation.

514
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:12,619
It was the right message, it was just the wrong vessel.

515
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:14,819
Amen.

516
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:16,080
So notice there's an example,

517
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,099
but notice number two, there's an expectation.

518
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:20,259
There's an expectation.

519
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:22,099
I believe that God expects for his children

520
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:24,139
to walk as children of light.

521
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:27,059
God expects for us to allow his word

522
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,259
and the Holy Spirit of God to work in us

523
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:32,779
and to conform us to the image of Jesus Christ,

524
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:33,619
his dear son.

525
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:37,139
In fact, Romans 8 and verse 29 tells us that very thing,

526
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:41,940
that this is really the understanding of the Christian life.

527
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,739
We often read verse 28, I mentioned on Sunday night,

528
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:46,539
and we know that all things work together for good

529
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:47,419
to them that love God,

530
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:49,619
to them who are the called according to his purpose.

531
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:52,020
Verse 29 says, for whom he did foreknow,

532
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,339
he also did predestinate to what?

533
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:57,699
To be conformed to the image of his son,

534
00:22:57,699 --> 00:23:00,500
that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.

535
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,860
We find that as you continue to read,

536
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,500
and even as you think about the truth

537
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,520
of the book of Romans,

538
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,699
if you were to back up into the sixth chapter

539
00:23:08,699 --> 00:23:11,119
and talk about how you were the servants of sin,

540
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:13,380
but now you're the servants of righteousness,

541
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,639
you can read in verse 19 and then again in verse 22

542
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:21,639
about the truth of holiness, fruits unto holiness.

543
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:22,720
Guess what that word is?

544
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,279
It's sanctification, it's the same word.

545
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,039
And we find this evening that there's been this change,

546
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,059
salvation brings this change, we're a new creature.

547
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:34,360
Listen, I'm thankful that Christianity,

548
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,739
the gospel, is not just about reformation.

549
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:41,119
It's about transformation.

550
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:44,899
Transformation, it's radical.

551
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,759
I'm a new creature in Christ.

552
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,479
Listen, I don't think like I used to think.

553
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,080
We shouldn't, why?

554
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,660
Because we had a worldview that was a void of God.

555
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:04,119
And there's a radical change

556
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:08,279
in this transforming gospel of Jesus Christ.

557
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:12,080
And his expectation is that his people

558
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,959
would be conformed to the image of his son,

559
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:16,559
that we'd be like Jesus.

560
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,119
Why did they call them Christians first at Antioch?

561
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,279
Well, they called them Christians

562
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,320
because they were like Christ.

563
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:30,200
A well-known leader of a former, another religion

564
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,239
said of Christians, I like your Christ,

565
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,660
but I don't like your Christians

566
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:40,540
because your Christians are nothing like your Christ.

567
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,940
What an indictment.

568
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,359
Because we're to be like Christ.

569
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,739
Notice what the Bible says in 1 Thessalonians chapter four.

570
00:24:47,739 --> 00:24:50,459
We kept within this book to look at the example

571
00:24:50,459 --> 00:24:54,100
of the apostle Paul when he talked about their behavior,

572
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,660
their own sanctification in chapter two.

573
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,820
But now look at what the Bible says in chapter four

574
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,399
with regard to this charge that he gives.

575
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:03,500
Notice in verse number one,

576
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,940
furthermore then we beseech you brethren

577
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,540
and exhort you by the Lord Jesus

578
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,299
that as you have received of us,

579
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:15,299
notice this phrase, how ye ought to walk and to please God

580
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,619
so ye would abound more and more.

581
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:21,579
It wasn't enough for them just to have the instruction.

582
00:25:21,579 --> 00:25:23,579
They had to do something with it.

583
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:29,040
It's not enough for someone to just know about Jesus.

584
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,820
They got to accept him as their personal savior.

585
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,459
The conversation with someone recently

586
00:25:33,459 --> 00:25:34,700
and I was talking about the Lord

587
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,179
and I asked her about heaven and I'm like,

588
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:38,100
oh yeah, man, I grew up in and he kind of went

589
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,820
on this whole rabbit trail of where he grew up

590
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,799
and the times he used to have

591
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,239
and he doesn't go to church anymore,

592
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:44,459
but I talk to God all the time and I cuss with God

593
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,019
and I do this with God and God seems to be okay with it.

594
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:49,579
And I'm like, I don't know what God you're talking to,

595
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:53,940
but that's not my God, amen?

596
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,500
What happened when Isaiah saw the glory of God?

597
00:25:58,639 --> 00:26:01,139
He fell to his face.

598
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:03,419
My God, your God is a holy God.

599
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:08,299
We find that he says that you would abound more and more.

600
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:11,059
Look at verse two, for ye know what commandments

601
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:13,820
we gave you by the Lord Jesus.

602
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,059
Verse number three, for this,

603
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:17,579
you might want to underline this,

604
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:21,380
for this is the will of God,

605
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,899
even your sanctification,

606
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:27,639
that ye should abstain from fornication,

607
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:31,220
that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel

608
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,779
in sanctification and honor.

609
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:38,019
For God, skip down to verse number seven, if you will,

610
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:42,619
for God hath not called us unto uncleanness,

611
00:26:42,619 --> 00:26:45,899
but unto holiness.

612
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,779
Praise the Lord.

613
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:50,559
And listen, here's the amazing thing.

614
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,239
It's not a work that you can do.

615
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:56,059
It's a work that God does in you.

616
00:26:56,059 --> 00:26:59,940
As you yield yourself to him, as you get into this word,

617
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,779
as you hear the teaching and preaching of God's word,

618
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:06,660
as you apply the teaching and preaching of God's word,

619
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,100
God is doing this work.

620
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,179
Notice he says, and the very God of peace

621
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:13,059
sanctify you wholly.

622
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:15,380
I can't make myself sanctified,

623
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:20,179
but God working in me causes me to be sanctified.

624
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:23,820
It's amazing as we yield ourselves to him.

625
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,700
We find that, as I mentioned a moment ago,

626
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,220
and if you were to have the opportunity,

627
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,760
we're out of time this evening,

628
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,299
but if you look back to 1 Corinthians chapter six

629
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:36,260
and verses 19 and 20, what know ye not,

630
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,940
that your bodies are the temple of the Holy Ghost,

631
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,000
which is in you, which you have of God.

632
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,040
And we understand we're to glorify God

633
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,880
in our body and our spirit,

634
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,799
which are his, why we're bought with a price,

635
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,880
and we understand that truth.

636
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,239
And I said this in the beginning this evening,

637
00:27:49,239 --> 00:27:51,320
but all the believers in Corinth,

638
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,279
positionally speaking, they were sanctified.

639
00:27:56,239 --> 00:28:00,160
However, many of the believers in Corinth

640
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,919
were not practically sanctified.

641
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,079
They were carnal.

642
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,119
They were living how they wanted to live,

643
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:11,119
doing what they wanted to do.

644
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:13,239
I believe that even as we look at this truth

645
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:16,320
with regard to the church in Corinth,

646
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,040
Christendom, broadly speaking, is still guilty.

647
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,160
If you've truly been saved by the grace of God,

648
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,000
you're positionally sanctified.

649
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,399
But there are a lot of people that are living

650
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,600
like they're not saved.

651
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,440
I said this a while ago from the pulpit.

652
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,719
We're talking about praying for leaders.

653
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:37,400
Sometimes we have the expectation

654
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,840
that lost people are gonna act like saved people,

655
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,679
when it's hard enough to get saved people

656
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:43,919
to act like saved people.

657
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,599
Why in the world would we think that a lost person

658
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:49,840
is gonna act like a saved person?

659
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,719
Why would you think a lost person's gonna believe

660
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:54,520
the truth of the Bible that you believe?

661
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,359
They're lost.

662
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,559
The Bible tells us that the natural man

663
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:01,559
receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,

664
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:03,039
for they're foolishness unto him,

665
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,039
neither can he know them

666
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,940
because they're spiritually discerned.

667
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,539
In 1 Corinthians chapter two.

668
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,380
As we look at this verse of Scripture

669
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,739
and we see the importance of sanctification,

670
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:16,700
as we reference once again that quote

671
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,419
from the preacher of yesteryear,

672
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:20,099
salvation is the miracle of the moment,

673
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:22,779
but sanctification is the process of a lifetime.

674
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:25,419
How much are we like Christ?

675
00:29:25,419 --> 00:29:27,059
How much are we allowing the Holy Spirit of God

676
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:30,460
to conform us to the image of his dear Son?

677
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,419
See, what we understand as Christians

678
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,460
is that first and foremost, my identity is in Christ.

679
00:29:37,979 --> 00:29:42,979
My identity is in Christ, first and foremost.

680
00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:44,940
And when we understand that

681
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,239
and we understand that our citizenship is in heaven,

682
00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:48,700
this world is not my home,

683
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,219
I'm just a passing through, as the songwriter said,

684
00:29:51,219 --> 00:29:53,140
and we're to be like Christ.

685
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,900
We're not to be conformed to this world.

686
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,419
We see that in Romans chapter 12 in verse number one and two.

687
00:29:58,419 --> 00:29:59,940
I beseech you therefore, brethren,

688
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,539
by the power vested in me by the Father and the Son

689
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:04,419
and the Holy Spirit, amen.

690
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:05,260
Amen.

691
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:10,000
the mercies of God that you present your body as a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto

692
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,800
God, which is your reasonable service.

693
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:19,640
And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind."

694
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,640
How does that happen?

695
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:27,960
Listen, you had a worldview, I had a worldview that was contrary to the biblical worldview.

696
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:34,160
One of the greatest problems we have in America today is that we think that the worldview

697
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:40,280
out there, that we can adopt part of that worldview.

698
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:45,560
It's contrary, it's contrary.

699
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:50,720
As we look back in 1 Thessalonians 5 verse 23, we see the truth of sanctification, but

700
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,360
I'm also interested in seeing what Paul says to these believers, and very quickly you notice

701
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:01,520
that Paul says, I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body, and we see that Paul was

702
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,560
praying for them and what a valid thing to understand the power of prayer and the importance

703
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,240
of intercession and being involved in intercessory prayer.

704
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:19,320
But notice what he says, that you would be preserved, that you would be preserved blameless

705
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:24,480
unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

706
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,720
He reminds them, not only that he's praying for them, but he reminds them once again of

707
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,920
the truth that Jesus is coming again.

708
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,200
In fact, as you read through 1 Thessalonians, you see every chapter, 2 Thessalonians, the

709
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,720
same thing, in every chapter there's a reference to the return of Christ, and it's a theme

710
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,360
of both of these books.

711
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,200
There was some false teaching that was affecting them as it's dealt with in the second book

712
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,520
with regard to the day of the Lord, and it's set forth and straightened out because there

713
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,720
were some that were led astray.

714
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,200
They were given a counterfeit letter as if it came from Paul, and Paul instructs and

715
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,480
corrects.

716
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,760
You look at 2 Thessalonians 2 and you see specifically that being dealt with.

717
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,000
But when we understand unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and the imminent return

718
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,120
of Christ, and we understand that John says, in the book of 1 John, that we would not be

719
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,520
ashamed of him at his appearing.

720
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:20,640
Then as you enter into the next portion of that scripture, that's at the end of chapter

721
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,600
2 of the book of 1 John, you get into chapter number 3, behold what manner of love the Father

722
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,640
hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God.

723
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,520
But then it talks about the truth there with regard to the coming of the Lord, and it says

724
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:41,520
this in chapter number 3, in verse number 3, talking about verse 2, when he shall appear,

725
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:47,900
but verse 3, and every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is

726
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,900
pure.

727
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:54,860
Ephesians chapter number 5 talks about the church being presented, and obviously it's

728
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,740
talking about the members of the church being presented.

729
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:04,180
In fact, he says this in verse 26, that he might sanctify and cleanse it, the church,

730
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:10,860
with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious

731
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:16,300
church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and

732
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,500
without blemish.

733
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,700
There's an expectation that God's people would be sanctified.

734
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,740
We'd be serious about this thing of living for Christ.

735
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:31,900
Living for Jesus, we sing the song.

736
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,580
I want to be like Christ, and we make the statement.

737
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:42,380
This evening, sanctification, there's an example, there's an expectation.

738
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,420
How is our journey with Christ?

739
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:51,580
The believers in Hebrews, they're corrected for the fact that at the time they ought to

740
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:56,140
be teachers, they were in need that someone teach them.

741
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:05,940
The people in Corinth, their position practically, their practice did not align with their position.

742
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,100
Positionally sanctified, but practically they were carnal.

743
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:14,420
I hope that it would be said of us that we are seeking to walk worthy and please God,

744
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:19,020
that we're letting God have his way in and through our lives, that we would be sanctified.

745
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:24,700
As I mentioned, 2 Timothy, and meet for the master's use.

746
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:29,460
It would be a vessel that's clean and pure, and that God can use us for his honor and

747
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,460
for his glory.

748
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,460
Let's pray.

749
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,460
Father, we love you.

750
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,460
We thank you for loving us.

751
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,619
Thank you for the opportunity to study your Word tonight.

752
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:38,740
I pray, God, that you'd bless, help us, Lord, to draw closer to thee.

753
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:42,820
Help us to allow your Spirit to work in our lives, to have your will and way.

754
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,700
Help us to be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

755
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,700
Help us to walk as we ought to walk.

756
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,059
I pray that you'd bless our time of prayer.

757
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:51,059
We thank you for the privilege.

758
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:55,059
We give you the honor and glory for all that you'll do for us in Christ's name we pray.

759
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:55,740
Amen.
