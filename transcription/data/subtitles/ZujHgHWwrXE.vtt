WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
Continue, amen, continue, don't give up,

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.460
don't throw in the towel, continue.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.279
And we have a great cause, we have a great savior,

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:13.239
and we are on the winning side, amen.

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:14.760
Continue, continue.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.540
First Thessalonians chapter number five this evening.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.379
This is our 15th lesson through this portion of scripture.

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:24.920
I've titled the series Walk Worthy, Please God.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.319
And here on Wednesday evenings,

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.920
we've had the opportunity to go through this bullet point

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.739
if you will, type of instruction

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.240
that begins in verse number 12

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.680
and goes through the end of the chapter.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.400
We do find that some of these verses

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.680
we'll look at in the next few weeks

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.840
have some greetings and so on and so forth.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.119
We find that in second Thessalonians chapter number three,

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:48.200
there's also some similar type of instruction

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.040
at the end of the book.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.119
And so once we finish here

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:52.180
in the fifth chapter of first Thessalonians,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.919
we will go over to the third chapter of second Thessalonians

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:58.040
and continue our study of Walk Worthy, Please God.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.220
I hope that your heart's desire is to please the Lord.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.599
I hope that you desire in your life

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:06.120
that I want my life to count for Christ

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.440
and I want Christ to be pleased with me.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.279
You know, it's interesting,

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:12.120
in the book of first Corinthians in the 10th chapter,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.760
you read that God tells us

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.760
of the children of Israel in the Old Testament

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.919
that with many of them, God was not well pleased.

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:23.040
That's a statement of scripture that really frightens me

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.080
because I would not want it to be said of me

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.199
or of us corporately as a church

00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:30.279
that God is not well pleased with us.

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:31.959
I want God to be pleased with me.

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:33.680
I hope that you have that same desire

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.239
and corporately as a church,

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:37.739
we desire God's blessing upon us.

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:39.839
We find that as we look at this passage of scripture,

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:42.559
the instruction that's been given as we've gone through it,

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:45.480
I've mentioned often that it's concise instruction,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.919
it's bullet point type instruction.

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:50.959
And we find that with each of the pieces of instruction

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:55.959
that God gives us, there's a response of the hearer.

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:59.319
We often say that we ought to be doers of the word

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.040
and not hearers only.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.000
And so this instruction is given to us

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.059
not so that we can answer a quiz question,

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:06.680
not so that we can say that we have,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.119
no, it's so that we would apply it in our lives,

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.320
that we would be doers of the word and not hearers only.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.360
Why do I say that?

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.759
Because we come to verse 23,

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:17.759
the verse that we'll be studying this evening,

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:19.399
and the subject matter that is before us

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:21.520
is that really of sanctification.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.740
And I believe that as you look at the passage of scripture,

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.940
verses 12 down through verse 22,

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.539
that as God is giving all of this instruction,

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:31.460
it's pointing to this is the process,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.020
if you will, of sanctification.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.419
Now, it's interesting to me,

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:40.419
the subject of salvation is often discussed,

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.100
as it should be, amen?

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.500
I'm thankful to be saved by the grace of God, aren't you?

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.259
I'm thankful to know Christ as my savior, I'm heaven bound.

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:50.380
I'm thankful that I can have confidence.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.460
I spoke about that on Sunday evening, and what a blessing.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.419
And I'm so thankful for the subject of salvation

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:01.419
that we can regularly discuss the truth of God's salvation

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.059
and how we can be saved and know that we're saved

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:08.779
and how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation,

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:10.160
the writer of Hebrews says,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.899
and no doubt it's a precious subject.

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:15.059
But I would say to you this evening

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:17.820
that the subject of sanctification

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.380
is also of significant importance.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.339
I would say that the subject of sanctification

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.979
must be understood,

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:28.699
but it's not one that we speak about maybe as often

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:31.100
as we speak about salvation.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.100
God saved you, if you're saved this evening,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.059
God saved you by his grace.

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:40.820
And as a new creature, we are to be sanctified.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.539
Now, let me explain this evening

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:44.979
because it's important for us to understand

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:46.820
the biblical aspects of the subject

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.460
that is before us this evening of sanctification.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.380
I've titled the message simply that, sanctification.

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:53.820
The Bible says in verse 23,

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.820
and the very God of peace sanctify you wholly, completely.

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:03.660
And I pray God, your whole spirit and soul and body

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.100
be preserved blameless unto the coming

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.100
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.699
As we look at this verse of scripture

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:14.100
and begin to think about the subject matter

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.619
of sanctification, we understand that the Bible

00:04:16.619 --> 00:04:19.980
gives us really some aspects of sanctification

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.480
that are important for us to understand.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.160
The first aspect of sanctification

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.980
that's important for us to understand

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.320
is that of positional sanctification.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.320
The Bible says of the believers in Corinth,

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.980
now we know some things about the church in Corinth, right?

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.920
The church in Corinth is a carnal church, do you agree?

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.440
The Bible says that Paul says to them in the third chapter,

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.920
I can't speak unto you as unto spiritual,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.540
but as unto carnal, why?

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.619
They were immature spiritually, they were babes,

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:50.079
they had divisions and contentions and so on and so forth.

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:54.760
So they were a people in the church in Corinth

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.880
that had some carnal issues, some problems,

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.399
but you know that God refers to them as being sanctified.

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:04.359
In 1 Corinthians chapter number one,

00:05:04.359 --> 00:05:06.359
if you wanna run over there very quickly,

00:05:06.359 --> 00:05:08.799
I want you to notice that as Paul was writing

00:05:08.799 --> 00:05:10.880
the introduction unto the inspiration of the Holy Spirit

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.079
of God to these members of the church at Corinth,

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:18.559
we find here that God is saying to these individuals

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:20.739
in verse number two, unto the church of God,

00:05:20.739 --> 00:05:24.000
which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.679
in Christ Jesus, called to be saints,

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:28.239
with all that in every place,

00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:30.440
call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord,

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.859
both theirs and ours.

00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:37.040
In chapter number six, he says this in verse number 11,

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.079
he says, and such were some of you.

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:39.959
What's he talking about?

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:41.600
Well, he goes through in verse nine and 10,

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.720
we don't have time to read all of it,

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.700
but he mentions a number of wicked lifestyles

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.200
and he says, and such were some of you,

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.359
but aren't you thankful for that great conjunction?

00:05:50.359 --> 00:05:53.399
Ye are washed, but ye are sanctified,

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:56.320
but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.600
and by the Spirit of our God.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.880
I would say of those in Corinth,

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.839
that the reality is that there were some,

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:06.519
all of the believers in Corinth

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:08.859
were sanctified positionally.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.640
But not every believer in Corinth

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.720
was sanctified practically.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.320
Sometimes we use the term progressive sanctification,

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.200
this ongoing process of becoming more like Christ.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.679
We find in the book of Ephesians,

00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:26.320
it's a great book to study

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.000
with regard to the subject matter of sanctification.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.600
The first three chapters of the book of Ephesians

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.500
deal specifically with our position in Christ.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.160
In fact, you find that in Christ is used repeatedly

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.720
in those first few chapters of the book of Ephesians, why?

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.079
Because that is our position in Christ.

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:47.519
Then you come to chapter number four and five and six,

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:50.640
and you start reading this word about walk.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.679
Now that this is your position

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:55.320
and we've established your position in Christ,

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.920
here is practically what it's supposed to look like.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.160
Does that make sense?

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.399
And so we find this evening,

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:05.160
if we were to look at some biblical phrases

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.119
in the book of Ephesians in the fourth chapter,

00:07:07.119 --> 00:07:09.720
the book of Colossians in the third chapter,

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.760
in both of those chapters,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.559
there's this put off and put on

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:16.500
that you'll read of.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.480
Put off these things, what are these things?

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.720
The works of the flesh.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.160
Put on, what are these things?

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.640
The fruit of the spirit, the obedience to Christ.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.160
And you'll see this put off, put on

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.279
that you find in those two portions of scripture.

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:32.000
And that's what I would refer to

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.500
as being practical or progressive sanctification.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.200
The word sanctify is a word

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.799
that means to cleanse or purify, to make holy,

00:07:40.799 --> 00:07:43.239
but that could be referred to a number of different things.

00:07:43.239 --> 00:07:44.399
You look in the Old Testament,

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:46.579
you talk about the furniture in the tabernacle,

00:07:46.579 --> 00:07:50.839
it was sanctified, it was set apart for a sacred use.

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:52.480
But I want you to understand this definition.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.760
I thought it was a great definition

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.160
from Noah Webster's 1828.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.679
It says this, here's how he defined the word sanctify,

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:04.679
to make holy by detaching the affections

00:08:04.799 --> 00:08:08.480
from the world and its defilements

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:13.480
and exalting them to a supreme love to God.

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:16.500
I think it's a great, great definition.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.500
To then piggyback on sanctify, then sanctification,

00:08:21.559 --> 00:08:22.679
he says it this way,

00:08:22.679 --> 00:08:24.720
here's how he defines it in that dictionary,

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.519
the act of God's grace,

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:29.380
by which the affections of men are purified

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.400
or alienated from sin and the world

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.200
and exalted to a supreme love to God.

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:41.599
I said at the beginning of the message

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:44.200
that the subject of salvation is often discussed

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.619
as it should be,

00:08:45.619 --> 00:08:47.320
but the subject matter of sanctification

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.000
sometimes isn't discussed as often.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.460
Can I tell you that it's missing in our churches today

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.659
this understanding of sanctification

00:08:55.659 --> 00:08:58.200
and what God's plan, and let me say it this way,

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.200
God's will is for every child of his to be sanctified.

00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:07.000
To be sanctified.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.299
Some people say, man, I'm saved

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:09.979
and I'm going to heaven

00:09:09.979 --> 00:09:11.460
and I can just do whatever I want to do.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.099
I can live however I want to live.

00:09:13.099 --> 00:09:16.640
I can just whatever because, man, I'm going to heaven.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.820
That's not the kind of salvation I got.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.659
Amen, I'm just being honest with you.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.659
When I got saved, the Bible says in Christ,

00:09:24.659 --> 00:09:25.940
he's a new creature.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:26.859
Old things are passed away.

00:09:26.859 --> 00:09:28.559
Behold, all things are become new.

00:09:29.479 --> 00:09:31.239
Do I still have the desires of the flesh?

00:09:31.239 --> 00:09:32.299
All of us do.

00:09:33.219 --> 00:09:34.059
But I'll tell you what,

00:09:34.059 --> 00:09:36.700
when you start understanding the truth of this book

00:09:36.739 --> 00:09:38.460
and the Holy Spirit of God

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.280
who indwells every child of God works in your life,

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.099
you understand the process of sanctification.

00:09:45.099 --> 00:09:47.859
All of a sudden, the things that you did

00:09:47.859 --> 00:09:49.059
before you got saved,

00:09:49.059 --> 00:09:51.140
now the Holy Spirit of God is convicting you

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.539
for doing those things after you got saved.

00:09:53.539 --> 00:09:54.380
Why?

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.700
Because you're a new creature, amen?

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.820
And we understand this.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:09:59.979
And listen, we have,

00:09:59.979 --> 00:10:04.099
in our world today, this situation where

00:10:04.099 --> 00:10:06.899
this subject of sanctification is really foreign

00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:08.019
to Christendom.

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:10.259
Man, just live how you wanna live.

00:10:10.259 --> 00:10:11.899
I mean, God understands.

00:10:11.899 --> 00:10:14.439
Listen, God wants you to be happy.

00:10:14.439 --> 00:10:16.339
Where did you find that in the Bible?

00:10:17.579 --> 00:10:19.299
I mean, honestly.

00:10:19.299 --> 00:10:21.299
I've not read, no, I understand the Bible

00:10:21.299 --> 00:10:23.459
used the word happy, used the word blessed,

00:10:23.459 --> 00:10:25.739
but listen, your definition of what you think

00:10:25.739 --> 00:10:28.219
makes you happy and what God talks about

00:10:28.219 --> 00:10:31.139
being blessed or happy are different.

00:10:31.139 --> 00:10:32.339
Amen?

00:10:32.339 --> 00:10:35.179
It makes me happy to live in this promiscuous lifestyle.

00:10:35.179 --> 00:10:38.139
That's not what God meant for you.

00:10:38.139 --> 00:10:40.179
Amen, can we agree tonight?

00:10:40.179 --> 00:10:43.419
And so we understand, listen, to be separate

00:10:43.419 --> 00:10:46.759
from profane things and dedicated to God.

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:49.259
The same Greek word in the New Testament

00:10:49.259 --> 00:10:52.459
is often translated, the same Greek word

00:10:52.459 --> 00:10:54.359
that's translated sanctification

00:10:54.359 --> 00:10:57.019
is often translated holiness.

00:10:57.019 --> 00:10:58.299
It's the same Greek word.

00:10:58.299 --> 00:10:59.119
They're synonymous.

00:10:59.119 --> 00:11:00.179
As you read through the scriptures,

00:11:00.179 --> 00:11:02.419
you'll see those words, you'll see that.

00:11:02.419 --> 00:11:06.059
Someone said this, a preacher of yesteryear,

00:11:06.059 --> 00:11:07.099
and he said it this way.

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:09.299
Salvation is the miracle of a moment.

00:11:10.619 --> 00:11:13.039
Sanctification is the process of a lifetime.

00:11:14.619 --> 00:11:16.619
I think it's a good quote.

00:11:16.619 --> 00:11:18.339
I'm thankful to be saved.

00:11:18.339 --> 00:11:21.339
I'm thankful that positionally I'm sanctified.

00:11:21.339 --> 00:11:22.499
I'm seated in the heavenlies.

00:11:22.499 --> 00:11:24.059
I mean, positionally.

00:11:24.099 --> 00:11:27.859
But practically, it's a process of a lifetime.

00:11:28.859 --> 00:11:30.259
You know what it is?

00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:33.099
It is daily abiding in Christ.

00:11:33.099 --> 00:11:33.919
You know what it is?

00:11:33.919 --> 00:11:35.859
It's walking in the spirit.

00:11:35.859 --> 00:11:36.699
You know what it is?

00:11:36.699 --> 00:11:39.239
It's crucifying the old man with its affections

00:11:39.239 --> 00:11:41.219
and its lust, it's understanding,

00:11:41.219 --> 00:11:44.379
as Paul says to the believers there in Colossae,

00:11:44.379 --> 00:11:47.139
that we're to mortify our members.

00:11:48.059 --> 00:11:49.659
If ye then be risen with Christ,

00:11:49.659 --> 00:11:53.139
seek those things which are above, amen.

00:11:53.139 --> 00:11:54.979
And it's that process of sanctification.

00:11:54.979 --> 00:11:58.339
It's yielding to God's work in your life.

00:11:58.339 --> 00:12:00.219
It's really the subject of surrender.

00:12:01.419 --> 00:12:03.059
As we look at this passage of Scripture

00:12:03.059 --> 00:12:06.259
in 1 Thessalonians chapter five and verse 23,

00:12:06.259 --> 00:12:08.499
we find that the Apostle Paul, being used of God,

00:12:08.499 --> 00:12:11.979
gives all of this instruction.

00:12:11.979 --> 00:12:14.399
He's giving them instruction with regard

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:16.019
to how they can walk worthy,

00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:18.179
how they can please God with their lives.

00:12:18.179 --> 00:12:19.859
And he goes through all of this,

00:12:19.859 --> 00:12:21.859
and we've studied it now for 14 weeks,

00:12:21.859 --> 00:12:24.979
and we've gone through all of these pieces of instruction,

00:12:24.979 --> 00:12:27.179
and we find that we come to verse 23,

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:28.419
and notice what he says,

00:12:28.419 --> 00:12:30.979
and the very God of peace,

00:12:30.979 --> 00:12:33.139
by the way, aren't you thankful for the peace of God?

00:12:33.139 --> 00:12:36.059
He is the God of peace, as it says here.

00:12:36.059 --> 00:12:38.659
Sanctify you wholly.

00:12:39.939 --> 00:12:41.979
Notice, it's the entirety of us.

00:12:41.979 --> 00:12:43.459
It's not to separate these,

00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:45.619
but to talk about the whole of our being.

00:12:45.619 --> 00:12:49.419
I pray, God, your whole spirit, soul, and body

00:12:49.419 --> 00:12:51.659
be preserved blameless

00:12:51.659 --> 00:12:55.859
under the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:57.579
On Sunday morning, I preached a message

00:12:57.579 --> 00:13:00.499
about the qualifications for pastors and for deacons,

00:13:00.499 --> 00:13:01.779
and I made this statement

00:13:01.779 --> 00:13:03.739
in the introduction of that message

00:13:03.739 --> 00:13:06.819
that though that passage of Scripture specifically

00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:10.619
is addressing the qualifications for those two offices,

00:13:10.619 --> 00:13:15.619
that the information, the qualifications listed therein

00:13:15.619 --> 00:13:19.779
are really what every child of God should attain to be.

00:13:19.779 --> 00:13:21.099
Amen?

00:13:21.099 --> 00:13:22.819
It's not that we attain to be that

00:13:22.819 --> 00:13:24.859
so that we can hold an office.

00:13:24.859 --> 00:13:27.659
No, it's that that's what we should desire to be.

00:13:27.659 --> 00:13:30.979
We should desire that what is said in those qualifications

00:13:30.979 --> 00:13:33.459
would be true of every one of us.

00:13:33.459 --> 00:13:35.379
Why? Because we're a child of God.

00:13:36.619 --> 00:13:38.379
As we look at this passage of Scripture,

00:13:38.379 --> 00:13:40.539
and we notice the subject of sanctification,

00:13:40.539 --> 00:13:41.779
two thoughts for you this evening.

00:13:41.899 --> 00:13:45.979
Number one, there is an example.

00:13:45.979 --> 00:13:47.579
Number one, there's an example.

00:13:47.579 --> 00:13:49.619
The greatest example in every area,

00:13:49.619 --> 00:13:53.579
any area of your life or my life is the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:13:53.579 --> 00:13:57.279
We're gonna deal with that last in this particular point

00:13:57.279 --> 00:13:59.259
because the reality is that sometimes

00:13:59.259 --> 00:14:01.939
as I've had interactions with people over the years,

00:14:01.939 --> 00:14:05.219
and I've shown, listen, Peter says in 1 Peter

00:14:05.219 --> 00:14:06.759
that Christ left us an example

00:14:06.759 --> 00:14:08.539
that we should follow his steps.

00:14:08.539 --> 00:14:11.579
But some would argue, well, he's God, he's perfect,

00:14:12.379 --> 00:14:14.579
and I just can't attain to that, okay?

00:14:14.579 --> 00:14:16.979
And I understand the argument,

00:14:16.979 --> 00:14:20.539
but God is, he has given us an example

00:14:20.539 --> 00:14:21.499
that we should follow his steps,

00:14:21.499 --> 00:14:25.659
and the best example that we could ever go to in Scripture

00:14:25.659 --> 00:14:28.259
is the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:14:28.259 --> 00:14:30.779
But I find that even in the text of Scripture

00:14:30.779 --> 00:14:33.259
that in here as we think about there's an example

00:14:33.259 --> 00:14:36.059
that the apostle Paul was an example

00:14:36.059 --> 00:14:38.579
of the truth that he's setting forth.

00:14:38.579 --> 00:14:40.939
Notice what the Bible says a few chapters before

00:14:41.299 --> 00:14:42.139
to the same that he's writing to

00:14:42.139 --> 00:14:44.139
in 1 Thessalonians chapter two.

00:14:44.139 --> 00:14:45.699
Notice what the Bible says.

00:14:47.459 --> 00:14:49.259
In 1 Thessalonians chapter two, of course,

00:14:49.259 --> 00:14:50.619
Paul was used of the Lord

00:14:50.619 --> 00:14:52.019
during the second missionary journey

00:14:52.019 --> 00:14:54.879
to see this church at Thessalonica established.

00:14:54.879 --> 00:14:58.299
God allowed him, God called him, God equipped him,

00:14:58.299 --> 00:15:00.019
and this church is established.

00:15:00.019 --> 00:15:02.379
As best we can tell as you read through the book of Acts,

00:15:02.379 --> 00:15:05.939
it was a short period of time that Paul was in Thessalonica.

00:15:05.939 --> 00:15:07.819
They ran him out of town just as they did

00:15:07.819 --> 00:15:09.979
in previous places where he ministered,

00:15:09.979 --> 00:15:11.859
and we find that he's not there long,

00:15:11.859 --> 00:15:13.699
but there's a church established.

00:15:13.699 --> 00:15:15.379
Paul, as we mentioned at the very beginning

00:15:15.379 --> 00:15:19.139
of our study here, he was yearning for these individuals,

00:15:19.139 --> 00:15:21.539
concerned for them of how they're doing,

00:15:21.539 --> 00:15:23.919
and notice what he says in the second chapter

00:15:23.919 --> 00:15:25.259
in verse number 10.

00:15:25.259 --> 00:15:28.559
He says, ye are witnesses.

00:15:28.559 --> 00:15:31.059
Not only were they the members of the church

00:15:31.059 --> 00:15:34.099
that he's writing to, but he says, and God also.

00:15:35.099 --> 00:15:40.099
How wholly and justly and unblameably

00:15:41.739 --> 00:15:46.739
we behaved ourselves among you that believe.

00:15:47.899 --> 00:15:51.259
As ye know how we exhorted and comforted

00:15:51.259 --> 00:15:55.139
and charged every one of you as a father doth his children

00:15:55.139 --> 00:15:58.219
that ye would walk worthy of God

00:15:58.219 --> 00:16:03.059
who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.

00:16:03.099 --> 00:16:05.819
Paul was not simply preaching a message

00:16:05.819 --> 00:16:08.139
to a church about sanctification

00:16:08.139 --> 00:16:12.739
that he himself was not applying in his own life.

00:16:12.739 --> 00:16:13.779
That's important.

00:16:13.779 --> 00:16:16.059
You've heard people say, I've said it

00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:17.179
from the pulpit plenty of times,

00:16:17.179 --> 00:16:19.899
the message of your lips is more powerful than the,

00:16:19.899 --> 00:16:22.219
or excuse me, the message of your life is more powerful

00:16:22.219 --> 00:16:24.379
than the message of your lips.

00:16:24.379 --> 00:16:27.699
What you do is much more impactful than what you say.

00:16:29.299 --> 00:16:31.059
You can say whatever you wanna say.

00:16:32.059 --> 00:16:34.099
That's why Paul said when he was writing

00:16:34.099 --> 00:16:35.379
to the believers in Philippi,

00:16:35.379 --> 00:16:37.619
the things that you've heard,

00:16:37.619 --> 00:16:41.139
but he says, and seen in me, do.

00:16:41.139 --> 00:16:45.099
He didn't just preach a message, he lived a message.

00:16:45.099 --> 00:16:47.339
In fact, he says it this way to the believers in Corinth

00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:49.619
in 1 Corinthians 11, one, you don't need to turn there,

00:16:49.619 --> 00:16:51.979
but he tells them to be followers of him,

00:16:51.979 --> 00:16:55.539
but it's based upon the fact that he is a follower of God.

00:16:56.659 --> 00:16:57.539
That's important.

00:16:58.499 --> 00:17:01.259
You don't blindly follow someone

00:17:01.259 --> 00:17:03.859
unless you know that that someone is following God.

00:17:05.539 --> 00:17:09.299
Paul says this in 2 Timothy 3 in verse number 10,

00:17:09.299 --> 00:17:12.179
again, with regard to his example,

00:17:12.179 --> 00:17:14.619
he says, and we don't have time to look through all of it,

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:17.339
but he's talking about the last days

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:19.659
and the perilous times, and he's going through

00:17:19.659 --> 00:17:21.779
and he's giving some examples,

00:17:21.779 --> 00:17:24.179
and he comes to verse number 10,

00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:29.419
and he says this, but thou hast fully known my doctrine,

00:17:29.579 --> 00:17:32.059
but then notice what he says, matter of life.

00:17:33.939 --> 00:17:36.899
You better know the doctrine of the spiritual leader,

00:17:36.899 --> 00:17:39.379
but he says, you've not only known my doctrine,

00:17:39.379 --> 00:17:41.179
but my matter of life.

00:17:41.179 --> 00:17:43.899
Paul understood the importance of sanctification.

00:17:43.899 --> 00:17:45.739
He understood that it was important that,

00:17:45.739 --> 00:17:47.019
listen, he's the one that writes,

00:17:47.019 --> 00:17:49.499
I am crucified with Christ, I die daily,

00:17:49.499 --> 00:17:51.299
walk in the spirit so that you would not

00:17:51.299 --> 00:17:52.539
fulfill the lust of the flesh.

00:17:52.539 --> 00:17:56.059
He's living that, and he says that you have

00:17:56.059 --> 00:18:00.579
fully known my doctrine, matter of life,

00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:05.179
purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity,

00:18:05.179 --> 00:18:08.539
patience, persecutions, afflictions,

00:18:08.539 --> 00:18:10.859
which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium,

00:18:10.859 --> 00:18:14.219
at Lystra, what persecutions I endured,

00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:17.019
but out of them all the Lord delivered me.

00:18:17.019 --> 00:18:17.939
Hallelujah.

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:20.659
Paul says you've known.

00:18:20.659 --> 00:18:23.499
See, Paul was an example as he writes to these believers

00:18:23.499 --> 00:18:26.899
in Thessalonica about the importance of sanctification.

00:18:26.899 --> 00:18:29.419
We understand that Paul was an example.

00:18:29.419 --> 00:18:31.459
The greatest example, of course, the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:18:31.459 --> 00:18:33.179
I mentioned that at the very beginning.

00:18:33.179 --> 00:18:35.459
The Bible tells us that the just for the unjust,

00:18:35.459 --> 00:18:37.500
there's no guile found in him.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.339
He's perfect, he's sinless, he did the will of the Father.

00:18:40.339 --> 00:18:41.859
We understand, the Bible says,

00:18:41.859 --> 00:18:43.699
God says in the book of Leviticus,

00:18:43.699 --> 00:18:45.659
we read it again in the book of 1 Peter,

00:18:45.659 --> 00:18:47.219
that we are to be holy, why?

00:18:47.219 --> 00:18:48.820
Because he is holy.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.539
In fact, look at 1 Peter chapter one,

00:18:51.419 --> 00:18:53.979
if you will, in verses 13 through 16,

00:18:53.979 --> 00:18:56.380
and notice what the Bible says with regard

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.859
to this matter of holiness or sanctification.

00:18:59.859 --> 00:19:03.699
Notice, Peter says in verse number 13,

00:19:03.699 --> 00:19:05.859
1 Peter one and verse 13,

00:19:05.859 --> 00:19:08.339
wherefore, gird up the loins of your mind,

00:19:08.339 --> 00:19:11.579
be sober and hope to the end for the grace

00:19:11.579 --> 00:19:13.179
that is to be brought unto you

00:19:13.179 --> 00:19:15.380
at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

00:19:16.219 --> 00:19:18.619
As obedient children,

00:19:18.619 --> 00:19:21.659
not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust

00:19:21.659 --> 00:19:23.339
in your ignorance,

00:19:23.339 --> 00:19:27.219
but as he which hath called you is holy,

00:19:27.219 --> 00:19:32.219
so be ye holy in all manner of conversation,

00:19:32.539 --> 00:19:36.699
because it is written, be holy for I am holy.

00:19:38.179 --> 00:19:40.940
What a great charge, what a great piece of instruction

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.219
with regard to holiness and sanctification.

00:19:43.219 --> 00:19:46.139
And we understand again that there were false teachers

00:19:46.139 --> 00:19:48.339
during the time of the writing of the New Testament,

00:19:49.059 --> 00:19:50.299
and we understand that the false teacher

00:19:50.299 --> 00:19:51.979
still exists to this very day,

00:19:51.979 --> 00:19:56.179
and they would deny the truth of God's word,

00:19:56.179 --> 00:19:57.739
and we find that they would creep in

00:19:57.739 --> 00:19:59.219
and they would deny the grace,

00:19:59.219 --> 00:20:00.059
they would turn.

00:20:00.059 --> 00:20:03.799
excuse me, the grace of God into lasciviousness,

00:20:03.799 --> 00:20:05.739
according to the book of Jude.

00:20:05.739 --> 00:20:07.139
Unbridled lust.

00:20:07.139 --> 00:20:10.559
Listen, you can find today, antinomianism is popular.

00:20:10.559 --> 00:20:11.399
You can read of it.

00:20:11.399 --> 00:20:12.559
Just, man, you're saved by grace.

00:20:12.559 --> 00:20:14.119
You do what you wanna do.

00:20:14.119 --> 00:20:14.959
We're not under the law.

00:20:14.959 --> 00:20:16.859
Look, I'm glad that we're not under the law.

00:20:16.859 --> 00:20:18.679
Christ fulfilled the law.

00:20:18.679 --> 00:20:21.159
But I said this a few weeks ago.

00:20:21.159 --> 00:20:23.519
The standard is actually higher.

00:20:23.519 --> 00:20:26.879
In the Old Testament, remember, he said, do no evil.

00:20:27.839 --> 00:20:29.919
But we come to 1 Thessalonians 5.22,

00:20:29.919 --> 00:20:34.519
and he says, abstain from all appearance of evil.

00:20:34.519 --> 00:20:37.719
It doesn't mean that we should engage in evil.

00:20:37.719 --> 00:20:41.279
We understand the instruction to do no evil still stands,

00:20:41.279 --> 00:20:43.479
but he takes it to a higher plane,

00:20:43.479 --> 00:20:45.759
and he says, not only are you to do no evil,

00:20:45.759 --> 00:20:49.139
but you're to abstain from all appearance of evil.

00:20:50.679 --> 00:20:52.079
Wow.

00:20:52.079 --> 00:20:53.719
There's an example.

00:20:53.719 --> 00:20:55.159
Paul was not perfect.

00:20:55.159 --> 00:20:57.019
He was a man like you and like me.

00:20:58.519 --> 00:20:59.559
He was a human being.

00:21:00.919 --> 00:21:02.359
There are times in which I've heard people say,

00:21:02.359 --> 00:21:04.479
man, I wanna be used like Paul.

00:21:05.879 --> 00:21:07.439
You better read what Paul did

00:21:08.439 --> 00:21:11.360
in order to be used the way that he was used.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.399
He was surrendered, he was yielded,

00:21:13.399 --> 00:21:15.519
he was crucified with Christ.

00:21:15.519 --> 00:21:17.879
He was a man that was fully surrendered to God,

00:21:17.879 --> 00:21:20.279
and therefore God used him in the manner in which he did.

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:21.680
We can read of other missionaries

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.759
and preachers of yesteryear that God used in a great way.

00:21:24.759 --> 00:21:27.559
God is no respecter of persons.

00:21:27.559 --> 00:21:30.279
God will use you if you're usable.

00:21:32.199 --> 00:21:35.199
God will use you if you're usable.

00:21:35.199 --> 00:21:37.659
Understand God doesn't use dirty vessels.

00:21:41.119 --> 00:21:45.879
We're to be sanctified and meet for the master's use.

00:21:45.879 --> 00:21:48.079
Sanctification is important.

00:21:48.079 --> 00:21:50.159
Doesn't matter, man, just,

00:21:50.159 --> 00:21:52.159
remember the girl that was saying

00:21:52.159 --> 00:21:53.599
these are the servants of the Lord

00:21:53.599 --> 00:21:55.500
that tell us about the way of salvation,

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:59.299
and Paul rebuked and caused that demon,

00:21:59.299 --> 00:22:01.619
was it a right message?

00:22:01.619 --> 00:22:02.619
It was the right message.

00:22:02.619 --> 00:22:05.860
They were the servants of the most high God,

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:09.819
and they were speaking the way of salvation.

00:22:09.819 --> 00:22:12.619
It was the right message, it was just the wrong vessel.

00:22:13.619 --> 00:22:14.819
Amen.

00:22:14.819 --> 00:22:16.080
So notice there's an example,

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.099
but notice number two, there's an expectation.

00:22:19.099 --> 00:22:20.259
There's an expectation.

00:22:20.259 --> 00:22:22.099
I believe that God expects for his children

00:22:22.099 --> 00:22:24.139
to walk as children of light.

00:22:24.139 --> 00:22:27.059
God expects for us to allow his word

00:22:27.059 --> 00:22:29.259
and the Holy Spirit of God to work in us

00:22:29.259 --> 00:22:32.779
and to conform us to the image of Jesus Christ,

00:22:32.779 --> 00:22:33.619
his dear son.

00:22:33.619 --> 00:22:37.139
In fact, Romans 8 and verse 29 tells us that very thing,

00:22:37.139 --> 00:22:41.940
that this is really the understanding of the Christian life.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.739
We often read verse 28, I mentioned on Sunday night,

00:22:44.739 --> 00:22:46.539
and we know that all things work together for good

00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:47.419
to them that love God,

00:22:47.419 --> 00:22:49.619
to them who are the called according to his purpose.

00:22:49.619 --> 00:22:52.020
Verse 29 says, for whom he did foreknow,

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.339
he also did predestinate to what?

00:22:54.339 --> 00:22:57.699
To be conformed to the image of his son,

00:22:57.699 --> 00:23:00.500
that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.860
We find that as you continue to read,

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.500
and even as you think about the truth

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:06.520
of the book of Romans,

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.699
if you were to back up into the sixth chapter

00:23:08.699 --> 00:23:11.119
and talk about how you were the servants of sin,

00:23:11.119 --> 00:23:13.380
but now you're the servants of righteousness,

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:16.639
you can read in verse 19 and then again in verse 22

00:23:16.639 --> 00:23:21.639
about the truth of holiness, fruits unto holiness.

00:23:21.839 --> 00:23:22.720
Guess what that word is?

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.279
It's sanctification, it's the same word.

00:23:25.279 --> 00:23:29.039
And we find this evening that there's been this change,

00:23:29.039 --> 00:23:32.059
salvation brings this change, we're a new creature.

00:23:32.059 --> 00:23:34.360
Listen, I'm thankful that Christianity,

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.739
the gospel, is not just about reformation.

00:23:39.279 --> 00:23:41.119
It's about transformation.

00:23:42.639 --> 00:23:44.899
Transformation, it's radical.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:47.759
I'm a new creature in Christ.

00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:50.479
Listen, I don't think like I used to think.

00:23:52.639 --> 00:23:55.080
We shouldn't, why?

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:59.660
Because we had a worldview that was a void of God.

00:24:01.839 --> 00:24:04.119
And there's a radical change

00:24:04.119 --> 00:24:08.279
in this transforming gospel of Jesus Christ.

00:24:08.279 --> 00:24:12.080
And his expectation is that his people

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.959
would be conformed to the image of his son,

00:24:13.959 --> 00:24:16.559
that we'd be like Jesus.

00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:20.119
Why did they call them Christians first at Antioch?

00:24:20.119 --> 00:24:21.279
Well, they called them Christians

00:24:21.919 --> 00:24:23.320
because they were like Christ.

00:24:25.239 --> 00:24:30.200
A well-known leader of a former, another religion

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.239
said of Christians, I like your Christ,

00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:36.660
but I don't like your Christians

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:40.540
because your Christians are nothing like your Christ.

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:41.940
What an indictment.

00:24:43.399 --> 00:24:45.359
Because we're to be like Christ.

00:24:45.359 --> 00:24:47.739
Notice what the Bible says in 1 Thessalonians chapter four.

00:24:47.739 --> 00:24:50.459
We kept within this book to look at the example

00:24:50.459 --> 00:24:54.100
of the apostle Paul when he talked about their behavior,

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.660
their own sanctification in chapter two.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.820
But now look at what the Bible says in chapter four

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:02.399
with regard to this charge that he gives.

00:25:02.399 --> 00:25:03.500
Notice in verse number one,

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.940
furthermore then we beseech you brethren

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.540
and exhort you by the Lord Jesus

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.299
that as you have received of us,

00:25:10.299 --> 00:25:15.299
notice this phrase, how ye ought to walk and to please God

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.619
so ye would abound more and more.

00:25:18.619 --> 00:25:21.579
It wasn't enough for them just to have the instruction.

00:25:21.579 --> 00:25:23.579
They had to do something with it.

00:25:25.019 --> 00:25:29.040
It's not enough for someone to just know about Jesus.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.820
They got to accept him as their personal savior.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.459
The conversation with someone recently

00:25:33.459 --> 00:25:34.700
and I was talking about the Lord

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.179
and I asked her about heaven and I'm like,

00:25:36.179 --> 00:25:38.100
oh yeah, man, I grew up in and he kind of went

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.820
on this whole rabbit trail of where he grew up

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:40.799
and the times he used to have

00:25:40.799 --> 00:25:42.239
and he doesn't go to church anymore,

00:25:42.239 --> 00:25:44.459
but I talk to God all the time and I cuss with God

00:25:44.459 --> 00:25:47.019
and I do this with God and God seems to be okay with it.

00:25:47.019 --> 00:25:49.579
And I'm like, I don't know what God you're talking to,

00:25:49.579 --> 00:25:53.940
but that's not my God, amen?

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:57.500
What happened when Isaiah saw the glory of God?

00:25:58.639 --> 00:26:01.139
He fell to his face.

00:26:01.139 --> 00:26:03.419
My God, your God is a holy God.

00:26:05.619 --> 00:26:08.299
We find that he says that you would abound more and more.

00:26:08.299 --> 00:26:11.059
Look at verse two, for ye know what commandments

00:26:11.059 --> 00:26:13.820
we gave you by the Lord Jesus.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.059
Verse number three, for this,

00:26:16.059 --> 00:26:17.579
you might want to underline this,

00:26:17.579 --> 00:26:21.380
for this is the will of God,

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.899
even your sanctification,

00:26:24.899 --> 00:26:27.639
that ye should abstain from fornication,

00:26:27.639 --> 00:26:31.220
that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:35.779
in sanctification and honor.

00:26:35.779 --> 00:26:38.019
For God, skip down to verse number seven, if you will,

00:26:38.019 --> 00:26:42.619
for God hath not called us unto uncleanness,

00:26:42.619 --> 00:26:45.899
but unto holiness.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:48.779
Praise the Lord.

00:26:48.779 --> 00:26:50.559
And listen, here's the amazing thing.

00:26:50.559 --> 00:26:53.239
It's not a work that you can do.

00:26:53.239 --> 00:26:56.059
It's a work that God does in you.

00:26:56.059 --> 00:26:59.940
As you yield yourself to him, as you get into this word,

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.779
as you hear the teaching and preaching of God's word,

00:27:03.779 --> 00:27:06.660
as you apply the teaching and preaching of God's word,

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.100
God is doing this work.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.179
Notice he says, and the very God of peace

00:27:11.179 --> 00:27:13.059
sanctify you wholly.

00:27:13.059 --> 00:27:15.380
I can't make myself sanctified,

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:20.179
but God working in me causes me to be sanctified.

00:27:20.179 --> 00:27:23.820
It's amazing as we yield ourselves to him.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.700
We find that, as I mentioned a moment ago,

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.220
and if you were to have the opportunity,

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.760
we're out of time this evening,

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.299
but if you look back to 1 Corinthians chapter six

00:27:34.299 --> 00:27:36.260
and verses 19 and 20, what know ye not,

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:37.940
that your bodies are the temple of the Holy Ghost,

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.000
which is in you, which you have of God.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.040
And we understand we're to glorify God

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:42.880
in our body and our spirit,

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.799
which are his, why we're bought with a price,

00:27:44.799 --> 00:27:46.880
and we understand that truth.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.239
And I said this in the beginning this evening,

00:27:49.239 --> 00:27:51.320
but all the believers in Corinth,

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.279
positionally speaking, they were sanctified.

00:27:56.239 --> 00:28:00.160
However, many of the believers in Corinth

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.919
were not practically sanctified.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.079
They were carnal.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.119
They were living how they wanted to live,

00:28:09.119 --> 00:28:11.119
doing what they wanted to do.

00:28:11.119 --> 00:28:13.239
I believe that even as we look at this truth

00:28:13.239 --> 00:28:16.320
with regard to the church in Corinth,

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:21.040
Christendom, broadly speaking, is still guilty.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.160
If you've truly been saved by the grace of God,

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.000
you're positionally sanctified.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.399
But there are a lot of people that are living

00:28:28.399 --> 00:28:29.600
like they're not saved.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.440
I said this a while ago from the pulpit.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.719
We're talking about praying for leaders.

00:28:35.719 --> 00:28:37.400
Sometimes we have the expectation

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.840
that lost people are gonna act like saved people,

00:28:41.279 --> 00:28:42.679
when it's hard enough to get saved people

00:28:42.679 --> 00:28:43.919
to act like saved people.

00:28:45.679 --> 00:28:47.599
Why in the world would we think that a lost person

00:28:47.599 --> 00:28:49.840
is gonna act like a saved person?

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.719
Why would you think a lost person's gonna believe

00:28:52.719 --> 00:28:54.520
the truth of the Bible that you believe?

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.359
They're lost.

00:28:55.359 --> 00:28:59.559
The Bible tells us that the natural man

00:28:59.559 --> 00:29:01.559
receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,

00:29:01.559 --> 00:29:03.039
for they're foolishness unto him,

00:29:03.039 --> 00:29:04.039
neither can he know them

00:29:04.039 --> 00:29:05.940
because they're spiritually discerned.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.539
In 1 Corinthians chapter two.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.380
As we look at this verse of Scripture

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.739
and we see the importance of sanctification,

00:29:14.859 --> 00:29:16.700
as we reference once again that quote

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.419
from the preacher of yesteryear,

00:29:18.419 --> 00:29:20.099
salvation is the miracle of the moment,

00:29:20.099 --> 00:29:22.779
but sanctification is the process of a lifetime.

00:29:23.739 --> 00:29:25.419
How much are we like Christ?

00:29:25.419 --> 00:29:27.059
How much are we allowing the Holy Spirit of God

00:29:27.059 --> 00:29:30.460
to conform us to the image of his dear Son?

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.419
See, what we understand as Christians

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:37.460
is that first and foremost, my identity is in Christ.

00:29:37.979 --> 00:29:42.979
My identity is in Christ, first and foremost.

00:29:43.099 --> 00:29:44.940
And when we understand that

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.239
and we understand that our citizenship is in heaven,

00:29:47.239 --> 00:29:48.700
this world is not my home,

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.219
I'm just a passing through, as the songwriter said,

00:29:51.219 --> 00:29:53.140
and we're to be like Christ.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.900
We're not to be conformed to this world.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.419
We see that in Romans chapter 12 in verse number one and two.

00:29:58.419 --> 00:29:59.940
I beseech you therefore, brethren,

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.539
by the power vested in me by the Father and the Son

00:30:02.539 --> 00:30:04.419
and the Holy Spirit, amen.

00:30:04.419 --> 00:30:05.260
Amen.

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:10.000
the mercies of God that you present your body as a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.800
God, which is your reasonable service.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:19.640
And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind."

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.640
How does that happen?

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:27.960
Listen, you had a worldview, I had a worldview that was contrary to the biblical worldview.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:34.160
One of the greatest problems we have in America today is that we think that the worldview

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:40.280
out there, that we can adopt part of that worldview.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:45.560
It's contrary, it's contrary.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:50.720
As we look back in 1 Thessalonians 5 verse 23, we see the truth of sanctification, but

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:56.360
I'm also interested in seeing what Paul says to these believers, and very quickly you notice

00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:01.520
that Paul says, I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body, and we see that Paul was

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:06.560
praying for them and what a valid thing to understand the power of prayer and the importance

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:10.240
of intercession and being involved in intercessory prayer.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:19.320
But notice what he says, that you would be preserved, that you would be preserved blameless

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:24.480
unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:29.720
He reminds them, not only that he's praying for them, but he reminds them once again of

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.920
the truth that Jesus is coming again.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:36.200
In fact, as you read through 1 Thessalonians, you see every chapter, 2 Thessalonians, the

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:40.720
same thing, in every chapter there's a reference to the return of Christ, and it's a theme

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.360
of both of these books.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:46.200
There was some false teaching that was affecting them as it's dealt with in the second book

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:50.520
with regard to the day of the Lord, and it's set forth and straightened out because there

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.720
were some that were led astray.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:58.200
They were given a counterfeit letter as if it came from Paul, and Paul instructs and

00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.480
corrects.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:03.760
You look at 2 Thessalonians 2 and you see specifically that being dealt with.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:07.000
But when we understand unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and the imminent return

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.120
of Christ, and we understand that John says, in the book of 1 John, that we would not be

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:16.520
ashamed of him at his appearing.

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:20.640
Then as you enter into the next portion of that scripture, that's at the end of chapter

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:25.600
2 of the book of 1 John, you get into chapter number 3, behold what manner of love the Father

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.640
hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God.

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:34.520
But then it talks about the truth there with regard to the coming of the Lord, and it says

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:41.520
this in chapter number 3, in verse number 3, talking about verse 2, when he shall appear,

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:47.900
but verse 3, and every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:48.900
pure.

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:54.860
Ephesians chapter number 5 talks about the church being presented, and obviously it's

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:58.740
talking about the members of the church being presented.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:04.180
In fact, he says this in verse 26, that he might sanctify and cleanse it, the church,

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:10.860
with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:16.300
church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.500
without blemish.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:22.700
There's an expectation that God's people would be sanctified.

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:26.740
We'd be serious about this thing of living for Christ.

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:31.900
Living for Jesus, we sing the song.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:35.580
I want to be like Christ, and we make the statement.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:42.380
This evening, sanctification, there's an example, there's an expectation.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:44.420
How is our journey with Christ?

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:51.580
The believers in Hebrews, they're corrected for the fact that at the time they ought to

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:56.140
be teachers, they were in need that someone teach them.

00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:05.940
The people in Corinth, their position practically, their practice did not align with their position.

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:10.100
Positionally sanctified, but practically they were carnal.

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:14.420
I hope that it would be said of us that we are seeking to walk worthy and please God,

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:19.020
that we're letting God have his way in and through our lives, that we would be sanctified.

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:24.700
As I mentioned, 2 Timothy, and meet for the master's use.

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:29.460
It would be a vessel that's clean and pure, and that God can use us for his honor and

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:30.460
for his glory.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.460
Let's pray.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:32.460
Father, we love you.

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:33.460
We thank you for loving us.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.619
Thank you for the opportunity to study your Word tonight.

00:34:35.619 --> 00:34:38.740
I pray, God, that you'd bless, help us, Lord, to draw closer to thee.

00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:42.820
Help us to allow your Spirit to work in our lives, to have your will and way.

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.700
Help us to be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:48.700
Help us to walk as we ought to walk.

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:50.059
I pray that you'd bless our time of prayer.

00:34:50.059 --> 00:34:51.059
We thank you for the privilege.

00:34:51.059 --> 00:34:55.059
We give you the honor and glory for all that you'll do for us in Christ's name we pray.

00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:55.740
Amen.
