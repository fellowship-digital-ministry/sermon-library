1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
17 here this morning. And as we look at this passage of Scripture, I trust it to be a blessing

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,800
and encouragement to you. I trust that it would challenge us in our walk with God.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,439
And we are so thankful for the Word of God, the truth that is contained therein.

4
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,559
And what a blessing that God has given us His Word. He has preserved His Word.

5
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,319
And we have the privilege of being able to go to the Scriptures and to be encouraged and

6
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:26,879
strengthened. I'm thankful all at the same time that the Word of God will encourage us and

7
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:32,159
challenge us and convict us and comfort us. It's amazing how the Holy Spirit of God will use the

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,799
Word of God in the lives of His people. And of course, even as we would share the Gospel with

9
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:43,040
an unregenerate individual, we are so thankful that God will use His Word to convict them of

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,319
their sin of Christ's righteousness and judgment to come. And this morning, as we look at this

11
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:52,479
passage, I'll begin reading in verse number 12, 1 Timothy chapter number 1, beginning in verse

12
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:59,200
number 12, notice what the Apostle Paul says, and I thank Christ Jesus, our Lord, who hath enabled

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:05,279
me, for that He counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry, who was before a blasphemer

14
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:12,720
and a persecutor and injurious. But I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.

15
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:19,839
And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus.

16
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:29,040
This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world

17
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:38,080
to save sinners, of whom I am chief. Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first

18
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:44,319
Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe

19
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:53,040
on Him to life everlasting. Now unto the King, eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God,

20
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,319
be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. This morning, as you see in the bulletin, I want to

21
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:06,400
preach a message that I've just titled from verse number 15, to save sinners, to save sinners. As we

22
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,080
look at this passage of Scripture, we would note that the book of 1 Timothy was written approximately

23
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:19,759
30 years after the apostle Paul—at that time, his name being Saul—traveled on the road to Damascus.

24
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,240
Of course, we understand that it's in Acts chapter number 9 that we have the privilege of reading

25
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:31,600
about that journey that Saul took, and the purpose of that journey was to find any of that way—those

26
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,039
that had claimed the name of Christ and to persecute—to bind them and bring them back to

27
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:42,880
Jerusalem, and we find that he had the authority to do so. But it was as he traveled on that road

28
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:49,759
to Damascus that something magnificent took place, something that would change the course of his life,

29
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:56,479
and we find that he met the Lord Jesus Christ, and he was born again. He was saved by the

30
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:02,880
power of the gospel, and we find that it was on that day that truly the apostle Paul was a new

31
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,759
creature. Of course, we know that a few chapters of the book of Acts passed before his name is

32
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:14,240
changed from Saul to Paul, but we think about that amazing event that took place in Acts chapter

33
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:20,639
number 9—those that he would have martyred and those that he would have persecuted and sought

34
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:27,520
to make their lives miserable. He now is preaching and fellowshipping with them, and what an amazing

35
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:33,199
blessing, as we think about the power of the gospel to transform a life. We understand that

36
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,800
Paul was used of the Lord. In fact, between the time of his conversion and the writing of 1 Timothy,

37
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,479
we understand that he had the opportunity to participate greatly in the advancement of the

38
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,360
gospel in the first century. It was through the apostle Paul and those three missionary journeys

39
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,080
that he had the privilege of being able to preach the gospel, to see churches established, and what

40
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:03,919
an amazing testimony of this man. And you think about all of these things that had taken place,

41
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:10,479
and the opportunity for him to see many, trust Christ, and become established in the faith,

42
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:16,079
growing and thriving. He would write back to a number of those churches. Of course, as you study

43
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,440
the epistles, you find that he's writing back to those individuals. And I find that Paul, nearly

44
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,359
30 years had passed between that time and this in 1 Timothy chapter number one, and I find that

45
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:33,519
Paul is still overwhelmed with joy and amazement. And really, I believe that there's two reasons.

46
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:39,600
The first reason that he's filled with this joy and amazement is that the Lord would allow him

47
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:46,720
to serve. You think about the verse number 12. He says this, and I thank Christ Jesus, our Lord,

48
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:54,959
who hath enabled me. For that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry.

49
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,640
There is joy in serving Jesus, the songwriter said. And we find that the apostle Paul had great joy,

50
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:07,920
and he stood in awe and amazement at the fact that the Lord God Almighty would allow him to serve,

51
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,119
to be involved in the ministry and the work of Christ. And what a great joy that you find in the

52
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:18,480
life of the apostle Paul. I believe furthermore, and most importantly, he never got over the

53
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,480
blessedness of his salvation. He understood what a great privilege it was to know the Lord Jesus

54
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,320
Christ as his personal Savior. Not only for him to know the truth of the gospel and to be converted

55
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,399
himself, but to have the privilege of taking that message to a lost and dying world. We find that

56
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:41,440
the apostle Paul here, as he's writing to Timothy, his son in the faith, and we find that in this

57
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,399
few verses of Scripture, this portion that we'll study this morning, we see that he gives great

58
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,920
testimony, and he gives us great truth that I trust would be a blessing to us this morning.

59
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,320
If you are taking notes, number one in your notes this morning, note the purpose. As we think about

60
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,040
the introduction here, we find that Paul is rejoicing in the fact in verse number 12 that he

61
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,640
was counted worthy of being put into the ministry. Of course, God had enabled him, and Paul was

62
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,920
faithful. In fact, the reality is that we find the Word of God teaches us in 1 Corinthians chapter

63
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:17,679
number 4, moreover is required in stewards that a man be found faithful. You know, this is something

64
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:22,640
that each child of God can attain, that thing of faithfulness. Aren't you thankful that our God is

65
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,959
faithful? He'll never fail you. We sing about, great is thy faithfulness, but we find that the wise

66
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:35,600
man Solomon, he said, who can find a faithful man? And faithfulness is of significant importance.

67
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:43,200
God puts, places a premium on obedience and on faithfulness. And we find that Paul, according to

68
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,440
this passage, he says that the Lord counted him faithful and put him into the ministry. He

69
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,320
remembers what he was. In verse number 13, he mentions how that he was a blasphemer, a persecutor,

70
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,559
an injurious. He says, but I obtained mercy. And then we notice here that he speaks about the grace

71
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:04,079
of our Lord in verse number 14, and that it was exceeding abundant with faith and love, which is

72
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:11,760
in Christ Jesus. We often sing about the grace of God and what wonder to think about and to

73
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:17,760
understand the depths of God's mercy and his grace. And I'm so thankful this morning that yes,

74
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,600
his grace is amazing, but we find here in verse number 14, that he uses that phrase abundant

75
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,160
and how glorious it is to be mindful of the grace of God. As we come to verse number 15,

76
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,920
he shares with us a purpose. And as we note this purpose, we would find that it is absolutely

77
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:42,079
truthful. And he says this, I literally says, this is a faithful saying, truthful. Now it is,

78
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,839
it is a saying, a truth that I'm getting ready to share with you, Timothy, that is a faithful saying

79
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:55,920
and notice what he says, worthy of all acceptation. In other words, this truth that I'm going to

80
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:01,359
share with you, this saying that I'm going to give you this morning, or as he's writing this

81
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:08,000
particular letter, it's a truthful saying, it's a faithful saying, and it is worthy of being accepted.

82
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,440
It is to be embraced and to be held dear to the child of God. And we find that he says this in

83
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:23,679
verse number 15, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. Christ Jesus came into the

84
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:30,320
world to save sinners. We know that everything that our God does, he does with a purpose.

85
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:36,559
There are times in our lives, no doubt, that we would go through various difficulties and trials,

86
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,760
perhaps, and we may not fully understand or be aware of the purpose, but we can rest assured

87
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,919
that our God has a purpose. As we read the gospel accounts, we have the privilege of reading about

88
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:55,200
the incarnation of Jesus Christ and the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, that he is God in flesh,

89
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,599
and we find that throughout the New Testament, throughout the gospel records, you'll find a

90
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:06,400
number of examples in which the Lord Jesus Christ claimed and proved his deity, that he is God,

91
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:13,440
that he is God in flesh, and that he came with a purpose, and that purpose is to save sinners.

92
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,080
There are many times in which we would sing a song, Born to Die, and we find that the songwriter

93
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,640
would say of that particular song that Jesus was born, but he was born to die. Why? Because his

94
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,559
purpose was to save sinners. Even at the announcement of the birth of Jesus Christ, when the

95
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:38,159
angel appeared to Mary, we find that it's there in the book of Matthew, that the Bible tells us

96
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:44,400
in verse number 21, and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus. Why?

97
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:54,159
For he shall save his people from their sins. To save sinners. We think about this purpose,

98
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,000
and we ask the question this morning, how would this be accomplished?

99
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,620
It's an amazing truth.

100
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,460
It's a faithful saying worthy of all acceptation

101
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,039
that Christ Jesus came into the world

102
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,779
to save sinners.

103
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:09,659
How would this be accomplished?

104
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:11,079
For many of us this morning,

105
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:13,159
we understand that it would be accomplished

106
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,540
by the Lord Jesus Christ

107
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,040
going to the cross of Calvary

108
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,379
and paying, shedding His precious blood,

109
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:22,260
making atonement for the sin of the world.

110
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,959
We know that as we would celebrate

111
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:25,540
Resurrection Sunday next week,

112
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,959
that we would be mindful today

113
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,700
of the triumphal entry of the Lord Jesus Christ

114
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,580
as He would enter into Jerusalem.

115
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,459
And we understand that the reason

116
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:35,540
in which He would enter into Jerusalem

117
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,619
as He had made it known to His disciples

118
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:40,779
in those days leading up to this amazing event

119
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:45,180
that He was going to go to the cross.

120
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,759
He was going to that cross willingly.

121
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:52,340
He was going to that cross to save sinners.

122
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,380
And we find that really as we look at this truth

123
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,000
and we understand this morning

124
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,200
that Paul says that Christ Jesus

125
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,240
came into the world to save sinners.

126
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,040
How would this be accomplished?

127
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,040
There's only one way for mankind to be redeemed

128
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,040
and that's through the substitutionary atonement

129
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,440
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

130
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:16,019
You are incapable of saving yourself.

131
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:17,519
There's no work that you can do.

132
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,059
There's no religious activity

133
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:20,599
that you can participate in.

134
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,580
There's nothing that you can do

135
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,099
to save yourself.

136
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:28,099
Jesus said it is finished.

137
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:29,779
Notice with me, let's take a journey

138
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:31,620
all the way back to the book of Genesis

139
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,459
and let's look at a number of passages

140
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,860
throughout the Word of God

141
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,180
that will help us understand this morning

142
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,940
the significance of the substitutionary atonement

143
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,000
of Jesus Christ.

144
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,699
Genesis 3.

145
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:45,040
And I want you to be mindful with me this morning

146
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,540
that as we would understand and note the purpose

147
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,339
in which the Apostle Paul says,

148
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,639
listen, this is a faithful, a truthful saying.

149
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,519
It's worthy of all acceptation

150
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:57,720
that Christ Jesus came into the world

151
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,599
to save sinners.

152
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:01,080
We know that the statement will end

153
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
of whom I am chief

154
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,680
and we'll look at that in just a moment.

155
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,080
And notice in Genesis 3,

156
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,720
it's in this portion of Scripture

157
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,160
that God provides us with the record of sin

158
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,800
entering into the world.

159
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,080
You understand that God created all things

160
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,960
and He created all things perfect.

161
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,679
It was a perfect environment

162
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,740
in which God created mankind.

163
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,699
We would look through Genesis 1

164
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:25,139
and we would find the record of creation.

165
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:27,940
We would find that it's in Genesis 2

166
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,380
that the Lord said to Adam

167
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,460
that he was to keep the garden,

168
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,240
but He tells them specifically

169
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,479
there was a single, simple command

170
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:40,020
in verses 16 and 17 of Genesis 2.

171
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,139
And the Lord God commanded the man saying,

172
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:44,979
of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat,

173
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:48,919
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil

174
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,839
thou shalt not eat of it,

175
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,639
for in the day that thou eatest thereof,

176
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,440
thou shalt surely die.

177
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,619
There was a simple command with a known consequence.

178
00:13:00,619 --> 00:13:02,320
And yet, we find that Satan,

179
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,500
the Bible tells us that he's likened to a serpent here,

180
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,820
that he was more subtle than any beast of the field

181
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,259
according to verse 1.

182
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:10,539
And he comes to the woman,

183
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,539
he comes to Eve,

184
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:13,300
and he says at the end of verse 1,

185
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,360
Yea, hath God said,

186
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,820
ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden.

187
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,160
The woman said unto the serpent,

188
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,059
we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden,

189
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:26,479
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,

190
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:28,199
God hath said, ye shall not eat of it,

191
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:30,820
neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.

192
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,240
And the serpent said unto the woman,

193
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,559
ye shall not surely die.

194
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,699
There's been an attack from the very beginning

195
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:41,380
between Satan and God.

196
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,660
We understand there's a great spiritual battle

197
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,440
that is raging in our world even still today.

198
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,240
And you find that Satan seeks

199
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,380
to undermine the authority of God.

200
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,000
He seeks to plant into the people's minds

201
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,240
that there's some level of doubt

202
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,720
with regard to what God has said.

203
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,639
And I'm thankful that God has been faithful

204
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,880
to give us the record of what He has said.

205
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,679
And it's absolutely imperative that we know this book.

206
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,880
For Satan simply tries to undermine the authority.

207
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,059
He questions the authority of God.

208
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,539
Yea, hath God said.

209
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:15,260
He questions the consequence.

210
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,660
Ye shall not surely die.

211
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,859
He shares with Eve and says to her

212
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,500
that really what's going to happen

213
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,059
is you're going to become like God's.

214
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:25,700
In other words, what's happening

215
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,619
is God is giving you this truth,

216
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,700
this command, He's keeping you from this

217
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,339
because He's keeping something good from you.

218
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:39,420
The Bible says in verse number five,

219
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,119
For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof,

220
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:43,760
then your eyes shall be opened

221
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,220
and ye shall be as God's knowing good and evil.

222
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:50,160
The enemy wants to think

223
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,140
that God's keeping something good from you.

224
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,640
Oh, you can't do this, you can't do that.

225
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,359
God doesn't want you to participate in this.

226
00:14:58,359 --> 00:14:59,359
God doesn't want you to do that.

227
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:02,160
He's just keeping good things from you.

228
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,200
No, no, He's protecting us.

229
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,279
Amen?

230
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,519
He is the all wise God.

231
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,700
He understands as He is the Creator

232
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,940
and Sustainer of all things.

233
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,940
He has created life.

234
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,459
He understands the consequences.

235
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:15,820
And He says here in Genesis chapter number two,

236
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,899
here's the command, here's the consequence.

237
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:20,859
And we find that Satan undermines the authority

238
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:23,420
and the truth that God has previously revealed.

239
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,059
And the Bible tells us that they ate of the fruit.

240
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,880
Sin entered into the world.

241
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,500
Immediately upon sin entering into the world,

242
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,579
their eyes were opened.

243
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:36,279
The Bible says that they sought to hide themselves

244
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,260
because they were naked.

245
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,720
They sought to cover themselves.

246
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,720
They sewed fig leaves together

247
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,220
that would represent to us the works of their hands.

248
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,279
And as you understand,

249
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,559
as you would go through the account in Genesis three

250
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,899
and you would notice the way in which Adam and Eve

251
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:52,959
sought to cover for their own sin

252
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,920
and they sought to use the works of their own hands

253
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,119
to cover, that God says it's not adequate.

254
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:02,279
It is not sufficient.

255
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,459
As you end Genesis chapter number three,

256
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:07,200
you find that it's in verse number 21.

257
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,160
The Bible says unto Adam also and to his wife,

258
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,160
did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them?

259
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,119
We find that in order for these coats of skin to be made,

260
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:25,079
that there had to be the death of an animal.

261
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,559
There had to be shed blood.

262
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,880
We find that God is revealing to us

263
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,239
all the way back in Genesis chapter number three,

264
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,019
this truth of the substitutionary atonement.

265
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:37,380
In fact, He tells us in verse number 15,

266
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,579
I will put enmity between thee and the woman

267
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:41,700
and between thy seed and her seed.

268
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,500
It shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel.

269
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,179
In essence, God is saying to Adam and Eve,

270
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,100
these works of your own hands,

271
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,779
these fig leaves that you've sewn together

272
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:01,040
to seek to cover your sin, your nakedness,

273
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,500
you understand it's not sufficient, it's inadequate.

274
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,619
An animal had to die.

275
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:13,619
The blood was shed so that coats of skin would be provided,

276
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:17,299
thus providing us with an example for years to come,

277
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:18,859
not only showing us an example,

278
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:22,179
but providing for us that picture,

279
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:24,660
that typology of the Lord Jesus Christ

280
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,320
who would die as our substitute.

281
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,459
In Genesis chapter number 22, in verse number 13,

282
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:33,660
you'll be mindful of the fact that in just a,

283
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,279
hopefully in a few weeks we'll be studying this

284
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:37,179
on Sunday night in its entirety,

285
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:39,299
but it's here in this passage that Abraham

286
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:42,500
is commanded by God to take his son Isaac

287
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,820
and to offer him there at Mount Carmel.

288
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,380
And we find that it's there as he's seeking to obey

289
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,220
and his faith is revealed to us

290
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,420
that Abraham is now ready to slay his son.

291
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:59,000
And God calls, Abraham, Abraham,

292
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,519
according to verse number 11.

293
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,279
And he said, here am I, verse number 12 of Genesis 22,

294
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:07,160
and he said, lay not thine hand upon the lad,

295
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,880
neither do thou anything unto him,

296
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,320
for now I know that thou fearest God,

297
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,239
seeing thou hast not withheld thy son,

298
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:15,119
thine only son, from me.

299
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,239
Now understand with me that Isaac had inquired

300
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,420
when they were walking up that mount,

301
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,799
they had the wood, they had all of the things

302
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:24,940
that were necessary for the sacrifice,

303
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,179
but they had no lamb for a burnt offering.

304
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:32,080
And Isaac asks the question, he says to his father,

305
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,219
he says, behold, the fire and the wood,

306
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:35,380
in verse number seven,

307
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,179
but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

308
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:42,719
And Abraham said, my son, God will provide Himself

309
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:45,500
a lamb for a burnt offering.

310
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,380
So they went, both of them together.

311
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,179
And after God calls out to Abraham in 11 and 12,

312
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:54,239
we find that in verse number 13

313
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:55,679
of this passage of Scripture,

314
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,880
the Bible says that Abraham lifted up his eyes

315
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,640
and looked, and behold, behind him a ram

316
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,559
caught in a thicket by his horns.

317
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,200
And Abraham went and took the ram

318
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,960
and offered him up for a burnt offering.

319
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,840
Notice this phrase, in the stead of his son.

320
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,479
In the place of his son.

321
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:18,440
The lamb, the ram that is mentioned here, was offered.

322
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,299
We find that as you would look at the truth

323
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,960
of the Passover in Exodus chapter number 12.

324
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,799
We don't have time this morning to read the entirety of it,

325
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,320
but really, if you read the entirety

326
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,640
of Exodus chapter number 12,

327
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,799
you find that God Almighty is giving to Moses

328
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,840
the instruction with regard to this final plague

329
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,500
and the requirement for the blood to be applied,

330
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,760
the Passover lamb to be sacrificed.

331
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,559
And we find that God tells Moses

332
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,919
that this was going to be something

333
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,460
that they would follow throughout their time as a nation.

334
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,940
And we find that they were to understand

335
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,659
that this was not only a reminder

336
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:58,059
of how God would deliver them from Egyptian.

337
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:03,579
bondage, but it was a picture of Messiah who would one day come.

338
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:08,879
We find that that Passover lamb was to be taken and to be sacrificed, and as that blood,

339
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:13,119
they were to apply it on the doorpost and upon the lintel, and really, if you think

340
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,379
about the picture of the doorpost and the lintel, you can see a cross that would be

341
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:23,119
established between putting the blood in those particular locations, and as the death angel,

342
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:27,419
as the Word of God would say, would enter in, we find the death of the firstborn for

343
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:33,819
those in Egypt, but as he would see the blood, he would pass over.

344
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:36,299
He would pass over.

345
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:40,379
We find that it must be applied.

346
00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:45,019
If the blood were not applied, certainly death would visit that home.

347
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:50,979
We find that through that picture that is given to us, that typology, that we understand

348
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:55,699
that that is a great picture of what the Lord Jesus Christ would do for us.

349
00:20:55,699 --> 00:20:59,459
In fact, Paul, don't turn over there because we're going to continue with some truth from

350
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:03,599
the Old Testament, but Paul would say this in 1 Corinthians chapter number 5 and verse

351
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:08,259
number 7, "...purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump as ye are

352
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:09,259
unleavened."

353
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:18,259
Notice this, "...for even Christ, our Passover, is sacrificed for us."

354
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:23,860
Paul connects the truth of the Passover that was instituted in Exodus chapter number 12

355
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:29,899
with the death of Christ, saying that He, Christ, is our Passover.

356
00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:34,339
What a wonderful truth that is given to us here in Exodus chapter number 12.

357
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:38,860
Read with me, turn over if you will to the book of Isaiah chapter number 53.

358
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,619
Isaiah chapter number 53, what a powerful passage of Scripture that would reveal to

359
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:49,379
us the truth of the death of our wonderful Lord and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, and

360
00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:57,459
we find that it's here in Isaiah 53 that the Bible says this in verse number 1, "...who

361
00:21:57,459 --> 00:22:02,860
hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?

362
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:07,899
For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground.

363
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:12,380
He hath no form nor comeliness, and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we

364
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,179
should desire him.

365
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:20,739
He is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.

366
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:24,099
And we hid, as it were, our faces from him.

367
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:28,300
He was despised, and we esteemed him not.

368
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:33,779
Surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows.

369
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:38,139
Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted."

370
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:43,679
Notice verse number 5, "...but he was wounded for our transgressions.

371
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,959
He was bruised for our iniquities.

372
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:54,319
The chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed.

373
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,819
All we, like sheep, have gone astray.

374
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:01,199
We have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him..."

375
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:06,479
Notice this, "...the iniquity of us all.

376
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:12,440
He was oppressed and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth.

377
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,679
He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before his shearers is dumb.

378
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:18,720
So he opened not his mouth.

379
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,720
He was taken from prison and from judgment.

380
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,759
Who shall declare his generation?

381
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:27,160
For he was cut off out of the land of the living.

382
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,440
For the transgression of my people was he stricken.

383
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,199
And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death.

384
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:41,160
Because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth."

385
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,959
Notice verse 10, "...yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him.

386
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:52,679
He hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin.

387
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:58,119
He shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper

388
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,440
in his hand."

389
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,279
You note in verse number 10 not only the death of Christ when he would make his soul an offering

390
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:09,520
for sin, but you see the resurrection of Christ when it says he shall prolong his days.

391
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,800
Verse 11, "...he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied."

392
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:19,839
We notice in verse number 11 that God is satisfied with the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ

393
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:22,359
upon the cross of Calvary.

394
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:28,679
The substitutionary atonement, it satisfied the demand of Almighty God for the payment

395
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:31,119
for sin for mankind.

396
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,720
It says, "...by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many, for he shall bear their

397
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,720
iniquities.

398
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,639
Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with

399
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:45,200
the strong, because he hath poured out his soul unto death, and he was numbered with

400
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:52,079
the transgressors, and he bared the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors."

401
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:58,119
I'm so thankful the Lord Jesus Christ went to the cross of Calvary to pay for my sin,

402
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:04,200
to do for me what I could not do for myself, to do for you what you could not do for yourself.

403
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:10,679
We find that Peter would say this in 1 Peter 1, a portion of Scripture that is familiar

404
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:16,480
to us, and we find that here, as Peter would speak about this very truth of the substitutionary

405
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,639
atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ, that he tells us in 1 Peter 1, beginning in verse

406
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:26,899
number 17, and if you call on the Father, notice this phrase, "...who without respect

407
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:30,919
of persons judgeth according to every man's work."

408
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,079
I'm so thankful that our God is no respecter of persons.

409
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:38,179
We all must come by the way of the cross, amen?

410
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:39,480
And what a great blessing.

411
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,600
I've often made the statement throughout the years of pastoring here that there are two

412
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,959
categories of people in this world.

413
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:50,239
There are saved people and there are lost people.

414
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:56,440
And I'm so thankful that our God is no respecter of persons, and He paid for the sin of all

415
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,079
humankind.

416
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,760
The Bible says that there at the end of verse number 17, "...past the time of your sojourning

417
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:07,559
here in fear, notice verse 18, for as much as you know that you are not redeemed with

418
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:13,160
corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition

419
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:21,559
from your fathers, but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and

420
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:28,519
without spot, who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was

421
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:34,519
manifest in these last times for you, who by Him do believe in God that raised Him up

422
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:42,540
from the dead and gave Him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God."

423
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:47,760
As we note the purpose that is given to us in 1 Timothy 1 and verse number 15, when the

424
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,279
Apostle Paul says, this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ

425
00:26:53,279 --> 00:27:01,040
Jesus came into the world to save sinners, we understand the purpose.

426
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,200
I would like to submit to you this morning that for us in this congregation and for many

427
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,799
that perhaps are tuned in via live stream this morning, verse number 18 is applicable

428
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:16,079
to us in 1 Peter chapter number 1, when Peter says, "...for as much as ye know that you

429
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,519
are not redeemed with corruptible things," listen, this is a truth that we know.

430
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:24,440
We understand the purpose of Christ's birth, His incarnation, that He came into the world

431
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,639
to save sinners.

432
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:28,399
We understand this morning how that would be accomplished.

433
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,679
There was only one way for that to be accomplished.

434
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:32,880
There's no other way.

435
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:42,399
Jesus had to go to the cross of Calvary, but I submit to you this morning that there's

436
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:47,339
a world around us that is unaware of this purpose.

437
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:53,440
We know the purpose here, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.

438
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,919
I would challenge you this morning to ask some folks this week, hey, why did Jesus Christ

439
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,279
come into the world?

440
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,799
You'll get a variety of answers, no doubt.

441
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:07,600
Some, if they would be honest and transparent, they would probably tell you they have no

442
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,279
idea.

443
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:19,559
But we find that the Word of God clearly communicates to us the purpose of His incarnation and the

444
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:21,600
way in which this would be accomplished.

445
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,320
To save sinners, it would be accomplished through the substitutionary atonement of Jesus

446
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
Christ.

447
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,159
And as we would think about those that would be around us this morning that are unaware

448
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,440
of this truth, they do not know why Jesus came to this earth.

449
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:40,919
In fact, the further and further our nation and our world gets from a biblical understanding,

450
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:46,559
the more ignorance that you find in our society and our communities about the purpose of Christ's

451
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,940
birth.

452
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:57,119
We find here this morning that Jesus Christ said in John 19 and verse number 30, before

453
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:02,900
He gave up the ghost, He said, it is finished.

454
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,559
What is finished?

455
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,880
The purpose for which He came.

456
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:12,159
He would shed His precious blood and He paid for the sin of mankind.

457
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:17,000
We're understanding and aware of the fact that in just a few days He would rise, conquering

458
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,559
sin, death, and the grave.

459
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:24,799
And what wonderful truth that God gives us in His Word with regard to the work of Jesus

460
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:25,799
Christ.

461
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:31,479
Hebrews 7 and verse number 25 says this, that He's able to save them, wherefore He also

462
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:37,320
is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth

463
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,080
to make intercession for them.

464
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,919
I'm so thankful this morning for the purpose that is noted in 1 Timothy chapter number

465
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:46,919
1.

466
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:51,880
Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.

467
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,239
On Wednesday evening, we've been going through the model prayer of the Lord Jesus Christ

468
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:57,559
from Luke chapter number 11.

469
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:58,080
In this passage…

470
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,400
Last Wednesday, I dealt with the subject,

471
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,920
forgive us our sins.

472
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,080
And I made the statement in that study

473
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,200
on Wednesday evening

474
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,640
that far too often in our society today,

475
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,460
we've tried to accommodate people

476
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,320
and we want to be politically correct

477
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,060
and you don't want to call anyone a sinner

478
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,980
because it will just mess with their psyche

479
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,820
and it will adversely affect their self-esteem.

480
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,560
But the reality is that if you don't recognize

481
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,400
that you're a sinner,

482
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,280
you'll never recognize that you need a Savior.

483
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,180
It'd be a horrible thing if all we knew

484
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,080
is that we were sinners and there was no Savior.

485
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,880
If all we knew that we were sinners

486
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,200
and there was no hope of being saved,

487
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,000
being delivered, being redeemed,

488
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,480
that'd be terrible.

489
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,440
But understanding that Christ Jesus

490
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,440
came to save sinners.

491
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,140
The purpose.

492
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,600
Notice that there's a pattern

493
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,000
that is noted here back in 1 Timothy 1.

494
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,960
Paul concludes v. 15 by saying this

495
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,520
of whom I am chief.

496
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:10,320
Paul understood that he was a sinner.

497
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,360
Paul understood even as he would testify

498
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,960
in v. 13, and you note the phrase

499
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,360
who was before a blasphemer

500
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,280
and a persecutor and injurious.

501
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,800
I've gained mercy because I did it

502
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,120
ignorantly in unbelief.

503
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,320
For many of us this morning,

504
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
we can remember what we were

505
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,200
before we trusted Christ as our Savior.

506
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,080
We can remember being in a place

507
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,480
without any hope.

508
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,720
Perhaps with a great level of fear

509
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,720
as to what would happen if we were to die.

510
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,200
No peace. No joy.

511
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,960
Living for the things of this world.

512
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,320
Having uncertainty about those things

513
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,640
that would come in the future.

514
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,280
But we find that Paul,

515
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,040
because of his conversion,

516
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,400
he gives us the truth with regard

517
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,120
to his own personal conversion

518
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,120
and then his involvement in the ministry

519
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,920
and he says, listen, I want you to be mindful

520
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,760
of the fact that this is the purpose,

521
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,720
but then he gives us this pattern.

522
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,480
He says of whom I am chief,

523
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,400
how be it v. 16,

524
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:18,160
for this cause I obtained mercy.

525
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,840
You note that on two occasions

526
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,800
in these few verses of Scripture,

527
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,280
Paul makes this statement,

528
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,880
I obtained mercy.

529
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,080
In v. 13, he says, but I obtained mercy.

530
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,160
And then again here in v. 16,

531
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,240
he says I obtained mercy.

532
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,720
Aren't you thankful that our God is merciful?

533
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,160
His mercy endureth forever.

534
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,600
Great are His mercies.

535
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,160
They're new every morning.

536
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,800
We find that we serve a God

537
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,440
who is gracious and merciful

538
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,000
and we find that he mentions

539
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,120
the grace of God in v. 14.

540
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,520
He mentions the mercy of God

541
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,960
in v. 13 and v. 16.

542
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,000
And he says this when we consider

543
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,760
this pattern that is given.

544
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,920
He says I obtained mercy.

545
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,440
Notice what he says in v. 16.

546
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,160
That in me first,

547
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,200
Jesus Christ might show forth

548
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,880
all long-suffering,

549
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,680
notice, for a pattern to them

550
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,720
which should hereafter believe on Him

551
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,480
to life everlasting.

552
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,800
We note that there's a purpose,

553
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,520
but we note that there's a pattern

554
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,280
as I would notice here,

555
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,680
this truth in which Paul is revealing

556
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,520
to Timothy and of course being preserved

557
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,960
for us here this morning

558
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,760
that he would speak about this pattern

559
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,040
to them which should hereafter

560
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,760
believe on Him to life everlasting.

561
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,000
I'm so thankful for the truth of the Gospel

562
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,840
that whosoever shall call upon

563
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,400
the name of the Lord shall be saved.

564
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,560
And Paul is noting this pattern

565
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,880
that is here that yes,

566
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,000
I trust that Christ is my Savior.

567
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,200
I received the truth of the Gospel

568
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,280
and I was saved.

569
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,240
I was born again.

570
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,920
My life was changed.

571
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,080
I obtained mercy,

572
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,760
but you also can obtain mercy.

573
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,640
What was it that kept Paul preaching

574
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,280
everywhere he went?

575
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,120
What was it that caused Paul

576
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,400
to suffer great adversity?

577
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,880
What was it that caused him

578
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,040
to suffer great bodily harm

579
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,280
in all of these places that he would go

580
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,560
and he would share the Gospel?

581
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,320
It was because he understood

582
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,440
that Christ is the Savior of the world.

583
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,480
He understood that Christ Jesus

584
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,680
came into the world to save sinners

585
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,320
and therefore he understood this pattern

586
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,280
that it was not that Jesus

587
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,600
just paid for his sins,

588
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,480
but he paid for the sins of the world

589
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,400
and he was going to be an advocate,

590
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,240
an ambassador to go

591
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,120
and to carry that message.

592
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,440
He would go anywhere he could go.

593
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,120
He says, I am ready to preach the Gospel

594
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,840
to you that are at Rome also

595
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,400
in Romans chapter number one.

596
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Why? Because he understood

597
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,440
that it was the Gospel

598
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,880
that was the power of God unto salvation.

599
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,200
And as we would understand

600
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,640
the passage of Scripture

601
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,160
that is before us this morning,

602
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,560
it would be likened to

603
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,760
what the songwriter said

604
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,880
when they said, I don't know

605
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,000
what a sinner you are,

606
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,080
but I know what a Savior he is.

607
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,520
The reality is that Paul says

608
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,080
when he would look at his own life

609
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,440
that he was chief of sinners,

610
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,600
that he participated

611
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,000
in these wicked activities.

612
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,080
He was a blasphemer, a persecutor.

613
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,320
He was injurious.

614
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,360
Not only did he commit these sins,

615
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,880
but he would go and find

616
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,440
those that were of that way

617
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,960
and he would threaten them

618
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,360
and he would imprison them

619
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,360
and he would consent unto their death

620
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,840
and he would try to cause them

621
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,240
to deny the Lord Jesus Christ.

622
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,680
And he says, but I obtained mercy.

623
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,520
I obtained mercy.

624
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,080
Isn't that wonderful?

625
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,240
To understand the grace and mercy of God.

626
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,560
See, because Christ Jesus

627
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,440
came into the world to save sinners.

628
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,760
Paul did it ignorantly.

629
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,800
He thought he was doing service for God.

630
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,680
He thought he was doing

631
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,960
what he was supposed to do

632
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,560
under that which he'd been taught

633
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,000
in his Jewish religion and what have you.

634
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,280
And he's going forth with great zeal

635
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,920
to establish his own righteousness.

636
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,560
But as he would testify to the believers in Philippi,

637
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,920
he could not have his own righteousness

638
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,400
that would be accepted by God.

639
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,640
He must have the righteousness of Christ

640
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,040
imputed upon him.

641
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,040
This morning, we see this pattern.

642
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,200
We understand the pattern.

643
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,160
It would cause us to tell someone

644
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,000
this wonderful truth.

645
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,280
Romans 10.13, I quoted a moment ago,

646
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,320
but look back, if you will, to the book of Romans

647
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,520
and look at chapter number 10.

648
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,560
I want you to look at a few verses here.

649
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,440
Some verses that we're certainly familiar with.

650
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,640
In Romans chapter number 10, in verse number one,

651
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,360
the Bible says, brethren,

652
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,840
my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel

653
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,840
is that they might be saved.

654
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,160
Christ Jesus came into the world

655
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,920
to save sinners of whom I am chief.

656
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,600
He said, this is my heart's desire.

657
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,320
This is my prayer to God for Israel

658
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,600
that they might be saved.

659
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,160
Notice what he says in verses two and following.

660
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,600
He says, for I bear them record

661
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,000
that they have a zeal of God,

662
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,120
but not according to knowledge,

663
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,160
for they being ignorant of God's righteousness

664
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,280
and going about to establish their own righteousness

665
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,040
have not submitted themselves

666
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,040
unto the righteousness of God.

667
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,200
For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness

668
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,440
to every one that believeth.

669
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,080
Wow.

670
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,320
See, Paul says, listen, they're ignorant of this.

671
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,520
There's some people that you know,

672
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,560
there's some people that I know

673
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,040
that are ignorant of the truth of God's grace

674
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,920
and his mercy.

675
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,600
They're ignorant to the purpose

676
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,720
of Christ's incarnation, his birth,

677
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,520
that he came to save sinners

678
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,680
and how that would be accomplished.

679
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,800
By the way, it's not accomplished

680
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,560
by I'll do my part and you do your part.

681
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,880
Amen?

682
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,680
It's not a Christ died and I'm going to do these things

683
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,360
in order for us to accomplish this.

684
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,280
No, it's a he did it.

685
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,120
It's done.

686
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,200
It's finished.

687
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,640
He paid it all.

688
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,240
It's not a cooperative thing

689
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,280
where you come into a place and you say,

690
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,400
okay, I'm going to do my part

691
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,600
and he's going to do his part

692
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,680
or he did his part.

693
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,880
No, it's all of Christ.

694
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,600
Christ alone.

695
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,400
He says in verse number nine of Romans 10,

696
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,760
that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth,

697
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,720
the Lord Jesus,

698
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,280
and shalt believe in thine heart

699
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,840
that God hath raised him from the dead,

700
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,720
thou shalt be saved.

701
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,559
For with the heart,

702
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:46,200
man believeth unto righteousness

703
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,040
and with the mouth,

704
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,840
confession is made unto salvation.

705
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,880
For the Scripture saith,

706
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,000
whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.

707
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,080
For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek

708
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,760
for the same Lord over all is rich

709
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,440
unto all that call upon him.

710
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,880
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

711
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,960
shall be saved.

712
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,840
Why did Paul say whosoever shall call

713
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,160
upon the name of the Lord?

714
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,640
Because Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.

715
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,559
And Paul says this was a pattern

716
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:18,880
to them which should hereafter believe on him

717
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,520
to life everlasting.

718
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,480
That Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.

719
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,679
I've been saved.

720
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:25,679
And I know that there's this purpose,

721
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,239
the reason that Christ came,

722
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:30,400
but there's also a pattern that just as Jesus saved me,

723
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,080
that he'll save any sinner because that's why he came.

724
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,200
So he says,

725
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,360
whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

726
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,200
shall be saved.

727
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,520
But then he asked this question,

728
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,040
really a series of questions

729
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,559
beginning in verse number 14 of Romans 10.

730
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:47,840
How then shall they call on him

731
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,119
in whom they have not believed?

732
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,040
And how shall they believe in him

733
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,360
of whom they have not heard?

734
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,960
And how shall they hear without a...

735
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:05,260
That's a great question, are they not?

736
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:12,060
This morning, I believe that every one of us, even before this message, could have answered

737
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:16,240
the question, why did Christ come?

738
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,380
What was the purpose of His incarnation?

739
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,540
Maybe you would not have said to save sinners in those words, but we would have understood

740
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,900
that it was that He would pay for the sin of mankind.

741
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:34,060
We'd understand that there's this pattern, again, we may not have used the exact phraseology,

742
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:38,800
but we'd understand that, as Paul says, that this pattern that is here in them, which should

743
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,180
hereafter believe on Him to life everlasting, but we asked the question this morning, how

744
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,220
are they going to believe if they've not heard?

745
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:50,260
How are they going to know to call if they've not heard the name of Jesus?

746
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,420
How shall they hear without a preacher?

747
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,420
See they're ignorant.

748
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:59,500
As he mentions in verse number three, for they being ignorant of God's righteousness,

749
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:05,180
we find that he says, Peter, in 1 Peter chapter 1, for as much as ye know, I'm thankful to

750
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:10,500
know the truth, but there's a number of people that are ignorant to the truth of God's righteousness

751
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:16,300
and of His sacrificial atonement, the substitutionary atonement of Jesus Christ.

752
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:21,140
And so as we think about this pattern that is established and is mentioned in 1 Timothy

753
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:26,560
chapter 1, we find that what Paul is saying here is that this is a pattern, and therefore

754
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:34,620
as he would understand the pattern, he was actively engaged in sharing the truth, actively

755
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,620
engaged.

756
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:41,580
He had the opportunity on Friday to rent a piece of equipment for our workday that Brother

757
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:47,860
Matt would be great, he'd just let you know how wonderful that piece of equipment was,

758
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,940
and it wasn't as efficient as we had hoped for it to be.

759
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:57,020
But the opportunity at that rental location to share a gospel track with the individual.

760
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:00,100
And as we spoke, just for a moment, I found out that he was a believer.

761
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,700
He had trust in Christ as a Savior.

762
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,900
In fact, his father and his grandfather are preachers.

763
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,340
We had the privilege of being able to chat for just a little while, and before we left

764
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,580
that store, we were able to pray in the parking lot.

765
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:15,420
It was a tremendous blessing.

766
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,780
See sometimes we have the privilege of being able to try to share the gospel with someone

767
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,380
that's already a believer, and then we get to rejoice one with another, and how can I

768
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,380
pray for you?

769
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,740
And the Lord allowed our paths to cross for this purpose.

770
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:33,060
In fact, he may be watching the service this morning with his wife and children.

771
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:37,820
But I want you to understand this morning that we seek to let sinners know because we

772
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,900
understand the purpose and the pattern.

773
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:45,660
I understand that just as Christ saved me, and Paul understood that just as Christ saved

774
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:50,060
him, that his purpose is to save sinners, and there's this pattern that is established,

775
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:55,380
and anyone that would place their faith and trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary

776
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,380
will be saved.

777
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:01,980
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

778
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:05,180
Isn't that wonderful?

779
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:11,500
See it's great that we know that truth, but no doubt there are people that you know that

780
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,020
are just simply not aware of it.

781
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:19,440
Some that maybe have rejected it, we just need to pray for them, pray that God would

782
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,020
open their hearts and their minds to the truth of the Word of God, the Holy Spirit would

783
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:28,380
use the Word of God to accomplish His purpose to save sinners.

784
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:32,180
Back in 1 Timothy 1, we note the purpose, we note the pattern.

785
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:35,300
Notice with me in verse number 17 that we notice the praise.

786
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:40,700
This is a natural response to understanding what has already been revealed to us in this

787
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:45,020
short passage of Scripture, and we find that Paul had an understanding of who the Lord

788
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:50,060
Jesus Christ is, and he understood that he was worthy of His praise.

789
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:54,980
Listen, this morning I believe that we as the people of God, we ought to be a praising

790
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:59,420
people, we ought to be a worshiping people, we ought to be an excited people about what

791
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,340
God has done for us.

792
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:06,860
That we do not live under the circumstances in which we're facing, that we understand

793
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:12,820
that we're just pilgrims and strangers, that we're too going to a better country.

794
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:18,260
That God is preparing a place for us, that He is going to come back and receive us so

795
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,940
that we would be with Him for all of eternity.

796
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:27,900
That truly as we sing the songs of Zion, that we will one day see Him face to face.

797
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,540
Oh, it ought to cause us to rejoice greatly.

798
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:34,340
It ought to cause us to be a people that praise Him regularly.

799
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:39,700
That we're not just caught up as all of the people of the world of living under the circumstances

800
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,980
and saying, well, given the circumstances, given the things that are going on, I mean,

801
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,660
it's really hard, it's really difficult.

802
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:51,460
Man, we're looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.

803
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:55,940
I'm thankful that He's the author, but He's also the finisher of our faith.

804
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:59,820
And we'll be with Him for all of eternity.

805
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:04,300
When Paul shares with the believers in Thessalonica in chapter number four of that first epistle

806
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:08,220
with regard to the coming of the Lord, he tells us, wherefore, comfort one another with

807
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,220
these words.

808
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:15,420
Listen, we can face adversities and difficulties and we can have circumstances that are adverse,

809
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,460
but man, we're going to heaven.

810
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:21,580
We're saved by the blood of the Lamb.

811
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,380
This ought to cause us to rejoice greatly.

812
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:28,540
Listen, the reality is that it's not that we have to put on a show.

813
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:31,540
It shouldn't be that we have to work up our praise.

814
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:34,820
You understand what I'm saying?

815
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:41,220
When we truly understand who we were and now who we are in Christ, when we understand what

816
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:51,860
He did for us, how He changed our lives, that I was on my way to the lake of fire, but He

817
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:54,700
took my place.

818
00:45:54,700 --> 00:46:04,100
He took my place, and now I'm a new creature, heaven-bound, one day having the privilege

819
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,140
of seeing Him face to face.

820
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:12,860
And it's not something that we have to try to work a crowd, so to speak.

821
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:17,580
No, no, we should just praise Him because we understand what He's done for us.

822
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:24,900
Notice in verse number 17, now unto the King eternal, aren't you thankful that our God

823
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:25,900
is eternal?

824
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,900
He has no beginning and no ending.

825
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,020
He is Alpha and Omega.

826
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,380
We understand the eternality of Christ.

827
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:37,260
In fact, when we would understand as you study through the Gospel records in all of the Word

828
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:42,700
of God, and you'd understand the eternality of Christ and showing and proving the deity

829
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:47,660
of Christ, that He is God, even there in the Gospels when John the Baptist is asked

830
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:52,940
about the Lord Jesus Christ, he makes the statement that He that is before me is preferred

831
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,020
above me.

832
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:59,660
And the reality is if you look at the genealogy, if you look at the chronological order, that

833
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:03,380
John the Baptist was born first physically.

834
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,300
Amen?

835
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:12,860
Why is it that John would say of Jesus that He is before me because of His eternality?

836
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:20,060
And we notice here that he says the King eternal, immortal, aren't you thankful?

837
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:29,540
As we notice how the Lord is described here, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and

838
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:34,180
glory forever and ever.

839
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,940
Amen.

840
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:40,740
I'm thankful that as you read the book of Revelation, and you read about the way in

841
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:46,260
which we're going to praise Him, you read Revelation 4 and 5, and you read in those

842
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:54,660
chapters the scene in heaven, and the praise, oh what glory, but we don't have to wait until

843
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,260
we get into His presence to praise Him.

844
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,260
Amen?

845
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:05,460
We find that Paul makes this statement with regard to his praise, this natural response

846
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:09,200
to the understanding of what Christ has done for him.

847
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,040
Not only did He save his soul, but He enabled him and allowed him to serve in the ministry

848
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,860
according to verse number 12, and He says that He is to be honored and glorified, He

849
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:21,180
is to be exalted and magnified in our lives.

850
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:24,260
Oh, that we'd praise Him.

851
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:27,300
Enter into His gates with thanksgiving.

852
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:31,860
You read all throughout the Scriptures of the way in which we are to praise our God,

853
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,740
and He is worthy of our praise.

854
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:38,619
He alone is worthy of our praise.

855
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:44,540
And this morning, I believe that as you notice in verse number 17, the praise that is offered

856
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:52,619
to the Lord, we find that Paul is overwhelmed with gratitude, as he would understand and

857
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:58,500
be mindful of what Christ has done for him.

858
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:05,300
Perhaps in our lives, we'd have a certain amount of influence and impact in the lives

859
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:13,220
of others if we'd really praise Him like we should, if people would really truly see that

860
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:17,059
He's real to us, and He's changed our lives.

861
00:49:17,059 --> 00:49:27,100
I mean, when we truly daily live with an appreciation for our redemption, that we understand

862
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:37,600
the significance of Christ's birth, the purpose to save sinners, that it was there that that

863
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:43,500
work would only be accomplished through the substitutionary atonement of Jesus Christ.

864
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:51,340
This morning, I believe that almost all of us are aware of these truths, but I wonder

865
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:59,020
this morning, how often are we regularly allowing the truth of this passage?

866
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:03,060
passage to impact us?

867
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:06,640
Are we understanding the purpose?

868
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,100
Are we sharing the purpose?

869
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:16,420
Again, I challenge you, ask some people, hey, why… next week we're going to celebrate

870
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:22,300
Resurrection Sunday, Easter.

871
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:25,020
You know, the marketing companies, they market all kinds of things.

872
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:28,700
They change their Hershey Kisses and their M&Ms and everything else to look like Easter's

873
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:32,700
pastel colors and so on and so forth, right?

874
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:41,380
For a lot of people, Easter's about a bunny rabbit, right?

875
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,700
Do you not see that there's a great opportunity?

876
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:50,100
Listen, we're celebrating the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.

877
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:54,180
He conquered sin, death, and the grave on the cross of Calvary and then He rose in victory

878
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,220
conquering sin, death, and the grave.

879
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:57,220
He's my Savior.

880
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,020
I mean, it's a different perspective.

881
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,580
Hey, why are we celebrating Easter?

882
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:07,780
You ask people and they don't have any idea, most of them.

883
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:13,520
And some that would answer in the affirmative, you get to rejoice with them that they know

884
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,980
the same truth that you know.

885
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:23,780
Some no doubt would believe that Jesus rose again but they don't understand the significance

886
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:27,420
of why He was even crucified in the first place.

887
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:31,740
Because they're under the mindset that there's some kind of cooperation that is required

888
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:37,380
between their good works and Christ's sacrifice in order to save them.

889
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:42,340
But not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He hath

890
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,020
begotten us.

891
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:47,160
For by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves.

892
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:52,460
It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast.

893
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:57,780
We understand the truth of the Word of God and this morning I hope that we would praise

894
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,540
Him as we should.

895
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:06,340
I mean, for all He's done, how He's changed our lives.

896
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:11,180
I find that the Apostle Paul, nearly 30 years has passed.

897
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:16,560
And from my perspective, he never got over the fact that he was saved.

898
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:25,120
He never got over the fact that he was a sinner and confronted with the truth that

899
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:31,000
Christ is the only Savior and His life was forever changed.

900
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,560
And he says, I'm going to get engaged in sharing this message because I understand it's a pattern

901
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:41,440
for those which hereafter shall call upon His name to life everlasting and I'm going

902
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,240
to praise Him for all He's done.

903
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,040
Oh, what a wonderful Savior He is.

904
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:53,200
We live in the midst of a generation that just simply is ignorant to the truth of God's

905
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,560
Word.

906
00:52:54,560 --> 00:53:02,880
For too many years, in our own country, they've tried to remove God from any sphere of any

907
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,920
influence whatsoever.

908
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,360
And therefore we have a generation of people that are just completely ignorant to the truth

909
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,280
of who God is.

910
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,960
To save sinners.

911
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:18,920
Oh, I'm so thankful that He is the Savior.

912
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,640
And I hope that you'd rejoice in that truth.

913
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,640
Let's pray together.

914
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,720
Father, we love You.

915
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,720
We thank You for Your Word.

916
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:32,200
We thank You for the way in which the Apostle Paul never got over his salvation.

917
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:37,480
I pray that You'd help it to be fresh to us this morning.

918
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:50,240
And be mindful of how You saved our lives and changed our direction.

919
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:55,000
We thank You for Your grace and Your mercy.

920
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:02,400
I pray that You would help us, Lord, to be engaged in the work of the Lord, taking advantage

921
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:08,480
of the opportunities that You would present us with, that we would seize those opportunities.

922
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:14,120
Oh, God, I pray that You'd help us to praise You.

923
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:18,840
I mean regularly in our lives.

924
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:22,520
Because we're looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.

925
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:26,320
Because we're pilgrims and strangers.

926
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,960
Because our home is heaven.

927
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,400
Because we've been redeemed.

928
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:36,560
Lord, if there's one present here or one that's watching via live stream that's not sure of

929
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:43,000
heaven, I pray this morning that they would trust Christ as their personal Savior, understanding

930
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,760
that it's all paid for.

931
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:53,240
The sin of mankind is paid for with the blood of Jesus Christ.

932
00:54:53,240 --> 00:55:00,320
Just as those fig leaves of Adam and Eve, the result of their own work was inadequate,

933
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:05,120
was not sufficient, accepted.

934
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,120
An animal had to be sacrificed.

935
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:14,360
The blood had to be shed, showing to us a picture and a pattern of the Lord Jesus Christ

936
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:18,240
who would go to that cross and shed His precious blood.

937
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:24,280
Would You help them this morning to understand that they're a sinner, and that there's only

938
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,500
one Savior?

939
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:31,760
Would You convict them and convince them this morning, we pray, that it would be their day

940
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,100
of salvation?

941
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:40,540
Would You use us, Lord, those that are saved, to be Your representatives?

942
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:44,360
Help us to praise You regularly as we should.

943
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:49,840
Would You do a work in our time of invitation this morning, and we'll thank You for it,

944
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,960
in Christ's name we pray.

945
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,400
Would You stand with me?

946
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,600
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

947
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:59,960
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano, and as she does, the altar's open.

948
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,480
Maybe you'd say as Paul, I obtain mercy.

949
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,480
I've been saved.

950
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,480
You just want to praise Him.

951
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,280
You just want to come to this altar this morning and just thank Him for your salvation.

952
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:12,320
Maybe this morning you need to make a commitment to God that you're going to share the truth

953
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:16,880
that this week, by God's grace and with God's help, I'm going to share the gospel with at

954
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,020
least one person.

955
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:19,880
Would you make that commitment?

956
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,720
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
