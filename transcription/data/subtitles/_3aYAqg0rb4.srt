1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
Second Thessalonians chapter number three.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,599
Second Thessalonians chapter number three,

3
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:09,439
we continue looking through the concise instruction

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,479
that is given to the church at Thessalonica.

5
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:13,720
We've mentioned several times

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,680
that the church at Thessalonica is a good church,

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,280
a model church.

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,920
It's a church that is commended for many things

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,520
as you study through the first and second letters.

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,040
You find primarily in that first letter

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,639
that you'll see much of what Paul is commending them for,

12
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:31,520
but he starts out in the second letter

13
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,560
and talks about how their faith groweth exceedingly.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,720
If you notice that in chapter one in verse number three,

15
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,599
and what a blessed truth to see that there's a church,

16
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:46,099
a body of believers, that their faith was growing.

17
00:00:46,099 --> 00:00:47,200
How does our faith grow?

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,319
Well, by being in the word of God.

19
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:52,240
And we find, so then faith cometh by hearing

20
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,639
and hearing by the word of God.

21
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:57,560
And the Bible tells us that their faith groweth exceedingly,

22
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,319
that the charity every one of you all

23
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:01,400
toward each other aboundeth.

24
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,760
And they were a growing church, they were doing well.

25
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,339
They faced some opposition, they faced persecutions,

26
00:01:08,339 --> 00:01:11,779
they faced that attack from without,

27
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:14,080
but really the greatest danger

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,839
that the church in Thessalonica was dealing with

29
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:18,239
was false teaching.

30
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,080
And let me say this,

31
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,919
that's the greatest danger of any church.

32
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:22,720
There are false teachers that exist

33
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,639
that continue to peddle their false doctrine,

34
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:25,959
their false teaching,

35
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:28,160
and they package it real nicely

36
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,319
so that they can deceive as many as they possibly can.

37
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,239
And we find that the church in Thessalonica

38
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,239
was dealing with some of that false teaching

39
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:40,839
and how it was adversely impacting some of the members.

40
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:45,519
We looked last week at verses six through 10,

41
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,239
and this evening we're gonna continue the thought

42
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,779
really from last week regarding that disorderly behavior

43
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,379
that we noted in verses six through 10.

44
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:59,180
We discover tonight in verses 11 and 12

45
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,339
some additional instruction that is given

46
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:06,860
regarding those that are defined as being busybodies.

47
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,539
Notice verse number 11 and 12,

48
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,779
it'll be our text this evening.

49
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:13,660
I've simply titled the message this evening, Busybodies.

50
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,979
And the Bible says this,

51
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:16,500
for we hear, verse 11,

52
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,460
that there are some which walk among you disorderly.

53
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,539
He's dealt with that subject of disorderly

54
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:24,860
in verses six through 10 a couple of times.

55
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:29,979
It says this, working not at all, but are busybodies.

56
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:34,139
Now, we understand that, as we mentioned last week,

57
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:35,559
with some of that false teaching,

58
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:36,860
if you look in the second chapter

59
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,139
of the book of 2 Thessalonians,

60
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:39,139
there were those that were saying

61
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:41,020
that the day of the Lord was at hand.

62
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,139
And so there were some that, through this false teaching,

63
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:46,339
they thought that they didn't have to work anymore

64
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:47,179
and what have you.

65
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:48,619
No doubt there were probably others

66
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:51,080
for other reasons that didn't wanna work,

67
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,259
and we have certainly deal with that

68
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:55,679
throughout human history.

69
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:58,119
We see it in our time as well,

70
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:00,119
where there are some folks that just don't wanna work,

71
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:01,559
but it says here, working not at all.

72
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:04,000
Notice this, but are busybodies.

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Now, verse 12, them that are such,

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,919
we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ

75
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,279
that with quietness they work and eat their own bread.

76
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,960
Now, last week, when we looked at this situation

77
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,479
with the disorderly behavior,

78
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,440
we mentioned the fact that there were some

79
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,399
that were not working.

80
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:24,559
We see that in verse number 10.

81
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:26,839
If a man doesn't work, he shouldn't eat.

82
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,800
And we find that the really,

83
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,759
as we looked at that text of scripture,

84
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:33,960
that we needed to identify the disorderly behavior,

85
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,479
and then you correct the disorderly behavior.

86
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,600
The fact of the matter is that that correction,

87
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,679
that warning is given, but the response to the warning,

88
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:45,679
we have no control over.

89
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:48,600
And we have the responsibility to identify it

90
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,240
to give the warning or to correct it,

91
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,800
but we found in the text last week

92
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,399
that if they continue down that path,

93
00:03:56,399 --> 00:04:00,639
it comes to a place where we are to withdraw ourselves,

94
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,360
we see that in verse number six,

95
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,039
from every brother that walketh disorderly,

96
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,839
literally to separate from them,

97
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:09,759
to remove oneself or to depart.

98
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,559
As we come to verses 11 and 12,

99
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:14,759
we really continue to look at the instruction

100
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:18,640
that Paul is providing as he addresses specifically

101
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,760
this group of people,

102
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,160
and he refers to them as being busybodies.

103
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,160
Now, what is a busybody?

104
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,959
You've heard the term, no doubt,

105
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:29,720
but really an individual that would be identified

106
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,559
as being a busybody is one that is busy,

107
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:37,559
they busy oneself about trifling, needless, useless matters.

108
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:39,160
That's what they do.

109
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,000
They fill up their time with those things.

110
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,640
It's defined this way,

111
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,640
one who is inquisitive about others' affairs,

112
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,480
a meddling person,

113
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,679
one who concerns themselves with the affairs of others.

114
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:57,679
Can I tell you this evening that it's very easy

115
00:04:57,679 --> 00:05:00,799
to fall into a trap of being a busybody?

116
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,320
It really is.

117
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,720
It's very easy with,

118
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,320
especially in the day and age in which we live,

119
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,079
hey, did you hear about this clickbait stuff

120
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:12,040
that's on the internet and on social media

121
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,160
and all this sort of thing?

122
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,239
And people can really fill up their time

123
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:19,440
meddling in the affairs of others,

124
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,119
useless, just needless information

125
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:27,859
and matters that don't really impact or affect you,

126
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:31,679
but we can get so caught up with it, and it's a danger.

127
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:34,480
And we find that as we look at this text of Scripture

128
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,959
in verses 11 and 12,

129
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,160
we understand that Paul is writing

130
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,739
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

131
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,260
to a local church.

132
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,820
A local church is not a building,

133
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,540
it's a group of believers.

134
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,179
And we find that the local church is a family,

135
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:51,820
it's a body, it's those that have been saved

136
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,019
and baptized members of the church.

137
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:58,019
And we find that as the Apostle Paul is writing this letter,

138
00:05:58,019 --> 00:05:59,260
I want you this evening,

139
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,459
before we get into points and look at this,

140
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:03,980
I want you this evening to consider

141
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,619
being a member of the church at Thessalonica

142
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:09,720
and receiving this letter.

143
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:12,160
And as this letter is being read,

144
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,119
you're reading these things,

145
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:14,519
you start out in the first chapter,

146
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,760
man, their faith groweth exceedingly

147
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,959
and their love one toward another aboundeth.

148
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,279
And you're thinking, yes, this is great.

149
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,880
And then you get into the second chapter

150
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,640
and there's the instruction that's given

151
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,200
with regard to helping them understand

152
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,160
the timing of the end days and the return of Christ

153
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,640
and the appearance of the antichrist

154
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,399
and the abomination of desolation.

155
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:40,119
And all of those things are looked at in the second chapter

156
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:41,440
you come to the third chapter

157
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,239
and Paul begins by talking about praying for them

158
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:47,440
and the opportunities that are there.

159
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,440
And then he starts addressing disorderly behavior.

160
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:54,399
And then the Bible says this in verse number 11.

161
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,559
Now again, stay with me.

162
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:58,880
You're a member of the church at Thessalonica,

163
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,880
like just think that way tonight.

164
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,440
And as you are reading this,

165
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,480
for we hear that there are some

166
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,920
which walk among you disorderly,

167
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,880
working not at all, but are busybodies.

168
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:17,119
Not me.

169
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,559
I mean, I don't know who,

170
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:24,760
can you imagine the atmosphere?

171
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,559
The difference in excitement

172
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:32,559
from the first few verses of chapter one

173
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:35,359
to now these verses in chapter three.

174
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:38,799
And Paul says, we have heard.

175
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:40,640
So as we look at this passage of scripture,

176
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,559
I have two main thoughts for you

177
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:43,519
and then we're gonna close it up

178
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,440
with giving you three points of application this evening.

179
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,279
But number one, I want you to notice in verse number 11,

180
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,359
the exposure of busybodies.

181
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:53,760
They're exposed.

182
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,839
And we find that Paul has received a report.

183
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:00,239
I'm not sure how this report was delivered to him.

184
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:02,799
We find that he mentioned something similar to this

185
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:04,799
as he's writing to the church in Corinth.

186
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:07,160
As he's writing to them in the first chapter,

187
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,679
he says to them that they have,

188
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:14,000
it's been declared unto me of you, my brethren,

189
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,160
by them which are of the house of Chloe,

190
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,799
that there are contentions among you.

191
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:20,279
That's first Corinthians one and verse number 11.

192
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,839
And so there in the church in Corinth,

193
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,399
Paul says specifically who it was

194
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:26,000
that gave them the information.

195
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,760
It was those from the house of Chloe.

196
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,119
And they tell Paul there's contentions in the church.

197
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:33,960
There's problems, divisions.

198
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,880
And so Paul begins to address that.

199
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,340
Well, here in 2 Thessalonians,

200
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,340
we do not have the information with regard to who it was

201
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:46,039
that delivered this report to Paul.

202
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,119
But we find that Paul says,

203
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:50,760
for we hear that there are some

204
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,280
which walk among you disorderly.

205
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,960
And so it's no longer just a situation.

206
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,960
And we hinted at this last week

207
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,080
that it seemed obvious that there were those

208
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,840
that were behaving themselves disorderly.

209
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,440
And you get to verse number 11,

210
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,099
and it's no more a situation where this is a church

211
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:11,559
where it could or could not be applicable.

212
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,640
You ever been in a situation like,

213
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,840
well, that doesn't really apply to us.

214
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,239
No, no, it applied to the church of Thessalonica.

215
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:20,359
There were some there that were within the body of Christ

216
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:24,559
in this local church that were walking disorderly.

217
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,919
They did not work at all.

218
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:29,719
And they're referred to as being busybodies.

219
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:32,679
The exposure of busybodies.

220
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:36,960
Their disorderly behavior, not working at all,

221
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,239
as we see in verse number 11,

222
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:43,479
left them with some time on their hands.

223
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:45,080
They're not working.

224
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,000
They have this extra time, if you will.

225
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And with that time, they begin to use it inappropriately.

226
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,280
They begin to meddle in the affairs of others.

227
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,719
They begin to go, as we read on Sunday morning.

228
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:03,939
regard to those young widows, how they would go from house to house, and they would begin

229
00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:08,339
to engage themselves into the affairs of others.

230
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,279
And here we find, though it does not go into that level of detail, but we understand how

231
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:20,659
busybodies, what their behavior is like, and what they're typically going to do.

232
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:27,499
And we find that Paul, the Scriptures expose these individuals.

233
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:33,579
They no longer can hide behind, they no longer can excuse their behavior, no, the Scriptures

234
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:37,339
are exposing these busybodies.

235
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:45,119
I believe, as we look at this portion of Scripture and see the situation where they're not working

236
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:52,979
and they're called busybodies that we find this evening, that there is, let me put it

237
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:59,579
this way, if a child of God is doing all the things that they're supposed to do, I think

238
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:03,579
you probably find yourself by saying, I just don't have enough time.

239
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:09,299
Not that I have just this idle time to get engaged in the affairs of other people.

240
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:12,979
No, I don't have the time for that.

241
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:17,619
And I don't have the interest in that, but I don't have the time for it.

242
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:23,899
I mentioned this last week, how that so often I hear people today that mention about not

243
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:27,259
having time to do X, Y, or Z.

244
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:31,779
And the reality is that it always baffles my mind when I hear that.

245
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:33,679
Why do I say that?

246
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,979
We have more conveniences today than any other generation that's ever gone before us.

247
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:39,379
I mean, honestly.

248
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:42,459
You know, I think about it today.

249
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:44,299
Now I'm kind of a weird person.

250
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:49,619
I actually like going to the store, and I like buying my own food, okay?

251
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:54,299
I like going and picking out my own vegetables and my own fruit.

252
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:55,299
What am I getting at?

253
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:58,419
I don't want them to deliver it to my house, okay?

254
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:01,859
Now if you're getting food delivered, I'm not criticizing you, I'm not telling you you're

255
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:02,859
wrong.

256
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:04,139
I'm saying I'm weird.

257
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:05,899
I like going and doing it myself.

258
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:09,419
Look, I'm picky with my apples.

259
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:10,699
I'm picky with my grapes.

260
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:12,839
I don't want squishy grapes.

261
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,599
If you like squishy grapes, Lord bless you.

262
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:16,399
I don't like squishy grapes.

263
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,359
So when I go in and I'm going to buy my grapes, you know what I do?

264
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:21,559
I feel them.

265
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,559
Some of you smell them.

266
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,559
I don't smell them.

267
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:26,599
I don't know what they're supposed to smell like, but I feel them, and if they feel squishy,

268
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:28,699
that's not the bag for me.

269
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:29,699
But you know what?

270
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:33,599
The person at whatever place that's doing the Instacart, the whatever, they don't care

271
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:36,799
what they're giving you.

272
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,039
Why am I saying all that?

273
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:43,439
Because these are modern, you know what they had to do back in this time and in our grandparents'

274
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:44,439
time?

275
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:46,559
They had to go out to a field.

276
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:51,079
They had to go and, I mean, there was no local, there was no one that was going to deliver

277
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:54,799
their, I mean, it was, it was a lot of work.

278
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,399
Now I don't do much wash, admittedly, all right?

279
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,679
Joseph throws me under the bus for it.

280
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,999
He says, I can't believe you don't even know how to use the washing machine.

281
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:05,119
I said, Mommy takes care of that stuff, man.

282
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:09,919
I don't, I mean, I, when she went away for all that time to go visit with Nova, I said,

283
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,599
I need a lesson on the washing machine.

284
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:13,399
And he said, I can't believe that.

285
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:17,639
I just don't, Holly just takes care of it, and I'm more than happy to have her take care

286
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,639
of it.

287
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,639
Amen.

288
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:22,359
And so she gave me the instructions, because when she's gone for a month, I'm going to

289
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:24,639
have to do some laundry, and so I had to figure it out.

290
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,799
But you know how our great-grandparents had to do some laundry?

291
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,679
The washboard, do you ever, I've never used one.

292
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,919
I've seen them, right?

293
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:42,159
We have all these modern conveniences, but yet we say, I don't have time to read my Bible.

294
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:48,679
I don't have time to whatever it might be, spiritually speaking.

295
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:51,879
But then you start looking at the screen time.

296
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:56,619
Now if your device is like my device, every week you get this little alert that says your

297
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:59,359
screen time increased by or decreased by.

298
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:01,759
Does your phone do that for you?

299
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,039
And sometimes I look and I'm like, there is no way my screen time increased by that

300
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,099
much.

301
00:14:06,099 --> 00:14:09,519
And then I go back and I think in my week, and I'm like, oh yeah, I was driving somewhere

302
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:16,359
and I had the maps on for that whole trip, and it kind of calculates that in there.

303
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:19,599
You know, there's something, the studies are out there of how much time people spend on

304
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:24,839
social media just scrolling and scrolling and scrolling.

305
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,359
It's a danger.

306
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:33,199
And what happens is it lends itself to this busybody stuff, because all of a sudden we're

307
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,639
getting into the affairs of other folks that really are needless, useless matters, trifling

308
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,639
things.

309
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,159
And it's all because of the inquisitive nature of mankind.

310
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:49,359
Hey, did you hear about, and all of a sudden you don't even, yeah, it doesn't matter to

311
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:54,799
you what happened, but you got interest in the story, it's a problem.

312
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,279
So these folks, they weren't working, they were busybodies.

313
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:06,279
And we find the exposure, but then notice with me number two, the exhortation to busybodies.

314
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:13,439
The exhortation, in verse number 12, we find that the Bible says, now them that are such.

315
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:17,659
Paul doesn't call them out by name, but let me ask you this, did the Holy Spirit know

316
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:19,959
who they were by name?

317
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:21,479
Absolutely.

318
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:25,079
Could the Holy Spirit have chosen to put the names in there?

319
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,299
Sure He could.

320
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:28,959
Now them that are such.

321
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,959
I think about Achan, he's referred to in the book of Chronicles as being the troubler of

322
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,959
Israel.

323
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:39,879
No one knew when you start Joshua chapter number seven, that Achan was the one that

324
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:44,479
took the accursed thing, but God knew.

325
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:52,919
God gave Joshua the path forward for how to determine, take the tribe, take the house,

326
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,799
take the family, the house, the man.

327
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:01,279
Can you imagine Achan one by one as the family's, nope, not that one, it's this one right here,

328
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,239
and he knew he took it.

329
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:09,199
And so here the Scriptures just say, now them that are such.

330
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:15,679
In other words, examine yourself, and if the shoe fits, this is you.

331
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,679
Do you understand?

332
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:20,239
I mean, again, they were in the church at Thessalonica.

333
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:29,159
This is not a passage of Scripture as we would take it today as being God's Word, and it

334
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:36,719
could be that there's a church today that has no one that's a busybody, but that wasn't

335
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:37,719
the case in Thessalonica.

336
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:40,399
There were busybodies there.

337
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,759
They're exposed.

338
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,959
Now the exhortation is given, now them that are such, notice we command and exhort by

339
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,319
our Lord Jesus Christ.

340
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:50,599
What is the exhortation?

341
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:51,599
What is it?

342
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:56,879
Number one, that with quietness they work.

343
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:58,199
With quietness they work.

344
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:03,679
Now that doesn't actually mean that they work quietly as to regard to the decibel of their

345
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,879
activity.

346
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:09,559
The word quietness actually carries with it the idea of no more meddling.

347
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:16,679
Get away of that busybody stuff, go and work, and don't be concerned in the affairs of others.

348
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,719
And so it says, number one, what do they do?

349
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:19,959
They're to go and work.

350
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:21,879
With quietness they work.

351
00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:25,799
And then notice, and eat their own bread.

352
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,279
Now why does the Scripture say, eat their own bread?

353
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:34,519
Well obviously they were eating somebody's bread if they weren't working, right?

354
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:40,199
They're eating somebody's bread, whether, and we use the word to mooch off of someone

355
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:45,559
or whatever you want to use, they were eating bread somehow.

356
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:48,519
And Paul says, no, here's what you need to do.

357
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:52,479
With quietness you need to work and eat their own bread.

358
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:58,439
Now I said this last week, and it's worth repeating tonight, this is not, verses 6 through

359
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:05,439
12 is not instruction that's given to those that cannot work.

360
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:09,999
This is written to people that can work that are not working.

361
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:16,639
There's a great difference between somebody that physically is incapable of working because

362
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:21,519
of some health condition or whatever it may be.

363
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,479
That's a different situation than what we find here.

364
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:31,239
These people were able-bodied people that could go and work, but they chose not to work.

365
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:35,479
And they're eating other people's bread, and they're, whether they're, you know, show up

366
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:40,159
at the right time so that you can bring the story from the other folks that you're, I

367
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:42,959
got a story to tell you, oh it's lunch, hey do you want to have lunch?

368
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:49,479
I don't know how it all worked, but the reality is that they were given this instruction on

369
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:52,979
how they needed to correct their behavior.

370
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:59,299
As I look at these couple of verses and couple it with last week's lesson, I'm reminded of

371
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:01,819
three powerful truths.

372
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:07,099
And in closing this evening, I want you to consider these three truths that we find that

373
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:10,099
are applicable for each of us this evening.

374
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:15,459
Number one, God's Word confronts.

375
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:16,459
God's Word confronts.

376
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:17,699
What do I mean by that?

377
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:24,139
Well as you get into God's Word, God's Word will confront you in areas that you need to

378
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:27,299
examine and you need to deal with.

379
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:34,859
As we honestly and regularly study the Scriptures and read the Scriptures and attend church

380
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:39,699
where the Scriptures are being preached, then God's Word will confront us.

381
00:19:39,699 --> 00:19:44,939
There are times we could use the truth as we look at this passage of Scripture where

382
00:19:44,939 --> 00:19:49,979
we find that these busy bodies that were being exposed in this portion of Scripture,

383
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:53,699
they were being confronted with their behavior.

384
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:59,779
It reminds me when we think about how God's Word confronts that we...

385
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:07,979
must examine oneself. It's actually vital. See, so often, and I've said this many

386
00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:17,179
times, and you find it to be true, it's far easier for us to examine someone

387
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:24,939
else's life than for us to examine our own life. Far easier to be able to look

388
00:20:24,939 --> 00:20:32,299
down at someone else and be able to identify areas of weakness and areas of

389
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:39,059
error and what-have-you, but we don't like the personal self-examination.

390
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:43,899
It's important that we understand that when God's Word confronts us that we

391
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:49,059
must examine oneself, that the reality is that in we deal with the subject of

392
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:54,259
self-examination is that it requires two very important things. Number one, it

393
00:20:54,259 --> 00:21:04,619
requires honesty. It requires honesty, and it requires humility. Typically, human

394
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:09,859
nature is to think that we're better than we really are, to think that we

395
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:12,899
really don't have any problems, that, yeah, I know there's a lot of people that

396
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:17,259
that applies to, but it's not really for me. I've not heard it recently, thankfully,

397
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:20,899
but I remember years ago hearing somebody as they would leave church

398
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:24,559
from hearing a message, oh man, that would have been a great message for so

399
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,539
and so, I wish they were here. You missed the whole point, because God has

400
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:35,739
something for you in it as well. That's how God works through His Word. Oh man,

401
00:21:35,739 --> 00:21:39,579
I'm gonna get that message so I can share it with so-and-so, and we just

402
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:46,219
totally forget about ourselves. And so this evening we understand, number one,

403
00:21:46,219 --> 00:21:49,619
in closing, that God's Word confronts. Not only does God's Word confront, it

404
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:57,099
convicts. God's Word convicts. This is the work of the Holy Spirit. Conviction

405
00:21:57,099 --> 00:22:03,539
is the work of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit of God uses the Word of God to

406
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:08,179
bring conviction in the people of God. Can I tell you this evening, conviction

407
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:13,739
is a good thing. It's a good thing to be convicted. It's a good thing to have our

408
00:22:13,739 --> 00:22:17,539
toes stepped on. You hear sometimes, especially when you start thinking

409
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:21,739
about old-time preaching, and you hear about some of the Billy Sundays and

410
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:26,619
other guys say, man, they'd step on people's toes. No, listen, it's God's work

411
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:34,419
to do that, to convict. The Holy Spirit convicts us. We ought to be sensitive to

412
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:38,819
the leadership of the Spirit of God in our lives, and as the Holy Spirit of God

413
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:44,459
would put His finger in an area of our lives, we must respond to that. And we

414
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:48,699
find that as we look at this passage of Scripture, and I think, again, as I've

415
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:52,699
asked you this evening to put yourself in the position of being the church at

416
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:58,099
Thessalonica and receiving this letter and finding out, listen, there are some

417
00:22:58,099 --> 00:23:07,979
amongst us that are busybodies. I better examine myself. Is God talking about me?

418
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:13,459
Now, I understand we're not the church at Thessalonica, but I also understand that

419
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:19,019
there's probably very few churches in the world that have any size of a

420
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:24,579
congregation at all that have zero busybodies in it, all right? I don't have

421
00:23:24,579 --> 00:23:30,339
my head in the sand, all right? The Holy Spirit of God writes this and gives this,

422
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:34,459
yes, to the church at Thessalonica, but we find the truth is preserved for all of

423
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:43,619
the church age, and this evening, as God's Word confronts, we examine ourselves, and

424
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:49,139
the Holy Spirit of God begins to convict us and to put His finger, and I hope, I

425
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:54,659
don't know, but I hope that there were some in Thessalonica that readily

426
00:23:54,659 --> 00:24:01,899
acknowledge, yes, that's me. See, I'm thankful that God doesn't just leave us

427
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:07,059
to ourselves. You know what the Bible tells us? The Bible says, whom the Lord

428
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:17,219
loveth, He chasteneth. When you have children, if you have children, you

429
00:24:17,219 --> 00:24:23,699
correct them because you love them. Now, we're not perfect like God is, so there

430
00:24:23,699 --> 00:24:29,899
certainly are times that we correct with a motive that's not as pure as it ought

431
00:24:29,939 --> 00:24:38,139
to be. Is that fair? But God is perfect, and God loves, and therefore, God convicts,

432
00:24:38,139 --> 00:24:43,259
and He corrects. He doesn't just leave us over to ourselves. No, He wants us to live

433
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:47,019
our lives in such a way that we're walking worthy so that we might

434
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:51,579
please Him, and so He provides this instruction, and through His Word, He

435
00:24:51,579 --> 00:24:56,459
confronts, He convicts, and then I would say, as we look at this passage, that God's

436
00:24:56,739 --> 00:25:02,099
Word corrects. The behavior is corrected. In verse number 12, the remedy is

437
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:08,179
provided. The reality is that if you were in the church at Thessalonica and you

438
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:14,099
acknowledged after receiving and hearing the words of this epistle that, yes, I am

439
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:21,379
a busybody, that is me, I am guilty, then you look at the truth of the exhortation

440
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:27,299
and the command in verse number 12 that God's Word corrects. How do I make

441
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:33,939
this behavior appropriate? What do I do so that I can please God? Well, in this

442
00:25:33,939 --> 00:25:40,339
context, go to work and eat your own bread. That's what it says, that with

443
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:47,419
quietness they work and eat their own bread. Now, the correction must be

444
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:53,659
accepted. How do we respond? No doubt, because I know human history, I know

445
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:59,539
human tendency, and you know human tendency and human nature. I'm assuming

446
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:04,339
the Scriptures do not tell us, but just by knowing how humans deal with things,

447
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:08,139
that there were probably some in Thessalonica that were busybodies that

448
00:26:08,139 --> 00:26:15,059
did not accept that they were a busybody. That's not me. I mean, that

449
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:19,179
might be Tom, but that's not me. They didn't have, you understand what I'm

450
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:25,299
saying. And this evening, as we look at a passage of Scripture like this and we

451
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:30,619
see the exposure of these busybodies, we see the exhortation, we're reminded

452
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:37,939
tonight of how God's Word, how God uses His Word in the lives of His people.

453
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:46,219
That's why it's so vital that we have a proper daily time with God and His Word,

454
00:26:46,219 --> 00:26:50,539
because God's Word will confront us about our behavior, about the things that

455
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:55,379
we're doing or not doing, and as God's Word confronts us, the Holy Spirit of

456
00:26:55,379 --> 00:27:01,419
God begins to convict us, using His Word to convict us of, hey, what you're doing

457
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:05,899
is not right, or hey, you're not doing this thing and you should be doing this

458
00:27:05,939 --> 00:27:10,259
thing, and we have that conviction, but you know the reality is that we can be

459
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:16,619
convicted, we can be stirred, and then not receive the correction and not take that

460
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:22,499
step of altering or changing our behavior so that it's aligned with what

461
00:27:22,499 --> 00:27:28,779
God has prescribed. We find that as God's Word corrects, as the remedy is provided,

462
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:32,899
that it's absolutely essential that every believer, those that would be in

463
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:38,139
this particular category and setting, busybodies, that they take heed and that

464
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:44,579
they respond properly. But this truth this evening of God's Word confronting

465
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:50,339
and convicting and correcting is a truth that's applicable in a variety of areas

466
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:56,059
of our lives, and we study the Scriptures and we read the Scriptures so that God

467
00:27:56,219 --> 00:28:03,899
can help me be the believer that I'm supposed to be. I know that it's a very

468
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:09,099
popular, it's probably not as popular as it was several years ago, but you would

469
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:16,259
see regularly, you still see it today, this WWJD. And how many of you know what

470
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:19,059
that stands for? All right, some of you know. All right, what does it stand for?

471
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:26,899
Help me out. What would Jesus do? All right, you know what I believe? I believe

472
00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:31,619
that most people that wear that paraphernalia that says WWJD have

473
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:38,419
absolutely no idea what Jesus would do because they don't have a relationship

474
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:44,619
with this book. They don't study the life of Christ. You see in their behavior, they

475
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:51,139
have the WWJD, but they don't study the Scriptures to know. Listen, Peter said that

476
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:56,339
Christ left us an example that we should follow His steps. Paul tells us in the book of Romans

477
00:28:56,339 --> 00:29:02,659
that we are to be conformed to the image of His dear Son, in Romans 8 and verse 29, speaking

478
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:06,379
about God, speaking about Jesus, and we're to be conformed to His image. We're to be

479
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:13,379
like Him. Why in Antioch did they call them Christians? Well, because their behavior was

480
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:21,219
that of Christ, and so they were called Christians first in Antioch. And so this evening as we

481
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:27,419
look at the context and we see what's happening in Thessalonica, that we can broaden the scope

482
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:33,899
this evening and say that God's Word will confront, convict, and correct in a variety

483
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:40,899
of areas of our lives. In our thinking, our behavior must be aligned with God's Word.

484
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:51,259
We must be able to prove what is acceptable unto the Lord. Do you remember at the end

485
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:56,419
of 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, it was one of the studies that we did several weeks ago

486
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:59,539
in verse 21, prove all.

487
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:04,899
things, hold fast that which is good.

488
00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:08,659
And we find that as we couple that with the book of Ephesians where the Bible tells us

489
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:14,679
that we're to prove what is acceptable unto the Lord, that we understand that we must,

490
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:17,619
we must get into God's Word.

491
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:25,539
This church received this letter to expose some behavior that needed to be corrected.

492
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:33,819
But it didn't just expose, there was an exhortation given, there was instruction provided for

493
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:38,219
how to correct and how to please God.

494
00:30:38,219 --> 00:30:43,139
The study has been titled for all of these weeks now, this is our 20th lesson through

495
00:30:43,139 --> 00:30:47,499
1st and 2nd Thessalonians, these just the last chapters and the last sections of the

496
00:30:47,499 --> 00:30:54,859
last chapters in our 20th lesson to walk worthy and please God.

497
00:30:54,859 --> 00:31:01,699
These individuals that are exposed, that are confronted, they were not walking worthy.

498
00:31:01,699 --> 00:31:04,819
They were not pleasing God.

499
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:13,859
But God gives them instruction so that they can change, alter, confess, repent, and they

500
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:16,939
can walk worthy and please God.

501
00:31:16,939 --> 00:31:23,919
I'm so thankful that we have a gracious Heavenly Father who loves us so much that He gives

502
00:31:23,979 --> 00:31:32,599
us truth and then He takes the interest in our lives individually, that when we sit down

503
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:38,559
to study the Scriptures, to read the Scriptures, when we come to a church service, that we

504
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,839
have the opportunity, Lord, would You speak to me?

505
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:45,719
God, would You give me something from Your Word?

506
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:47,959
Would You correct my behavior?

507
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:52,759
Lord, would You show me if there's something I need to do that I'm not doing?

508
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:58,319
God, would You show me if there's something that I'm not doing that I need to do?

509
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:03,519
God has that personal interest in our lives that He answers that prayer.

510
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:12,439
Why is it that we on Sunday morning and Sunday evening have a time of prayer before the service?

511
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:13,599
A couple of reasons.

512
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:18,359
Number one, God said, Jesus said that His house should be a house of prayer and a number

513
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:23,639
of years ago now it was under great conviction that we almost, in our church services, use

514
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:25,119
prayer like bookends.

515
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:28,079
We'd pray to open the service and say, God, would You bless the service, and we'd pray

516
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:32,559
to close the service and say, thank You for blessing the service.

517
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:39,599
But a time to pray specifically during that time, the morning service, the evening service,

518
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:45,159
those few moments that we have of prayer time is really not designed to be praying for Aunt

519
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:52,599
Susie who has a, no, no, the time is to be fixed upon praying for the service, what's

520
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:55,959
at hand, and God, speak to me.

521
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:57,839
God, use the preacher.

522
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:02,519
You know, there's spiritual warfare that takes place when you're trying to preach the Bible.

523
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:06,639
God, would You help me to not be distracted, to be attentive?

524
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:12,119
God, I know I came this morning expecting, I came this evening expecting to hear from

525
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:15,919
You, and God, show me.

526
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:25,119
Sometimes I think that if we're not careful, we can get to the time of invitation, and

527
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:31,919
I'm not saying any of this to try to emotionally impact anyone, but I think that if we're not

528
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:38,599
careful, we can get to a time of invitation where God has confronted us and God has convicted

529
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:44,839
us, but we don't take that step of dealing with it.

530
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:47,159
God, help me.

531
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:50,479
Help me to be a doer of the Word and not a hearer only.

532
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:51,799
Help me to apply those things.

533
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:55,799
Help me to confess, and sometimes I think that if we're not careful, we can have the

534
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:00,239
mindset of, well, if I go forward in invitation, everyone's going to think I'm a sinner.

535
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:02,759
Everyone already knows you're a sinner, amen?

536
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:05,839
For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, amen?

537
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:06,839
We already know that.

538
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:08,999
They're going to think my life's messed up.

539
00:34:08,999 --> 00:34:11,379
Why do you care?

540
00:34:11,379 --> 00:34:15,479
Just do business with God, amen?

541
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:20,119
God's Word is powerful, and I'm thankful for the ministry of the Word.

542
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:27,679
We see it at work in the Church of Thessalonica and how God was confronting and addressing

543
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:33,399
these individuals and seeking to correct their behavior so that they could please God.

544
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:34,399
Let's pray together.

545
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,399
Father, we love You.

546
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:36,399
We thank You for loving us.

547
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:37,959
We thank You for Your Word.

548
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:43,159
Thank You, God, for the truth, the application.

549
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,879
I pray, Lord, that You'd help us to be sensitive to Your leadership.

550
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:48,799
Help us, Lord, to be doers of Your Word.

551
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:50,159
I pray that You'd bless the time of prayer.

552
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,159
We thank You for it.

553
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:54,639
I pray that You'd move and work as only You can, and we'll thank You for it in Christ's

554
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,639
name we pray, amen.

555
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,359
Does anyone need a bulletin this evening?

556
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,359
You didn't get one.

557
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:00,439
We don't have any left, so if you didn't get one, you should come earlier next week.
