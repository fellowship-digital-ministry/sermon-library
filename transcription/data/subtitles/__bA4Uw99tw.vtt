WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.799
to number two this morning.

00:00:01.799 --> 00:00:05.360
And last week, we really entered the third phase

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.719
of our annual theme.

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:09.119
Our theme, as you see on the banners here

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:10.520
behind me this morning,

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.079
great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.960
And Psalm 48, verses one and two

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.959
has been our theme song all year.

00:00:16.959 --> 00:00:19.180
And we sang that through twice this morning.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.799
We sing it for each of our services

00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:23.440
and certainly thank the Lord for the truth

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.879
that he has revealed to us in his precious word

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:28.360
that he is a great God.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.280
And phase number one, as we started

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.760
in the month of January,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.200
was really to discover God's greatness.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.840
I believe, and I made the statement

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.599
in the very first Sunday of the year,

00:00:37.599 --> 00:00:40.360
that everyone that walked through these doors that morning

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.799
would have said, I believe that God is great.

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:47.119
But if we really wanna add some meat to that statement,

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:49.080
we would say, why is God great?

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.659
And I've preached through a number of messages

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.119
where God has revealed and declared to us his greatness

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:57.919
and thus we have discovered the very truth

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:59.639
and we can say with the Psalmist,

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:04.639
as he said in Psalm 135, I know that the Lord is great.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.739
And we find that as we've understood

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:08.160
and discovered the greatness of God,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.919
we then transition into phase number two.

00:01:09.919 --> 00:01:11.199
I don't remember exactly the dates,

00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:12.919
I could look back at the messages,

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:14.680
but we transitioned into phase number two

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.199
and really dealt with the importance

00:01:16.199 --> 00:01:18.699
of declaring God's greatness.

00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:20.000
We live in the midst of a people,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.419
we live in the midst of a world

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:23.419
that many that we come in contact with,

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:26.239
they do not know how great our God is.

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:29.839
And the Psalmist in understanding that our God is great,

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:33.239
he says, I will declare thy greatness

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:35.000
and we have a great privilege,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.160
we have a great responsibility

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.360
to let others know how great our God is

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.919
and truly this morning we serve a great God.

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:46.000
Phase number three started last week

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.339
and really as we finish out the calendar year

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:49.959
with this theme of great is the Lord

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:51.360
and greatly to be praised,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.720
the idea of this third phase, if you will,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.519
of our theme is having a desire

00:01:57.519 --> 00:02:01.160
to live in light of God's greatness.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.919
So in other words, let me say it this way,

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:05.720
because of what I understand

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.000
regarding the person of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.720
and the greatness of God,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.039
it should have an impact on how I live my life.

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:18.520
What we believe impacts our behavior,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.679
our behavior reveals what we believe.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.479
And as we started last week with this third phase,

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:29.360
we really started and began in the area of prayer,

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:31.600
in prayer.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.240
I asked this question last week,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.779
what is it that we're praying about?

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.240
What is it that's on your prayer list,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.639
that's on my prayer list that only God can do?

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:42.199
What is it about your prayer life and my prayer life

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:46.839
that reveals truly that we believe that God is great,

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:49.199
that God is the God of the impossible,

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:51.160
that God is the God that says,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.800
is anything too hard for me,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.679
that God is the God that said,

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.679
call unto me and I will answer thee

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:00.320
and show thee great and mighty things

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.639
which thou knowest not,

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.039
the God who said that he's able to do

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:09.039
exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:13.000
And I wonder this morning, as we examine our prayer lives,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.160
what is it in your prayer life and my prayer life

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.800
that reveals that we believe God is great?

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.839
Last week, we looked at Psalm 34

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:25.160
and we considered the prayer life of David

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.279
and we considered how that David said,

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:31.119
this poor man cried and the Lord heard him,

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:33.639
delivered him out of all of his troubles.

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.160
What a wonderful truth that we find there in Psalm 34

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.960
and the wonderful truth for us is that David is rehearsing,

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.639
he is sharing his own personal experience

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.039
and how he cried unto the Lord,

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:46.679
he sought the Lord and God delivered

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:48.279
and God answered and God worked,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.559
but he tells us in several verses later

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:54.839
that the righteous cry and the Lord heard them

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:57.839
and the Lord delivered them out of all their troubles

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:00.520
and what a blessing to know that God hears us.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.479
Now, we have a God who is able to do the impossible.

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.520
This morning, as we consider the subject of prayer again

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.559
and we'll do it again next week as well,

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:11.800
I wanna consider the life of Daniel,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.520
the life of Daniel.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.440
As we think about Daniel, as we mentioned the character,

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.279
the Bible character Daniel and our mind floods

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.839
with a number of events that are recorded in God's word

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:26.399
with regard to Daniel, perhaps even some particular areas

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:30.480
in which we would be aware of and have the knowledge

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.760
of Daniel being a man of prayer.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.920
If we're to ask this morning and we're to fill out

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.119
a form of some level of tell me what you know about Daniel,

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:41.959
I'm sure that for many of us,

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:43.880
one of the things that would be on our list

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.079
is that Daniel was a man of prayer.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.760
How do we say that?

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.279
Well, most of us are familiar with Daniel chapter number six

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:52.239
the events in Daniel six are quite familiar.

00:04:52.239 --> 00:04:54.040
We won't be looking at them this morning,

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.239
but Daniel chapter number six,

00:04:56.239 --> 00:04:59.480
remember there was a law that was signed into writing

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.440
that no one was allowed to ask any petitions

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.239
of anyone other than the King.

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:07.279
And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed,

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:08.239
what did he do?

00:05:08.239 --> 00:05:10.600
Well, he went in and he prayed.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.440
He went in and he prayed.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.559
He knew that the writing had been signed.

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:17.720
He understood, he was aware of the consequences

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.399
of his decision that he would be cast into a den of lions.

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:24.079
And the Bible tells us that he went, he went home,

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:26.959
he opened his chambers toward Jerusalem.

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:28.320
I mean, he was not afraid.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.320
He was not dealing with any type of distress over this.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.559
He kneeled down on his knees and the Bible tells us

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:37.359
that three times a day he prayed

00:05:37.359 --> 00:05:39.279
and gave thanks before his God.

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:41.440
But there's a little phrase that at the end of verse number

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.040
10 of Daniel six that says this, as he did a four time.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.760
Daniel didn't pray because it was constituted being illegal.

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:57.640
He didn't pray because there was a signature

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.440
on some legislation that said you can't pray.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.559
No, Daniel prayed because he was a man of prayer.

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:07.559
Daniel prayed because he believed that he served a God

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:10.880
who hears and answers prayer.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.760
We find in Daniel chapter number six

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.600
that he's a man of prayer.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.079
We know in Daniel chapter number nine,

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:19.760
as you read the prayer of Daniel,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.839
what a powerful prayer it is.

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:26.399
In fact, he says that he set my face under the Lord God

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:30.000
to seek my prayer and supplications with fasting

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.799
and sackcloth and ashes and I prayed under the Lord my God.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.920
Daniel nine records a powerful prayer in Daniel's life.

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:41.679
Daniel was a man of prayer.

00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:45.239
Daniel believed that God heard and answered prayer.

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:47.760
This morning, I wanna focus our attention

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.920
and examine an event in Daniel's life

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.600
that's recorded for us in Daniel chapter two.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.200
I've asked you to turn there this morning

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.559
and as we look and really the truth

00:06:57.559 --> 00:07:01.339
of this particular passage, we could spend so much time

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:03.720
looking at all of the details with regard

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.059
to the circumstances, but we really wanna focus

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:09.940
our attention this morning on the middle section

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.859
of Daniel chapter number two because that's

00:07:11.859 --> 00:07:15.619
where we read about the prayer of Daniel.

00:07:15.619 --> 00:07:18.200
Begin looking there with me at verse number seven.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.700
The Bible says, they answered again,

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.700
this is those that Nebuchadnezzar had called,

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.380
the magicians, astrologers, sorcerers, and Chaldeans.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.220
They answered Nebuchadnezzar, they said this,

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.700
let the king tell his servants the dream

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.100
and we will show the interpretation of it.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.000
The king answered and said, I know of certainty

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.220
that you would gain the time because you see

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.980
the thing is gone from me, but if you will not make known

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.100
unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.940
for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.660
to speak before me till the time be changed.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.260
Therefore, tell me the dream and I shall know

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.500
that ye can show me the interpretation thereof.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.739
The Chaldeans answered in verse number 10 before the king

00:07:56.739 --> 00:07:59.540
and said, there is not a man upon the earth

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.899
that can show the king's matter.

00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:04.679
Therefore, there is no king, lord, nor ruler

00:08:04.679 --> 00:08:08.160
that asks such things of any magician

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.079
or astrologer or Chaldean.

00:08:10.079 --> 00:08:13.160
And it is a rare thing that the king requireth.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.519
There's none other that can show it before the king

00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:19.679
except the gods whose dwelling is not with flesh.

00:08:19.679 --> 00:08:22.279
Now skip down, if you will, to verse number 18, 19.

00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:25.420
The Bible says this, then was the secret revealed

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.760
unto Daniel in a night vision.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.519
Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.

00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:33.059
I'm gonna preach a message that I've titled there

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:37.900
from verse number 19, the secret was revealed unto Daniel.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.580
The secret was revealed unto Daniel.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.099
As we look at this passage of scripture,

00:08:42.099 --> 00:08:44.179
we find in verses seven through 16,

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:45.380
if you're taking notes this morning,

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.500
number one, the situation reported.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.340
The situation reported, Nebuchadnezzar had a dream

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.700
according to verse number one.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.320
And the Bible tells us that in this dream,

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.059
that he was troubled greatly or as a result of the dream,

00:08:57.059 --> 00:08:58.380
he was troubled greatly.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.179
He commanded these magicians and astrologers

00:09:01.179 --> 00:09:04.739
and sorcerers and Chaldeans to enter into his presence.

00:09:04.739 --> 00:09:07.419
And here's what he required of them.

00:09:07.419 --> 00:09:10.619
Tell me the dream and the interpretation.

00:09:10.619 --> 00:09:13.780
Now, oftentimes, as you consider even that

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.260
which is reported here in the book,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.020
in the second chapter of the book of Daniel,

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.380
when someone would have a dream

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.239
and they would call the magicians and astrologers

00:09:20.239 --> 00:09:21.940
and all these people in to interpret,

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.919
what they would do, the standard format,

00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:26.380
is they would tell the dream

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.340
and then those people would give an interpretation.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.419
Well, here, Daniel says, I don't remember the dream.

00:09:32.419 --> 00:09:34.099
And so you have to tell me the dream

00:09:34.099 --> 00:09:36.539
and you have to tell me the interpretation.

00:09:36.539 --> 00:09:38.460
And so these magicians and astrologers

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.820
and sorcerers and Chaldeans,

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.419
they're saying, no, this is impossible.

00:09:42.419 --> 00:09:44.059
I mean, you're asking us a hard thing.

00:09:44.059 --> 00:09:46.719
There's no man, notice what he says in verse number 10.

00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:49.219
These men that are brought before the presence

00:09:49.219 --> 00:09:51.020
of Nebuchadnezzar, they say,

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.820
there is not a man upon the earth

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.299
that can show the king's matter.

00:09:56.299 --> 00:09:57.780
I mean, they were beside themselves.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.340
They said, this is impossible,

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.580
what you're asking us to.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.880
to do, you're telling us that you had a dream

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.380
and it's troubled you, but you can't tell us the dream

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.400
and you want us to tell you the dream and the interpretation.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.920
You've lost your mind, this is impossible.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.600
There's not a man upon the earth.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.200
Therefore, they say this, there is no king, lord,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.680
nor ruler that asks such things as any magician,

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.720
astrologer, or Chaldean.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.360
No one has ever been asked to do this before.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.360
That's what they're saying to Nebuchadnezzar.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.480
You're putting us in a terrible position.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.240
And the situation is reported to us,

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.040
it seems as we look at the text of scripture,

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.100
it seems quite obvious that Daniel is unaware

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.600
of these events that are transpiring for us

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.880
that are being recorded to us in the first several verses

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.600
of Daniel chapter number two.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.600
I'm not sure where he was at the particular time,

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.520
what's going on, but he is unaware of what has transpired.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.200
And so with these that had been gathered,

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.600
unable to answer the king,

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.480
Nebuchadnezzar is in a fit of rage.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.800
The Bible tells us that the king responds,

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.080
notice in verse number 12,

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.280
for this cause the king was angry and very furious

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:12.280
and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.300
This irate ruler now issues an irrational decree,

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.180
kill all the wise men.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.640
Can you imagine?

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.320
Daniel, by the way, would have been part

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.680
of that group of people.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.320
And we find that as we look at what's taking place,

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.160
the captain, the king's captain,

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.920
a man by the name of Ariok is introduced to us here

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.640
with regard to what's taking place

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.000
because the decree went forth.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.440
Notice this irate ruler makes this irrational decree

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.680
in verse number 12 to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.120
And it tells us in verse number 13

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.520
that the decree went forth

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.400
that the wise men should be slain.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.220
The wise men should be slain.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.720
And they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.080
So Daniel and his three companions,

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.040
Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.880
are not there at the particular time.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.720
And so they're going to seek for them

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.880
because they need to be part of the company

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.480
of all the wise men that are going to be sentenced,

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.000
put to death because the king has made this decree.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.620
The Bible tells us that they're seeking for them

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.920
and it tells us in verse 14,

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.280
then Daniel answered,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.480
notice what the Bible says,

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.680
with counsel and wisdom.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.940
The way every day of our lives, we need God's wisdom.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.200
Daniel did not know what was going to happen

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.520
on this particular day,

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.480
but we know that Daniel was a man of prayer.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.080
And perhaps even as I've said before,

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.840
every day of our lives, we need wisdom

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.880
and we ought to pray God give us wisdom.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.880
I don't know what I'm going to face today,

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.120
but I know that you know what I'm going to face today.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.060
And I need wisdom.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.980
If any man lack, let him ask of God

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.040
who giveth liberally and upbraideth not.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.700
If we lack wisdom, we go to the all wise God

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.340
who promises to give wisdom.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.140
And here Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.540
to Ariok, the captain of the king's guard,

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.500
which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.300
Listen, this situation is an unfortunate situation.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.100
Daniel begins to have this conversation with Ariok.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.380
Notice in verse 15,

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.800
he answered and said to Ariok, the king's captain,

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.600
why is the decree so hasty from the king?

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.360
Then Ariok made the thing known to Daniel.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.760
So that particular time,

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.740
Daniel is informed of what we've just read

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.280
with regard to Nebuchadnezzar having a dream

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.200
and all of these individuals being brought to his presence

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.600
and their inability to be able to provide

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.880
the dream and the interpretation.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.600
And Daniel is brought up to speed, so to speak,

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.840
with the events that have happened on this particular day.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:53.720
And he finds out from Ariok why this thing is being done

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:58.720
so hasty and why the king has made this irrational decree.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.400
We find that Daniel, as he's informed of this situation

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.000
that is being reported to us in Daniel chapter number two,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.320
it's really the response of Daniel

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.260
that I wanna focus on this morning.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.040
And we find that if you're taking notes,

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.960
number two this morning in verses 17 and 18,

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.040
I want you to notice not only do we see,

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.760
first of all, the situation reported,

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.520
but we see number two, the supplication recorded.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.160
The supplication recorded.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.360
Daniel, according to verse number 16,

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.000
as he responds to Ariok after hearing

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.720
of what transpired this particular day,

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.080
the Bible says that then Daniel went in

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.560
and desired of the king that he would give him time

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.600
and that he would show the king the interpretation.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.860
This is very interesting to me,

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.160
the request that's made

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.480
and understanding the response of Daniel

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.360
and the supplication that's recorded.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.240
We notice even in verse number 16,

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.200
as he says give him time

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.160
and notice what he says at the end of the verse

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.680
that he would show the king the interpretation.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.280
There's a measure of confidence on the part of Daniel.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.100
Why?

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.200
Because Daniel knows who God is.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.480
Daniel understands the greatness of God.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.920
Daniel understands the God who he serves.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.160
No doubt in my life,

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.640
Daniel has seen God answer prayer in his life.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.400
And we find that Daniel requests this time.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.000
Now it's interesting because in verse number eight,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.200
when those people that had been gathered

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.960
into Nebuchadnezzar's presence,

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.560
the king answered and said in verse number eight,

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.960
I know of certainty that you would gain the time

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.840
because you see the thing is gone from me.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.680
And so he says to them in verse number nine,

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.620
but if you will not make known unto me the dream,

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.320
there is but one decree for you,

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.440
for you have prepared lying and corrupt words

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.620
to speak before me.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.440
Tell me the dream and I shall know

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.500
that you can show me the interpretation thereof.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.840
And so we find that Daniel then says to the king,

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.840
give me some time and I'll show you the interpretation.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.560
There's a measure of confidence on the part of Daniel.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.960
And Daniel makes this request,

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.800
but really as we think about the supplication

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.680
that is recorded for us here

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.920
in this passage of scripture,

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.440
we find in verse 17 that the Bible tells us

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.480
then Daniel went to his house,

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.520
noticed and made the thing known to Hananiah,

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.320
Mishael and Azariah, his companions.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.280
Notice the first statement of verse 18

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:19.280
that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.220
concerning this secret.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.060
You know what they did?

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.640
They had a prayer meeting.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.940
They had a prayer meeting.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.360
And I would submit to you this morning

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:33.360
that this irate ruler that made this irrational decree,

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.920
kill all the wise men.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:37.920
Can you imagine?

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.480
And Daniel's immediate response, pray, pray, pray.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.160
He hears of what's transpired.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.320
He says, give me some time

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.440
because we need to have a prayer meeting.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.680
We have a prayer meeting.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.720
I think about the truth, hold your place here

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.760
and turn to the book of Philippians, if you will.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.240
And I want you to look at a couple

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.520
of New Testament principles

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.880
and we'll get back to Daniel chapter number two here

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.720
in just a moment.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.520
But in Philippians chapter number four,

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.980
we read a passage, a truth that is quite familiar to us.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.980
We find that in Philippians four and verse number six,

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.980
the Bible says be careful for nothing.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.480
Truly that means not to be full of care,

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.080
not to worry.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.520
How many of you hear people say, I'm not worried,

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.320
I'm just concerned.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.920
Man, we learn how to twist things up, don't we?

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.740
Honestly, be careful for nothing.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:50.600
But in everything, by prayer and supplication

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:59.880
with thanksgiving, let your request be made known unto God.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.160
In Daniel chapter number two,

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.080
if Daniel would have responded with worry,

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.460
with full of care, how would that have helped him?

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.540
It would have helped him the same way it helps you.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.380
Not at all.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.060
Somebody said of worry, it's like a rocking chair.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.960
It'll keep you busy, but it won't get you anywhere.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.660
You ever sit in a rocking chair?

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.560
You can rock all day and you don't move.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.320
You're not getting anywhere.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.360
It'll keep you busy.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.220
Somebody said, well, everything I worry about,

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.739
it just never happens.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.420
As if their worry made it not happen.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.080
Actually, what that reveals to us

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.040
is we worry about a lot of things

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.860
that never actually come to pass.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.880
And here, the Bible says be careful for nothing.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.360
But in everything, by prayer and supplication

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:02.360
with thanksgiving, let your request be made known unto God.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.920
I am so thankful that we have a God

00:19:07.239 --> 00:19:10.220
who has extended to us an invitation

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.559
that we can let our request be made known unto him.

00:19:13.559 --> 00:19:16.280
And by the way, he can do something about it.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.239
Isn't that awesome?

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.799
Daniel, he hears, I mean, listen,

00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:23.860
I've never received news like Daniel received

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.320
in Daniel chapter number two.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.500
I'm guessing that you haven't either.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.360
I'm guessing that you've never received news

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.280
that, hey, we've come to get you

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.200
because we're taking you to be slain.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.679
I've never received that news.

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:42.000
I'm not sure how I'd respond in that circumstance

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.960
or in that situation.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.400
But I hope we'd respond like Daniel.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.239
Can you give us some time?

00:19:47.239 --> 00:19:49.260
We gotta have a prayer meeting.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.059
We gotta seek the face of God.

00:19:52.059 --> 00:19:55.020
Notice the truth in 1 Timothy chapter number two.

00:19:56.619 --> 00:19:59.340
Paul speaking here to his son of the faith, Timothy.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.739
We understand that Paul was.

00:20:00.739 --> 00:20:05.599
man of prayer. Paul was a man that as God would use him to record much of our

00:20:05.599 --> 00:20:09.619
New Testament, to be the human penman for much of our New Testament, we find that

00:20:09.619 --> 00:20:15.999
that many times God allowed for the Apostle Paul to write to those that he

00:20:15.999 --> 00:20:20.059
ministered to and to record the prayers that he offered for those particular

00:20:20.059 --> 00:20:25.459
people. And what a blessing to hear how Paul was praying. He didn't just simply

00:20:25.459 --> 00:20:29.899
say on many occasions, I'm praying for you. No, he said I'm praying for you and

00:20:29.899 --> 00:20:34.419
here's how I'm praying for you. And he prayed according to what he understood

00:20:34.419 --> 00:20:39.099
with regard to who God is. And in 1st Timothy 2 as he's giving this

00:20:39.099 --> 00:20:42.939
instruction under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God to his son in the

00:20:42.939 --> 00:20:50.219
faith Timothy, he says in verse number 1, I exhort therefore that first of all, I

00:20:50.219 --> 00:20:55.019
have it underlined in my Bible that phrase first of all. Why? Because there is

00:20:55.019 --> 00:21:03.579
a priority that God places upon the subject of prayer. Not last of all, but

00:21:03.579 --> 00:21:07.779
first of all. How many times if we'd be honest this morning we are guilty in our

00:21:07.779 --> 00:21:12.339
lives of trying to do so many things to resolve so many issues and then when

00:21:12.339 --> 00:21:18.179
everything fails we say you know maybe we should pray about this. Prayer should

00:21:18.179 --> 00:21:24.939
be our first response, not our last resort. And he says first of all,

00:21:24.939 --> 00:21:33.739
supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men. He

00:21:33.739 --> 00:21:38.699
says in verse number 8, I will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy

00:21:38.819 --> 00:21:49.419
hands without wrath and doubting. Wow. The first response. The immediate response to

00:21:49.419 --> 00:21:54.339
the situation back in Daniel 2. Go back there with me. The immediate response is

00:21:54.339 --> 00:21:58.139
Daniel saying we need some time because we need to have a prayer meeting. We

00:21:58.139 --> 00:22:01.739
have a prayer meeting. Listen, Daniel did not gather his friends and try to

00:22:01.739 --> 00:22:07.179
develop an escape route. How are we gonna avoid this? What are we

00:22:07.179 --> 00:22:10.579
gonna do? We need to have some time so that we can just plan our escape and how

00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:13.579
are we gonna get out of the city? How can we get out of here without anyone

00:22:13.579 --> 00:22:18.259
knowing? How can we change our countenance or our image so that people

00:22:18.259 --> 00:22:25.619
don't know who we are? No, no. That's not what Daniel does. He prays. He prays. It says in

00:22:25.619 --> 00:22:32.299
verse number 17 that he enlisted his companions and Daniel went to his house

00:22:32.299 --> 00:22:36.979
and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions. You know

00:22:36.979 --> 00:22:41.939
there's something powerful about corporate prayer. Corporate prayer. I'm

00:22:41.939 --> 00:22:48.779
thankful that I can go to God anytime for anything by myself. I can go to God. I can

00:22:48.779 --> 00:22:53.099
pray and so can you. But you know there's something about corporate prayer. Having a

00:22:53.099 --> 00:23:00.379
prayer meeting. Praying together. Wednesday evenings we have prayer and Bible study. Why?

00:23:00.379 --> 00:23:06.139
Because we believe that God answers prayer or pray corporately. We find that

00:23:06.139 --> 00:23:12.019
he enlists his companions and we find that the Bible says in verse 18 that

00:23:12.019 --> 00:23:20.339
they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret. We find

00:23:20.339 --> 00:23:26.179
that as Daniel would enlist his friends he no doubt these companions, Hananiah,

00:23:26.179 --> 00:23:30.459
Mishael, and Azariah, they're made aware of the situation and they, I believe that as

00:23:30.459 --> 00:23:35.539
they go and pray, notice the specific aspect in verse 18 that Daniel and his

00:23:35.539 --> 00:23:41.339
fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. There was only

00:23:41.339 --> 00:23:46.419
one way to avoid being put to death and that was to give the king the dream and

00:23:46.419 --> 00:23:51.499
the interpretation. Because the king said that if you can't do this thing then

00:23:51.499 --> 00:23:54.739
you're going to be put to death and he orders that all the wise men of Babylon

00:23:54.739 --> 00:23:59.979
be put to death. And so we find that here in verse 18 that Daniel and his three

00:23:59.979 --> 00:24:05.339
companions, the Bible tells us that they go to God in prayer. Listen, the

00:24:05.339 --> 00:24:10.339
details of the prayer, the actual writing out of the prayer. In chapter 9 you read

00:24:10.339 --> 00:24:14.059
the prayer of Daniel. I mean it's provided for us. In many instances in the

00:24:14.059 --> 00:24:18.660
life of Paul you read how that he's praying specifically, but here we find

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:23.220
that the specifics of the prayer are not given except for the fact that they say

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:29.179
that the God of heaven would give us mercies with regard to this

00:24:29.179 --> 00:24:36.859
secret. So they had something specific that they were praying about. I believe

00:24:36.859 --> 00:24:41.859
that you could argue this morning that not only were they specific in prayer

00:24:41.859 --> 00:24:47.979
but they were fervent in prayer. You know why I believe that? Because they're about to die.

00:24:47.979 --> 00:25:00.059
Amen? Specific and fervent. You know we need to be specific in our prayers. We need to be

00:25:00.059 --> 00:25:05.019
specific as we seek God's face as we pray. How do we know if God answers

00:25:05.019 --> 00:25:09.380
prayer if all we do is pray general prayers? If we just pray God just bless

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:16.859
everybody. I mean bless them and bless them good. What does that even mean? Because I

00:25:16.859 --> 00:25:19.940
would submit to you this morning and I don't have time to to prove it to you

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:24.139
but I'd certainly be willing to do so not within this service but another time.

00:25:24.139 --> 00:25:28.739
Listen, not everything that we refer to as a blessing is what God would refer to

00:25:28.739 --> 00:25:36.019
as a blessing. Blessings come packaged differently. And what your definition and

00:25:36.019 --> 00:25:44.339
my definition of a blessing is not, sometimes it's actually a curse. They

00:25:44.339 --> 00:25:54.819
prayed specifically. God, there's a matter. God, we know that you're God. We know what

00:25:54.819 --> 00:25:57.779
you're capable of doing. We understand who you are. We're going to read in just a few

00:25:57.779 --> 00:26:04.819
moments what Daniel knew about God. Why would Daniel go to God and ask God to

00:26:04.819 --> 00:26:08.139
reveal to him a dream that Nebuchadnezzar had and provide an

00:26:08.139 --> 00:26:13.339
interpretation? Because he knew who God was. Listen, if Daniel did not know the

00:26:13.339 --> 00:26:17.940
greatness of God, there's absolutely no reason that Daniel would ever seek God

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:25.819
to answer a prayer like this. But Daniel seeks God because he knows who God is

00:26:25.819 --> 00:26:31.779
and he knows the greatness of God. And we find that not only were they specific

00:26:31.779 --> 00:26:35.539
but they were fervent. Listen, James in chapter 5 and verse 16 tells us this,

00:26:35.539 --> 00:26:42.579
that the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. How fervent

00:26:42.579 --> 00:26:52.739
are we in prayer? We find that, I believe this morning, that Daniel and his

00:26:52.739 --> 00:26:58.859
companions, they prayed believing. They prayed believing. Why do I say that? Well

00:26:58.859 --> 00:27:02.779
because in verse number 16, Daniel said give him time and that he would show the

00:27:02.779 --> 00:27:08.579
king the interpretation. Daniel, I believe, when he went to God in prayer with his

00:27:08.579 --> 00:27:15.539
three companions in verse 18, I believe that Daniel had every fiber of his being.

00:27:15.539 --> 00:27:22.699
He believed that God could. Just like we find in Daniel chapter number 3 when

00:27:22.699 --> 00:27:26.899
those three same companions stand before Nebuchadnezzar because they didn't bow

00:27:26.899 --> 00:27:30.019
before the image that was created and Nebuchadnezzar says I'm gonna give you

00:27:30.019 --> 00:27:32.859
another opportunity boys because otherwise you're gonna go in that fiery

00:27:32.859 --> 00:27:36.339
furnace and they say listen let it be known that we're not gonna bow to your

00:27:36.339 --> 00:27:43.220
image. Our God is able to deliver us and if not then still let it be known we're

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:49.739
not gonna bow to your image because they believe that God was able. We read

00:27:49.739 --> 00:27:53.419
Daniel 3 and we see that God didn't deliver them from the fiery furnace but

00:27:53.419 --> 00:27:57.979
God delivered them through the fiery furnace and for most of us this morning

00:27:57.979 --> 00:28:03.059
we'd rather be delivered from something than through something. Amen? But they

00:28:03.059 --> 00:28:08.059
got delivered through it and we still talk about it today. Hallelujah. We serve a

00:28:08.059 --> 00:28:14.579
great God. They prayed believing. Daniel believed that God would do what only God

00:28:14.579 --> 00:28:18.179
could do. Daniel understood that it wasn't within himself to be able to

00:28:18.179 --> 00:28:22.339
figure out who, what Nebuchadnezzar dreamed and what the interpretation.

00:28:22.339 --> 00:28:26.419
Remember all of those people that were gathered together the Bible says in

00:28:26.419 --> 00:28:31.940
verse number 2 of our passage of scripture in Daniel 2 that he, Nebuchadnezzar,

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.979
he got all the astrologers, the sorcerers, the magicians and all the

00:28:34.979 --> 00:28:40.820
Chaldeans and they say there's not a man upon the earth that can show the King's

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:45.179
matter. It's just not possible. But you know what Daniel will say when he gets

00:28:45.179 --> 00:28:48.380
before Nebuchadnezzar? We're not gonna really study it this morning for sake of

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:54.339
time but notice what he says in verse 28. There is a God in heaven. There is a God

00:28:54.339 --> 00:29:02.260
in heaven that revealeth secrets. See Daniel believed. We're to pray in faith

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:07.299
believing that God is able. Notice the promises in 1st John. We could go to so

00:29:07.299 --> 00:29:10.659
many passages this morning but turn to 1st John chapter 3 if you will. I want

00:29:10.659 --> 00:29:14.179
you to look at two verses of scripture within the book of 1st John with regard

00:29:14.179 --> 00:29:21.299
to this idea of praying, believing that God is able. Praying, believing that God

00:29:21.299 --> 00:29:25.380
is able and I understand at times we may be like the man that spoke to Jesus

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:30.619
and Jesus is having that interaction with him and he says, Lord I believe, help

00:29:30.619 --> 00:29:34.979
thou mine unbelief. You've been there, I've been there but we understand this

00:29:34.979 --> 00:29:39.779
morning that our God is great and he's powerful and he's able and the Bible

00:29:39.779 --> 00:29:43.779
says in 1st John 3 and verse number 22 notice what it says, and whatsoever we

00:29:43.779 --> 00:29:48.459
ask we receive of him. Why? Because we keep his commandments and do those

00:29:48.539 --> 00:29:53.739
things that are pleasing in his sight. Now what a blessing to think about the

00:29:53.739 --> 00:29:58.779
result of obedience as it's mentioned in verse 22 of 1st John 3 that as we walk

00:29:58.779 --> 00:30:02.820
in his ways as we obey his commandments

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:07.140
commandments, that we can have confidence that God hears us and God answers us and God

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:08.140
works.

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:14.740
In 1 John chapter number 5 and verses 14 and 15, notice what the Bible says, and this is

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.580
the confidence that we have in Him.

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:24.220
Listen, our confidence is not in us, our confidence is not in, well, I have the ability to pray.

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:25.760
No.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.820
It's not in your ability to wax eloquent.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:39.020
We just come before God as hopeless, helpless people in need of what He can do.

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:46.100
But if we ask anything according to His will, He heareth us, He heareth us.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:47.340
How do we know if it's according to His will?

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:51.060
Well, you better get in His Word and find out if it's according to His will.

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:59.220
Pastor, I've been praying for that new whatever, I've been praying for that, no, no, no, what's

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:02.340
according to His will?

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:07.940
Verse 15, if we know that He hear us, do you see the confidence, the believing?

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:12.580
If we know that He hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.060
we desired of Him.

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:20.060
Listen, this morning, God wants us to pray believing that He's able.

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:25.000
God's revealed His greatness to us so that it would impact our behavior.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.080
God has made known to you and to me how great He is as we study through the pages of this

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.160
precious book.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:37.200
He has revealed His greatness so that it would impact our daily lives, so that it would impact

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.040
how we pray.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:44.880
We see in Daniel's life, his prayer life was impacted by what he believed to be true

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.720
about God.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:51.000
We see the situation reported, we see the supplication recorded, number three this morning,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.400
we see the secret revealed.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.080
You know the wonderful thing?

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.800
God answered prayer.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.800
God answered!

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.040
And God still answers today.

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:05.800
I wonder this morning, do you keep any kind of record of when God answers prayer?

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:10.760
Because you know what happens in your life and in my life as God answers prayer, you

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:16.160
know it encourages us and it builds our faith.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.960
And it causes us to continue to seek God's face in prayer.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:19.960
Why?

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.120
Because God often answers prayer.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:28.080
And when we pray specifically, we can know that God answers specifically and we see what

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.400
God is able to do.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:34.200
Notice in our text of Scripture, the Bible says in verse number 19, I don't know how

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.320
long the prayer meeting was.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:40.120
Truly, it could have been a couple of minutes, it could have been a couple of hours, I don't

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:47.560
know the amount of time, but then, then is how verse 19 begins, was the secret revealed

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:51.280
unto Daniel in a night vision.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:56.440
Can you imagine Daniel's excitement?

00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.920
Can you imagine how thrilled they must have been?

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:05.160
I mean, they believed that God could, but God did.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.840
God answered.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:13.400
God revealed to Daniel the dream and the interpretation and we find that as Daniel receives the answer

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:19.040
that he was seeking from God, he understood who God was, he understood who God was and

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:24.760
what God was able to do, we find that the Bible says that then was the secret revealed

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:25.760
unto Daniel.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.660
Remember, what were they praying?

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:33.440
That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:37.200
Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:41.880
I mean, hallelujah that we serve a God who hears and answers prayer, that he worked in

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:46.720
Daniel's life and that he still works today in your life and in my life and he answers

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.720
prayer.

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:53.200
But I want you to notice something extremely important with regard to the subject matter

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.760
of prayer as we look in Daniel chapter number two.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:00.280
We've mentioned how that there was an immediate response and for you and I this morning, we

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:04.640
must get to the place where our immediate response to the circumstances, the troubles,

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:15.280
the difficulties in life is prayer, is prayer, depending on the God of the universe.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:22.200
The one who said, let there be light and there was light, that's my God.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:27.720
If you're saved this morning, that's your God and he's able and he hears, he's promised

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.720
to do so.

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:33.520
But I want you to notice even as we look at the immediate response of Daniel and the supplication

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:38.440
that is recorded, I notice in our text of scripture something extremely important and

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:43.000
I want you to think just for a moment if we can consider this passage of scripture and

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.960
I think that we would agree that it was an urgent matter.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.399
The decree had already been issued.

00:34:51.399 --> 00:34:56.920
The king, Nebuchadnezzar, he is angry and very furious.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.440
He's irate.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:02.640
He's made an irrational decree and then here comes Daniel and says, would you give us some

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.559
time and we'll show you the interpretation.

00:35:05.559 --> 00:35:07.360
So the secret is revealed.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.920
What is our thought with regard to what would happen next?

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:15.520
I mean, make a beeline directly to Nebuchadnezzar and say, hey, Nebuchadnezzar, I got the answer

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.520
for you.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.520
Here's the dream and here's the interpretation.

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.520
But that's not what happens.

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:22.940
That's not what happens.

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:29.679
In the midst of an urgent matter, in the midst of a life and death situation, Daniel said

00:35:29.679 --> 00:35:31.640
we need to pray.

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.880
God answers prayer and you know what Daniel says?

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:34.880
We need to rejoice.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.920
We need to take time to worship God.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:45.839
We need to take time to thank God for the answer that He gave to prayer.

00:35:45.839 --> 00:35:47.360
Notice with me in verse number 19.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.480
The Bible says, then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision.

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.480
Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.580
But it doesn't stop there.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:36:01.240
It actually records for us his rejoicing more than it records for us his prayer.

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:04.839
Think about that for a moment.

00:36:04.839 --> 00:36:10.880
We talked in Sunday school about a lack of gratitude.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.279
Will we hear more frequently in our lives?

00:36:13.279 --> 00:36:17.880
I asked this question at the start of Sunday school this morning in general.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:23.279
Generally speaking, on any given day in your life, do you hear more complaining or more

00:36:23.279 --> 00:36:25.119
rejoicing?

00:36:25.119 --> 00:36:29.679
Every single person that was in Sunday school this morning said, generally speaking, they

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:35.119
hear in a specific day more complaining than rejoicing.

00:36:35.119 --> 00:36:40.800
How many times do we pray and then God answers and we don't even thank Him?

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:47.179
We don't even take time to thank Him for answering our prayers.

00:36:47.179 --> 00:36:52.000
Maybe when we pray we'll say, God and we will give you the glory and then God answers and

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.520
we just go.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.520
But notice what happens.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.880
It says that Daniel blessed the God of heaven.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:11.800
Verse 20, Daniel answered and said, blessed be the name of God forever and ever for wisdom

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:15.480
and might are His.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.320
This is a time of rejoicing.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.200
This is a time of worship.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.200
Listen our God is eternal.

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.760
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:25.200
Daniel says blessed be the name of God forever and ever.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:26.880
He is the eternal God.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.880
He is alpha and omega.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.080
He has no beginning and no ending.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:35.040
He is the self-sufficient one.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.760
He is the all-knowing one.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:40.880
He says at the end of verse number 20, for wisdom and might are His.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.440
He is the omniscient God.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.839
He has all wisdom.

00:37:43.839 --> 00:37:45.360
He is the omnipotent God.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.360
He has all power.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:49.360
And you begin to think about the worship of Daniel.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:55.360
When Daniel receives a response, when Daniel receives an answer from God, when God reveals

00:37:55.360 --> 00:38:00.279
to Daniel the secret, the very thing that Daniel was praying about as he sought the

00:38:00.279 --> 00:38:07.520
face of God in urgency, in fervency, very specific, he enlisted his friends and God

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:12.559
answers and Daniel says, though it's a life and death situation, though the matter is

00:38:12.559 --> 00:38:18.279
urgent, though the decree has been given with haste, I must stop and rejoice.

00:38:18.279 --> 00:38:20.360
I must stop and praise my God.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:27.920
Listen, it's a key in this passage of Scripture that we thank God.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.920
He's the omnipotent God.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.000
He's the omniscient God.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
He's the eternal God.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.520
Notice in verse 21, and He changeth the times and the seasons.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:43.119
Just think about that for a moment.

00:38:43.119 --> 00:38:44.119
Why?

00:38:44.119 --> 00:38:46.160
Because He's God.

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.160
I can't do that.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:50.160
He can't do that.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.359
God can.

00:38:52.359 --> 00:38:56.760
I'm not sure, but maybe Daniel had a record of Joshua.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:05.799
Do you remember when Joshua prayed that God would cause the sun to stand still?

00:39:05.799 --> 00:39:10.200
What would even possess a man to pray that prayer?

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:13.160
What they believed to be true about God.

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:19.080
Because if God made the sun, God can cause it to stand still.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:23.799
You understand what I'm saying?

00:39:23.799 --> 00:39:30.960
I don't know that Daniel read that report of Joshua and the land, but what I'm saying

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.600
is that Daniel says, you're the God who changes times and seasons.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:38.520
Notice He removeth kings and setteth up kings.

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.880
You know, Nebuchadnezzar had a pride issue.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:48.440
Nebuchadnezzar thought he was the man, and in a certain sense he was.

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:53.280
But you know, God showed him who he was.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:58.919
And God is the one that sets up and removes.

00:39:58.919 --> 00:40:01.400
He's the one that rules in the affairs of man.

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.880
The Bible tells us in the Proverbs.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:07.920
Proverbs, that the heart of the king is what? It's in the hand of the Lord. And he turneth

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:16.280
it withersoever he wills. Amen? That's Bible. That's what the Bible teaches us. And so Daniel,

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:25.000
he's rejoicing. He says this, he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:33.360
know understanding. You know, as we seek God, and we seek the face of God, God will give

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:43.160
us wisdom, knowledge, understanding. Our God is the all-wise God. You understand that we're

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:50.640
speaking about heavenly wisdom, not earthly wisdom. There's a difference. James talks

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:57.080
about some of those differences. The wisdom that's from above. That's the wisdom that

00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:03.640
we need. The Bible speaks about those that do not know God in the book of Romans in the

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:13.960
first chapter, professing themselves to be wise. They became fools. And here we find

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:22.640
that Daniel is rejoicing. Notice in verse 22, he revealeth the deep and secret things.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:29.440
He knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him. As I'm going to read

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:40.360
verse 20 through 22, I see evidence, not only as Daniel is rejoicing and praising God, but

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:46.900
I see evidence here in these verses of Scripture of what Daniel believed about who God is,

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:53.960
and how that belief shaped his prayer. And now he's thanking God. He's rejoicing. In

00:41:53.960 --> 00:42:00.440
verse 23, the Bible says, I thank thee and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:10.680
has given me wisdom and might, and has made known unto me now what we desired of thee.

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:17.960
For thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter. I believe that as we look here in

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:24.480
this passage of Scripture and we see Daniel taking time to pause and thank God, it's such

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:33.180
an important truth for us. Because in our lives, we sometimes can get so busy, so distracted

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:36.440
with so many things, we pray about something and God answers, and we just kind of keep

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:46.720
on rolling. But Daniel says, we've got to thank God. We've got to thank God. Daniel

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:54.840
did not say, man, we're pretty smart guys. We figured this thing out. No. God gave us

00:42:54.840 --> 00:43:00.779
wisdom. God revealed this thing to me. You notice very specifically in verse 23, he says,

00:43:00.779 --> 00:43:06.400
I thank thee and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, notice who has given me wisdom

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:12.900
and might. Why? Because he prayed for it. And has made known unto me now what we desired

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:18.779
of thee. For thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter. Daniel will then call

00:43:18.779 --> 00:43:23.700
and he'll enter into the presence. Notice the confidence again in verse number 24. The

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:27.720
Bible says, therefore Daniel went in unto Ariok, whom the king had ordained to destroy

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:31.540
the wise men of Babylon. He went and said thus unto him, destroy not the wise men of

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:38.059
Babylon. Bring me in before the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation.

00:43:38.059 --> 00:43:43.900
Daniel was confident because he knows that God revealed it. And he just testified of

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:52.860
that. I mentioned earlier, he stands before Nebuchadnezzar and Daniel says that there

00:43:52.860 --> 00:44:01.980
is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets. This morning, we serve the same God that Daniel

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:10.059
We serve a God who's able. He said to do what? He's able. We sing the song, He's able to

00:44:10.059 --> 00:44:16.260
deliver thee. We think about Daniel chapter number 6. When Daniel is asked after he's

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:21.260
going to be cast there into the den of lions and after the king, Darius had did everything

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:26.940
within his power to deliver Daniel from having to go into the den of lions, we find that

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:32.660
he says that thou, your God who you serve continually, He'll deliver thee. That's exactly

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:39.179
what God did. That's exactly what God did. I'm not sure what you're facing this morning.

00:44:39.179 --> 00:44:43.580
I don't know what you're dealing with this morning. But I know that our God hears and

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:48.820
answers prayer. And I know that we must place a priority, an emphasis on the subject of

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:53.360
prayer. And I understand this morning that my prayer life is going to be shaped, your

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:59.720
prayer life is going to be shaped by what we truly believe about who God is. If we don't

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.920
understand these things that we've studied throughout this year, if we don't understand

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:08.200
how great God is, then our prayers are not going to be proving God to do something that

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:15.559
only God can do. Why don't you pray about that? You think about somebody making that

00:45:15.559 --> 00:45:22.959
statement and somebody that doesn't know how great God is. It's confusing to them. But

00:45:22.959 --> 00:45:28.200
this morning, when we know the God of the universe, you get that news, you get that

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:34.679
report, you receive that, whatever it might be. What's our immediate response? What do

00:45:34.679 --> 00:45:39.679
we do? Do we say, you know what? We need to pray about this. We have a prayer meeting.

00:45:39.679 --> 00:45:46.279
We seek the face of God. Because there's nothing I can do through this situation. I'm not able.

00:45:46.279 --> 00:45:53.959
I need God. I believe this morning that prayer is the greatest revelation of our dependence

00:45:53.959 --> 00:46:03.360
upon Him. We pray. We seek His face. This morning, does your prayer life, does my prayer

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:11.399
life reveal that we believe that God is great? That we believe that He's the God of the impossible?

00:46:11.399 --> 00:46:15.600
That we believe that He's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think?

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.880
What does your prayer life, what does my prayer life reveal about what we believe to

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:25.640
be true about God? I believe that if we were to take inventory, as we have an opportunity

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:30.480
here this morning, I think we'd all agree this morning that after reading Daniel 2,

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:35.399
that Daniel believed that God was able and that Daniel believed God was great. Daniel

00:46:35.399 --> 00:46:42.200
had an understanding of God's greatness that directly impacted how he prayed. Do you agree

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:50.880
this morning? I mean, it's obvious in our lives. We too must be people of prayer. Why

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:54.520
are we spending three weeks on the subject? I mean, the weeks are short. I mean, it's

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:59.640
November 5th. We only have so many weeks left in this calendar year. We'll start a new theme

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:08.160
in 2024. Why would I spend three weeks on the subject of prayer? Because I need it.

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:17.239
If I could say it with all kindness and truthfulness, you need it as well. We need it. We need to

00:47:17.239 --> 00:47:25.440
be challenged with regard to our prayer lives. We need to examine our prayer lives. And we

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:36.480
need to say, God, does my prayer life really reveal how great You are? Because as I read

00:47:36.559 --> 00:47:49.600
the pages of this precious book, our God is so great. And so often we pray such puny prayers.

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:57.399
To a God who said, let there be light, and there was light. To a God who made the stars

00:47:57.399 --> 00:48:08.440
also. To a God who redeemed us, saved us, so we could go to heaven. I hope this morning

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:13.040
that by looking at Daniel 2, we've been challenged. I hope we've been encouraged. Our God hears

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:17.320
and answers prayer. But I hope we've been challenged. What does my prayer life, what

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:22.360
does your prayer life reveal about what we believe to be true about God? Let's pray.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:27.839
Father, we love You. We thank You so much for loving us. We thank You for the privilege

00:48:27.839 --> 00:48:36.640
of being able to serve You. Of being able to enter into Your presence. What a privilege

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:44.960
to pray. And God, I pray that in these moments of invitation that we would truly examine

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:59.000
our lives and examine our prayer lives. We'd be honest, humble, thorough, to truly answer

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:07.039
the question, what does my prayer life reveal about what I believe to be true about God?

00:49:07.039 --> 00:49:14.320
Lord, if there's one here that's not sure of heaven, they do not know the Lord Jesus

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:18.200
Christ as their personal Savior. In fact, if they were to die today, they have no assurance

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:23.919
that heaven is their home. They hope to go to heaven. They'd like to go to heaven. They

00:49:23.919 --> 00:49:28.760
do not know for sure. They've never trusted Christ as their Savior. I pray that You'd

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:33.160
move and work in their hearts and lives today. They'd be saved. We'd have an opportunity

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:36.960
to take a Bible and show them how they could know for sure that they could be saved, that

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:43.000
they'd be heaven-bound. For every child of God this morning, would You work in our hearts?

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.559
Would You help us to do business with You as we've been ready to receive truth? I pray

00:49:47.559 --> 00:49:53.239
now in these moments of invitation that we'd be ready to respond. We'll thank You for every

00:49:53.239 --> 00:49:57.960
decision that's made. We'll thank You, God, for the way that You'll work. For it's in

00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:00.039
Christ's name we pray. Would You stand with me?
