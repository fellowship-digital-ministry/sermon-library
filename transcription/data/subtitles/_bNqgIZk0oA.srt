1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
12, Mark chapter number 12 this evening, and I'll be looking at verses 18-27, Mark chapter

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:15,079
number 12 verses 18-27, and the text of Scripture that is before us this evening provides us

3
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:20,280
with a record of a conversation that takes place between the Lord Jesus Christ and the

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,600
Sadducees.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,520
As you read the New Testament, you have the opportunity to come across the terminology,

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,119
the group of people that are referred to as the Sadducees, and then of course the Pharisees,

7
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,959
and as you read about these religious groups of people, you read about the scribes and

8
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:43,099
what have you, but here, specifically, the context of the conversation that is recorded

9
00:00:43,099 --> 00:00:48,819
for us is that between the Sadducees and the Lord Jesus Christ.

10
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:54,419
These Sadducees were religious leaders during this particular time of Christ, and they come

11
00:00:54,419 --> 00:00:55,979
to Jesus with a question.

12
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:00,180
As you study the Gospels, you'll find often that the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the

13
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,660
scribes, the religious leaders of the day, that they often would try to catch Jesus in

14
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:12,019
saying something that was contrary to what they believed, and try to find occasion to

15
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:17,419
find fault, and so on and so forth, and often times they would show up to where Jesus was

16
00:01:17,419 --> 00:01:23,419
teaching for all of the wrong reason, and they had wrong motives, and here we find in

17
00:01:23,419 --> 00:01:28,500
this particular conversation that really what is recorded to us is that they think

18
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,660
they have this question that is going to leave the Lord Jesus Christ cornered without an

19
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,180
answer.

20
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,540
And we know that He is God and that He is omniscient, He knows all things, and as a

21
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:47,339
side thought, I kind of wonder this evening how long these Sadducees sat around and how

22
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:52,739
many different seminar hearings they had in order to come up with this question, right?

23
00:01:53,059 --> 00:01:58,339
I mean, they're trying to corner the Lord Jesus Christ, and we find that as we look

24
00:01:58,339 --> 00:02:03,779
at the passage of Scripture, I would mention just very quickly, and we'll kind of circle

25
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:09,779
back to it at the end, but I wonder tonight if these Sadducees would have spent as much

26
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:16,820
time actually studying the Word of God as they did on trying to figure out how to corner

27
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:22,339
Jesus, that perhaps they wouldn't have had to have the question for Jesus because they

28
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:26,979
would have come to the proper conclusion biblically.

29
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:32,940
And I mentioned this many years ago as you look at David and Saul, and it's a completely

30
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,899
different context, but the Bible says that Saul made David his enemy continually and

31
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:43,660
he sought him, and he spent all of this time seeking David, seeking to kill him, and I

32
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:49,179
often wonder what if he would have sought God with just a measure of that which he sought

33
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:52,539
David, how things would have been different in the life of Saul.

34
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:56,300
But we find here that these religious leaders, they weren't really interested in studying

35
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,220
the Scriptures to come to the conclusion that they needed to come to, rather they sought

36
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,619
to question the Lord Jesus Christ and corner Him.

37
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:11,339
As we look at the passage, I really want to focus our attention upon the response of Jesus,

38
00:03:11,339 --> 00:03:14,539
which is recorded for us in verses 24 through 27.

39
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:18,300
As we would focus our attention this evening on the latter part of the text that we'll

40
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:24,020
study, the purpose in so doing is so that we can be better equipped to deal with this

41
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,940
matter of deception.

42
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,699
I've mentioned as we've had this series here on Wednesday evenings for a little over a

43
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:35,539
month now that we are living in an age of deception, there is the danger of deception,

44
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:41,259
and we find that as we look at the truth that is before us this evening, you will not find

45
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:46,339
the word deceive or deceived or deceiving, but I want you to understand, look at it in

46
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:48,020
verse number 24, the Bible says,

47
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:52,860
"...and Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore..."

48
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:59,899
Look at that word, err, "...because ye know not the Scriptures, neither the power of God."

49
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:03,460
Now, skip down to verse 27, we'll look at the whole context as we go through the message

50
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,740
this evening, but look at verse 27, it says,

51
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,820
"...he is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living."

52
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,500
Notice this phrase, "...ye therefore do greatly err."

53
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,019
I've used that phrase at the end of verse number 27 for our lesson tonight as a title,

54
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,899
"...ye therefore do greatly err."

55
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:27,899
That word err in verse number 24, and again in verse number 27, is actually the same exact

56
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:32,420
Greek word that is used in many of the other passages that we've studied in these last

57
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,579
six weeks that is translated deceive or deceived.

58
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:42,660
And we find that here, as we've mentioned that word and we've looked at it and we've

59
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:50,459
dissected it, we understand that it also carries with it the idea of being led into error.

60
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:56,140
And here we find that that's really the context in what we're finding, is that Jesus says

61
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:01,540
to these Sadducees, "...do ye not therefore err?

62
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,540
Ye therefore do greatly err."

63
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,519
They had been deceived.

64
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,760
And we find that as we look at this passage of Scripture, we can answer the question,

65
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,920
what led to their deception?

66
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,480
Start back with me in verse number 18.

67
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,320
The Bible says, "...then come unto him the Sadducees, which say, there is no resurrection.

68
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,040
And they asked him, saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, if a man's brother die and

69
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,959
leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife and

70
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,359
raise up seed unto his brother."

71
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:39,880
Without having to go back to the Old Testament, the Pentateuch, we would quickly acknowledge

72
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,480
that what they're saying is accurate with regard to what Moses had written to them concerning

73
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,279
the particular subject.

74
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,519
They then come up with this particular scenario, this hypothetical, and they say this in verse

75
00:05:52,519 --> 00:06:01,799
number 20, "...now there were seven brethren, and the first took a wife, and dying left

76
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:03,540
no seed.

77
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,480
And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed.

78
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,279
And the third likewise, and the seven had her, and left no seed.

79
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,160
Last of all, the woman died also.

80
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:22,959
In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them?

81
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,519
For the seven had heard a wife."

82
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,059
Now it's kind of interesting that in verse number 18, the Bible reveals to us that they

83
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:35,100
say, the Sadducees, they say there is no resurrection.

84
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,140
Bible scholars for years have said that's why they're sad, you see, because they don't

85
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,820
believe in a resurrection.

86
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:46,700
But the reality is that when they're trying to corner Jesus, they say in verse number

87
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,779
23, "...in the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise."

88
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:55,299
But they don't even believe in a resurrection.

89
00:06:55,299 --> 00:07:01,579
We find that Jesus, as He's going to respond to them, He graciously answers their question,

90
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:07,540
but He also corrects their error in their doctrine, in their theology, if you will.

91
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:13,619
So we notice that these Sadducees, they've come up with this question, this hypothetical,

92
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:18,420
they've come and they've provided this scenario to the Lord Jesus Christ, and they ask in

93
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:23,339
verse number 23, "...whose wife shall she be of them?

94
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:26,279
For the seven had heard a wife."

95
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,779
Notice how Jesus responds.

96
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:34,779
I do not believe for one second that they expected that this would be how He would respond.

97
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:38,940
He says, "...do ye not therefore err?"

98
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:45,579
Whoa, what do you mean we're, what do you mean we err, right?

99
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:53,660
Notice what He says, "...because ye know not the Scriptures, neither the power of God."

100
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:59,980
Here in verse number 24, we find that God gives us insight as to what led to their deception.

101
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,660
Now I believe that as we study the passage of Scripture and we gain this insight that

102
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:09,940
is provided to us, it will help us in preventing deception in our own lives.

103
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,700
What was it that led to the deception in the lives of these Sadducees when they come and

104
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:20,380
they bring this question and they seek to corner Jesus and to cause Him to not be able

105
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,380
to answer the question?

106
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:28,739
Well, God gives us two reasons that they had been deceived, or two things that led to their deception.

107
00:08:28,739 --> 00:08:38,099
I want you to understand that He says this in verse number 24, "...ye know not the Scriptures."

108
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,859
Ye know not the Scriptures.

109
00:08:40,859 --> 00:08:46,979
Understand, they had the Scriptures.

110
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:56,099
It was not a matter of them being truly ignorant without having biblical truth that led to

111
00:08:56,099 --> 00:08:59,820
the question, a question in which they were seeking truth.

112
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,380
No, they're trying to corner Jesus.

113
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,059
Their motive is not right.

114
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:11,020
And here Jesus says that they had been led into error, they had been deceived because

115
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,739
they do not know the Scriptures.

116
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:15,979
Again, it was not that they did not have the Scriptures.

117
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:18,340
It wasn't even that they didn't use the Scriptures.

118
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:24,900
For we find that they say in verse number 19, "...Moses wrote unto us."

119
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,900
And then they say, if a man's brother died, they quote a passage from Deuteronomy.

120
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,380
And they're familiar with the Scriptures.

121
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,059
The Pentateuch, as we would often refer to it as, the Law, the five books of Moses, is

122
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:41,340
what he's referring to here, these Sadducees are referring to.

123
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:47,020
Moses wrote unto us, and they accepted the Pentateuch as being the Word of God.

124
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:53,539
They accepted the Scriptures as being these first five books, and we find that they used

125
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:54,900
the Scriptures.

126
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,340
But Jesus said, "...ye do err."

127
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,340
Why?

128
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,059
Because you know not the Scriptures.

129
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:03,279
It wasn't that they didn't have them, it wasn't that they didn't use them,

130
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,779
it was that they did not properly know the Scriptures.

131
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:09,359
Let me say it this way.

132
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:19,039
They refused, the Sadducees refused, to allow the Scriptures to dictate their belief.

133
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:26,219
Instead of allowing the Scriptures to dictate and to determine what they would believe,

134
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:31,519
they had their own belief, they had their own tradition,

135
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,899
they had their own presuppositions, if you will,

136
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:40,779
and they already had their mind filled with what they wanted to believe,

137
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:44,399
and we're not going to let the Scriptures mess with that.

138
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,379
Does it not sound familiar with some stuff that we deal with in society today?

139
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:51,499
There's no room for the real truth

140
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:56,499
because there's all this false stuff that's filled the heads of people.

141
00:10:56,499 --> 00:10:59,499
And you try to give them truth, but they've already erred,

142
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:01,539
they've already believed something else,

143
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:04,720
and they're so set in what they believe

144
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,879
that they're not willing to allow the Scriptures to dictate their belief.

145
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:17,399
This evening, we understand, we say it often as Baptist people,

146
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:21,799
that the Bible is our sole authority for faith and practice.

147
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:27,939
There is nothing else that stands at the same level as the Bible

148
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:32,059
with regard to dictating our doctrine, our belief.

149
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,819
The Bible stands alone. Amen?

150
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,819
There's no other religious book, there's no other tradition,

151
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:44,199
there's no other anything that we set at the same level as the Bible,

152
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:48,379
or even at a higher level than the Bible.

153
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:52,959
Today, if you were to look at many groups of people around the world

154
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,720
that would claim to be religious,

155
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,759
even as the Sadducees would claim to be religious,

156
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,799
they may not deny the Bible,

157
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,839
but they would hold the tradition of their church fathers

158
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:07,479
in higher regard than the Bible.

159
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:13,940
They would hold some other holy book higher in regard than the Bible.

160
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,259
And we find that what Jesus is saying to these Sadducees,

161
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:21,639
He says, you err. Do you not therefore err?

162
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:24,779
Why? Number one, because you know not the Scriptures.

163
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:31,440
You refuse to allow the Scriptures to dictate your belief.

164
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,000
I hope that we'd never be there.

165
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I hope that we'd be humble enough to say,

166
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,039
it's the Bible that's going to tell me what to believe.

167
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:45,220
It's not me that's going to misinterpret or misapply Scripture

168
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,720
to make it fit what I want to believe.

169
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,139
There are people that twist Scriptures all kinds of ways

170
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:57,440
to try to make it fit what they want to do.

171
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,639
And we must understand that this is one of the great dangers

172
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:05,979
that is revealed to us with regard to what leads into error,

173
00:13:05,979 --> 00:13:08,319
what leads into being deceived,

174
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,099
is not having the knowledge of the Scriptures.

175
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:14,479
Notice what he says is really the second reason

176
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:17,899
that led to their deception at the end of verse 24,

177
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:22,239
neither the power of God.

178
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:24,160
They did not know the power of God.

179
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,819
Now with regard to the answer in verse 24,

180
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:29,199
I want you to understand,

181
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:34,419
Jesus is not giving these two truths in verse 24

182
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:39,520
to answer their question about whose wife shall she be.

183
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,160
He'll answer that in a moment.

184
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,239
He's giving this truth because of their error

185
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:48,279
with regard to the resurrection.

186
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:50,000
He's fixing their doctrine.

187
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,419
He's correcting their belief.

188
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:54,699
Now, they didn't believe in the resurrection

189
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:57,880
because they didn't believe in the power of God.

190
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,880
How is it that this could happen?

191
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,539
Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15,

192
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:05,500
and I'll say some among you that there is no resurrection.

193
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,959
If Christ be not risen,

194
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,580
then our preaching is vain, our faith is vain,

195
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,880
but now is Christ risen, he says.

196
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,419
And so we find that as we notice here,

197
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:17,119
he says neither the power of God.

198
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:19,799
Now I want you just for a moment in your mind tonight

199
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,540
to think about these Sadducees

200
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,380
and they had the book of Moses

201
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,299
and we use that terminology to refer to the Pentateuch.

202
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:29,540
They had the first five books of the Bible

203
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,880
and they believed them

204
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,919
according to what they would say,

205
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:35,380
what they would acknowledge.

206
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:41,720
They held that the books of Moses were Scripture.

207
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,299
Is it not amazing

208
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:46,880
how in those first five books of the Bible,

209
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,079
God demonstrates His power in amazing ways?

210
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,339
How can you not know the power of God,

211
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:59,220
but read the Pentateuch?

212
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,720
Just the first pages of Genesis.

213
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,760
God said, let there be light.

214
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,059
And there was light.

215
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:12,720
How is that not a demonstration of the power of God?

216
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,519
So He can create everything out of nothing,

217
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:22,059
but He can't resurrect?

218
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:24,519
I mean, we could look at a whole host of things.

219
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:26,220
We understand we've studied through

220
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,720
the book of Genesis on Sunday evenings

221
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,059
for a long time now

222
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:33,220
and finished up chapter 22 this last Sunday evening.

223
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,559
But in so doing, we've learned many things

224
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,720
about how God revealed Himself to Abraham.

225
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,059
El Shaddai, the Almighty God.

226
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:44,899
Is anything too hard for me? He asks Abraham.

227
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:46,859
We find that you would begin to look

228
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:49,480
through the book of Exodus,

229
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,059
a reference to what Jesus will give here

230
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:55,220
in just a few moments in His answer to their question.

231
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,600
And we find that as we look at the book of Exodus

232
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,940
and you begin to read about the plagues,

233
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,139
is that not a demonstration of the power of God?

234
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:08,279
I mean, even the Egyptians

235
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:13,899
recognize this is the finger of God.

236
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:15,820
They recognize this power.

237
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,779
And here are these religious leaders.

238
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:19,200
We believe the book of Moses.

239
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,320
We have the first five books.

240
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,739
But we don't believe in the resurrection.

241
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:26,160
But yet, they're going to corner Jesus and say,

242
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:28,639
in the resurrection, when they shall rise,

243
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,380
whose wife shall she be?

244
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,760
And Jesus says,

245
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,139
do you not therefore err?

246
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:40,839
Number one, because you know not the Scriptures.

247
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:46,079
Number two, because you know not the power of God.

248
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,839
I hope tonight that we would be absolutely

249
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:54,919
convinced of God's power.

250
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,339
That there is nothing too hard for Him.

251
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,880
That He is able to do exceeding abundantly

252
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,239
above all that we ask or think.

253
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:07,000
That as we understand,

254
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,079
even as we started our Sunday School series

255
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,899
on the miracles of Jesus Christ,

256
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:20,160
that with God, nothing shall be impossible.

257
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,440
Indeed, we think we have moments in our lives

258
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,000
where we look at circumstances

259
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,600
and we look at the mountains in our lives

260
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,679
and we say, how can we ever deal with this?

261
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:32,959
How can this ever?

262
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:35,820
Don't leave God out of the equation.

263
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,839
Amen?

264
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:40,239
Because He's the God of the impossible.

265
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:44,639
And here, what led to them being in error,

266
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:46,639
what led to them being deceived,

267
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:48,040
was two-fold.

268
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,119
They did not know the Scriptures,

269
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:54,559
and they did not know the power of God.

270
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,119
Jesus answered the question that they asked

271
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,720
in verse 23,

272
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,119
and I believe it's gracious of our Savior to do so,

273
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:06,160
but we find that He corrected their wrong doctrine

274
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,000
as I mentioned a moment ago.

275
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And it's very interesting that He did so

276
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,040
by using the Pentateuch.

277
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,079
The very books of the Bible

278
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:20,200
that these Sadducees would have claimed to believe,

279
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,040
Jesus is going to use those very books

280
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,880
to answer and to correct their doctrine.

281
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,200
Notice in v. 25-26,

282
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,440
for when they shall rise from the dead.

283
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,599
Don't you love how Jesus says that?

284
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:37,919
It's not a matter of if.

285
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,520
Yes, they will. Why?

286
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,520
Because He understands,

287
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,239
I am the resurrection and the life.

288
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:43,760
Is that not what He said?

289
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,840
If you look at the seven I Am statements

290
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,200
of Jesus in the book of John,

291
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,159
one of them is I Am the resurrection and the life.

292
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:54,400
For when they shall rise from the dead,

293
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,279
they neither marry nor are given in marriage,

294
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:01,159
but are as the angels which are in heaven

295
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:04,239
and as touching the dead that they rise.

296
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:06,640
So we find again, He gives the answer

297
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,599
and He really focuses in on this thing

298
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,679
of the resurrection.

299
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,960
Because it was their doctrine that was wrong

300
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,719
and they had been led into this error

301
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,039
and into this deception.

302
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,760
And so we find that He tells them,

303
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,159
listen, they're not going to marry.

304
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,760
They're not going to be given in marriage.

305
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,679
They'll be like the angels which are in heaven.

306
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,479
Again, this is a truth that is revealed to us here.

307
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:28,799
Obviously, this is not the truth

308
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,520
that He's referring to when He says,

309
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,919
you know not the Scriptures.

310
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:34,279
The truth that He's referring to

311
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,719
when He says, you know not the Scriptures,

312
00:19:35,719 --> 00:19:38,000
is the truth of the resurrection.

313
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,840
And so He says, for when they shall rise from the dead,

314
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,640
and He gives the answer with regard to the marriage

315
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,679
that is asked in v. 23.

316
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,799
Then we come to v. 26 and He says,

317
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:53,080
and as touching the dead that they rise.

318
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,880
You see how He's focusing on that thing of the resurrection?

319
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,599
Listen, it's so vital.

320
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,119
We understand that the resurrection of Jesus Christ is...

321
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:04,119
He is the cornerstone of our faith.

322
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,639
I mentioned 1 Corinthians 15 a few moments ago.

323
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,159
If Christ be not risen,

324
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,139
there's no reason for us to even

325
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:11,839
think about meeting.

326
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,759
It's pointless.

327
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:17,359
But He is risen.

328
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:19,819
He is risen indeed,

329
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:22,799
as Luke 24 tells us.

330
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,379
And notice, he says,

331
00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:26,119
have ye not read,

332
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,279
and what does he say?

333
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:29,239
In the book of Moses.

334
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:31,199
Don't you love that?

335
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:33,399
Our Lord had such a way

336
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,399
of answering the questions

337
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:38,479
and really dealing with people in grace.

338
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:40,639
Speaking, we mentioned on Sunday morning

339
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,279
about the importance of our speech

340
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:44,279
being always with grace

341
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:47,119
and how they observe the graciousness

342
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,839
of the speech of Jesus.

343
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:50,399
But He says, have ye not read

344
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:53,799
in the book of Moses

345
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:55,679
how in the bush God spake unto Him?

346
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,599
What's He talking about?

347
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,199
Exodus?

348
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:00,479
Remember the burning bush?

349
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:02,159
Remember Moses?

350
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,559
He's referring to an account

351
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:05,319
that they would have absolutely

352
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:07,839
been familiar with.

353
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,479
And He says this,

354
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:12,559
that how in the bush God spake unto Him

355
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:18,159
saying, I am the God of Abraham

356
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,199
and the God of Isaac

357
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:22,199
and the God of Jacob.

358
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:26,639
Now, when God Almighty appears to Moses

359
00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:28,119
in that portion of Scripture

360
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:30,239
in Exodus chapter 3,

361
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:32,639
we find that at that point,

362
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:35,079
these men that are mentioned here,

363
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:37,039
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,

364
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,599
they had died physically.

365
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:41,239
Correct?

366
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:43,679
You can read of it in the book of Genesis.

367
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,159
You can understand of their death.

368
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,599
And you can look to the places

369
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,479
in which they were buried.

370
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:52,319
And we find that they no doubt

371
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,679
had been familiar with this,

372
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,199
but they did not connect the dots.

373
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:56,959
Remember, they did not allow

374
00:21:56,999 --> 00:22:02,719
the Scripture to dictate their belief.

375
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:04,399
He is the God of Abraham,

376
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:05,279
the God of Isaac,

377
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:06,239
the God of Jacob.

378
00:22:06,239 --> 00:22:07,119
Notice what He says.

379
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:09,440
He is not the God of the dead,

380
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,519
but the God of the living.

381
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:14,279
He's the God of the living.

382
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:15,360
And then He says again,

383
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,479
ye therefore do greatly err.

384
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:24,080
Again, as we think about this subject

385
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,239
of deception and we notice

386
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:28,199
in this passage of Scripture

387
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:30,959
how that Jesus deals with a group of people

388
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:33,080
that have been deceived.

389
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,399
And as we dig in and say,

390
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:37,839
okay, why have they been deceived?

391
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:40,159
What is it that led to their deception?

392
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,799
And we answer the question

393
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,319
with that twofold answer from verse 24

394
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,679
of not knowing the Scriptures

395
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,360
nor the power of God.

396
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,119
We find that this gives us insight

397
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,119
as to how we can guard against deception.

398
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,799
How can we guard against deception?

399
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,319
Remember, He says be not deceived.

400
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,839
Remember, He says that there are many

401
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,399
that lie in wait to deceive.

402
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:03,919
He says in the last times

403
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,319
that evil men and seducers

404
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,839
are going to wax worse and worse

405
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:08,919
deceiving and being deceived.

406
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:10,080
And so we understand

407
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,639
that all of these warnings

408
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:12,799
have been given to us

409
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,479
with regard to this age of deception.

410
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:16,479
And so what do we do?

411
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:20,519
How do we come to a place

412
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,239
where we are prepared for this deception?

413
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:27,080
I would say simply this,

414
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,000
know the book.

415
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,839
Know the book.

416
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:33,879
Know the truth.

417
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,279
Notice what John 5 says.

418
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:36,839
Turn over, if you will, to the book of John.

419
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:38,879
We'll look at three passages of Scripture

420
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:40,119
that will be done tonight

421
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,599
and enter into our prayer time.

422
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,799
John 5 and verse 39.

423
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,199
Here again in this passage of Scripture,

424
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:51,279
we find that Jesus is speaking here

425
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,319
and a discourse is going on

426
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:55,199
and of course, dealing with some of those

427
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:57,440
religious leaders of the day again.

428
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,239
And He says this in verse 39,

429
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:04,000
Search the Scriptures,

430
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,679
for in them ye think

431
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:10,839
ye have eternal life.

432
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:16,559
And they are they which testify of Me.

433
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,040
Search the Scriptures.

434
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,880
Study the Word of God.

435
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,160
Dig in.

436
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,359
And we find that as we study

437
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:24,679
and search the Scriptures,

438
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:25,919
that we allow the Scriptures

439
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,320
to dictate our belief.

440
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,880
When we find that we're in a place

441
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,040
where I come to a passage of Scripture

442
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,399
and there's something different

443
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:35,519
that I believed prior to reading

444
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:36,760
this portion of Scripture,

445
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,919
and God, as I'm reading the Word of God,

446
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:40,959
the Holy Spirit of God is teaching me

447
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,639
and illumining the Scripture to me,

448
00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:47,600
and I say, that's different than what I believe.

449
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,760
Who's right? Me or God?

450
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,320
We know the answer. God is right.

451
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,440
And so what must I do?

452
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,279
I must change my belief.

453
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:01,160
I must align my belief with the Bible.

454
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,639
I do not seek to twist and manipulate Scripture

455
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:07,839
to make it say what I want it to say

456
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,000
so that I can continue to believe

457
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,760
what I want to believe.

458
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,519
No.

459
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:16,320
Let God be true.

460
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,519
Let every man a liar.

461
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:19,959
Let God's Word stand.

462
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:21,760
So we need to search the Scriptures.

463
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,199
We're familiar with 2 Timothy 2.

464
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:27,399
In 2 Timothy 2, in v. 15,

465
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:29,199
Paul is giving this admonition

466
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:30,760
to his son in the faith

467
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,000
and he tells him to study.

468
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,639
Study to show thyself approved unto God.

469
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:41,000
A workman that needeth not to be ashamed,

470
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,639
rightly dividing the Word of Truth.

471
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:46,760
Some people don't like study.

472
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,320
I'm not talking about Bible study.

473
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,359
I'm just talking about study in general.

474
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,119
Study is hard work.

475
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,720
If you're going to study something,

476
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,359
you're going to dig into it.

477
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,959
Some people love studying.

478
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,639
But a lot of people don't like studying.

479
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:05,160
I remember in Bible college,

480
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,799
there was one professor in particular.

481
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,919
We had a couple of professors that were really kind.

482
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:10,279
They would give us some insight

483
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:13,119
as to what our final would be in our classes

484
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,119
and they would tell us,

485
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:15,799
know these things, so on and so forth,

486
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:17,479
and give you kind of a study guide

487
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:19,880
of what to study to be prepared for the final.

488
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,279
And we had one professor

489
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,559
that every class I ever took with that man,

490
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:26,119
every time we'd come to the week before finals,

491
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,359
he would say this,

492
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:29,440
know everything.

493
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,720
Well, that's helpful, isn't it?

494
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,160
Thank you.

495
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,880
And that's what he would say.

496
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,720
And he wanted to help us understand

497
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,959
the importance of study.

498
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:43,720
Study. Know it.

499
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,359
Study to show thyself approved unto God.

500
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:49,040
A workman, notice what he says,

501
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,880
that needeth not to be ashamed,

502
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,559
rightly dividing the word of truth.

503
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,639
Listen, when you've studied the word of God

504
00:26:54,639 --> 00:26:56,679
and you've come to the conclusion

505
00:26:56,679 --> 00:26:58,440
as to what God's Word says,

506
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,239
you don't have to be ashamed of it.

507
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,040
It doesn't matter that there are other groups of people

508
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,359
that will disagree.

509
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,959
It doesn't matter that the popular opinion

510
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:13,199
is in disagreement with what you have concluded scripturally.

511
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:16,359
You have studied and you have concluded

512
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:19,160
that this is what God says on the subject.

513
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,000
You don't need to be ashamed about it.

514
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:24,679
God said it.

515
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:25,639
That settles it.

516
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:31,119
I know there's a saying that was very popular years ago.

517
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:31,959
God said it.

518
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:33,079
I believe it.

519
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,320
That settles it.

520
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,239
I think that's cute.

521
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,079
I think it's good.

522
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:38,000
But the reality is that whether you believe it or not,

523
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,199
it doesn't really matter.

524
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:43,760
Because God said it and that settles it.

525
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,919
Amen?

526
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:45,919
I don't believe it.

527
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,600
Well, God ain't gonna change.

528
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:49,760
Right?

529
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,679
It's just not gonna happen.

530
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,199
And so we ought to just believe what God says.

531
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:57,199
Let's finish in 2 Peter 3.

532
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:00,359
2 Peter 3, I want you to notice

533
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:03,320
at the end of this portion of Scripture

534
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,479
that Peter's gonna give these folks

535
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:07,799
some really important truth.

536
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,440
In the book of 1 Peter,

537
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,440
if I could just really quickly summarize,

538
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,440
in the book of 1 Peter,

539
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,839
that book is being written to those folks

540
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:18,679
really that are in need of encouragement.

541
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:20,199
They had been scattered abroad

542
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,000
because of the persecution under Nero

543
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,079
and all that was going on,

544
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:25,519
and they were in need of encouragement.

545
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:26,639
Can I tell you, there are times

546
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:28,919
that we're in need of encouragement.

547
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:32,000
And I'm thankful that God's Word encourages us.

548
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,200
In 2 Peter, really the idea

549
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,760
in the main thrust of the book

550
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,880
is not one given because of a need of encouragement.

551
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,919
Rather, they were in need of instruction.

552
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,880
Again, I'm thankful there are times

553
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,239
that we need instruction.

554
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:54,320
And God's Word provides instruction.

555
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,679
In the book of 2 Peter,

556
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:56,919
as you study through the book,

557
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:58,719
you'll find that there are many things

558
00:28:58,719 --> 00:29:00,559
that are given to us about false teachers

559
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,640
and about their behavior

560
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,919
and about how they operate

561
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:04,039
and so on and so forth.

562
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:07,839
And these believers needed instruction.

563
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:10,080
And God, in His infinite wisdom,

564
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,440
He spoke through Peter

565
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,320
to write the book of 2 Peter.

566
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,159
It is Scripture.

567
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:16,159
It's been preserved for us.

568
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,919
And oh, how beneficial it is for us

569
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:21,599
to have the instruction that's contained therein.

570
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:25,159
As He ends the book,

571
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:27,719
notice the last two verses of 2 Peter 3,

572
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:29,400
verses 17 and 18.

573
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,799
The Bible says this.

574
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:33,960
Ye, therefore, beloved,

575
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,919
seeing ye know these things before,

576
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:41,640
beware, lest ye, also being led away

577
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,520
with the error of the wicked,

578
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,520
fall from your own steadfastness.

579
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,159
You see that word error?

580
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,880
It's not the same exact Greek word,

581
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,279
but it's the Greek word that is derived,

582
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:56,679
excuse me, the Greek word deceive

583
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:58,400
that we've been mentioning throughout this study

584
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,320
is derived from this word.

585
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,360
that's translated error.

586
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,980
And guess what a valid translation

587
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,600
of that Greek word is?

588
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,860
Not only error, but deceive.

589
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,860
So guess what?

590
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,660
He's saying to these believers

591
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,260
that are in need of instruction

592
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,380
that they have known these things

593
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,060
and they need to take warning

594
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,060
and to beware lest ye also

595
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:26,460
being led away with the error of the wicked

596
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,820
fall from your own steadfastness.

597
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,300
What's the answer?

598
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,420
But grow in grace

599
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:37,780
and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

600
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,060
To Him be glory both now and forever.

601
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,620
Amen.

602
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,220
How do I avoid being led away

603
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,660
with the error of the wicked?

604
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,860
I better grow.

605
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,780
I better grow.

606
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,980
And I better grow in the grace

607
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,520
and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior

608
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,640
Jesus Christ.

609
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,520
How am I going to grow?

610
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,680
Well, back in 1 Peter,

611
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,840
he said in chapter 2 and verse number 2,

612
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,280
as newborn babes,

613
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,000
desire the sincere milk of the Word

614
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,600
that ye may grow thereby.

615
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,480
The Word of God produces growth

616
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,480
in our lives spiritually.

617
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,880
You're not going to grow spiritually

618
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,360
apart from this book.

619
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,880
It is this book that provides

620
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,880
the spiritual growth that we need.

621
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,880
So these Sadducees, they come to Jesus.

622
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,320
I think, man, we got them now.

623
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,000
Let's see what Jesus is going to say

624
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,200
about this one.

625
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,680
Let's paint this scenario

626
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,920
and here's the situation.

627
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,560
There were seven brethren

628
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,880
and they go through the scenario.

629
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,160
So in the resurrection,

630
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,200
whose wife shall she be?

631
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,640
Jesus said, you guys have been deceived.

632
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,080
You therefore greatly err.

633
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,040
You've been deceived.

634
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,560
Why? What led to their deception?

635
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,200
You don't know the Scriptures.

636
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,160
Neither the power of God.

637
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,840
They had the Scriptures.

638
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,440
They referred to the Scriptures.

639
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,800
But they didn't know them.

640
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,720
They didn't allow the Scriptures

641
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,520
to dictate their belief.

642
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,760
They had their own beliefs.

643
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,720
They had their own traditions.

644
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,800
And they said, how are we going to make this

645
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,920
fit what we believe?

646
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,840
This evening, I hope that we would not

647
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,120
be led away with the error of the wicked one.

648
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,560
We understand that we're living

649
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,040
in an age of deception.

650
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,240
They're lying in wait to deceive.

651
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,280
There are many deceivers.

652
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,080
What must we do?

653
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,400
We must know the book.

654
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,320
He said, you don't know the book.

655
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,760
Oh, that it would never be said of us.

656
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,960
That we don't know the book

657
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,080
or we don't know the power of God.

658
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,680
But that we would understand

659
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,000
that God's given us this book

660
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,720
and oh, what a joy it is to study it.

661
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,040
To search it.

662
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,000
You find the truth that God gives us.

663
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,960
And when people come and make their statements

664
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,280
and try to lead us into error,

665
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,440
we say, no, no, no.

666
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,160
The Bible says,

667
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,640
and we have studied

668
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,160
and we do not need to be ashamed.

669
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,080
Amen?

670
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,680
Let's pray.

671
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,880
Father, we love You.

672
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,000
We thank You for loving us.

673
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,360
Thank You for this conversation

674
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,760
that was recorded for us

675
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,160
that helps us.

676
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,480
That helps us to understand

677
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,320
the ways in which we can be led into error.

678
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,160
Led into being deceived.

679
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,360
Help us to know the Word of God.

680
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,960
Help us to know the power of God.

681
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,400
I believe that as we would have

682
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,640
a knowledge of Your Word,

683
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,320
that we also would have a knowledge of Your power.

684
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,920
For Your power is not only declared in Your Word,

685
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,600
but it's demonstrated over and over

686
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,240
through this precious book.

687
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,160
Thank You for the privilege of prayer.

688
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,160
We pray You've commanded us,

689
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,839
You've invited us to enter into Your presence.

690
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,320
And we demonstrate our dependence upon You

691
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,920
recognizing that we can't, but You can.

692
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,679
And God, I pray that as we engage

693
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,720
in corporate intercessory prayer,

694
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,119
that You'd meet with us.

695
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,240
Encourage us.

696
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,240
Help us to labor in prayer.

697
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,279
And we'll thank You for it.

698
00:34:39,279 --> 00:34:40,839
In Christ's name we pray,

699
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:41,839
Amen.
