00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400
12, Mark chapter number 12 this evening, and I'll be looking at verses 18-27, Mark chapter

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:15.079
number 12 verses 18-27, and the text of Scripture that is before us this evening provides us

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:20.280
with a record of a conversation that takes place between the Lord Jesus Christ and the

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.600
Sadducees.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.520
As you read the New Testament, you have the opportunity to come across the terminology,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.119
the group of people that are referred to as the Sadducees, and then of course the Pharisees,

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:36.959
and as you read about these religious groups of people, you read about the scribes and

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:43.099
what have you, but here, specifically, the context of the conversation that is recorded

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:48.819
for us is that between the Sadducees and the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:54.419
These Sadducees were religious leaders during this particular time of Christ, and they come

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:55.979
to Jesus with a question.

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:00.180
As you study the Gospels, you'll find often that the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.660
scribes, the religious leaders of the day, that they often would try to catch Jesus in

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.019
saying something that was contrary to what they believed, and try to find occasion to

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:17.419
find fault, and so on and so forth, and often times they would show up to where Jesus was

00:01:17.419 --> 00:01:23.419
teaching for all of the wrong reason, and they had wrong motives, and here we find in

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:28.500
this particular conversation that really what is recorded to us is that they think

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.660
they have this question that is going to leave the Lord Jesus Christ cornered without an

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.180
answer.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.540
And we know that He is God and that He is omniscient, He knows all things, and as a

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.339
side thought, I kind of wonder this evening how long these Sadducees sat around and how

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:52.739
many different seminar hearings they had in order to come up with this question, right?

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:58.339
I mean, they're trying to corner the Lord Jesus Christ, and we find that as we look

00:01:58.339 --> 00:02:03.779
at the passage of Scripture, I would mention just very quickly, and we'll kind of circle

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:09.779
back to it at the end, but I wonder tonight if these Sadducees would have spent as much

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:16.820
time actually studying the Word of God as they did on trying to figure out how to corner

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.339
Jesus, that perhaps they wouldn't have had to have the question for Jesus because they

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:26.979
would have come to the proper conclusion biblically.

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:32.940
And I mentioned this many years ago as you look at David and Saul, and it's a completely

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.899
different context, but the Bible says that Saul made David his enemy continually and

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:43.660
he sought him, and he spent all of this time seeking David, seeking to kill him, and I

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.179
often wonder what if he would have sought God with just a measure of that which he sought

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:52.539
David, how things would have been different in the life of Saul.

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:56.300
But we find here that these religious leaders, they weren't really interested in studying

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.220
the Scriptures to come to the conclusion that they needed to come to, rather they sought

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.619
to question the Lord Jesus Christ and corner Him.

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:11.339
As we look at the passage, I really want to focus our attention upon the response of Jesus,

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:14.539
which is recorded for us in verses 24 through 27.

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:18.300
As we would focus our attention this evening on the latter part of the text that we'll

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:24.020
study, the purpose in so doing is so that we can be better equipped to deal with this

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.940
matter of deception.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.699
I've mentioned as we've had this series here on Wednesday evenings for a little over a

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:35.539
month now that we are living in an age of deception, there is the danger of deception,

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:41.259
and we find that as we look at the truth that is before us this evening, you will not find

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:46.339
the word deceive or deceived or deceiving, but I want you to understand, look at it in

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:48.020
verse number 24, the Bible says,

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.860
"...and Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore..."

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.899
Look at that word, err, "...because ye know not the Scriptures, neither the power of God."

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:03.460
Now, skip down to verse 27, we'll look at the whole context as we go through the message

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.740
this evening, but look at verse 27, it says,

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.820
"...he is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living."

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.500
Notice this phrase, "...ye therefore do greatly err."

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.019
I've used that phrase at the end of verse number 27 for our lesson tonight as a title,

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.899
"...ye therefore do greatly err."

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:27.899
That word err in verse number 24, and again in verse number 27, is actually the same exact

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:32.420
Greek word that is used in many of the other passages that we've studied in these last

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.579
six weeks that is translated deceive or deceived.

00:04:37.579 --> 00:04:42.660
And we find that here, as we've mentioned that word and we've looked at it and we've

00:04:42.739 --> 00:04:50.459
dissected it, we understand that it also carries with it the idea of being led into error.

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:56.140
And here we find that that's really the context in what we're finding, is that Jesus says

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.540
to these Sadducees, "...do ye not therefore err?

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.540
Ye therefore do greatly err."

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.519
They had been deceived.

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:12.760
And we find that as we look at this passage of Scripture, we can answer the question,

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.920
what led to their deception?

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.480
Start back with me in verse number 18.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.320
The Bible says, "...then come unto him the Sadducees, which say, there is no resurrection.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.040
And they asked him, saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, if a man's brother die and

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.959
leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife and

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:35.359
raise up seed unto his brother."

00:05:35.359 --> 00:05:39.880
Without having to go back to the Old Testament, the Pentateuch, we would quickly acknowledge

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.480
that what they're saying is accurate with regard to what Moses had written to them concerning

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.279
the particular subject.

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:52.519
They then come up with this particular scenario, this hypothetical, and they say this in verse

00:05:52.519 --> 00:06:01.799
number 20, "...now there were seven brethren, and the first took a wife, and dying left

00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:03.540
no seed.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.480
And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.279
And the third likewise, and the seven had her, and left no seed.

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:15.160
Last of all, the woman died also.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:22.959
In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them?

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:25.519
For the seven had heard a wife."

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:30.059
Now it's kind of interesting that in verse number 18, the Bible reveals to us that they

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:35.100
say, the Sadducees, they say there is no resurrection.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.140
Bible scholars for years have said that's why they're sad, you see, because they don't

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.820
believe in a resurrection.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:46.700
But the reality is that when they're trying to corner Jesus, they say in verse number

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.779
23, "...in the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise."

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:55.299
But they don't even believe in a resurrection.

00:06:55.299 --> 00:07:01.579
We find that Jesus, as He's going to respond to them, He graciously answers their question,

00:07:01.579 --> 00:07:07.540
but He also corrects their error in their doctrine, in their theology, if you will.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:13.619
So we notice that these Sadducees, they've come up with this question, this hypothetical,

00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:18.420
they've come and they've provided this scenario to the Lord Jesus Christ, and they ask in

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:23.339
verse number 23, "...whose wife shall she be of them?

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:26.279
For the seven had heard a wife."

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.779
Notice how Jesus responds.

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:34.779
I do not believe for one second that they expected that this would be how He would respond.

00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:38.940
He says, "...do ye not therefore err?"

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:45.579
Whoa, what do you mean we're, what do you mean we err, right?

00:07:45.579 --> 00:07:53.660
Notice what He says, "...because ye know not the Scriptures, neither the power of God."

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:59.980
Here in verse number 24, we find that God gives us insight as to what led to their deception.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.660
Now I believe that as we study the passage of Scripture and we gain this insight that

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:09.940
is provided to us, it will help us in preventing deception in our own lives.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.700
What was it that led to the deception in the lives of these Sadducees when they come and

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:20.380
they bring this question and they seek to corner Jesus and to cause Him to not be able

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.380
to answer the question?

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:28.739
Well, God gives us two reasons that they had been deceived, or two things that led to their deception.

00:08:28.739 --> 00:08:38.099
I want you to understand that He says this in verse number 24, "...ye know not the Scriptures."

00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:40.859
Ye know not the Scriptures.

00:08:40.859 --> 00:08:46.979
Understand, they had the Scriptures.

00:08:46.979 --> 00:08:56.099
It was not a matter of them being truly ignorant without having biblical truth that led to

00:08:56.099 --> 00:08:59.820
the question, a question in which they were seeking truth.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.380
No, they're trying to corner Jesus.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.059
Their motive is not right.

00:09:05.059 --> 00:09:11.020
And here Jesus says that they had been led into error, they had been deceived because

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.739
they do not know the Scriptures.

00:09:12.739 --> 00:09:15.979
Again, it was not that they did not have the Scriptures.

00:09:15.979 --> 00:09:18.340
It wasn't even that they didn't use the Scriptures.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:24.900
For we find that they say in verse number 19, "...Moses wrote unto us."

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.900
And then they say, if a man's brother died, they quote a passage from Deuteronomy.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.380
And they're familiar with the Scriptures.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:38.059
The Pentateuch, as we would often refer to it as, the Law, the five books of Moses, is

00:09:38.059 --> 00:09:41.340
what he's referring to here, these Sadducees are referring to.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:47.020
Moses wrote unto us, and they accepted the Pentateuch as being the Word of God.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:53.539
They accepted the Scriptures as being these first five books, and we find that they used

00:09:53.539 --> 00:09:54.900
the Scriptures.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.340
But Jesus said, "...ye do err."

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.340
Why?

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.059
Because you know not the Scriptures.

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:03.279
It wasn't that they didn't have them, it wasn't that they didn't use them,

00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:07.779
it was that they did not properly know the Scriptures.

00:10:07.779 --> 00:10:09.359
Let me say it this way.

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:19.039
They refused, the Sadducees refused, to allow the Scriptures to dictate their belief.

00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:26.219
Instead of allowing the Scriptures to dictate and to determine what they would believe,

00:10:26.219 --> 00:10:31.519
they had their own belief, they had their own tradition,

00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:35.899
they had their own presuppositions, if you will,

00:10:35.899 --> 00:10:40.779
and they already had their mind filled with what they wanted to believe,

00:10:40.779 --> 00:10:44.399
and we're not going to let the Scriptures mess with that.

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:49.379
Does it not sound familiar with some stuff that we deal with in society today?

00:10:49.379 --> 00:10:51.499
There's no room for the real truth

00:10:51.499 --> 00:10:56.499
because there's all this false stuff that's filled the heads of people.

00:10:56.499 --> 00:10:59.499
And you try to give them truth, but they've already erred,

00:10:59.499 --> 00:11:01.539
they've already believed something else,

00:11:01.539 --> 00:11:04.720
and they're so set in what they believe

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:11.879
that they're not willing to allow the Scriptures to dictate their belief.

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:17.399
This evening, we understand, we say it often as Baptist people,

00:11:17.419 --> 00:11:21.799
that the Bible is our sole authority for faith and practice.

00:11:21.799 --> 00:11:27.939
There is nothing else that stands at the same level as the Bible

00:11:27.939 --> 00:11:32.059
with regard to dictating our doctrine, our belief.

00:11:32.059 --> 00:11:34.819
The Bible stands alone. Amen?

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:38.819
There's no other religious book, there's no other tradition,

00:11:38.819 --> 00:11:44.199
there's no other anything that we set at the same level as the Bible,

00:11:44.199 --> 00:11:48.379
or even at a higher level than the Bible.

00:11:48.379 --> 00:11:52.959
Today, if you were to look at many groups of people around the world

00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:54.720
that would claim to be religious,

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.759
even as the Sadducees would claim to be religious,

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:00.799
they may not deny the Bible,

00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:04.839
but they would hold the tradition of their church fathers

00:12:04.839 --> 00:12:07.479
in higher regard than the Bible.

00:12:07.479 --> 00:12:13.940
They would hold some other holy book higher in regard than the Bible.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.259
And we find that what Jesus is saying to these Sadducees,

00:12:18.259 --> 00:12:21.639
He says, you err. Do you not therefore err?

00:12:21.639 --> 00:12:24.779
Why? Number one, because you know not the Scriptures.

00:12:24.779 --> 00:12:31.440
You refuse to allow the Scriptures to dictate your belief.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.000
I hope that we'd never be there.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
I hope that we'd be humble enough to say,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.039
it's the Bible that's going to tell me what to believe.

00:12:41.059 --> 00:12:45.220
It's not me that's going to misinterpret or misapply Scripture

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.720
to make it fit what I want to believe.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.139
There are people that twist Scriptures all kinds of ways

00:12:53.139 --> 00:12:57.440
to try to make it fit what they want to do.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.639
And we must understand that this is one of the great dangers

00:13:01.639 --> 00:13:05.979
that is revealed to us with regard to what leads into error,

00:13:05.979 --> 00:13:08.319
what leads into being deceived,

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.099
is not having the knowledge of the Scriptures.

00:13:11.099 --> 00:13:14.479
Notice what he says is really the second reason

00:13:14.479 --> 00:13:17.899
that led to their deception at the end of verse 24,

00:13:17.899 --> 00:13:22.239
neither the power of God.

00:13:22.239 --> 00:13:24.160
They did not know the power of God.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.819
Now with regard to the answer in verse 24,

00:13:27.819 --> 00:13:29.199
I want you to understand,

00:13:29.199 --> 00:13:34.419
Jesus is not giving these two truths in verse 24

00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:39.520
to answer their question about whose wife shall she be.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.160
He'll answer that in a moment.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.239
He's giving this truth because of their error

00:13:45.239 --> 00:13:48.279
with regard to the resurrection.

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:50.000
He's fixing their doctrine.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.419
He's correcting their belief.

00:13:52.419 --> 00:13:54.699
Now, they didn't believe in the resurrection

00:13:54.699 --> 00:13:57.880
because they didn't believe in the power of God.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.880
How is it that this could happen?

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.539
Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15,

00:14:02.539 --> 00:14:05.500
and I'll say some among you that there is no resurrection.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.959
If Christ be not risen,

00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:09.580
then our preaching is vain, our faith is vain,

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.880
but now is Christ risen, he says.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.419
And so we find that as we notice here,

00:14:15.419 --> 00:14:17.119
he says neither the power of God.

00:14:17.119 --> 00:14:19.799
Now I want you just for a moment in your mind tonight

00:14:19.799 --> 00:14:21.540
to think about these Sadducees

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.380
and they had the book of Moses

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.299
and we use that terminology to refer to the Pentateuch.

00:14:26.299 --> 00:14:29.540
They had the first five books of the Bible

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.880
and they believed them

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.919
according to what they would say,

00:14:33.919 --> 00:14:35.380
what they would acknowledge.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:41.720
They held that the books of Moses were Scripture.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.299
Is it not amazing

00:14:44.299 --> 00:14:46.880
how in those first five books of the Bible,

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:52.079
God demonstrates His power in amazing ways?

00:14:52.079 --> 00:14:56.339
How can you not know the power of God,

00:14:56.339 --> 00:14:59.220
but read the Pentateuch?

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:02.720
Just the first pages of Genesis.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.760
God said, let there be light.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.059
And there was light.

00:15:09.059 --> 00:15:12.720
How is that not a demonstration of the power of God?

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.519
So He can create everything out of nothing,

00:15:16.519 --> 00:15:22.059
but He can't resurrect?

00:15:22.059 --> 00:15:24.519
I mean, we could look at a whole host of things.

00:15:24.519 --> 00:15:26.220
We understand we've studied through

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.720
the book of Genesis on Sunday evenings

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.059
for a long time now

00:15:30.059 --> 00:15:33.220
and finished up chapter 22 this last Sunday evening.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.559
But in so doing, we've learned many things

00:15:35.559 --> 00:15:38.720
about how God revealed Himself to Abraham.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.059
El Shaddai, the Almighty God.

00:15:41.059 --> 00:15:44.899
Is anything too hard for me? He asks Abraham.

00:15:44.899 --> 00:15:46.859
We find that you would begin to look

00:15:46.859 --> 00:15:49.480
through the book of Exodus,

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.059
a reference to what Jesus will give here

00:15:52.059 --> 00:15:55.220
in just a few moments in His answer to their question.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.600
And we find that as we look at the book of Exodus

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.940
and you begin to read about the plagues,

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:05.139
is that not a demonstration of the power of God?

00:16:05.139 --> 00:16:08.279
I mean, even the Egyptians

00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:13.899
recognize this is the finger of God.

00:16:13.899 --> 00:16:15.820
They recognize this power.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.779
And here are these religious leaders.

00:16:17.779 --> 00:16:19.200
We believe the book of Moses.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.320
We have the first five books.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.739
But we don't believe in the resurrection.

00:16:23.739 --> 00:16:26.160
But yet, they're going to corner Jesus and say,

00:16:26.179 --> 00:16:28.639
in the resurrection, when they shall rise,

00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:31.380
whose wife shall she be?

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.760
And Jesus says,

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.139
do you not therefore err?

00:16:36.139 --> 00:16:40.839
Number one, because you know not the Scriptures.

00:16:40.839 --> 00:16:46.079
Number two, because you know not the power of God.

00:16:46.079 --> 00:16:50.839
I hope tonight that we would be absolutely

00:16:50.839 --> 00:16:54.919
convinced of God's power.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:59.339
That there is nothing too hard for Him.

00:16:59.339 --> 00:17:01.880
That He is able to do exceeding abundantly

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.239
above all that we ask or think.

00:17:05.239 --> 00:17:07.000
That as we understand,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.079
even as we started our Sunday School series

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.899
on the miracles of Jesus Christ,

00:17:12.899 --> 00:17:20.160
that with God, nothing shall be impossible.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.440
Indeed, we think we have moments in our lives

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.000
where we look at circumstances

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.600
and we look at the mountains in our lives

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.679
and we say, how can we ever deal with this?

00:17:30.679 --> 00:17:32.959
How can this ever?

00:17:32.959 --> 00:17:35.820
Don't leave God out of the equation.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:36.839
Amen?

00:17:36.839 --> 00:17:40.239
Because He's the God of the impossible.

00:17:40.239 --> 00:17:44.639
And here, what led to them being in error,

00:17:44.639 --> 00:17:46.639
what led to them being deceived,

00:17:46.639 --> 00:17:48.040
was two-fold.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.119
They did not know the Scriptures,

00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:54.559
and they did not know the power of God.

00:17:54.559 --> 00:17:57.119
Jesus answered the question that they asked

00:17:57.119 --> 00:17:58.720
in verse 23,

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:03.119
and I believe it's gracious of our Savior to do so,

00:18:03.119 --> 00:18:06.160
but we find that He corrected their wrong doctrine

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.000
as I mentioned a moment ago.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
And it's very interesting that He did so

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.040
by using the Pentateuch.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.079
The very books of the Bible

00:18:16.079 --> 00:18:20.200
that these Sadducees would have claimed to believe,

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:24.040
Jesus is going to use those very books

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.880
to answer and to correct their doctrine.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.200
Notice in v. 25-26,

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.440
for when they shall rise from the dead.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.599
Don't you love how Jesus says that?

00:18:35.599 --> 00:18:37.919
It's not a matter of if.

00:18:37.919 --> 00:18:39.520
Yes, they will. Why?

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.520
Because He understands,

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.239
I am the resurrection and the life.

00:18:42.239 --> 00:18:43.760
Is that not what He said?

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.840
If you look at the seven I Am statements

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.200
of Jesus in the book of John,

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.159
one of them is I Am the resurrection and the life.

00:18:51.159 --> 00:18:54.400
For when they shall rise from the dead,

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.279
they neither marry nor are given in marriage,

00:18:58.279 --> 00:19:01.159
but are as the angels which are in heaven

00:19:01.159 --> 00:19:04.239
and as touching the dead that they rise.

00:19:04.239 --> 00:19:06.640
So we find again, He gives the answer

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.599
and He really focuses in on this thing

00:19:09.599 --> 00:19:11.679
of the resurrection.

00:19:11.679 --> 00:19:13.960
Because it was their doctrine that was wrong

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.719
and they had been led into this error

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.039
and into this deception.

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:18.760
And so we find that He tells them,

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.159
listen, they're not going to marry.

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:21.760
They're not going to be given in marriage.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.679
They'll be like the angels which are in heaven.

00:19:23.679 --> 00:19:26.479
Again, this is a truth that is revealed to us here.

00:19:26.479 --> 00:19:28.799
Obviously, this is not the truth

00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:30.520
that He's referring to when He says,

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.919
you know not the Scriptures.

00:19:32.919 --> 00:19:34.279
The truth that He's referring to

00:19:34.279 --> 00:19:35.719
when He says, you know not the Scriptures,

00:19:35.719 --> 00:19:38.000
is the truth of the resurrection.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.840
And so He says, for when they shall rise from the dead,

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.640
and He gives the answer with regard to the marriage

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.679
that is asked in v. 23.

00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:47.799
Then we come to v. 26 and He says,

00:19:47.799 --> 00:19:53.080
and as touching the dead that they rise.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.880
You see how He's focusing on that thing of the resurrection?

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.599
Listen, it's so vital.

00:19:57.599 --> 00:20:00.119
We understand that the resurrection of Jesus Christ is...

00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:04.119
He is the cornerstone of our faith.

00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:06.639
I mentioned 1 Corinthians 15 a few moments ago.

00:20:06.639 --> 00:20:08.159
If Christ be not risen,

00:20:08.159 --> 00:20:10.139
there's no reason for us to even

00:20:10.139 --> 00:20:11.839
think about meeting.

00:20:11.839 --> 00:20:15.759
It's pointless.

00:20:15.759 --> 00:20:17.359
But He is risen.

00:20:17.359 --> 00:20:19.819
He is risen indeed,

00:20:19.819 --> 00:20:22.799
as Luke 24 tells us.

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:24.379
And notice, he says,

00:20:24.379 --> 00:20:26.119
have ye not read,

00:20:26.119 --> 00:20:27.279
and what does he say?

00:20:27.279 --> 00:20:29.239
In the book of Moses.

00:20:29.239 --> 00:20:31.199
Don't you love that?

00:20:31.199 --> 00:20:33.399
Our Lord had such a way

00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:35.399
of answering the questions

00:20:35.399 --> 00:20:38.479
and really dealing with people in grace.

00:20:38.479 --> 00:20:40.639
Speaking, we mentioned on Sunday morning

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:42.279
about the importance of our speech

00:20:42.279 --> 00:20:44.279
being always with grace

00:20:44.279 --> 00:20:47.119
and how they observe the graciousness

00:20:47.119 --> 00:20:48.839
of the speech of Jesus.

00:20:48.839 --> 00:20:50.399
But He says, have ye not read

00:20:50.399 --> 00:20:53.799
in the book of Moses

00:20:53.799 --> 00:20:55.679
how in the bush God spake unto Him?

00:20:55.679 --> 00:20:57.599
What's He talking about?

00:20:57.599 --> 00:20:59.199
Exodus?

00:20:59.199 --> 00:21:00.479
Remember the burning bush?

00:21:00.479 --> 00:21:02.159
Remember Moses?

00:21:02.159 --> 00:21:03.559
He's referring to an account

00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:05.319
that they would have absolutely

00:21:05.319 --> 00:21:07.839
been familiar with.

00:21:07.839 --> 00:21:09.479
And He says this,

00:21:09.479 --> 00:21:12.559
that how in the bush God spake unto Him

00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:18.159
saying, I am the God of Abraham

00:21:18.159 --> 00:21:20.199
and the God of Isaac

00:21:20.199 --> 00:21:22.199
and the God of Jacob.

00:21:22.199 --> 00:21:26.639
Now, when God Almighty appears to Moses

00:21:26.639 --> 00:21:28.119
in that portion of Scripture

00:21:28.119 --> 00:21:30.239
in Exodus chapter 3,

00:21:30.239 --> 00:21:32.639
we find that at that point,

00:21:32.639 --> 00:21:35.079
these men that are mentioned here,

00:21:35.079 --> 00:21:37.039
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,

00:21:37.039 --> 00:21:39.599
they had died physically.

00:21:39.599 --> 00:21:41.239
Correct?

00:21:41.239 --> 00:21:43.679
You can read of it in the book of Genesis.

00:21:43.679 --> 00:21:46.159
You can understand of their death.

00:21:46.159 --> 00:21:47.599
And you can look to the places

00:21:47.599 --> 00:21:49.479
in which they were buried.

00:21:49.479 --> 00:21:52.319
And we find that they no doubt

00:21:52.319 --> 00:21:53.679
had been familiar with this,

00:21:53.679 --> 00:21:55.199
but they did not connect the dots.

00:21:55.199 --> 00:21:56.959
Remember, they did not allow

00:21:56.999 --> 00:22:02.719
the Scripture to dictate their belief.

00:22:02.719 --> 00:22:04.399
He is the God of Abraham,

00:22:04.399 --> 00:22:05.279
the God of Isaac,

00:22:05.279 --> 00:22:06.239
the God of Jacob.

00:22:06.239 --> 00:22:07.119
Notice what He says.

00:22:07.119 --> 00:22:09.440
He is not the God of the dead,

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.519
but the God of the living.

00:22:12.519 --> 00:22:14.279
He's the God of the living.

00:22:14.279 --> 00:22:15.360
And then He says again,

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:21.479
ye therefore do greatly err.

00:22:21.479 --> 00:22:24.080
Again, as we think about this subject

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.239
of deception and we notice

00:22:26.279 --> 00:22:28.199
in this passage of Scripture

00:22:28.199 --> 00:22:30.959
how that Jesus deals with a group of people

00:22:30.959 --> 00:22:33.080
that have been deceived.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.399
And as we dig in and say,

00:22:35.399 --> 00:22:37.839
okay, why have they been deceived?

00:22:37.839 --> 00:22:40.159
What is it that led to their deception?

00:22:40.159 --> 00:22:42.799
And we answer the question

00:22:42.799 --> 00:22:45.319
with that twofold answer from verse 24

00:22:45.319 --> 00:22:46.679
of not knowing the Scriptures

00:22:46.679 --> 00:22:48.360
nor the power of God.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.119
We find that this gives us insight

00:22:51.119 --> 00:22:55.119
as to how we can guard against deception.

00:22:55.119 --> 00:22:56.799
How can we guard against deception?

00:22:56.799 --> 00:22:59.319
Remember, He says be not deceived.

00:22:59.319 --> 00:23:00.839
Remember, He says that there are many

00:23:00.839 --> 00:23:02.399
that lie in wait to deceive.

00:23:02.399 --> 00:23:03.919
He says in the last times

00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:05.319
that evil men and seducers

00:23:05.319 --> 00:23:06.839
are going to wax worse and worse

00:23:06.839 --> 00:23:08.919
deceiving and being deceived.

00:23:08.919 --> 00:23:10.080
And so we understand

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.639
that all of these warnings

00:23:11.639 --> 00:23:12.799
have been given to us

00:23:12.799 --> 00:23:15.479
with regard to this age of deception.

00:23:15.479 --> 00:23:16.479
And so what do we do?

00:23:16.479 --> 00:23:20.519
How do we come to a place

00:23:20.559 --> 00:23:25.239
where we are prepared for this deception?

00:23:25.239 --> 00:23:27.080
I would say simply this,

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.000
know the book.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.839
Know the book.

00:23:31.839 --> 00:23:33.879
Know the truth.

00:23:33.879 --> 00:23:35.279
Notice what John 5 says.

00:23:35.279 --> 00:23:36.839
Turn over, if you will, to the book of John.

00:23:36.839 --> 00:23:38.879
We'll look at three passages of Scripture

00:23:38.879 --> 00:23:40.119
that will be done tonight

00:23:40.119 --> 00:23:41.599
and enter into our prayer time.

00:23:41.599 --> 00:23:45.799
John 5 and verse 39.

00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:48.199
Here again in this passage of Scripture,

00:23:48.199 --> 00:23:51.279
we find that Jesus is speaking here

00:23:51.279 --> 00:23:53.319
and a discourse is going on

00:23:53.319 --> 00:23:55.199
and of course, dealing with some of those

00:23:55.199 --> 00:23:57.440
religious leaders of the day again.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.239
And He says this in verse 39,

00:24:00.239 --> 00:24:04.000
Search the Scriptures,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.679
for in them ye think

00:24:08.679 --> 00:24:10.839
ye have eternal life.

00:24:10.839 --> 00:24:16.559
And they are they which testify of Me.

00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:18.040
Search the Scriptures.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.880
Study the Word of God.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.160
Dig in.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.359
And we find that as we study

00:24:23.359 --> 00:24:24.679
and search the Scriptures,

00:24:24.679 --> 00:24:25.919
that we allow the Scriptures

00:24:25.919 --> 00:24:28.320
to dictate our belief.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.880
When we find that we're in a place

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.040
where I come to a passage of Scripture

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.399
and there's something different

00:24:33.399 --> 00:24:35.519
that I believed prior to reading

00:24:35.519 --> 00:24:36.760
this portion of Scripture,

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.919
and God, as I'm reading the Word of God,

00:24:38.919 --> 00:24:40.959
the Holy Spirit of God is teaching me

00:24:40.959 --> 00:24:42.639
and illumining the Scripture to me,

00:24:42.639 --> 00:24:47.600
and I say, that's different than what I believe.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.760
Who's right? Me or God?

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.320
We know the answer. God is right.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.440
And so what must I do?

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.279
I must change my belief.

00:24:56.279 --> 00:25:01.160
I must align my belief with the Bible.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:05.639
I do not seek to twist and manipulate Scripture

00:25:05.639 --> 00:25:07.839
to make it say what I want it to say

00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:10.000
so that I can continue to believe

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.760
what I want to believe.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.519
No.

00:25:14.519 --> 00:25:16.320
Let God be true.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.519
Let every man a liar.

00:25:18.519 --> 00:25:19.959
Let God's Word stand.

00:25:19.959 --> 00:25:21.760
So we need to search the Scriptures.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.199
We're familiar with 2 Timothy 2.

00:25:24.199 --> 00:25:27.399
In 2 Timothy 2, in v. 15,

00:25:27.399 --> 00:25:29.199
Paul is giving this admonition

00:25:29.199 --> 00:25:30.760
to his son in the faith

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:35.000
and he tells him to study.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.639
Study to show thyself approved unto God.

00:25:38.639 --> 00:25:41.000
A workman that needeth not to be ashamed,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.639
rightly dividing the Word of Truth.

00:25:44.679 --> 00:25:46.760
Some people don't like study.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.320
I'm not talking about Bible study.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.359
I'm just talking about study in general.

00:25:51.359 --> 00:25:54.119
Study is hard work.

00:25:54.119 --> 00:25:55.720
If you're going to study something,

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.359
you're going to dig into it.

00:25:57.359 --> 00:26:00.959
Some people love studying.

00:26:00.959 --> 00:26:03.639
But a lot of people don't like studying.

00:26:03.639 --> 00:26:05.160
I remember in Bible college,

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.799
there was one professor in particular.

00:26:06.799 --> 00:26:08.919
We had a couple of professors that were really kind.

00:26:08.919 --> 00:26:10.279
They would give us some insight

00:26:10.279 --> 00:26:13.119
as to what our final would be in our classes

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.119
and they would tell us,

00:26:14.119 --> 00:26:15.799
know these things, so on and so forth,

00:26:15.799 --> 00:26:17.479
and give you kind of a study guide

00:26:17.479 --> 00:26:19.880
of what to study to be prepared for the final.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.279
And we had one professor

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:23.559
that every class I ever took with that man,

00:26:23.559 --> 00:26:26.119
every time we'd come to the week before finals,

00:26:26.119 --> 00:26:27.359
he would say this,

00:26:27.359 --> 00:26:29.440
know everything.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.720
Well, that's helpful, isn't it?

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.160
Thank you.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.880
And that's what he would say.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.720
And he wanted to help us understand

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.959
the importance of study.

00:26:42.079 --> 00:26:43.720
Study. Know it.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:47.359
Study to show thyself approved unto God.

00:26:47.359 --> 00:26:49.040
A workman, notice what he says,

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.880
that needeth not to be ashamed,

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.559
rightly dividing the word of truth.

00:26:52.559 --> 00:26:54.639
Listen, when you've studied the word of God

00:26:54.639 --> 00:26:56.679
and you've come to the conclusion

00:26:56.679 --> 00:26:58.440
as to what God's Word says,

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.239
you don't have to be ashamed of it.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.040
It doesn't matter that there are other groups of people

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.359
that will disagree.

00:27:06.359 --> 00:27:08.959
It doesn't matter that the popular opinion

00:27:08.959 --> 00:27:13.199
is in disagreement with what you have concluded scripturally.

00:27:13.199 --> 00:27:16.359
You have studied and you have concluded

00:27:16.359 --> 00:27:19.160
that this is what God says on the subject.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.000
You don't need to be ashamed about it.

00:27:23.239 --> 00:27:24.679
God said it.

00:27:24.679 --> 00:27:25.639
That settles it.

00:27:26.839 --> 00:27:31.119
I know there's a saying that was very popular years ago.

00:27:31.119 --> 00:27:31.959
God said it.

00:27:31.959 --> 00:27:33.079
I believe it.

00:27:33.079 --> 00:27:34.320
That settles it.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.239
I think that's cute.

00:27:35.239 --> 00:27:36.079
I think it's good.

00:27:36.079 --> 00:27:38.000
But the reality is that whether you believe it or not,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.199
it doesn't really matter.

00:27:40.839 --> 00:27:43.760
Because God said it and that settles it.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:44.919
Amen?

00:27:44.919 --> 00:27:45.919
I don't believe it.

00:27:45.919 --> 00:27:47.600
Well, God ain't gonna change.

00:27:48.919 --> 00:27:49.760
Right?

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.679
It's just not gonna happen.

00:27:51.679 --> 00:27:54.199
And so we ought to just believe what God says.

00:27:55.119 --> 00:27:57.199
Let's finish in 2 Peter 3.

00:27:58.279 --> 00:28:00.359
2 Peter 3, I want you to notice

00:28:00.359 --> 00:28:03.320
at the end of this portion of Scripture

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.479
that Peter's gonna give these folks

00:28:05.479 --> 00:28:07.799
some really important truth.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:09.440
In the book of 1 Peter,

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.440
if I could just really quickly summarize,

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.440
in the book of 1 Peter,

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.839
that book is being written to those folks

00:28:15.839 --> 00:28:18.679
really that are in need of encouragement.

00:28:18.679 --> 00:28:20.199
They had been scattered abroad

00:28:20.199 --> 00:28:22.000
because of the persecution under Nero

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.079
and all that was going on,

00:28:23.079 --> 00:28:25.519
and they were in need of encouragement.

00:28:25.519 --> 00:28:26.639
Can I tell you, there are times

00:28:26.639 --> 00:28:28.919
that we're in need of encouragement.

00:28:28.919 --> 00:28:32.000
And I'm thankful that God's Word encourages us.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.200
In 2 Peter, really the idea

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.760
in the main thrust of the book

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:42.880
is not one given because of a need of encouragement.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.919
Rather, they were in need of instruction.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.880
Again, I'm thankful there are times

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.239
that we need instruction.

00:28:51.359 --> 00:28:54.320
And God's Word provides instruction.

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.679
In the book of 2 Peter,

00:28:55.679 --> 00:28:56.919
as you study through the book,

00:28:56.919 --> 00:28:58.719
you'll find that there are many things

00:28:58.719 --> 00:29:00.559
that are given to us about false teachers

00:29:00.559 --> 00:29:01.640
and about their behavior

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:02.919
and about how they operate

00:29:02.919 --> 00:29:04.039
and so on and so forth.

00:29:04.039 --> 00:29:07.839
And these believers needed instruction.

00:29:07.839 --> 00:29:10.080
And God, in His infinite wisdom,

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.440
He spoke through Peter

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.320
to write the book of 2 Peter.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.159
It is Scripture.

00:29:15.159 --> 00:29:16.159
It's been preserved for us.

00:29:16.159 --> 00:29:18.919
And oh, how beneficial it is for us

00:29:18.919 --> 00:29:21.599
to have the instruction that's contained therein.

00:29:22.599 --> 00:29:25.159
As He ends the book,

00:29:25.159 --> 00:29:27.719
notice the last two verses of 2 Peter 3,

00:29:27.719 --> 00:29:29.400
verses 17 and 18.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.799
The Bible says this.

00:29:30.839 --> 00:29:33.960
Ye, therefore, beloved,

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.919
seeing ye know these things before,

00:29:36.919 --> 00:29:41.640
beware, lest ye, also being led away

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.520
with the error of the wicked,

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.520
fall from your own steadfastness.

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.159
You see that word error?

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.880
It's not the same exact Greek word,

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.279
but it's the Greek word that is derived,

00:29:54.279 --> 00:29:56.679
excuse me, the Greek word deceive

00:29:56.679 --> 00:29:58.400
that we've been mentioning throughout this study

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.320
is derived from this word.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.360
that's translated error.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.980
And guess what a valid translation

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:08.600
of that Greek word is?

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.860
Not only error, but deceive.

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:12.860
So guess what?

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.660
He's saying to these believers

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:16.260
that are in need of instruction

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.380
that they have known these things

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:21.060
and they need to take warning

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:23.060
and to beware lest ye also

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:26.460
being led away with the error of the wicked

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.820
fall from your own steadfastness.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.300
What's the answer?

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:33.420
But grow in grace

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:37.780
and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:41.060
To Him be glory both now and forever.

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:43.620
Amen.

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:47.220
How do I avoid being led away

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.660
with the error of the wicked?

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.860
I better grow.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:53.780
I better grow.

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.980
And I better grow in the grace

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.520
and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior

00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.640
Jesus Christ.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.520
How am I going to grow?

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.680
Well, back in 1 Peter,

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.840
he said in chapter 2 and verse number 2,

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.280
as newborn babes,

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:09.000
desire the sincere milk of the Word

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.600
that ye may grow thereby.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.480
The Word of God produces growth

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.480
in our lives spiritually.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.880
You're not going to grow spiritually

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.360
apart from this book.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.880
It is this book that provides

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.880
the spiritual growth that we need.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.880
So these Sadducees, they come to Jesus.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.320
I think, man, we got them now.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.000
Let's see what Jesus is going to say

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.200
about this one.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.680
Let's paint this scenario

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.920
and here's the situation.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.560
There were seven brethren

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.880
and they go through the scenario.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.160
So in the resurrection,

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.200
whose wife shall she be?

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:53.640
Jesus said, you guys have been deceived.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.080
You therefore greatly err.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.040
You've been deceived.

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.560
Why? What led to their deception?

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.200
You don't know the Scriptures.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:07.160
Neither the power of God.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.840
They had the Scriptures.

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.440
They referred to the Scriptures.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.800
But they didn't know them.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.720
They didn't allow the Scriptures

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.520
to dictate their belief.

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.760
They had their own beliefs.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.720
They had their own traditions.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.800
And they said, how are we going to make this

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.920
fit what we believe?

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.840
This evening, I hope that we would not

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:36.120
be led away with the error of the wicked one.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.560
We understand that we're living

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.040
in an age of deception.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.240
They're lying in wait to deceive.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:46.280
There are many deceivers.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.080
What must we do?

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.400
We must know the book.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.320
He said, you don't know the book.

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.760
Oh, that it would never be said of us.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:56.960
That we don't know the book

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.080
or we don't know the power of God.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.680
But that we would understand

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.000
that God's given us this book

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.720
and oh, what a joy it is to study it.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.040
To search it.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.000
You find the truth that God gives us.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.960
And when people come and make their statements

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.280
and try to lead us into error,

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.440
we say, no, no, no.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.160
The Bible says,

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.640
and we have studied

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.160
and we do not need to be ashamed.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.080
Amen?

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:25.680
Let's pray.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.880
Father, we love You.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.000
We thank You for loving us.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.360
Thank You for this conversation

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.760
that was recorded for us

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.160
that helps us.

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:40.480
That helps us to understand

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:45.320
the ways in which we can be led into error.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:48.160
Led into being deceived.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.360
Help us to know the Word of God.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.960
Help us to know the power of God.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.400
I believe that as we would have

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.640
a knowledge of Your Word,

00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.320
that we also would have a knowledge of Your power.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.920
For Your power is not only declared in Your Word,

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.600
but it's demonstrated over and over

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.240
through this precious book.

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:12.160
Thank You for the privilege of prayer.

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:15.160
We pray You've commanded us,

00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:17.839
You've invited us to enter into Your presence.

00:34:17.839 --> 00:34:21.320
And we demonstrate our dependence upon You

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:25.920
recognizing that we can't, but You can.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.679
And God, I pray that as we engage

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:30.720
in corporate intercessory prayer,

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.119
that You'd meet with us.

00:34:33.119 --> 00:34:35.240
Encourage us.

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.240
Help us to labor in prayer.

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.279
And we'll thank You for it.

00:34:39.279 --> 00:34:40.839
In Christ's name we pray,

00:34:40.839 --> 00:34:41.839
Amen.
