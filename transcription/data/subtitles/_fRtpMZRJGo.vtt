WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760
chapter number 35 this evening. Genesis chapter number 35, we'll be looking at verses 16-29

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.239
this evening as we finish up this 35th chapter here in the book of Genesis. As we conclude

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:17.020
this chapter, we're provided with a number of records. I'll read the text of Scripture

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.479
and then we'll deal with those and look at this passage maybe from a little peculiar

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:27.979
type of a perspective this evening. But notice with me, last week as we read the first half

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:31.860
and studied through the first 15 verses of the book of, of the 35th chapter of the book

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.900
of Genesis, we dealt with the fact that they were returning to Bethel. And what a wonderful

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.299
truth that God gave us in that portion of Scripture. And we talked about the fact that

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:47.340
Jacob of course had been to Bethel before and now this was a return for him. And they

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.979
were going there for the purpose of worship. And our God is worthy of worship. And we talked

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:56.819
about the importance of preparing for worship and looked at that passage and what a blessing

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:01.939
it was. And now the Bible tells us beginning in verse number 16 that they journeyed from

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:06.019
Bethel. And so they were there, they worshiped, and now they're departing. And the Bible says

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:11.500
this, and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath. And Rachel travailed and she had

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.699
hard labor. And it came to pass when she was in hard labor that the midwife said unto her,

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:24.000
fear not, thou shalt have this son also. And it came to pass as her soul was in departing

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.760
for she died, that she called his name Benoni, but his father called him Benjamin. And Rachel

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.680
died and was buried in the way of Ephrath which is Bethlehem. And Jacob set a pillar

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.959
upon her grave, that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day. And Israel journeyed

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:47.400
and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar. And it came to pass when Israel dwelt in the

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.959
land that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father's concubine. And Israel heard it.

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:58.720
The sons of Jacob were twelve, the sons of Leah, Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.440
and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun, the sons of Rachel, Joseph, and Benjamin,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.399
the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid, Dan, and Naphtali, the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid,

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.839
Gad, and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob which were born to him in Paddan Aram. And

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:22.000
Jacob came unto Isaac, his father, unto Mamre, unto the city of Arba, which is Hebron, where

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.839
Abraham and Isaac sojourned. The days of Isaac were 104 score years, 180 years old. Wow.

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:36.639
Verse 29, And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:43.440
old and full of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. Of course you'll remember

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.539
that after Jacob received the vision from the Lord to depart from Paddan Aram and return,

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:56.460
we read of the reunion between Jacob and Esau. And now we see this reference for after that

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.119
great reunion and we read of all of those things that transpired. There was obviously

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:06.220
a departure and they were in their different separate places. But as you end the 35th chapter

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.220
and you see once again a reference to Jacob and Esau, they are together and they are burying

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.380
their father Isaac. But as we look at this portion of Scripture in these verses that

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.740
are before us this evening, we really see the record of four events that are provided

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.259
for us. Number one, we see the record of the birth of Benjamin. And we see that in verses

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:33.419
16 through 18. We have the record of Jacob's sons in verses 23 through 26. That was a question

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:38.500
from the teens on the teen takeover, name the sons of Jacob, right? And if you, there's

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.820
a couple of places you can go and you can see the list. And here we find that in just

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.059
a few verses of Scripture, God gives us the names of the sons of Jacob. We find that the

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:53.580
text of Scripture before us records for us the death of Rachel. And we read that in verses

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.699
18 and in verse number 19. And then we find that the Bible in this portion of Scripture

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:05.059
reveals to us the death of Isaac in verses 27 through 29. And so we read of the birth

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.619
of Benjamin, all of the names of Jacob's sons, the death of Rachel and the death of Isaac.

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:18.619
And thus I have titled the message this evening, Life and Death. Life and Death. You think

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.059
about all the sons of Jacob that are mentioned in verses 23 through 26. You can go to previous

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:30.540
portions of Scripture and you can read of the record of their birth. And here does not

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.859
record for us their birth specifically, only Benjamin's birth is recorded here in this

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:40.899
portion of Scripture. But you are referencing and understanding that each of these sons

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:46.140
of Jacob were born and you can read of that. It's interesting that in these few verses

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:52.459
of Scripture, we read of life and we read of death. Let me begin to think about life

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:58.380
and begin to think about that thought from this portion of Scripture this evening. In

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:05.980
2022 globally, so not just the United States but globally, in 2022 there were about 67

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:17.980
million people that died and 140 million that were born. Life and death. 140 million born,

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:26.980
67 million died. So every single second, the exact math based on those estimate numbers

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:36.299
is that there are 4.4 births every second. Globally. 4.4 people are born, so we'd say

00:05:36.299 --> 00:05:40.579
4 people, right, because we're not having a partial, right, but you understand the math

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:49.579
exactly. But every second, 4 people are born and 2.1 people, so we'd say 2 people, die.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:58.779
So you think about that. Seconds pass so quickly. But every second that passes represents 4

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:06.059
births and 2 deaths. Life and death. We're familiar with that. We, in fact, often times

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:11.820
we don't like talking about death. In fact, there's a big word, a phobia of dying, the

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.179
fear of dying, an anxiety of dying, and you talk to some people and they have a fear of

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.100
dying. The uncertainty. The fear. In fact, the book of Hebrews talks about, in Hebrews

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.540
chapter number 2, you don't need to turn there, but in Hebrews chapter number 2 the Bible

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.339
talks about these that had this fear of death and perhaps at one point in your life you

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:37.179
would say, I had a fear of dying. The uncertainty. But we find that the Bible says in Hebrews

00:06:37.179 --> 00:06:42.260
2 and verse 14, for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:48.899
himself likewise took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:55.579
the power of death, that is the devil, and it continues and says this in verse 15, and

00:06:55.579 --> 00:07:05.940
deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. I hope

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:12.119
this evening that you can say, I do not fear death. In saying that you do not fear death,

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:16.279
that does not necessarily mean that you have a death sentence, but it means that you don't

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:23.200
fear death. It means that you have no fear of that final breath here upon this earth.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:30.359
The life expectancy globally, according to some statistics that I looked at, globally

00:07:30.359 --> 00:07:37.239
the life expectancy is 73. In the United States of America, the life expectancy currently

00:07:37.239 --> 00:07:43.559
is about 76 years old. And for some of us that means we have borrowed time, and for

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:48.000
some of us that means we have several years, and some have a whole lot of years if you

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.359
look at that life expectancy. But we understand the Bible teaches us that we don't know when

00:07:53.359 --> 00:07:59.000
we're going to die. You can look at the statistics and you can look at the life expectancy, but

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.480
the reality is that we do not know the time of our departure. We understand that Paul

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.320
would say, the time of my departure is at hand. We understand that Peter would say that

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:14.079
I must put off this, my tabernacle. And we understand that there was an understanding

00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:19.760
and an acknowledgement amongst those individuals, those saints of God, that death was soon for

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.399
them. God had revealed it to them.

00:08:22.399 --> 00:08:27.480
As we begin to think about this passage of Scripture and the records that are provided

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:33.039
to us of life and death, I want us to consider this evening some biblical truth. Turn to

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:37.239
the book of Ecclesiastes, if you will, and we're going to look at a number of passages,

00:08:37.239 --> 00:08:40.559
and then I'm just going to ask two questions this evening through the message, but turn

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:47.520
to the book of Ecclesiastes, if you will. Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the third

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:59.320
chapter, Ecclesiastes chapter number three. It's good to hear pages turning. Somebody

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.880
sent me an email yesterday, side note, we'll chase the rabbit while you're turning pages,

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:10.520
and they said this, they said, pastor, what would we do if we didn't have a Bible? I'm

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.080
glad we have a Bible. Amen? Because I really don't want to think about that. I'm glad we

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:20.119
have a Bible. It's a wonderful thing to hear pages of Bibles turning.

00:09:20.119 --> 00:09:24.000
Verse one of Ecclesiastes three, the Bible says, to everything there is a season and

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.440
a time to every purpose under the heaven. Notice what it says, a time to be born and

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.119
a time to die, a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted, a time

00:09:33.119 --> 00:09:36.919
to kill and a time to heal, a time to break down and a time to build up, a time to weep

00:09:36.919 --> 00:09:41.719
and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance, a time to cast away stones

00:09:41.719 --> 00:09:46.359
and a time to gather stones together, a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing.

00:09:46.359 --> 00:09:49.960
And you get the idea, and I'm not going to continue reading the passage, because I want

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:56.200
you to notice the first phrase of verse two, a time to be born and a time to die, a time

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.000
to be born and a time to die. For all of us here, we know the time of our

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:07.920
birth, right? We know. You have a record of a live birth, and we have a birth certificate,

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.640
and you understand that you have a birthday. Somebody told me, I won't mention who, but they

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.079
have a birthday coming up in the month of April, and they said, just so you know, Pastor, this is

00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:20.399
the last year I'm celebrating my birthday for a little while. And I understand. I said, well,

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:24.959
that's because you're turning 39, and you just don't want to hit that 40. But the reality is

00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:30.639
that we know the time of our birth. What we do not know is the time of our death.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:37.599
The Bible says a time to be born and a time to die. In chapter number seven of the book of

00:10:37.599 --> 00:10:44.639
Ecclesiastes, notice what the Bible says in verse number two. Here in Ecclesiastes 7, in verse

00:10:44.639 --> 00:10:52.319
number two, the Bible says it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of

00:10:52.319 --> 00:11:02.799
feasting. Notice why that statement is made about which is better. It says, for that is the end

00:11:03.439 --> 00:11:08.879
of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart. You know, something interesting about

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:14.400
funerals, the house of mourning. There's something that's interesting about going to

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:21.760
a funeral, a celebration of life, a memorial service, whatever you want to call it.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:28.000
There's something that's interesting about that experience is it's a sobering time. It's a time

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.239
of recognizing and understanding that our life is going to come to an end. It's the end of all men.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.800
And that's what the wise man says here in the book of Ecclesiastes under the inspiration of

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:44.879
the Holy Spirit of God. Notice what Job says over in Job chapter 21. And this portion of

00:11:44.879 --> 00:11:51.680
Scripture is quite interesting with regard to the observation that is made here in this reply to

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:57.839
one of the friends. And Job is speaking here in Job chapter 21. And notice what he says about this

00:11:57.839 --> 00:12:06.400
idea of death. In Job chapter 21, beginning in verse number 23, the Bible says, One dieth in

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:12.479
his full strength, being holy at ease and quiet. His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are

00:12:12.479 --> 00:12:17.440
moistened with marrow. And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:22.080
pleasure. They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.

00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:30.479
We're going to die one day. We're all going to die. We see life and death. We see in the portion of

00:12:30.479 --> 00:12:37.279
Scripture this evening the record of the birth of Benjamin, the names of all of the sons of Jacob.

00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:43.199
But we see the death of Rachel, and we see the death of Isaac, 180 years old. I mean, that's a

00:12:43.199 --> 00:12:51.279
long life. But it came to an end. All the sons of Jacob, though all of their deaths are not recorded

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:59.279
for us within the pages of Scripture, we understand they all died. Hebrews 9 and verse 27 says it this

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:07.119
way, And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment. I've often said this,

00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:10.960
and I've understood, as you think about the truth of that verse of Scripture, that there's an

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:16.399
appointment that we have with death. And there's nothing I can do to change it, cancel it.

00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:27.440
I don't know when it is. Neither do you. Think about how James thinks about life. He says,

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:35.360
what is your life? It's but a vapor that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away.

00:13:35.919 --> 00:13:41.119
In James 4 and verse number 14, we're understanding of what a vapor is, and you begin to think about

00:13:41.119 --> 00:13:46.639
that imagery that is being used, and you think about the boiling pot, and if you think about

00:13:46.639 --> 00:13:51.440
that analogy of seeing the vapor, and it just appears for a little while, and then it's gone.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.600
It's gone. And the reality is that as we begin to think about life, and we think about death,

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.080
and no matter how many years we might live here upon the earth, the reality is that it's just

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:10.000
about that long in light of eternity. I think about what the psalmist said, turn to Psalm 102,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.360
if you will. We find that James, in James 4 and 14, references life, and he compares it. He uses

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:20.000
the analogy that our life is but a vapor that appeareth for a little time. The psalmist here

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:29.600
in Psalm 102, look what he says about his life, his days. In Psalm 102, in verse number 11,

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.519
the psalmist says this,

00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:39.359
My days are like a shadow that declineth, and I am withered like grass.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:47.200
You ever see a shadow? Sure you have. You look out in the evening as the sun is setting, and

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:52.079
you begin to see that shadow, and it grows, and then before long, the shadow's gone. Why? Because

00:14:52.799 --> 00:14:58.079
the sun is set. You begin to think about shadows, and light, and all that takes place, and the

00:14:58.079 --> 00:15:04.640
psalmist says, My days, my life is like a shadow that declineth. But notice what it says in Psalm

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:12.480
90, a familiar passage of Scripture, a psalm actually that's ascribed to Moses. In Psalm 90,

00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:22.959
the Bible will speak to us about our lives. Beginning in verse number 9 of this psalm,

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:32.320
the Bible says this, For all our days are passed away in thy wrath. Notice the statement,

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:39.440
we spend our years as a tale that is told. I preached a message several years ago from that

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:45.839
thought at the end of verse number 9. I believe it was a last service of a particular year as we were

00:15:45.839 --> 00:15:49.760
entering into a new year, and I asked this question as I preached from this portion of

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:56.320
Scripture, what's your story? Because we spend our years as a tale that is told.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:04.160
For each of us here this evening, there's a chapter in our book. I don't know what page it is,

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:09.119
and I don't know when the end comes. But I've read a lot of books, and I'm sure you've read

00:16:09.119 --> 00:16:15.839
a lot of books as well, and there comes an end to the book, and there's going to come an end to our

00:16:16.079 --> 00:16:21.279
and there's going to come an end to our lives. And we see that the Bible says that we spend our

00:16:21.279 --> 00:16:26.799
years as a tale that is told. Notice it says this in verse number 10, The days of our years are

00:16:26.799 --> 00:16:32.399
threescore years and ten, seventy. And if by reason of strength they be fourscore years,

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:39.440
eighty, it is their strength, labor, and sorrow, for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.640
Who knoweth the power of thine anger, even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath. Notice

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:51.440
verse 12, So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.

00:16:53.519 --> 00:17:00.559
Isaiah was called of God as a servant of the Lord. He prophesied faithfully.

00:17:01.359 --> 00:17:08.480
But in one particular account in the book of Isaiah, Isaiah is given the specific task

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:15.279
of delivering a message to King Hezekiah. That message is recorded for us in Isaiah 38 in verse

00:17:15.279 --> 00:17:24.079
number 1, and here's what God says through His messenger, Thus saith the Lord, Set thine house

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:32.720
in order, for thou shalt die and not live. Now if you're familiar with the life of Hezekiah

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:38.079
in that particular announcement from the prophet of God, you understand that Hezekiah weeps.

00:17:39.839 --> 00:17:46.320
You understand that God answers and extends his life by 15 years. But even in extending

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:52.559
his life by 15 years, you know what happened to Hezekiah one day? He died. He died.

00:17:53.519 --> 00:17:59.600
We need to think about this passage in Genesis chapter 35 and thinking about life and death and

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.320
considering the truth that is before us and looking at some statistics, but then also looking

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:12.320
and considering once again afresh, if you will, the truth of God's Word with regard to life

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:20.559
and death. And two simple questions this evening for the message, and here's the first.

00:18:20.559 --> 00:18:30.480
First, are you prepared to take your final breath? Are you personally prepared to take

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:38.640
your final breath? We don't know the time of our departure. If we were to take a trip today to

00:18:39.359 --> 00:18:42.640
this evening, we were to load up in our vehicles and we were to visit

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:52.559
over to some local cemetery, graveyard, and we begin to walk through the tombstones and begin to

00:18:52.559 --> 00:19:01.039
walk through the property, one thing that you would find is a variety of ages. You would not

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:06.559
find consistency among all of the headstones that all of these people died at a certain age.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:13.520
No, you'll find some that died way older and some that died way younger.

00:19:15.599 --> 00:19:21.760
Sometimes when a young person dies, an individual will make an assessment, will make a comment of

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:26.719
their life was cut short. You've heard somebody say that, no doubt.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.679
And the question this evening is, are you prepared to take your final breath?

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:37.919
In recent days, we've read of a number of calamities in our nation where people's lives

00:19:37.919 --> 00:19:43.520
were lost. We mentioned a couple of those this morning in our Sunday school hour. You think

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:48.960
about the tragedy that took place in Tennessee. By the way, I read this afternoon that there was

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:54.080
a shooting just here in Northern Virginia at a mall up in what, Leesburg, is that where it was?

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:58.960
Tyson's at the Tyson's Mall, Dulles, Dulles Shopping Center this afternoon, active shooting

00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.919
situation.

00:19:59.919 --> 00:20:04.879
It seems like it's recurring, right?

00:20:04.879 --> 00:20:06.319
It's more and more.

00:20:06.319 --> 00:20:09.659
You're reading of this.

00:20:09.659 --> 00:20:14.159
Military personnel serving the U.S. Army go out this week for some training mission in

00:20:14.159 --> 00:20:22.839
the evening and two Black Hawk helicopters crash, nine people perish, tornadoes.

00:20:22.839 --> 00:20:25.439
We've seen the devastation.

00:20:25.439 --> 00:20:29.879
They don't even know how many people have died in all of those tornadoes.

00:20:29.879 --> 00:20:34.959
You think about earthquakes that have taken place and lives that have perished.

00:20:34.959 --> 00:20:39.839
And some of those, many of those instances, I mean, car crashes and fatalities, those

00:20:39.839 --> 00:20:45.959
people did not know that today was when I'm going to take my final breath.

00:20:45.959 --> 00:20:48.599
They didn't have that understanding.

00:20:48.599 --> 00:20:52.759
In this evening, I begin to think about this truth and looking at this portion of Scripture

00:20:52.759 --> 00:20:56.439
and God impressed this truth and this thought upon my heart.

00:20:56.439 --> 00:21:00.679
And the reality is we must be prepared to take our final breath.

00:21:00.679 --> 00:21:02.719
It's absolutely essential.

00:21:02.719 --> 00:21:07.799
And again, when we answer the question that I do not fear dying, when I answer the question

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:12.399
that I'm prepared for death, it does not necessarily mean that I have a death sentence, that somebody

00:21:12.399 --> 00:21:16.439
needs to put us on some kind of special watch because we're going to do harm to ourselves.

00:21:16.439 --> 00:21:21.159
No, it just means that I know that I'm going to heaven.

00:21:21.159 --> 00:21:22.159
Notice what Paul says.

00:21:22.159 --> 00:21:24.119
Look over to the book of Philippians, if you will.

00:21:25.119 --> 00:21:29.599
I want you to consider the familiar words of the Apostle Paul as he's writing to these

00:21:29.599 --> 00:21:38.379
believers in Philippi and he shares with them some truth that I think is not only impactful

00:21:38.379 --> 00:21:44.379
for the believers in Philippi, but no doubt impactful for believers through the centuries.

00:21:44.379 --> 00:21:48.959
As we've read these verses of Scripture and we've understood what is being communicated

00:21:48.959 --> 00:21:56.819
and we can rejoice in Paul's preparation and his understanding of being ready to die.

00:21:56.819 --> 00:22:00.479
Notice what Paul says in Philippians 1 in verse 21.

00:22:00.479 --> 00:22:07.119
For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.

00:22:07.119 --> 00:22:12.479
And then he says this, but if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor, yet

00:22:12.479 --> 00:22:14.279
what I shall choose I won't not.

00:22:14.879 --> 00:22:20.399
Notice what he says in verse 23, for I am in a straight betwixt two.

00:22:20.399 --> 00:22:25.359
What was it that caused this situation that Paul is referencing?

00:22:25.359 --> 00:22:27.719
You've ever heard somebody say, I'm between a rock and a hard place.

00:22:27.719 --> 00:22:33.439
I've heard that saying as a child many times and he says, I'm in a straight betwixt two.

00:22:33.439 --> 00:22:35.399
Notice what the situation is.

00:22:35.399 --> 00:22:47.599
Having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better.

00:22:47.599 --> 00:22:51.599
You read 1 Corinthians 15, the wonderful chapter on the resurrection.

00:22:51.599 --> 00:22:56.039
The Bible tells us that this mortal shall put on immortality.

00:22:56.039 --> 00:22:59.739
The Bible tells us that this corruption shall put on incorruption.

00:22:59.739 --> 00:23:02.939
In the moment, the twinkling of an eye, I'm so thankful.

00:23:02.939 --> 00:23:06.419
And Paul says, listen, it's better to be with Christ.

00:23:06.419 --> 00:23:11.379
Again, it doesn't mean that we have a death sentence that we're trying to cut our lives

00:23:11.379 --> 00:23:12.379
short.

00:23:12.379 --> 00:23:19.279
No, it just simply means I'm not afraid of dying and I'm prepared for dying.

00:23:19.279 --> 00:23:25.619
He says this in verse 24, nevertheless, to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.

00:23:25.619 --> 00:23:28.299
Paul understood that there was still a mission at hand.

00:23:28.859 --> 00:23:30.899
There was still something that God had for him.

00:23:30.899 --> 00:23:32.499
I think about Elijah.

00:23:32.499 --> 00:23:35.219
Elijah said, I just want to die.

00:23:35.219 --> 00:23:40.859
After the miraculous fire coming from heaven at Mount Carmel and all that took place and

00:23:40.859 --> 00:23:47.939
he hears what Jezebel says and he flees and I mean, he just wants to die.

00:23:47.939 --> 00:23:49.719
But God appears to him.

00:23:49.719 --> 00:23:50.719
God strengthens him.

00:23:50.719 --> 00:23:52.539
You know what God says to him?

00:23:52.539 --> 00:23:56.259
He says, I have two tasks yet for you, Elijah.

00:23:56.259 --> 00:23:59.259
God still had a purpose for Elijah's life.

00:23:59.259 --> 00:24:02.419
If we're here this evening and we're still living and breathing, God has a purpose for

00:24:02.419 --> 00:24:05.779
our life.

00:24:05.779 --> 00:24:09.419
And I'm thankful that God has a purpose for our life.

00:24:09.419 --> 00:24:15.259
And until God's done with us, we'll live for Christ.

00:24:15.259 --> 00:24:20.359
That's what Paul says, for me to live is Christ, to die is gain.

00:24:20.359 --> 00:24:22.059
No fear of dying.

00:24:22.059 --> 00:24:27.179
Notice what he says over in 2 Corinthians chapter number 5, in 2 Corinthians chapter

00:24:27.179 --> 00:24:36.539
number 5, in verse number, I want to read the whole passage, but look at just verse

00:24:36.539 --> 00:24:37.539
number 8 with me.

00:24:37.539 --> 00:24:41.819
I've got to get to the last point.

00:24:41.819 --> 00:24:50.299
Notice what Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 8, we are confident, I say, and

00:24:50.299 --> 00:24:58.779
willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord.

00:24:58.779 --> 00:25:07.659
This evening, we can have confidence that when we put off this, our earthly tabernacle,

00:25:07.659 --> 00:25:11.659
that we'll be in the presence of our Savior.

00:25:11.659 --> 00:25:13.419
We don't have to fear death.

00:25:13.419 --> 00:25:14.959
We can be prepared for death.

00:25:14.959 --> 00:25:20.059
But what was it that led Paul to a place of saying that I'm prepared for death, for taking

00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:21.819
my final breath?

00:25:21.819 --> 00:25:25.539
Well, obviously, the truth that he had trusted Christ as his Savior.

00:25:25.539 --> 00:25:29.899
There on the road to Damascus, as it's recorded in Acts chapter number 9, Saul's life was

00:25:29.899 --> 00:25:36.859
changed forever, and he accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as his personal Savior.

00:25:36.859 --> 00:25:43.019
From that point forward, Saul was a man that knew he was heaven bound.

00:25:43.019 --> 00:25:47.579
I think of D.L. Moody, man pulls a gun on him and he says, you can't threaten me with

00:25:47.579 --> 00:25:48.579
heaven.

00:25:49.099 --> 00:25:53.819
Wow, that's a man that has confidence to be absent from the body is to be present with

00:25:53.819 --> 00:25:55.579
the Lord.

00:25:55.579 --> 00:25:58.459
I shared the story many years ago, but I'll share it again this evening.

00:25:58.459 --> 00:26:03.899
I was standing in line at the bank just over here in Oakton several years ago now.

00:26:03.899 --> 00:26:08.539
And as I'm standing there in line and this fellow walks in, and the best way that I could

00:26:08.539 --> 00:26:13.499
describe this fellow, and I'm not trying to be unkind, but he was an elderly, grumpy man.

00:26:13.499 --> 00:26:14.939
Just what it was.

00:26:14.939 --> 00:26:16.139
He didn't have a grumpy shirt on.

00:26:16.139 --> 00:26:17.139
He didn't need it.

00:26:17.139 --> 00:26:19.179
He was just grumpy.

00:26:19.179 --> 00:26:21.139
And you just kind of, you ever meet somebody like that?

00:26:21.139 --> 00:26:22.419
Just grumpy.

00:26:22.419 --> 00:26:23.419
Sometimes they wear the shirt.

00:26:23.419 --> 00:26:28.219
We're at the restaurant and some guy walks in with a grumpy shirt.

00:26:28.219 --> 00:26:30.699
Just announce it to everybody, man.

00:26:30.699 --> 00:26:31.699
This guy didn't need a shirt.

00:26:31.699 --> 00:26:32.699
He's just grumpy.

00:26:32.699 --> 00:26:35.339
And I'm standing there doing my transaction, doing my thing.

00:26:35.339 --> 00:26:38.419
He's standing over there and just the two of us and a couple of tellers, and he looks

00:26:38.419 --> 00:26:43.819
at me and I look at him and I say, how are you?

00:26:43.819 --> 00:26:44.819
He says, how are you?

00:26:44.819 --> 00:26:46.079
I said, I'm wonderful.

00:26:46.079 --> 00:26:47.079
He said, you're lying.

00:26:47.079 --> 00:26:50.519
That's what he said to me.

00:26:50.519 --> 00:26:51.519
You're lying.

00:26:51.519 --> 00:26:53.679
I said, I've never had anyone tell me that.

00:26:53.679 --> 00:26:56.319
I was like confused.

00:26:56.319 --> 00:27:00.799
When I said I'm wonderful and he says you're lying, like I couldn't comprehend.

00:27:00.799 --> 00:27:01.799
I said, what do you mean I'm lying?

00:27:01.799 --> 00:27:04.199
He said, nobody's wonderful.

00:27:04.199 --> 00:27:07.999
What would make you say that you're wonderful?

00:27:07.999 --> 00:27:11.519
I didn't have time to really think about all this and lay it all out, but I just simply

00:27:11.519 --> 00:27:15.199
responded by saying I'm going to heaven.

00:27:15.319 --> 00:27:17.319
And he said, are you dying?

00:27:17.319 --> 00:27:20.439
It's comical, comical.

00:27:20.439 --> 00:27:26.079
I said, well, as far as I know, I'm not dying right now, but yes, I'm going to die one day.

00:27:26.079 --> 00:27:28.159
So are you.

00:27:28.159 --> 00:27:31.759
And I said, I can be wonderful because I know I'm going to heaven.

00:27:31.759 --> 00:27:34.879
I gave him a gospel tract and asked him to read it.

00:27:34.879 --> 00:27:37.279
I've never seen that man again in my life.

00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:39.399
I don't know that I ever will.

00:27:39.399 --> 00:27:42.599
But the reality is that we don't have to fear death.

00:27:42.599 --> 00:27:46.199
We can be prepared for death.

00:27:46.199 --> 00:27:51.479
The second question that I have this evening is not simply are you prepared to take your

00:27:51.479 --> 00:27:56.679
final breath, but let me ask this question, number two this evening.

00:27:56.679 --> 00:28:05.199
Are you helping others to be prepared to take their final breath?

00:28:05.199 --> 00:28:14.999
Are you prepared, but are you helping anyone to be prepared to take their final breath?

00:28:14.999 --> 00:28:21.399
Dean often says as he prays, everyone that we come into contact with has got a soul and

00:28:21.399 --> 00:28:24.599
they're going to die.

00:28:24.599 --> 00:28:30.079
People that you see every day are going to die.

00:28:30.079 --> 00:28:36.599
No doubt you've had people that you've worked with, people that are relatives, people that

00:28:36.599 --> 00:28:37.599
are neighbors.

00:28:37.599 --> 00:28:45.399
You get the news that so-and-so died.

00:28:45.399 --> 00:28:50.320
And the question this evening is, who are we helping to prepare to take their final

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.320
breath?

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:56.440
See, in the same passage of Scripture in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse number 8,

00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:00.799
when Paul says, we are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the

00:29:00.799 --> 00:29:05.760
body and to be present with the Lord, we find that Paul then begins to deal with something

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.239
at the end of the passage that is so important for us to understand.

00:29:09.239 --> 00:29:10.799
Notice and pick it up with me.

00:29:10.799 --> 00:29:14.039
For sake of time, we'll pick it up in verse 18.

00:29:14.039 --> 00:29:18.679
But notice what the Bible says here in 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 18.

00:29:18.679 --> 00:29:25.039
The Bible says, and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus

00:29:25.039 --> 00:29:26.039
Christ.

00:29:26.039 --> 00:29:28.599
We talked about reconciliation this morning.

00:29:28.599 --> 00:29:32.760
And I dealt with that truth from 1 Peter 3 and verse number 18.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:38.000
And the word reconciliation, it's the means by which sinners are reconciled and brought

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.279
into a state of favor with God after natural estrangement or enmity.

00:29:44.279 --> 00:29:49.119
And I think about that truth this evening of reconciliation and being brought back to

00:29:49.119 --> 00:29:50.119
God.

00:29:50.119 --> 00:29:53.959
We talked about as 1 Peter 3, 18, I preached this morning that there's the record of Christ's

00:29:53.959 --> 00:29:54.959
suffering.

00:29:54.959 --> 00:29:57.000
There's the reason for Christ's suffering.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
But there's the result that he would bring us to God.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.779
God.

00:30:01.779 --> 00:30:08.939
And here the Bible says that in verse number 18, and all things are of God who hath reconciled

00:30:08.939 --> 00:30:16.879
us to himself by Jesus Christ, aren't you thankful to be reconciled?

00:30:16.879 --> 00:30:21.219
What a glorious truth that we can stand up and say, I've been reconciled.

00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:23.540
I know we don't use the word that often.

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:27.620
We might talk about being redeemed and being saved and being born again.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:32.340
But the truth is that we can say accurately, I've been reconciled.

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:44.580
And notice what it says at the end of verse number 18, and hath given to us the ministry

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:48.099
of reconciliation.

00:30:48.099 --> 00:30:51.400
We have been reconciled to God through Jesus Christ.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:57.180
By the way, it's the only way to be reconciled because the just for the unjust, and we dealt

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.759
with that very detailed this morning.

00:30:59.759 --> 00:31:11.160
But we find that he then says this, that he has given to us the ministry of reconciliation.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:18.559
Notice to wit, verse 19, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing

00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:24.720
their trespasses unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:30.300
So we see at the end of verse number 18 that he hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation.

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:34.900
Now in verse number 19, he says, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:43.220
And then he says this in verse number 20, now then, we are ambassadors for Christ.

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.379
We are ambassadors for Christ.

00:31:45.379 --> 00:31:57.279
As though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's stead, be reconciled to God.

00:31:57.279 --> 00:32:02.400
For he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.760
of God in him.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:11.039
And as we look there at that truth in verses 18 through 20 of the ministry of reconciliation,

00:32:11.039 --> 00:32:15.619
when we find that Paul says we've been given this ministry of reconciliation, the word

00:32:15.619 --> 00:32:24.139
of reconciliation has been committed unto us, he says, now then, we are his ambassadors.

00:32:24.139 --> 00:32:26.380
Ambassadors are representative.

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:31.660
We sing the song, this world is not my home, I'm just a passing through.

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:39.020
I often talk about the fact that as a believer, we have dual citizenship, heaven, and for

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.119
me, America.

00:32:41.119 --> 00:32:45.320
I'm a citizen of this nation, but I'm a citizen of heaven.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.720
And can I say this?

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:54.240
It doesn't matter what nation upon this earth you have citizenship in, what matters is that

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:57.800
you have citizenship in heaven.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:05.279
There's a whole lot of people that God has allowed us to be surrounded by that need to

00:33:05.279 --> 00:33:09.020
understand the truth of reconciliation.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:18.259
They need somebody to help them understand how they can be prepared for their final breath.

00:33:18.259 --> 00:33:24.539
I think about the evangelist, Philip.

00:33:24.539 --> 00:33:27.059
He's ministering, he's serving the Lord.

00:33:27.059 --> 00:33:30.059
I mean, he's in Samaria and people are getting saved.

00:33:30.059 --> 00:33:31.779
It's exciting what's going on.

00:33:31.779 --> 00:33:36.160
You read in Acts chapter 8, man, it's exciting, God's using Philip.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:43.240
And then God moves Philip and says, I want you to go talk to this Ethiopian eunuch.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:51.279
That Ethiopian eunuch had been in Jerusalem and he's leaving in a chariot and he's reading

00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:54.880
Isaiah 53.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.440
And it's amazing to me that if you look at Acts chapter 8, that what happens in the text

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:03.179
of Scripture is that Philip comes up and he gets up into the chariot and he asks this

00:34:03.179 --> 00:34:08.740
question, understandest thou what thou readest?

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:09.740
You know what the eunuch said?

00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:17.779
How can I, except some man should teach me?

00:34:17.779 --> 00:34:20.500
You know what the eunuch asked?

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.500
Who's this man talking about?

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.339
Is he talking about himself or about somebody else?

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:30.839
Isaiah 53 is the great messianic prophecy and the truth of the suffering Savior.

00:34:30.839 --> 00:34:34.679
I mean, it's an amazing portion of Scripture.

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:39.059
And in God's providence, that's what the man's reading.

00:34:39.059 --> 00:34:40.059
And so what does Philip do?

00:34:40.059 --> 00:34:46.640
He comes to the same passage and preaches Christ, that he is the Son of God.

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:47.640
That eunuch gets saved.

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:53.339
But I want you to think about those words when he says, understandest thou what thou

00:34:53.339 --> 00:34:54.859
readest?

00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:57.260
How can I?

00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:01.119
Why did God give us the ministry of reconciliation?

00:35:01.119 --> 00:35:04.140
He gave it to those that have been reconciled.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:05.140
Why?

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:09.700
Because somebody that's been reconciled can tell somebody else how they can be reconciled.

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.760
Does that make sense?

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:16.720
If you've not been reconciled this evening, you can't tell anybody else how to be reconciled.

00:35:16.799 --> 00:35:20.600
If you're not prepared for your final breath this evening, you can't help anybody else

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.100
be prepared for their final breath.

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:29.720
But God's entrusted to us the ministry of reconciliation.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:35.880
And as I begin to think about Genesis chapter 35, and I read the portion of Scripture, and

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:43.459
I read about the birth of Benjamin, and I read about the death of Rachel, and then I

00:35:43.459 --> 00:35:48.839
read all the names of the sons of Jacob as they're provided for us in that short portion

00:35:48.839 --> 00:35:57.260
of Scripture, and then I read about the death of Isaac, I'm reminded life and death.

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:03.179
The reality this evening is that I don't know, and you don't know either, when we're going

00:36:03.179 --> 00:36:05.779
to take our final breath.

00:36:05.779 --> 00:36:13.019
I hope that you can say with confidence, as Paul did, I'm going to straight betwixt two,

00:36:13.019 --> 00:36:18.100
having a desire to depart, to be with Christ, which is far better.

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:23.779
But I hope this evening that we would take seriously the ministry of reconciliation that's

00:36:23.779 --> 00:36:26.500
been committed to us.

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:31.339
That we'd be faithful ambassadors.

00:36:31.339 --> 00:36:38.980
That we would do our part to try to help people be prepared to take their final breath.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:42.500
Because everywhere we look, people are dying.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.059
Four?

00:36:44.059 --> 00:36:45.339
Every second.

00:36:45.339 --> 00:36:46.899
How many people are born?

00:36:46.899 --> 00:36:48.179
Four.

00:36:48.179 --> 00:36:50.179
How many people die?

00:36:50.179 --> 00:36:51.820
Two.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.660
Think about that.

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:58.739
There have been people that have come to me and said, Pastor, I went into work on Monday,

00:36:58.739 --> 00:37:03.339
and I found out that my coworker passed away over the weekend.

00:37:03.339 --> 00:37:10.299
It happens, because people die.

00:37:10.299 --> 00:37:20.540
I read years ago, a story, as best I can tell, it was true.

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:25.459
I don't believe everything I read on the internet, and I hope you don't either.

00:37:25.459 --> 00:37:28.179
But as best I could tell, it was a true story.

00:37:28.179 --> 00:37:38.459
It was a story about a young girl that lived pretty close to a church, and lived there

00:37:38.579 --> 00:37:39.579
for years.

00:37:39.579 --> 00:37:41.899
Her parents, her family did.

00:37:41.899 --> 00:37:47.140
She was a teenager at this particular point.

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:51.019
Her dad and mom were killed.

00:37:51.019 --> 00:37:54.739
She was struggling.

00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:59.660
She walked out of that little church on a Sunday and went in for service.

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:02.579
She heard the pastor preach.

00:38:02.579 --> 00:38:06.140
She heard a pastor preach a message similar to what you would hear, perhaps, in our church

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:17.380
about Jesus is the only way, Jesus saves, He's a wonderful Savior to me.

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:20.619
He loves you, and He died for you.

00:38:20.619 --> 00:38:22.779
She heard that message.

00:38:22.779 --> 00:38:32.539
She confronted the pastor after the service, and was so distraught, because she said, if

00:38:32.539 --> 00:38:40.020
you really believe what you preached this morning, why did you never come to our house

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:44.260
and tell us before my parents died?

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:47.099
I wouldn't want to be that pastor.

00:38:47.099 --> 00:38:52.900
I wouldn't want to be that believer, that Christian, that would have to give an answer

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.140
to that individual.

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.260
People are dying.

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.859
People are dying.

00:38:59.859 --> 00:39:06.140
This evening, I hope that each and every one of us can leave here saying, I know I'm saved.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:09.900
I'm prepared for my final breath.

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:16.340
But I hope this evening that each and every one of us would say, God, help me to help

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:20.739
others be prepared to take their final breath.

00:39:20.739 --> 00:39:28.299
Help me to take seriously the ministry of reconciliation, and to understand that God

00:39:28.299 --> 00:39:33.979
gave me that responsibility because it's only reconciled people that are going to

00:39:33.979 --> 00:39:39.979
be able to help lost people to be reconciled to God.

00:39:39.979 --> 00:39:47.140
What a wonderful privilege God has given us, a weighty responsibility.

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:52.859
But this evening, there are people that are dying, life and death.

00:39:52.859 --> 00:39:56.340
How shall they hear without a preacher?

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:57.340
Amen?

00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.380
That's what Romans 10 says.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:06.620
associated that truth is to Acts 8. How can I except some man should teach me? Let's pray

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:13.660
together. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. This portion of Scripture reveals

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:20.740
to us the birth of Benjamin and the record of the names of the sons of Jacob, the death

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:28.940
of Rachel and the death of Isaac. We're reminded this evening about life and death. The Bible

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:37.500
is full of instruction regarding our lives, the analogies of a shadow of a vapor. God,

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:43.980
I pray this evening that each and every one of us would be able to say with confidence

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:51.180
as Paul did, I know I'm going to go to heaven when I die. I no longer fear death for I've

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:57.580
been saved, I've been reconciled. God, I pray that you'd help each and every one of us this

00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:08.060
evening, myself included, to have a burden, a passion to reach lost people. That we'd

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:14.660
take seriously the ministry of reconciliation that's been committed to us. God, we'd be

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:24.140
faithful servants, faithful ambassadors to tell a lost and dying world the glorious message

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:31.060
of the gospel. In these few moments of invitation, I pray that you'd move and work in our hearts

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:36.300
as only you can. I pray that decisions would be made that would please thee. I pray, God,

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:41.020
that you'd help us to have an impact on eternity. Well, thank you for all that you'll do. For

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.420
it's in Christ's name we pray.
