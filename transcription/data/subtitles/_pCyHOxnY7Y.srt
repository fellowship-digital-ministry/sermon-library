1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,219
for the Word of God, the truth that is contained therein, and I trust that as

2
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:10,800
you have an opportunity daily to walk with the Lord and to feast upon His Word

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,319
that you are strengthened and encouraged, and I hope that you're challenged, amen?

4
00:00:16,319 --> 00:00:20,840
And it's good when you read the Word of God and receive comfort, but it's just as

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,280
good when you get convicted reading the Word of God, amen? And I'm thankful for

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,600
the Word of God. This morning will be in Galatians chapter number 1, and if you

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,919
look at the bulletin you see that the title for the message today, The

8
00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:38,799
Testimony of a Changed Life. The Testimony of a Changed Life. Of course

9
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,520
the book of Galatians is written to the churches in the region of Galatia. You

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,759
notice in verse number 2 the Bible says, And all the brethren which are with me

11
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:53,000
unto the churches of Galatia. And we understand that these churches that are

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,959
being referenced to, that this book is being written to, are the churches in

13
00:00:56,959 --> 00:01:02,959
Antioch and Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe. And we find that it was on that

14
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:07,480
first missionary journey that the Apostle Paul and Barnabas, they went,

15
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,480
that's recorded in Acts 13 and 14, and they went through the region of Galatia

16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:17,599
and these churches were established. We find that God would use the Apostle Paul

17
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:23,680
as an instrument, as His servant, to take the gospel to this region and to see

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,639
churches established. What a wonderful blessing to hear of churches being

19
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:32,559
established. What a joy to be part of a local church. What a joy to support

20
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:37,599
missionaries who are going and seeking to preach the gospel and establish local

21
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,559
churches. The local church is the organism that God is using in this

22
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:48,040
particular era, and I'm so thankful for the church. And contrary to what has been

23
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,319
said to us over the last year, I will tell you that the church is absolutely

24
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:59,879
essential. It is God's bride. It is the bride of Christ, amen? And I am so

25
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,480
thankful to be part of a local church. I count it a great privilege to pastor a

26
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:11,080
local church. And we find that Paul is now being used by God to write back to

27
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,679
these churches in the region of Galatia, these four churches in particular, in

28
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:20,639
those particular cities, and we find that as Paul is now being used of the Lord to

29
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,720
write back to these churches, that this book of Galatians, though it's only six

30
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:32,600
chapters, I mean, it is rich and full of great content. I mean, helpful information.

31
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,320
We find that the false teachers have crept in, the Judaizers in particular

32
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,500
were there and active, and we find that much as the cases we would look

33
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,479
throughout the New Testament and even study church history, that the false

34
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:52,639
teachers always seem to show up. We find that as God would allow churches to be

35
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,720
established and he would allow the Word of God to be given, that there are false

36
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,479
teachers that would creep in. The book of Jude, Jude says it this way, that false

37
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:08,279
teachers, that these men, they crept in unawares, under the radar, so to speak. And

38
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:13,320
we find that Paul is being used of the Lord to give this church some very

39
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,080
important instruction that they needed, these churches, very important

40
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,679
instruction that they needed. Now this morning we're going to focus on the

41
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:25,360
latter part of Galatians 1, and as we look at this portion of Scripture, we'll

42
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,479
have the opportunity to see the testimony of the Apostle Paul. And as we

43
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:33,839
think about looking at this portion of Scripture, and obviously the title of the

44
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:38,880
message, the testimony of a changed life, I hope that this morning, as we look at

45
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,199
the life of the Apostle Paul in this particular portion of Scripture, and

46
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,800
we're able to look at the testimony of a changed life, that you also can look at

47
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:55,600
your own life and you can rejoice in the work that God has done in your life. See,

48
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,800
Paul, as we find here, as he's giving his testimony, really what he's testifying of

49
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,759
is how God has worked in his life. What God has done in his life, and you and I

50
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:12,320
have the opportunity to testify and to be a witness and to have a great

51
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:18,320
testimony with regard to the change that Christ has made in our lives. Notice he

52
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,119
begins in verse number 11,

53
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:26,200
But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not

54
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,799
after man. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the

55
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:38,399
revelation of Jesus Christ. For ye have heard of my conversation in time past, in

56
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:44,040
the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God and

57
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,040
wasted it, and profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine

58
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:56,200
own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. We'll

59
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,640
look at the entirety, but I want you to skip down to verse number 23, by way of

60
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:07,119
introduction. The Bible says this, but they had heard only that he, that's Paul, is the

61
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:12,640
one that's being referred to there, that he which persecuted us in times past, now

62
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:22,079
preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. And they glorified God in me.

63
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,559
As we look at this passage of Scripture, I see first of all, if you're taking

64
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:31,399
notes, the evidence of his conversion. The evidence of his conversion. As we begin to look at

65
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:36,040
this passage of Scripture, we find that he begins in verse 11 and 12, and he says,

66
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,959
I certify you, I make it known, I'm going to make you informed of this truth, that

67
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:46,200
the gospel which he would preach is not a gospel that's after man. The Apostle

68
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,160
Paul, on a regular basis, he seeks to be able to share with those that he's

69
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,279
ministering to, that he's speaking by the Word of the Lord. He's not just giving

70
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,519
his own opinion. In fact, on Thursday, as I had the opportunity to preach a funeral,

71
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,200
thank you for praying for me, I looked at the passage in 1 Thessalonians 4, as I

72
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,480
began to share with these individuals the truth of God's Word. And I said, you

73
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,160
understand that I'm not just giving you my opinion, and Paul's not just giving

74
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,880
his opinion. He says that this is by the Word of the Lord. And I'm so thankful

75
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,720
that God has given us his Word, and he has providentially preserved his Word

76
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,160
for us, and we can have confidence in the Word of God. And we find that Paul, he

77
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,519
says, I neither, in verse number 12, received it of man, neither was I taught

78
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:39,440
it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. He said, the Lord is my teacher, the Lord

79
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,480
has given me this truth, and the Lord has commissioned me to then give this truth

80
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,720
out. So we see the evidence of his conversion. I want you to notice that on

81
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,440
two occasions in this short passage of Scripture, he uses a phraseology that is

82
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:00,040
worth noting. In verse 13, he says this, for you have heard of my conversation,

83
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:08,399
notice this phrase, in time past. For you have heard of my conversation in time

84
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,480
past. That word, conversation, is my behavior, my manner of living. He said,

85
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,359
you heard of, you knew what my testimony was. What was his testimony? Well, he was

86
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:23,279
persecuting the church. He mentions in verse 13 and 14 of this passage of

87
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,600
Scripture, that which he did, he said, how that beyond measure I persecuted the

88
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:34,440
church of God and wasted it. We find that this man Saul, at this particular time in

89
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,239
his life, because he'd not yet been converted, that Saul was breathing out

90
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:43,040
threatenings, the Bible tells us, and you find that it's at the end of Acts 7, at

91
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:48,000
the stoning of Stephen, and Stephen's clothes are dropped at the feet of this

92
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,760
one Saul, and you begin to see how that he's no doubt under conviction, and his

93
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,799
response to that conviction was to intensify the attack against the church.

94
00:07:57,799 --> 00:08:03,119
And he went out seeking any of that way, those that were followers of the Lord

95
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:08,359
Jesus Christ, and he sought to destroy them, to imprison them. He was on the road

96
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:13,519
to Damascus, he had the authority from the officials to go and to arrest and to

97
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:19,359
bind and to bring back, and we find that Saul, he says, listen, it's known what my

98
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:25,239
conversation was, it's known of my behavior in time past. He uses the phrase

99
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:31,359
again in verse number 23, notice what it says here, but they had heard only that

100
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:38,520
he which persecuted us, notice, in times past, now preacheth the faith which once

101
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:43,320
he destroyed. And so we see in verse number 13, in verse number 23, he says, my

102
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,760
conversation in time past, he which persecuted us in times past, and as we

103
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,280
would focus upon that phrase in times past, I'm thankful that there's a

104
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:59,599
conjunction in verse number 15, but. See, there's a great change in the life of

105
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:04,719
the Apostle Paul. We find that it says, but in verse number 15, when it pleased

106
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:11,039
God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace, what did

107
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:16,359
he call him to do? To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the

108
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:20,200
heathen. Immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood. Notice in verse

109
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,640
number 23, you see that the Bible says, but they had heard only that he which

110
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:33,559
persecuted us in times past, notice, now preacheth the faith which once he

111
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:44,299
destroyed. Time past, now. The testimony of a changed life, the evidence of the

112
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:48,940
conversion of this man that we refer to as Paul. Of course, we know his name was

113
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,099
Saul, and then it was changed to Paul. And we'd find even in this passage of

114
00:09:53,099 --> 00:09:57,020
Scripture, as Paul was sharing his testimony with these churches in the

115
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:02,059
region of Galatia, that he's testifying of that

116
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,859
that event that was taken place

117
00:10:03,859 --> 00:10:06,759
and recorded for us in Acts 9.

118
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,279
We won't have time this morning

119
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,219
to go back to Acts 9,

120
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:11,879
but if you go back and you read

121
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,279
that portion of Scripture,

122
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,119
you'll find that it's there in Acts 9

123
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:18,459
that God reveals Himself to Saul

124
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:20,859
as He's walking on the road to Damascus,

125
00:10:20,859 --> 00:10:22,579
and we find that it's there

126
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:23,999
that He sees that light,

127
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:24,879
and He says,

128
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,299
Who art thou, Lord?

129
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:31,979
I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest.

130
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:34,179
We find that Paul, at that point,

131
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:35,419
his name is still Saul.

132
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:39,679
He says, Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?

133
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,799
We find that his life was changed.

134
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:46,319
I mean, it was a dramatic change.

135
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:47,739
And we think about the truth

136
00:10:47,739 --> 00:10:48,959
of being born again.

137
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,359
We know that Jesus in John 3

138
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,259
when Nicodemus came to Jesus by night,

139
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:56,299
He said, we know that Thou art a teacher

140
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:57,459
sent from God.

141
00:10:57,459 --> 00:10:59,919
And He begins to address the Lord Jesus Christ

142
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,119
and Jesus says,

143
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,459
listen, Nicodemus,

144
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,519
except a man be born again,

145
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:06,439
you cannot see the Kingdom of God.

146
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:09,559
Ye must be born again.

147
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,419
And we find that Saul,

148
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:13,500
the evidence of his conversion,

149
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,299
he says, listen, you know what I was,

150
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:19,419
but now look at what I am.

151
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:22,619
In time past, my conversation

152
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:25,199
and my behavior and my lifestyle

153
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:26,739
and I was fighting against God,

154
00:11:26,739 --> 00:11:28,540
but now I'm preaching,

155
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,479
I'm fulfilling what God has called me to do.

156
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:34,220
He changed my life.

157
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,559
I'm mindful of the truth

158
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,939
in 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 17.

159
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:40,099
Just turn a few pages back in your Bibles

160
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,199
and look at this passage of Scripture.

161
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:44,279
And we could quote it for you this morning

162
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,559
and I find sometimes even in my own life

163
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,759
that I'll quote a verse of Scripture

164
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,319
and my dad made this statement

165
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:51,439
on Wednesday evening

166
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:53,000
when he was giving an introduction

167
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,239
to Psalm 23

168
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:58,319
that many people know Psalm 23.

169
00:11:58,339 --> 00:11:59,959
Not just Christians.

170
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:03,220
A lot of people know Psalm 23.

171
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,979
But they lack the true knowledge

172
00:12:04,979 --> 00:12:08,860
of the full teaching and the depth

173
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,199
of the truth that is revealed to us

174
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:13,059
in that passage of Scripture.

175
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:15,660
I want you to think about 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 17.

176
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,020
Now, the Apostle Paul is the human penman

177
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,580
for the book of 2 Corinthians as well.

178
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,360
And I want you to think about this.

179
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,479
The Bible says, therefore,

180
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:27,279
if any man be in Christ,

181
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,919
he is a new creature.

182
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:32,160
Old things are passed away.

183
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,899
Behold, all things are become new.

184
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:38,759
It's a verse of Scripture that is familiar to us.

185
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,599
It's a verse of Scripture that I often quote.

186
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,720
But it hit me this week as I was preparing this message,

187
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,020
I wonder as the Apostle Paul

188
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,440
was writing these words

189
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,979
in what we now refer to as 2 Corinthians 5

190
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,559
and verse 17,

191
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:56,619
if any man be in Christ,

192
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,800
perhaps just for a moment he would pause

193
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,160
and understand that he himself was in Christ.

194
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,839
He had been saved.

195
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,559
It says that he is a new creature.

196
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,179
I mean, can you imagine Paul writing these words?

197
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:12,319
Old things are passed away.

198
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,080
Behold, all things are become new.

199
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,599
And as he would write these words

200
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:17,520
to encourage the believers in Corinth

201
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,160
to be preserved for us today,

202
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,360
I just wonder the way in which

203
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,919
his mind would flood with thoughts

204
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:26,000
and with appreciation for the work

205
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,059
that Christ did in him.

206
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,220
He was a new creature.

207
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,099
I mean, he was changed

208
00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:36,339
as one person would say,

209
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:37,860
from the bottom of his feet

210
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,360
to the top of his head.

211
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,899
I mean, he was changed.

212
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,059
There was evidence of his conversion.

213
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,339
We find that as he would be used of God

214
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:50,699
to pen these words in 2 Corinthians 5

215
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:52,000
and verse 17,

216
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,539
his own life testified of the message

217
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:57,839
that was being sent to this church in Corinth.

218
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,639
That he was in Christ

219
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,839
and he was a new creature.

220
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,520
And that old things were passed away.

221
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,660
We sing a song with the children

222
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,539
and sometimes even with the adults,

223
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:10,639
the things I used to do,

224
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,419
I don't do them anymore.

225
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,399
Why?

226
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,759
There's been a great change

227
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,540
since I've been born again.

228
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,200
And we understand that change

229
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,279
that God has made in our lives

230
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:25,859
and that evidence of conversion.

231
00:14:25,859 --> 00:14:27,059
Look over, if you will,

232
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:29,500
just a few pages the other way in your Bible

233
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,859
in Ephesians 2.

234
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:35,059
Ephesians 2.

235
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:36,260
Verses 1-3.

236
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,000
Really, we could look at verses 1

237
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,859
all the way down through verse 10.

238
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:40,859
For sake of time,

239
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:42,799
we'll just look at the first three verses

240
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,859
this morning of this portion of Scripture.

241
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:46,500
But notice what the Bible says,

242
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,320
"...and you hath he quickened

243
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,299
to make alive

244
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,279
those who were dead in trespasses and sins."

245
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,000
Notice this phrase again,

246
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,440
"...in time past."

247
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,440
He used that phrase in the book of Galatians

248
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,440
in giving his own personal testimony

249
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,899
in speaking of his own conversion experience

250
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:07,160
in time past.

251
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,660
He now uses this here

252
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,519
speaking to the believers in Ephesus,

253
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:13,119
"...wherein in time past

254
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:16,559
ye walked according to the course of this world,

255
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:19,440
according to the prince of the power of the air,

256
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,339
the spirit that now worketh

257
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:23,619
in the children of disobedience."

258
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:25,459
Notice what he says in verse 3.

259
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:28,739
"...among whom also we all

260
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:32,899
had our conversation in times past."

261
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:36,540
Listen, we all were in the same boat.

262
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,459
All of humanity.

263
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:43,820
We understand that God created Adam and Eve perfect.

264
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,619
Put them in a perfect environment.

265
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:49,679
Gave them instruction.

266
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:52,579
We find that that command was broken.

267
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:56,000
In Genesis 3, we find that the serpent

268
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,500
who was more subtle than any beast of the field,

269
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,739
he came in and he says,

270
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:02,619
"...yea, hath God said."

271
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:04,579
We find that just a few verses later,

272
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:06,279
they are partaking of the fruit

273
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:09,760
that they were commanded not to eat of.

274
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,660
And the Bible says that at that point,

275
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,239
sin entered into the world.

276
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,380
And as we read Romans 5,

277
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,700
the Bible says that,

278
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,320
"...for as by one man sin entered into the world,

279
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,419
and death by sin,

280
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:25,019
and so death hath passed on all men,

281
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,940
for that all have sinned."

282
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,459
Romans 3, "...for all have sinned

283
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:31,579
and come short of the glory of God."

284
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:33,279
I often will speak to individuals

285
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,859
and I'll ask them this question.

286
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:36,399
Listen, before they can be saved,

287
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,880
they've got to understand they're lost.

288
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,160
Are you a sinner?

289
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,540
Most people that I talk to

290
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,279
don't have a hard time acknowledging

291
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,500
that they're a sinner.

292
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,600
Every once in a while,

293
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,260
I come up with a smart aleck that says,

294
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,500
well, no, actually I don't think I am.

295
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,739
I said, well, have you ever lied?

296
00:16:52,739 --> 00:16:54,500
Yeah.

297
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,160
Okay, well, God said all men are liars.

298
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,500
And try to attack it in various ways

299
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,500
and what have you.

300
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,739
But most people have an ease

301
00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:05,919
of acknowledging that we're sinners.

302
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,220
And we find that Paul says,

303
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,679
listen, we all had our conversation

304
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:10,579
in time past.

305
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:12,260
We all were in that same condition

306
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,700
in that same boat.

307
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,820
But we think about the grace and mercy of God.

308
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,500
It says here in v. 3,

309
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,260
among whom also we all had our conversation

310
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,320
in times past in the lust of our flesh,

311
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,419
fulfilling the desires of the flesh

312
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:27,459
and of the mind,

313
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:29,760
and were by nature the children of wrath

314
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,239
even as others.

315
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:34,639
But God who is rich in mercy

316
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:38,359
for His great love wherewith He loved us.

317
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,619
And we think about Paul

318
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:42,119
and the evidence of his conversion.

319
00:17:42,139 --> 00:17:44,299
I'm thankful as we look at this passage

320
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:46,279
in Galatians 1,

321
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:49,399
in v. 11 down through v. 24,

322
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:52,940
I'm thankful that we have the now.

323
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,059
That Paul says this is times past.

324
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:56,980
You knew what my conversation was.

325
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,019
You knew what I was known for.

326
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:02,399
Listen, Saul had a reputation.

327
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:03,940
Do you remember in Acts 9

328
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,139
when right after his conversion,

329
00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:07,679
of course, he was left blind

330
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,320
and he could not see.

331
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,959
And God appears to Ananias and says,

332
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,679
hey, listen, I need you to go

333
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,059
and talk to Saul of Tarsus.

334
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,519
And Ananias is like, hold on a minute.

335
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:19,239
Do you know about this fellow?

336
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:20,440
Do you want me to go talk to him?

337
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,940
And God confirms to Ananias,

338
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,940
yes, I want you to go to him,

339
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,279
and I want you to speak to him.

340
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:29,079
And Ananias, when he goes in v. 17,

341
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,440
he put his hand on him and said,

342
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,539
Brother Saul, isn't that precious?

343
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:35,880
Just a few weeks ago,

344
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,000
I preached a message.

345
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,179
It was actually on Mother's Day.

346
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:40,760
Phoebe, our sister.

347
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:42,659
And I talked about the phraseology

348
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:45,359
of using those terms brother and sister

349
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,340
and acknowledging that we are in Christ

350
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,539
and that we're family

351
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:50,859
because we've been born again.

352
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:52,520
We're the sons of God.

353
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,320
And we find that Ananias says,

354
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,900
Brother Saul.

355
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,679
He was apprehensive initially. Why?

356
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,080
Because he knew about this man.

357
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,520
He knew what his behavior was.

358
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,520
But I'm thankful for the now.

359
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,640
Now.

360
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,840
Listen, this is what I was.

361
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:11,599
This is what I am in Christ.

362
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:14,580
The evidence of His conversion.

363
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,719
I wonder this morning,

364
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:19,260
is there evidence in your life?

365
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,659
Is there evidence in my life

366
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,979
that we've been born again?

367
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:26,580
Is there evidence of that new life in Christ?

368
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,820
The things I used to do,

369
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,919
I don't do them anymore.

370
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,099
The place I used to go.

371
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:31,739
You go through the whole list

372
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:33,059
and you see the change

373
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:35,140
that Christ has made in you.

374
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,940
I mentioned to someone not long ago

375
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,880
about some of the birthmarks of a believer.

376
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,820
The Bible says that as newborn babes

377
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,640
desire the sincere milk of the Word

378
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,960
that you may grow thereby.

379
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,520
In 1 Peter 2 and verse 2,

380
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,039
I will readily admit to you

381
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:49,760
that prior to my salvation,

382
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,559
I had no appetite for this Word.

383
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,900
For this book.

384
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,000
I didn't have a desire to read the Word of God.

385
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,299
I wasn't saved.

386
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:00,159
And I got saved.

387
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:01,679
And it's been a number of years now

388
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:02,679
that I've been saved.

389
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:07,679
saved, but I have an appetite, I have a desire to read the Word of God, to feast

390
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:14,399
upon God's Word, to learn it, and to learn of God, and to meditate upon the

391
00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:19,559
truth. And God gives us, because we're in Christ, because we've been saved, He gives

392
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:25,279
us that desire for His Word. I never went to church before I was saved. I didn't

393
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,999
have a desire to be around the people of God. I wasn't saved. Now I

394
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:35,639
love fellowshipping with the people of God, brothers and sisters in Christ. We

395
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:40,959
can go through the list, but I wonder this morning, as we would consider

396
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:45,159
Galatians 1, and we would consider the testimony of a changed life, and we would

397
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:50,159
consider the evidence of His conversion, how much evidence is there in

398
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:56,359
your life, in my life, of being born again? If someone were to look at the evidence,

399
00:20:56,359 --> 00:21:05,599
would it be enough to conclude, without any doubt whatsoever, this person is a

400
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,359
follower of Jesus Christ? They are a Christian. I believe the evidence is

401
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:14,999
clear in the life of the Apostle Paul. Not only do we see the evidence of his

402
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:18,359
conversion, number two, if you're taking notes, I want you to see the effectiveness

403
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:25,159
of his ministry, the effectiveness of his ministry. We find that as Paul was born

404
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:29,719
again, as he was saved, we find that he was called and he was commissioned, he

405
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:35,479
was given a particular ministry, and we find that Paul was faithful to fulfill

406
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:39,479
the ministry. And as we would think about the effectiveness of his ministry, we

407
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:43,559
must understand that it's because he was abiding in Christ, it was because he was

408
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:48,559
dependent upon the Lord. Paul understood that in him that was in his flesh

409
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,239
dwelleth no good thing. Paul understood as he testified in 1

410
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:58,279
Corinthians 15, I am what I am by the grace of God. And we find that as we

411
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:02,379
would look at the effectiveness of his ministry, we find that it's here in verse

412
00:22:02,379 --> 00:22:07,559
number 16 of Galatians 1 that it says, to reveal his Son in me, that I might

413
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:14,239
preach him among the heathen. Immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood. The

414
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:17,639
word heathen that is used here in verse number 16 often would be used to

415
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:23,399
reference Gentiles. It can be used very broadly to just speak of mankind in

416
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:28,439
general, and thinking about lost people in particular. And we find that Paul, as

417
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:34,639
he understood, that he had committed to him the ministry of taking the gospel to

418
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:38,359
the uncircumcision. In fact, in chapter number 2 of the book of Galatians, in

419
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:43,839
verse number 7, he mentions the ministry that was given to him versus that which

420
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:48,579
was given to Peter. But contrarywise, when they saw that the gospel of the

421
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:53,799
uncircumcision, that's to the Gentiles, was committed unto me as the gospel of

422
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:57,519
the circumcision was unto Peter. Now understand that it's not a different

423
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:02,079
gospel, but that he's speaking about the ministry in particular that he was

424
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:07,639
called to. You find that Paul, as he would go through, and if you evaluate the

425
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:10,819
missionary journeys, and you would find that he would go and he would take the

426
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:15,579
gospel to the Jews, and oftentimes they would reject the message, and he'd go to

427
00:23:15,579 --> 00:23:19,939
the Gentiles. And that always caused problems, and it caused uproars in a

428
00:23:19,939 --> 00:23:23,659
number of cities, but we find that Paul understood the ministry that he was

429
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:28,379
given. And as we would think about the ministry and the effectiveness of his

430
00:23:28,379 --> 00:23:34,419
ministry, we must understand that he was enlisted by God. See, Paul was enlisted by

431
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:41,859
God. Look in Galatians 1 and verse number 1. Notice what the Bible says here. Paul,

432
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:50,500
an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who

433
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:57,619
raised him from the dead. See, we find that Paul acknowledges here in this

434
00:23:57,619 --> 00:24:02,699
portion of Scripture that he was enlisted by God, and it was God that

435
00:24:02,699 --> 00:24:07,419
called him. I believe that as Paul understood that he was called by God, it

436
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:12,819
gave him a courage to stand and to fulfill all that God called him to do.

437
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:17,659
Though he faced much adversity and though he dealt with much opposition,

438
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:24,899
Paul understood that he was called and commissioned. He was enlisted by God. And

439
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:29,779
we find that because he understood his calling, because he understood what it

440
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:34,459
was that God was doing in him and through him. And notice at the end of

441
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:42,259
verse number 15, it says, "...and called me by his grace." I'm so thankful. As we would

442
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:46,739
think about the life of the Apostle Paul, and we would understand the evidence of

443
00:24:46,739 --> 00:24:50,619
his conversion, but then we would note the effectiveness of his ministry. And

444
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:54,660
we'd understand this morning that for each of us, the testimony of a changed

445
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:59,019
life, if you have been saved, if you've been born again, there ought to be

446
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:03,339
evidence of conversion in your life. But we also understand that God's given you

447
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:07,100
a ministry. It may not be the same ministry that he gave the Apostle Paul.

448
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,500
It may not be the same ministry that he gave me or to the person next to you, in

449
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,059
front of you, or behind you, but God has given you a ministry. God has given you

450
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:19,619
an opportunity to be his servant, to be his representative. And we find that as

451
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:24,579
we would understand the ministry that God has given us and to be engaged in

452
00:25:24,579 --> 00:25:29,940
the work that we would desire to be effective in ministry. But our

453
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:35,539
effectiveness is not based on our cleverness, on our abilities, our talents,

454
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:42,820
and our personalities. No, rather, our effectiveness in ministry is directly

455
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:50,419
related and directly a result of the the dependence that we have on God Almighty.

456
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:56,339
Remember what Jesus said in John 15. He said, I am the vine, you're the branches.

457
00:25:56,339 --> 00:26:04,220
Without me, ye can do nothing. See, Paul understood that. He understood that he

458
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:11,139
was a co-laborer with God. He understood, I was reading even this morning in the

459
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:14,979
book of 1st Corinthians, and what a wonderful book that is, but we find that

460
00:26:14,979 --> 00:26:18,059
he mentions in verse number 9 of chapter 3 that we're laborers together with God.

461
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:22,940
But remember, it's there that Paul says, as they're having this schism and these

462
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,699
divisions in the church in Corinth where there were some that said, I'm of Paul,

463
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:32,419
I'm of Apollos, I'm of Cephas, they're having all of these divisions, and Paul

464
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:40,859
says, who then is Paul? I'm just a servant, I'm just a minister. See, in chapter

465
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:44,660
number 1 of the book of 1st Corinthians, Paul uses and goes through great

466
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:49,619
detail, really, starting in verse number 10 and going all the way down through

467
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:53,459
the end of the chapter and dealing with their schism and division and their

468
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:58,299
alliances, if you will, and how he then testifies of his ministry there in

469
00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:04,179
Corinth, and he says, listen, I came to preach Christ. He didn't come to preach

470
00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:08,179
Paul. He wasn't looking to get a following for himself. No, he was preaching

471
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:14,619
Christ. And we find that he would conclude, as he goes through this chapter, how that

472
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:20,179
God, how that he does not call the the mighty, the wise, and so on and so forth.

473
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:24,660
God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. Why? That

474
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:30,779
God might be glorified. And it says this in verse number 29, that no flesh should

475
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:37,419
glory in his presence. See, what made the ministry of the Apostle Paul effective

476
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:42,100
was that he was dependent upon God. He understood he was enlisted by God, but he

477
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:46,979
also understood that he was enabled by God. It was God who called him, but it

478
00:27:46,979 --> 00:27:52,500
was God who enabled him. We find this, as we mentioned already in verses 11 and 12

479
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,139
of Galatians 1, when he speaks about the fact that the gospel that he preached,

480
00:27:57,139 --> 00:28:01,739
that he did not receive it of man, but he was taught it by Jesus Christ. And we

481
00:28:01,739 --> 00:28:06,019
find that he would speak of not only being enlisted by God, but being enabled

482
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:11,339
by God. Paul said this in 1 Timothy 1 and verse number 12, as he's writing to

483
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:17,259
his son in the faith, Timothy, he says, and I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who

484
00:28:17,259 --> 00:28:23,500
hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry.

485
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,820
And he understood that it was God who enabled him. I am what I am by the grace

486
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:34,779
of God, in 1 Corinthians 15 and verse number 10. I notice at the end, that

487
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:40,299
at the end of the book of Galatians, that Paul would speak about the fact that he

488
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:46,099
would glory in the cross. He says this in Galatians 6 and verse 14, but God

489
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:52,260
forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom

490
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:57,339
the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. What Paul is saying here

491
00:28:57,339 --> 00:29:03,539
is that, listen, I understand that I've been enabled by God. It's not about me.

492
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:08,099
See, sometimes we look at Paul, and if we're not careful, begin to study his

493
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:11,899
life, and begin to look at the passages of Scripture that deal with his

494
00:29:11,899 --> 00:29:16,820
ministry and his effectiveness, and we say, oh man, I wish I could be like Paul.

495
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:21,700
The reality is that Paul was used of God the way that he was, because he was

496
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:28,779
completely surrendered to God. He was completely surrendered to God. And as we

497
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:33,099
think about that absolute, that full surrender, and we see that in the life of

498
00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:36,979
the Apostle Paul, we see that that's what allowed for effectiveness in the

499
00:29:36,979 --> 00:29:42,380
ministry. We find that as we would go back to Galatians chapter 1, and we'd

500
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,659
pick back up here in verse number 17, and finish up through the chapter here, the

501
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:50,700
Bible says, neither when I up to Jerusalem to them which were Apostles

502
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,500
before me, but I went into Arabia and returned again unto Damascus, verse 18,

503
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,659
then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and abode with

504
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:04,380
him 15 days, but other of the Apostles saw I none.

505
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:09,700
Save James, the Lord's brother, now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God

506
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,700
I lie not.

507
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:15,060
Afterwards, I came into the region of Syria and Cilicia, and was unknown by faith unto

508
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,260
the churches of Judea which were in Christ.

509
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:25,960
But they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which

510
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,460
once he destroyed."

511
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,180
And so we find that Paul is preaching, he's being faithful.

512
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,780
Still again if you look at Acts 9, and we don't have time to develop all of it in Acts

513
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:39,100
9 this morning, but if you look there you find that originally when Paul was going to

514
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,500
go into Jerusalem that they were afraid of him.

515
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:49,020
They weren't really interested in this man coming, but it was Barnabas that came and

516
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:56,260
was used of God to let the apostles and those there in Jerusalem know that God had done

517
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,660
this great work in his life and they received him.

518
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:05,180
And we find that the Bible says that he preached boldly the name of Jesus.

519
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:09,500
But I want you to notice verse 24, it's an interesting verse of Scripture.

520
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:16,100
The Bible says this, and they glorified God in me.

521
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,860
You notice that it does not say that they glorified Paul.

522
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,140
That wouldn't be appropriate, amen?

523
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,900
They glorified God in me.

524
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,580
And I'm mindful as I look at this verse of Scripture, really just a simple truth in verse

525
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,980
number 24, but I'm mindful of what Jesus said in Matthew 5.

526
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:37,620
Turn back if you will to Matthew chapter number 5, and as we look at this portion of Scripture,

527
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:42,860
a familiar portion of Scripture, we find that Jesus as he would begin preaching and teaching

528
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:47,300
there and he's giving all of the Beatitudes and he's going through this whole process

529
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,900
of giving instruction and he tells the disciples and those that are gathered in verse number

530
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,860
13, you're the salt of the earth.

531
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,900
Then in verse number 14 of Matthew chapter number 5, he makes this great declaration,

532
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,260
ye are the light of the world.

533
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:08,140
He says this, a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid, neither do men light a candle

534
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:12,700
and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the

535
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,100
house.

536
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:20,520
Notice what it says in verse 16, let your light so shine before men that they may see

537
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,760
your good works and do what?

538
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,720
Glorify your Father which is in heaven.

539
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,480
Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works.

540
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,080
And then it says this, that they would glorify your Father which is in heaven.

541
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:44,400
What does the Bible say there in Galatians 1 and verse 24, and they glorified God in

542
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,400
me.

543
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,760
See, the Apostle Paul as he was seeking to fulfill the ministry that God had called him

544
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,639
to, we find that there was effectiveness in ministry because he understood that he was

545
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:59,800
enlisted by God and enabled by God and he sought to do what God called him to do.

546
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:06,480
And as he was living in dependence upon the Lord, as he understood that he was incapable

547
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,600
of doing any of these things on his own, that it was the grace of God that enabled him and

548
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,559
that strengthened him, we find that the Bible says that people saw this.

549
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:23,160
They saw that he's now preaching that same faith which once he destroyed him.

550
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:28,720
They see the testimony of a changed life and the evidence of his conversion, the effectiveness

551
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,720
of his ministry.

552
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,200
And what did it result in?

553
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,120
They glorified God.

554
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,220
Isn't that what it's all about?

555
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,279
That God would be glorified.

556
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,600
That God would be exalted.

557
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,720
We understand that the Word of God teaches us even as John the Baptist would make the

558
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,520
great declaration in John chapter number three when they came to him.

559
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:54,919
And of course, John the Baptist, he had quite a following, a number of people that followed

560
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:55,919
John the Baptist.

561
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,160
But then Jesus, see, John the Baptist understood what his role was.

562
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,880
He was a forerunner to Christ.

563
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,400
And when he saw the Lord Jesus Christ, he said, behold, the Lamb of God which taketh

564
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,480
away the sin of the world.

565
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,760
We find that the Lord Jesus Christ in John chapter number three, if you look at all that's

566
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,520
taking place, a number of folks begin to follow the Lord and there's some that come

567
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,480
to John and say, hey, does this bother you?

568
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,840
And he's no, no, no, no, I understand my position.

569
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,559
I understand who he is and he must increase.

570
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:25,559
I must decrease.

571
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:32,480
See, the reality is that as we look at this testimony in Galatians 1, in fact, you can

572
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,720
look at Paul giving his testimony in a variety of portions of Scripture.

573
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,559
And you can read of Paul standing before those that he would give an account and be judged

574
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:46,000
by and he would stand and testify of what God did in his life and how God changed his

575
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,679
life.

576
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,440
As we look here at this passage, we not only see that evidence of his conversion, but we

577
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,080
see the effectiveness of his ministry.

578
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:03,080
And we see that his ministry resulted in exactly what we need to desire, that God would be

579
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,080
glorified.

580
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,119
See, it's not about somebody saying, I'm of Paul.

581
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:11,119
I'm of Apollos.

582
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:16,119
That's what was happening in Corinth and Paul said, no, no, no, let me help you understand.

583
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:19,520
We're just the servants of God.

584
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,320
We're just the tools that God is using and it's that he would be glorified.

585
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,959
Who then is Paul?

586
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,320
Who then is Apollos?

587
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,920
We're just ministers.

588
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:37,200
Today, as we begin to think about the opportunities that God would give us and we begin to think

589
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,559
about the opportunities to serve him and we think about this effectiveness in ministry,

590
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:45,920
we've asked the question already, is there evidence that would prove that you've been

591
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,080
born again?

592
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,640
Is there evidence in your life?

593
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:54,959
Could someone evaluate your life and say, there is evidence of conversion?

594
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:56,839
That's not the same guy that I used to know.

595
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:00,520
You ever meet anyone that you knew before you were saved and you just kind of bumped

596
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:07,119
into them years later and man, it's just, it's different.

597
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,040
You just, you've been changed.

598
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,320
You've been born again and all of a sudden, maybe they say, hey, let me get your number.

599
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:20,920
We need to connect and there's just not much of a connection there anymore.

600
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,080
And they can look at you and they say, man, something happened to that guy.

601
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,880
Something happened to that lady.

602
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,920
They said of my dad, maybe they said of you.

603
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,640
He got religion.

604
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:36,080
That's how, that's how the family members kind of termed it.

605
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:42,559
And then they said something like this, it'll just kind of blow by.

606
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:48,080
I'm thankful that it hasn't because he didn't just get religion.

607
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,679
He got born again.

608
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:52,480
See Paul didn't just get religion.

609
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,279
Paul was a religious man.

610
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:58,360
I mean, you look in Galatians 1 when he talks about what his testimony was, he says in time

611
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,720
past in the Jews religion, how that beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God and

612
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,720
wasted it.

613
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:10,839
He was a religious man just as Nicodemus was, but he was lost and on that road to Damascus,

614
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:11,839
he was born again.

615
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,119
His life was changed.

616
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:15,440
The evidence is there.

617
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,440
Think about the effectiveness.

618
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,839
I want you to consider a couple of verses of scripture and closing this morning when

619
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,000
we think about the effectiveness and we've already kind of given some idea as to why,

620
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,880
what was it that would cause Paul to be effective in ministry, that he understood that he was

621
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,640
enlisted by God and enabled by God, that he could not do anything on his own.

622
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,760
But I want you to turn over to second Corinthians chapter number five.

623
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:43,080
We visited this passage just a few moments ago and we looked at verse number 17, speaking

624
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,760
of if any man be in Christ, he's a new creature and what great truth that is.

625
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,000
But I want you to draw your attention for just a moment here to verses 14 and 15 and

626
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:58,959
I want you to think about this effectiveness in ministry and the ministry in which we have

627
00:37:58,959 --> 00:38:00,480
been given.

628
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,679
We understand that through this portion of scripture in second Corinthians four and five,

629
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:09,940
the Bible talks about the fact that we have been given the ministry of reconciliation.

630
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:15,160
In verse 14, the Bible says this in second Corinthians five, for the love of Christ constraineth

631
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,360
us, it holds us together, it controls us.

632
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,360
Why?

633
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,959
Because God must judge that if one died for all, then we're all dead and that he died

634
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:36,119
for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died

635
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:39,239
for them and rose again.

636
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:43,559
Now as Paul would be used of God to write these words in verse number 15 of second Corinthians

637
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:46,940
five, he was living those words.

638
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:51,179
He didn't simply write these words and try to instruct the church in Corinth and the

639
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:53,500
believers there to live for Christ.

640
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:58,739
No, he himself was living for Christ as he said, listen, you have to acknowledge that

641
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:06,419
he died for all, that they which live should not live for themselves, but we live unto

642
00:39:06,419 --> 00:39:08,859
him which died for them and rose again.

643
00:39:08,859 --> 00:39:13,700
I'm thankful for the privilege of living for Jesus.

644
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:21,739
Paul would say this in Philippians one in verse number 21, for to me to live is Christ.

645
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:26,820
For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.

646
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,140
What a powerful verse of scripture.

647
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:33,580
Paul is acknowledging there in Philippians one in verse number 21 that as long as I have

648
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:39,979
life and breath, as long as I'm here upon this earth, I'm living for Christ.

649
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:42,660
I'm living for Christ.

650
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,099
To die is gain.

651
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:46,099
Why?

652
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:49,220
Why does Paul look at it as being gain to die?

653
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,220
Because he's going to be with Jesus.

654
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,220
Amen?

655
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:56,539
He had testified in second Corinthians to be absent from the body is to be present with

656
00:39:56,539 --> 00:39:57,539
the Lord.

657
00:39:57,539 --> 00:40:02,260
In fact, in that same passage in Philippians one, he tells the believers in Philippi how

658
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,260
that he was in the straight betwixt two.

659
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:12,260
What was it that caused Paul to be in this situation that he would term it as being in a straight betwixt two?

660
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:17,260
Well, he had a desire to depart to be with Christ, which was far better.

661
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:21,260
And we understand this morning that if we're going to be effective in ministry,

662
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:24,260
I understand that your ministry and my ministry are different,

663
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,260
I understand that our ministries are different than Paul's ministry,

664
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,260
but we're all ministers of Jesus Christ.

665
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:34,260
We've all been given some aspect of ministry,

666
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,260
and if we're going to be effective in ministry,

667
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:39,260
we better die to self, and we better be surrendered to God,

668
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:44,260
and we better understand that without Him, we can do nothing.

669
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:48,260
And that He will give us the boldness and the courage

670
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,260
that we would pray as the disciples prayed there in Acts,

671
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,260
as they were facing persecution,

672
00:40:54,260 --> 00:41:00,260
that they would pray that God would give them boldness to speak thy name.

673
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,260
We need boldness in this hour.

674
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,260
Our mission's theme was, I am not ashamed.

675
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:09,260
And oh, how we need boldness.

676
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:14,260
Perhaps you've experienced, even in the days since our mission's conference ended,

677
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,260
as you would seek to be more engaged in reaching our Jerusalem,

678
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,260
as you'd be more engaged in trying to reach people with the gospel,

679
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,260
that there are a number of people that want you to be ashamed.

680
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,260
They don't want to hear what you have to say.

681
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,260
They say, God, would you give me boldness?

682
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,260
Would you help me to speak thy word boldly?

683
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:37,260
And as we think about Paul, and we think about the testimony of a changed life,

684
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:41,260
we see it in the life of Paul.

685
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:45,260
And this morning, as we would begin to think about our own lives,

686
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:49,260
you've been born again, you've trusted Christ as your Savior,

687
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:53,260
you too have a testimony of a changed life.

688
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:58,260
The things that would be referred to as in times past,

689
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,260
as Paul referred to here in Galatians 1,

690
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:06,260
they may be different than what Paul's times past were.

691
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,260
But you have a time past.

692
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:11,260
You have a time when you were not saved.

693
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,260
And you compare time past to now,

694
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:19,260
and you see that difference, and you see what Christ has done in you.

695
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,260
You say, let me share with you, let me understand,

696
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,260
and let me help you understand the testimony of a changed life,

697
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,260
what God can do.

698
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,260
He is able to do exceeding great things.

699
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,260
He's changed my life.

700
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,260
And I know for you this morning, he's changed your life.

701
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,260
And I hope that as we would be encouraged this morning

702
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,260
by the testimony of a changed life,

703
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:45,260
that we would evaluate, how's the evidence?

704
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,260
If it was to be taken to the court of law,

705
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:52,260
you know, you need evidence when you go to the court of law.

706
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:57,260
If we were to go and be accused of being a Christian,

707
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:02,260
would there be enough evidence to get a guilty verdict?

708
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:05,260
Amen?

709
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:09,260
Remember Peter, when he denied the Lord?

710
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,260
You're one of his disciples.

711
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,260
No, I'm not.

712
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:18,260
But your speech.

713
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,260
And so he began to speak differently.

714
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,260
But I just wonder this morning,

715
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,260
if the accusation was made against us,

716
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:29,260
you're a Christian, you're a follower of Jesus Christ.

717
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,260
Is the evidence there?

718
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,260
I hope that we'd say yes.

719
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,260
The evidence is there, the evidence is clear.

720
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,260
I'm not suggesting the evidence is perfect, because we're not.

721
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:42,260
But the evidence of a changed life, the evidence of conversion.

722
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,260
And then the effectiveness in ministry.

723
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:48,260
Perhaps at times we get bogged down in ministry,

724
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,260
we get overwhelmed, we get to the point where we think,

725
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:54,260
man, I just can't seem to make a difference,

726
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:57,260
I can't seem to be effective.

727
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,260
How much are we depending upon the Lord?

728
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,260
Because as we depend upon the Lord,

729
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:10,260
we just kind of come to a place of full surrender.

730
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,260
Say, God, use me.

731
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,260
I'm not comfortable in this situation.

732
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,260
This isn't my personality.

733
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,260
Or maybe you're the kind of person that's super outgoing,

734
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,260
and you think you have the personality to do those things.

735
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:26,260
And you're just going to depend upon your own self.

736
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:29,260
We say, no, I've got to depend upon God.

737
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:33,260
And as I understand that it is God who enables me,

738
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:36,260
He allows me to be effective in ministry.

739
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,260
The Apostle Paul, the testimony of a changed life,

740
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:42,260
what a great opportunity we have to say,

741
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,260
let me tell you what God did for me.

742
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:47,260
Let me tell you how He changed my life.

743
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:50,260
Let me testify of the goodness of God,

744
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:54,260
so that others would glorify God in me,

745
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:57,260
as they did in Galatians 1 and verse number 24.

746
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,260
Let's pray.

747
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,260
Father, we love You.

748
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,260
We thank You for loving us.

749
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,260
We thank You for the Word of God.

750
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,260
We thank You this morning for the testimony

751
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,260
of a changed life, the Apostle Paul.

752
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,260
We thank You, God, for the way in which

753
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:18,260
You have recorded in Your Word,

754
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,260
not only here in Galatians 1,

755
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:24,260
but in other portions of Scripture,

756
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:28,260
the testimony of the Apostle Paul, the change.

757
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,260
Lord, I pray that if there's one here

758
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,260
that's not sure of heaven,

759
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,260
they've never been born again,

760
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,260
they don't have 100% assurance

761
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:39,260
that heaven is their home.

762
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:43,260
Lord, I pray that today would be the day of their salvation.

763
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,260
They would understand that truth

764
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:51,260
when Jesus said you must be born again.

765
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:55,260
Lord, I pray for each believer this morning.

766
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:59,260
I pray that You would help us

767
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,260
to be effective in ministry.

768
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:04,260
I pray that the evidence of conversion would be there.

769
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,260
And Lord, help us to be effective in ministry

770
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,260
as we seek to serve You,

771
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,260
as we seek to do Your work

772
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,260
that You've called us to do.

773
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:17,260
Help us to be dependent upon You.

774
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,260
I pray, God, that You would work,

775
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:22,260
move in ways that only You can move.

776
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:26,260
I pray that You alone would be glorified

777
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,260
during this time of invitation.

778
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,260
We'll thank You for the work that You'll do.

779
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,260
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

780
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,260
Would you stand with me?

781
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:35,260
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

782
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:38,260
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

783
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,260
And as she does, we have an opportunity

784
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,260
to respond to the Lord.

785
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,260
Maybe you want to come to this old-fashioned altar.

786
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,260
Maybe you want to make your pew an altar.

787
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,260
But do business with the Lord.

788
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,260
Let God have His way.

789
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,260
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
