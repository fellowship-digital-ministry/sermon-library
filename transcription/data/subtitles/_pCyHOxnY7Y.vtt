WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.219
for the Word of God, the truth that is contained therein, and I trust that as

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:10.800
you have an opportunity daily to walk with the Lord and to feast upon His Word

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.319
that you are strengthened and encouraged, and I hope that you're challenged, amen?

00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:20.840
And it's good when you read the Word of God and receive comfort, but it's just as

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.280
good when you get convicted reading the Word of God, amen? And I'm thankful for

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.600
the Word of God. This morning will be in Galatians chapter number 1, and if you

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.919
look at the bulletin you see that the title for the message today, The

00:00:32.919 --> 00:00:38.799
Testimony of a Changed Life. The Testimony of a Changed Life. Of course

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:43.520
the book of Galatians is written to the churches in the region of Galatia. You

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.759
notice in verse number 2 the Bible says, And all the brethren which are with me

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:53.000
unto the churches of Galatia. And we understand that these churches that are

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.959
being referenced to, that this book is being written to, are the churches in

00:00:56.959 --> 00:01:02.959
Antioch and Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe. And we find that it was on that

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:07.480
first missionary journey that the Apostle Paul and Barnabas, they went,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.480
that's recorded in Acts 13 and 14, and they went through the region of Galatia

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.599
and these churches were established. We find that God would use the Apostle Paul

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:23.680
as an instrument, as His servant, to take the gospel to this region and to see

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.639
churches established. What a wonderful blessing to hear of churches being

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:32.559
established. What a joy to be part of a local church. What a joy to support

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:37.599
missionaries who are going and seeking to preach the gospel and establish local

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:42.559
churches. The local church is the organism that God is using in this

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:48.040
particular era, and I'm so thankful for the church. And contrary to what has been

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.319
said to us over the last year, I will tell you that the church is absolutely

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.879
essential. It is God's bride. It is the bride of Christ, amen? And I am so

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:04.480
thankful to be part of a local church. I count it a great privilege to pastor a

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:11.080
local church. And we find that Paul is now being used by God to write back to

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.679
these churches in the region of Galatia, these four churches in particular, in

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:20.639
those particular cities, and we find that as Paul is now being used of the Lord to

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:25.720
write back to these churches, that this book of Galatians, though it's only six

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.600
chapters, I mean, it is rich and full of great content. I mean, helpful information.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.320
We find that the false teachers have crept in, the Judaizers in particular

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.500
were there and active, and we find that much as the cases we would look

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.479
throughout the New Testament and even study church history, that the false

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:52.639
teachers always seem to show up. We find that as God would allow churches to be

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.720
established and he would allow the Word of God to be given, that there are false

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.479
teachers that would creep in. The book of Jude, Jude says it this way, that false

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:08.279
teachers, that these men, they crept in unawares, under the radar, so to speak. And

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:13.320
we find that Paul is being used of the Lord to give this church some very

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.080
important instruction that they needed, these churches, very important

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.679
instruction that they needed. Now this morning we're going to focus on the

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:25.360
latter part of Galatians 1, and as we look at this portion of Scripture, we'll

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.479
have the opportunity to see the testimony of the Apostle Paul. And as we

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:33.839
think about looking at this portion of Scripture, and obviously the title of the

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:38.880
message, the testimony of a changed life, I hope that this morning, as we look at

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.199
the life of the Apostle Paul in this particular portion of Scripture, and

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:48.800
we're able to look at the testimony of a changed life, that you also can look at

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.600
your own life and you can rejoice in the work that God has done in your life. See,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.800
Paul, as we find here, as he's giving his testimony, really what he's testifying of

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.759
is how God has worked in his life. What God has done in his life, and you and I

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:12.320
have the opportunity to testify and to be a witness and to have a great

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.320
testimony with regard to the change that Christ has made in our lives. Notice he

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.119
begins in verse number 11,

00:04:20.119 --> 00:04:26.200
But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.799
after man. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the

00:04:31.799 --> 00:04:38.399
revelation of Jesus Christ. For ye have heard of my conversation in time past, in

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:44.040
the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God and

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.040
wasted it, and profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:56.200
own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. We'll

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.640
look at the entirety, but I want you to skip down to verse number 23, by way of

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:07.119
introduction. The Bible says this, but they had heard only that he, that's Paul, is the

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:12.640
one that's being referred to there, that he which persecuted us in times past, now

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:22.079
preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. And they glorified God in me.

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:26.559
As we look at this passage of Scripture, I see first of all, if you're taking

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:31.399
notes, the evidence of his conversion. The evidence of his conversion. As we begin to look at

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:36.040
this passage of Scripture, we find that he begins in verse 11 and 12, and he says,

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.959
I certify you, I make it known, I'm going to make you informed of this truth, that

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:46.200
the gospel which he would preach is not a gospel that's after man. The Apostle

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.160
Paul, on a regular basis, he seeks to be able to share with those that he's

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.279
ministering to, that he's speaking by the Word of the Lord. He's not just giving

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:59.519
his own opinion. In fact, on Thursday, as I had the opportunity to preach a funeral,

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:04.200
thank you for praying for me, I looked at the passage in 1 Thessalonians 4, as I

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.480
began to share with these individuals the truth of God's Word. And I said, you

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.160
understand that I'm not just giving you my opinion, and Paul's not just giving

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.880
his opinion. He says that this is by the Word of the Lord. And I'm so thankful

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.720
that God has given us his Word, and he has providentially preserved his Word

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:29.160
for us, and we can have confidence in the Word of God. And we find that Paul, he

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.519
says, I neither, in verse number 12, received it of man, neither was I taught

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:39.440
it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. He said, the Lord is my teacher, the Lord

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.480
has given me this truth, and the Lord has commissioned me to then give this truth

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.720
out. So we see the evidence of his conversion. I want you to notice that on

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.440
two occasions in this short passage of Scripture, he uses a phraseology that is

00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:00.040
worth noting. In verse 13, he says this, for you have heard of my conversation,

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:08.399
notice this phrase, in time past. For you have heard of my conversation in time

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:13.480
past. That word, conversation, is my behavior, my manner of living. He said,

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.359
you heard of, you knew what my testimony was. What was his testimony? Well, he was

00:07:18.359 --> 00:07:23.279
persecuting the church. He mentions in verse 13 and 14 of this passage of

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:28.600
Scripture, that which he did, he said, how that beyond measure I persecuted the

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:34.440
church of God and wasted it. We find that this man Saul, at this particular time in

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.239
his life, because he'd not yet been converted, that Saul was breathing out

00:07:38.239 --> 00:07:43.040
threatenings, the Bible tells us, and you find that it's at the end of Acts 7, at

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:48.000
the stoning of Stephen, and Stephen's clothes are dropped at the feet of this

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.760
one Saul, and you begin to see how that he's no doubt under conviction, and his

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:57.799
response to that conviction was to intensify the attack against the church.

00:07:57.799 --> 00:08:03.119
And he went out seeking any of that way, those that were followers of the Lord

00:08:03.119 --> 00:08:08.359
Jesus Christ, and he sought to destroy them, to imprison them. He was on the road

00:08:08.359 --> 00:08:13.519
to Damascus, he had the authority from the officials to go and to arrest and to

00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:19.359
bind and to bring back, and we find that Saul, he says, listen, it's known what my

00:08:19.359 --> 00:08:25.239
conversation was, it's known of my behavior in time past. He uses the phrase

00:08:25.239 --> 00:08:31.359
again in verse number 23, notice what it says here, but they had heard only that

00:08:31.359 --> 00:08:38.520
he which persecuted us, notice, in times past, now preacheth the faith which once

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.320
he destroyed. And so we see in verse number 13, in verse number 23, he says, my

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:48.760
conversation in time past, he which persecuted us in times past, and as we

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.280
would focus upon that phrase in times past, I'm thankful that there's a

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:59.599
conjunction in verse number 15, but. See, there's a great change in the life of

00:08:59.599 --> 00:09:04.719
the Apostle Paul. We find that it says, but in verse number 15, when it pleased

00:09:04.719 --> 00:09:11.039
God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace, what did

00:09:11.039 --> 00:09:16.359
he call him to do? To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the

00:09:16.359 --> 00:09:20.200
heathen. Immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood. Notice in verse

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.640
number 23, you see that the Bible says, but they had heard only that he which

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:33.559
persecuted us in times past, notice, now preacheth the faith which once he

00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:44.299
destroyed. Time past, now. The testimony of a changed life, the evidence of the

00:09:44.299 --> 00:09:48.940
conversion of this man that we refer to as Paul. Of course, we know his name was

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:53.099
Saul, and then it was changed to Paul. And we'd find even in this passage of

00:09:53.099 --> 00:09:57.020
Scripture, as Paul was sharing his testimony with these churches in the

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:02.059
region of Galatia, that he's testifying of that

00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:03.859
that event that was taken place

00:10:03.859 --> 00:10:06.759
and recorded for us in Acts 9.

00:10:06.759 --> 00:10:08.279
We won't have time this morning

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:10.219
to go back to Acts 9,

00:10:10.219 --> 00:10:11.879
but if you go back and you read

00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:13.279
that portion of Scripture,

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.119
you'll find that it's there in Acts 9

00:10:15.119 --> 00:10:18.459
that God reveals Himself to Saul

00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:20.859
as He's walking on the road to Damascus,

00:10:20.859 --> 00:10:22.579
and we find that it's there

00:10:22.579 --> 00:10:23.999
that He sees that light,

00:10:23.999 --> 00:10:24.879
and He says,

00:10:24.879 --> 00:10:28.299
Who art thou, Lord?

00:10:28.299 --> 00:10:31.979
I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest.

00:10:31.979 --> 00:10:34.179
We find that Paul, at that point,

00:10:34.179 --> 00:10:35.419
his name is still Saul.

00:10:35.419 --> 00:10:39.679
He says, Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:43.799
We find that his life was changed.

00:10:43.799 --> 00:10:46.319
I mean, it was a dramatic change.

00:10:46.319 --> 00:10:47.739
And we think about the truth

00:10:47.739 --> 00:10:48.959
of being born again.

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:51.359
We know that Jesus in John 3

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:54.259
when Nicodemus came to Jesus by night,

00:10:54.259 --> 00:10:56.299
He said, we know that Thou art a teacher

00:10:56.299 --> 00:10:57.459
sent from God.

00:10:57.459 --> 00:10:59.919
And He begins to address the Lord Jesus Christ

00:10:59.919 --> 00:11:01.119
and Jesus says,

00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:02.459
listen, Nicodemus,

00:11:02.459 --> 00:11:04.519
except a man be born again,

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:06.439
you cannot see the Kingdom of God.

00:11:06.439 --> 00:11:09.559
Ye must be born again.

00:11:09.559 --> 00:11:11.419
And we find that Saul,

00:11:11.419 --> 00:11:13.500
the evidence of his conversion,

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.299
he says, listen, you know what I was,

00:11:17.299 --> 00:11:19.419
but now look at what I am.

00:11:19.419 --> 00:11:22.619
In time past, my conversation

00:11:22.619 --> 00:11:25.199
and my behavior and my lifestyle

00:11:25.199 --> 00:11:26.739
and I was fighting against God,

00:11:26.739 --> 00:11:28.540
but now I'm preaching,

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.479
I'm fulfilling what God has called me to do.

00:11:31.479 --> 00:11:34.220
He changed my life.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.559
I'm mindful of the truth

00:11:35.559 --> 00:11:37.939
in 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 17.

00:11:37.939 --> 00:11:40.099
Just turn a few pages back in your Bibles

00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:42.199
and look at this passage of Scripture.

00:11:42.199 --> 00:11:44.279
And we could quote it for you this morning

00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:46.559
and I find sometimes even in my own life

00:11:46.559 --> 00:11:48.759
that I'll quote a verse of Scripture

00:11:48.759 --> 00:11:50.319
and my dad made this statement

00:11:50.319 --> 00:11:51.439
on Wednesday evening

00:11:51.439 --> 00:11:53.000
when he was giving an introduction

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.239
to Psalm 23

00:11:54.239 --> 00:11:58.319
that many people know Psalm 23.

00:11:58.339 --> 00:11:59.959
Not just Christians.

00:11:59.959 --> 00:12:03.220
A lot of people know Psalm 23.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.979
But they lack the true knowledge

00:12:04.979 --> 00:12:08.860
of the full teaching and the depth

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.199
of the truth that is revealed to us

00:12:11.199 --> 00:12:13.059
in that passage of Scripture.

00:12:13.059 --> 00:12:15.660
I want you to think about 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 17.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.020
Now, the Apostle Paul is the human penman

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.580
for the book of 2 Corinthians as well.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.360
And I want you to think about this.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.479
The Bible says, therefore,

00:12:24.479 --> 00:12:27.279
if any man be in Christ,

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:29.919
he is a new creature.

00:12:29.919 --> 00:12:32.160
Old things are passed away.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.899
Behold, all things are become new.

00:12:35.899 --> 00:12:38.759
It's a verse of Scripture that is familiar to us.

00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:41.599
It's a verse of Scripture that I often quote.

00:12:41.599 --> 00:12:44.720
But it hit me this week as I was preparing this message,

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.020
I wonder as the Apostle Paul

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.440
was writing these words

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.979
in what we now refer to as 2 Corinthians 5

00:12:51.979 --> 00:12:53.559
and verse 17,

00:12:53.559 --> 00:12:56.619
if any man be in Christ,

00:12:56.639 --> 00:12:58.800
perhaps just for a moment he would pause

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.160
and understand that he himself was in Christ.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.839
He had been saved.

00:13:03.839 --> 00:13:06.559
It says that he is a new creature.

00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:10.179
I mean, can you imagine Paul writing these words?

00:13:10.179 --> 00:13:12.319
Old things are passed away.

00:13:12.319 --> 00:13:14.080
Behold, all things are become new.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.599
And as he would write these words

00:13:15.599 --> 00:13:17.520
to encourage the believers in Corinth

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.160
to be preserved for us today,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.360
I just wonder the way in which

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.919
his mind would flood with thoughts

00:13:23.919 --> 00:13:26.000
and with appreciation for the work

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.059
that Christ did in him.

00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:31.220
He was a new creature.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.099
I mean, he was changed

00:13:34.099 --> 00:13:36.339
as one person would say,

00:13:36.339 --> 00:13:37.860
from the bottom of his feet

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.360
to the top of his head.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.899
I mean, he was changed.

00:13:42.899 --> 00:13:46.059
There was evidence of his conversion.

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:48.339
We find that as he would be used of God

00:13:48.339 --> 00:13:50.699
to pen these words in 2 Corinthians 5

00:13:50.699 --> 00:13:52.000
and verse 17,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.539
his own life testified of the message

00:13:54.539 --> 00:13:57.839
that was being sent to this church in Corinth.

00:13:57.839 --> 00:13:59.639
That he was in Christ

00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:01.839
and he was a new creature.

00:14:01.839 --> 00:14:04.520
And that old things were passed away.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.660
We sing a song with the children

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.539
and sometimes even with the adults,

00:14:08.539 --> 00:14:10.639
the things I used to do,

00:14:10.639 --> 00:14:13.419
I don't do them anymore.

00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:14.399
Why?

00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:16.759
There's been a great change

00:14:16.759 --> 00:14:19.540
since I've been born again.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.200
And we understand that change

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.279
that God has made in our lives

00:14:23.299 --> 00:14:25.859
and that evidence of conversion.

00:14:25.859 --> 00:14:27.059
Look over, if you will,

00:14:27.059 --> 00:14:29.500
just a few pages the other way in your Bible

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.859
in Ephesians 2.

00:14:32.859 --> 00:14:35.059
Ephesians 2.

00:14:35.059 --> 00:14:36.260
Verses 1-3.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.000
Really, we could look at verses 1

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.859
all the way down through verse 10.

00:14:39.859 --> 00:14:40.859
For sake of time,

00:14:40.859 --> 00:14:42.799
we'll just look at the first three verses

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:44.859
this morning of this portion of Scripture.

00:14:44.859 --> 00:14:46.500
But notice what the Bible says,

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.320
"...and you hath he quickened

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.299
to make alive

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.279
those who were dead in trespasses and sins."

00:14:55.279 --> 00:14:57.000
Notice this phrase again,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.440
"...in time past."

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.440
He used that phrase in the book of Galatians

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.440
in giving his own personal testimony

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.899
in speaking of his own conversion experience

00:15:05.899 --> 00:15:07.160
in time past.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.660
He now uses this here

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.519
speaking to the believers in Ephesus,

00:15:10.519 --> 00:15:13.119
"...wherein in time past

00:15:13.119 --> 00:15:16.559
ye walked according to the course of this world,

00:15:16.559 --> 00:15:19.440
according to the prince of the power of the air,

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:21.339
the spirit that now worketh

00:15:21.339 --> 00:15:23.619
in the children of disobedience."

00:15:23.619 --> 00:15:25.459
Notice what he says in verse 3.

00:15:25.459 --> 00:15:28.739
"...among whom also we all

00:15:28.739 --> 00:15:32.899
had our conversation in times past."

00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:36.540
Listen, we all were in the same boat.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.459
All of humanity.

00:15:39.459 --> 00:15:43.820
We understand that God created Adam and Eve perfect.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.619
Put them in a perfect environment.

00:15:46.619 --> 00:15:49.679
Gave them instruction.

00:15:49.679 --> 00:15:52.579
We find that that command was broken.

00:15:52.579 --> 00:15:56.000
In Genesis 3, we find that the serpent

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.500
who was more subtle than any beast of the field,

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.739
he came in and he says,

00:15:59.739 --> 00:16:02.619
"...yea, hath God said."

00:16:02.619 --> 00:16:04.579
We find that just a few verses later,

00:16:04.579 --> 00:16:06.279
they are partaking of the fruit

00:16:06.279 --> 00:16:09.760
that they were commanded not to eat of.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.660
And the Bible says that at that point,

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.239
sin entered into the world.

00:16:14.239 --> 00:16:16.380
And as we read Romans 5,

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:17.700
the Bible says that,

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.320
"...for as by one man sin entered into the world,

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.419
and death by sin,

00:16:22.419 --> 00:16:25.019
and so death hath passed on all men,

00:16:25.019 --> 00:16:26.940
for that all have sinned."

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.459
Romans 3, "...for all have sinned

00:16:29.459 --> 00:16:31.579
and come short of the glory of God."

00:16:31.579 --> 00:16:33.279
I often will speak to individuals

00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:34.859
and I'll ask them this question.

00:16:34.859 --> 00:16:36.399
Listen, before they can be saved,

00:16:36.399 --> 00:16:38.880
they've got to understand they're lost.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.160
Are you a sinner?

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.540
Most people that I talk to

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.279
don't have a hard time acknowledging

00:16:43.279 --> 00:16:44.500
that they're a sinner.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.600
Every once in a while,

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.260
I come up with a smart aleck that says,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.500
well, no, actually I don't think I am.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.739
I said, well, have you ever lied?

00:16:52.739 --> 00:16:54.500
Yeah.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.160
Okay, well, God said all men are liars.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.500
And try to attack it in various ways

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.500
and what have you.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.739
But most people have an ease

00:17:02.739 --> 00:17:05.919
of acknowledging that we're sinners.

00:17:05.919 --> 00:17:07.220
And we find that Paul says,

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.679
listen, we all had our conversation

00:17:09.679 --> 00:17:10.579
in time past.

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:12.260
We all were in that same condition

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.700
in that same boat.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.820
But we think about the grace and mercy of God.

00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:18.500
It says here in v. 3,

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.260
among whom also we all had our conversation

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.320
in times past in the lust of our flesh,

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.419
fulfilling the desires of the flesh

00:17:26.419 --> 00:17:27.459
and of the mind,

00:17:27.459 --> 00:17:29.760
and were by nature the children of wrath

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.239
even as others.

00:17:31.239 --> 00:17:34.639
But God who is rich in mercy

00:17:34.639 --> 00:17:38.359
for His great love wherewith He loved us.

00:17:38.359 --> 00:17:39.619
And we think about Paul

00:17:39.619 --> 00:17:42.119
and the evidence of his conversion.

00:17:42.139 --> 00:17:44.299
I'm thankful as we look at this passage

00:17:44.299 --> 00:17:46.279
in Galatians 1,

00:17:46.279 --> 00:17:49.399
in v. 11 down through v. 24,

00:17:49.399 --> 00:17:52.940
I'm thankful that we have the now.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.059
That Paul says this is times past.

00:17:55.059 --> 00:17:56.980
You knew what my conversation was.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.019
You knew what I was known for.

00:17:59.019 --> 00:18:02.399
Listen, Saul had a reputation.

00:18:02.399 --> 00:18:03.940
Do you remember in Acts 9

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.139
when right after his conversion,

00:18:06.139 --> 00:18:07.679
of course, he was left blind

00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:09.320
and he could not see.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.959
And God appears to Ananias and says,

00:18:11.959 --> 00:18:13.679
hey, listen, I need you to go

00:18:13.679 --> 00:18:15.059
and talk to Saul of Tarsus.

00:18:15.059 --> 00:18:16.519
And Ananias is like, hold on a minute.

00:18:16.519 --> 00:18:19.239
Do you know about this fellow?

00:18:19.239 --> 00:18:20.440
Do you want me to go talk to him?

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.940
And God confirms to Ananias,

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.940
yes, I want you to go to him,

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.279
and I want you to speak to him.

00:18:26.279 --> 00:18:29.079
And Ananias, when he goes in v. 17,

00:18:29.079 --> 00:18:30.440
he put his hand on him and said,

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.539
Brother Saul, isn't that precious?

00:18:34.539 --> 00:18:35.880
Just a few weeks ago,

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.000
I preached a message.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.179
It was actually on Mother's Day.

00:18:39.179 --> 00:18:40.760
Phoebe, our sister.

00:18:40.779 --> 00:18:42.659
And I talked about the phraseology

00:18:42.659 --> 00:18:45.359
of using those terms brother and sister

00:18:45.359 --> 00:18:48.340
and acknowledging that we are in Christ

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:49.539
and that we're family

00:18:49.539 --> 00:18:50.859
because we've been born again.

00:18:50.859 --> 00:18:52.520
We're the sons of God.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.320
And we find that Ananias says,

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.900
Brother Saul.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.679
He was apprehensive initially. Why?

00:18:57.679 --> 00:19:00.080
Because he knew about this man.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.520
He knew what his behavior was.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.520
But I'm thankful for the now.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.640
Now.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.840
Listen, this is what I was.

00:19:08.859 --> 00:19:11.599
This is what I am in Christ.

00:19:11.599 --> 00:19:14.580
The evidence of His conversion.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.719
I wonder this morning,

00:19:17.719 --> 00:19:19.260
is there evidence in your life?

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:20.659
Is there evidence in my life

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:22.979
that we've been born again?

00:19:22.979 --> 00:19:26.580
Is there evidence of that new life in Christ?

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.820
The things I used to do,

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:28.919
I don't do them anymore.

00:19:28.919 --> 00:19:30.099
The place I used to go.

00:19:30.099 --> 00:19:31.739
You go through the whole list

00:19:31.739 --> 00:19:33.059
and you see the change

00:19:33.059 --> 00:19:35.140
that Christ has made in you.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.940
I mentioned to someone not long ago

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.880
about some of the birthmarks of a believer.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.820
The Bible says that as newborn babes

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.640
desire the sincere milk of the Word

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.960
that you may grow thereby.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.520
In 1 Peter 2 and verse 2,

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.039
I will readily admit to you

00:19:48.039 --> 00:19:49.760
that prior to my salvation,

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.559
I had no appetite for this Word.

00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:53.900
For this book.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.000
I didn't have a desire to read the Word of God.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.299
I wasn't saved.

00:19:58.299 --> 00:20:00.159
And I got saved.

00:20:00.159 --> 00:20:01.679
And it's been a number of years now

00:20:01.679 --> 00:20:02.679
that I've been saved.

00:20:02.679 --> 00:20:07.679
saved, but I have an appetite, I have a desire to read the Word of God, to feast

00:20:07.679 --> 00:20:14.399
upon God's Word, to learn it, and to learn of God, and to meditate upon the

00:20:14.399 --> 00:20:19.559
truth. And God gives us, because we're in Christ, because we've been saved, He gives

00:20:19.559 --> 00:20:25.279
us that desire for His Word. I never went to church before I was saved. I didn't

00:20:25.279 --> 00:20:29.999
have a desire to be around the people of God. I wasn't saved. Now I

00:20:29.999 --> 00:20:35.639
love fellowshipping with the people of God, brothers and sisters in Christ. We

00:20:35.639 --> 00:20:40.959
can go through the list, but I wonder this morning, as we would consider

00:20:40.959 --> 00:20:45.159
Galatians 1, and we would consider the testimony of a changed life, and we would

00:20:45.159 --> 00:20:50.159
consider the evidence of His conversion, how much evidence is there in

00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:56.359
your life, in my life, of being born again? If someone were to look at the evidence,

00:20:56.359 --> 00:21:05.599
would it be enough to conclude, without any doubt whatsoever, this person is a

00:21:05.599 --> 00:21:10.359
follower of Jesus Christ? They are a Christian. I believe the evidence is

00:21:10.359 --> 00:21:14.999
clear in the life of the Apostle Paul. Not only do we see the evidence of his

00:21:14.999 --> 00:21:18.359
conversion, number two, if you're taking notes, I want you to see the effectiveness

00:21:18.359 --> 00:21:25.159
of his ministry, the effectiveness of his ministry. We find that as Paul was born

00:21:25.159 --> 00:21:29.719
again, as he was saved, we find that he was called and he was commissioned, he

00:21:29.719 --> 00:21:35.479
was given a particular ministry, and we find that Paul was faithful to fulfill

00:21:35.479 --> 00:21:39.479
the ministry. And as we would think about the effectiveness of his ministry, we

00:21:39.479 --> 00:21:43.559
must understand that it's because he was abiding in Christ, it was because he was

00:21:43.559 --> 00:21:48.559
dependent upon the Lord. Paul understood that in him that was in his flesh

00:21:48.559 --> 00:21:52.239
dwelleth no good thing. Paul understood as he testified in 1

00:21:52.239 --> 00:21:58.279
Corinthians 15, I am what I am by the grace of God. And we find that as we

00:21:58.279 --> 00:22:02.379
would look at the effectiveness of his ministry, we find that it's here in verse

00:22:02.379 --> 00:22:07.559
number 16 of Galatians 1 that it says, to reveal his Son in me, that I might

00:22:07.559 --> 00:22:14.239
preach him among the heathen. Immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood. The

00:22:14.239 --> 00:22:17.639
word heathen that is used here in verse number 16 often would be used to

00:22:17.639 --> 00:22:23.399
reference Gentiles. It can be used very broadly to just speak of mankind in

00:22:23.399 --> 00:22:28.439
general, and thinking about lost people in particular. And we find that Paul, as

00:22:28.439 --> 00:22:34.639
he understood, that he had committed to him the ministry of taking the gospel to

00:22:34.639 --> 00:22:38.359
the uncircumcision. In fact, in chapter number 2 of the book of Galatians, in

00:22:38.359 --> 00:22:43.839
verse number 7, he mentions the ministry that was given to him versus that which

00:22:43.839 --> 00:22:48.579
was given to Peter. But contrarywise, when they saw that the gospel of the

00:22:48.579 --> 00:22:53.799
uncircumcision, that's to the Gentiles, was committed unto me as the gospel of

00:22:53.799 --> 00:22:57.519
the circumcision was unto Peter. Now understand that it's not a different

00:22:57.519 --> 00:23:02.079
gospel, but that he's speaking about the ministry in particular that he was

00:23:02.079 --> 00:23:07.639
called to. You find that Paul, as he would go through, and if you evaluate the

00:23:07.639 --> 00:23:10.819
missionary journeys, and you would find that he would go and he would take the

00:23:10.819 --> 00:23:15.579
gospel to the Jews, and oftentimes they would reject the message, and he'd go to

00:23:15.579 --> 00:23:19.939
the Gentiles. And that always caused problems, and it caused uproars in a

00:23:19.939 --> 00:23:23.659
number of cities, but we find that Paul understood the ministry that he was

00:23:23.659 --> 00:23:28.379
given. And as we would think about the ministry and the effectiveness of his

00:23:28.379 --> 00:23:34.419
ministry, we must understand that he was enlisted by God. See, Paul was enlisted by

00:23:34.459 --> 00:23:41.859
God. Look in Galatians 1 and verse number 1. Notice what the Bible says here. Paul,

00:23:41.859 --> 00:23:50.500
an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:57.619
raised him from the dead. See, we find that Paul acknowledges here in this

00:23:57.619 --> 00:24:02.699
portion of Scripture that he was enlisted by God, and it was God that

00:24:02.699 --> 00:24:07.419
called him. I believe that as Paul understood that he was called by God, it

00:24:07.419 --> 00:24:12.819
gave him a courage to stand and to fulfill all that God called him to do.

00:24:12.819 --> 00:24:17.659
Though he faced much adversity and though he dealt with much opposition,

00:24:17.659 --> 00:24:24.899
Paul understood that he was called and commissioned. He was enlisted by God. And

00:24:24.899 --> 00:24:29.779
we find that because he understood his calling, because he understood what it

00:24:29.779 --> 00:24:34.459
was that God was doing in him and through him. And notice at the end of

00:24:34.459 --> 00:24:42.259
verse number 15, it says, "...and called me by his grace." I'm so thankful. As we would

00:24:42.259 --> 00:24:46.739
think about the life of the Apostle Paul, and we would understand the evidence of

00:24:46.739 --> 00:24:50.619
his conversion, but then we would note the effectiveness of his ministry. And

00:24:50.619 --> 00:24:54.660
we'd understand this morning that for each of us, the testimony of a changed

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:59.019
life, if you have been saved, if you've been born again, there ought to be

00:24:59.019 --> 00:25:03.339
evidence of conversion in your life. But we also understand that God's given you

00:25:03.339 --> 00:25:07.100
a ministry. It may not be the same ministry that he gave the Apostle Paul.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.500
It may not be the same ministry that he gave me or to the person next to you, in

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:15.059
front of you, or behind you, but God has given you a ministry. God has given you

00:25:15.059 --> 00:25:19.619
an opportunity to be his servant, to be his representative. And we find that as

00:25:19.619 --> 00:25:24.579
we would understand the ministry that God has given us and to be engaged in

00:25:24.579 --> 00:25:29.940
the work that we would desire to be effective in ministry. But our

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:35.539
effectiveness is not based on our cleverness, on our abilities, our talents,

00:25:35.539 --> 00:25:42.820
and our personalities. No, rather, our effectiveness in ministry is directly

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:50.419
related and directly a result of the the dependence that we have on God Almighty.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:56.339
Remember what Jesus said in John 15. He said, I am the vine, you're the branches.

00:25:56.339 --> 00:26:04.220
Without me, ye can do nothing. See, Paul understood that. He understood that he

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:11.139
was a co-laborer with God. He understood, I was reading even this morning in the

00:26:11.139 --> 00:26:14.979
book of 1st Corinthians, and what a wonderful book that is, but we find that

00:26:14.979 --> 00:26:18.059
he mentions in verse number 9 of chapter 3 that we're laborers together with God.

00:26:18.059 --> 00:26:22.940
But remember, it's there that Paul says, as they're having this schism and these

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:26.699
divisions in the church in Corinth where there were some that said, I'm of Paul,

00:26:26.699 --> 00:26:32.419
I'm of Apollos, I'm of Cephas, they're having all of these divisions, and Paul

00:26:32.419 --> 00:26:40.859
says, who then is Paul? I'm just a servant, I'm just a minister. See, in chapter

00:26:40.859 --> 00:26:44.660
number 1 of the book of 1st Corinthians, Paul uses and goes through great

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:49.619
detail, really, starting in verse number 10 and going all the way down through

00:26:49.619 --> 00:26:53.459
the end of the chapter and dealing with their schism and division and their

00:26:53.459 --> 00:26:58.299
alliances, if you will, and how he then testifies of his ministry there in

00:26:58.299 --> 00:27:04.179
Corinth, and he says, listen, I came to preach Christ. He didn't come to preach

00:27:04.179 --> 00:27:08.179
Paul. He wasn't looking to get a following for himself. No, he was preaching

00:27:08.179 --> 00:27:14.619
Christ. And we find that he would conclude, as he goes through this chapter, how that

00:27:14.619 --> 00:27:20.179
God, how that he does not call the the mighty, the wise, and so on and so forth.

00:27:20.179 --> 00:27:24.660
God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. Why? That

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:30.779
God might be glorified. And it says this in verse number 29, that no flesh should

00:27:30.779 --> 00:27:37.419
glory in his presence. See, what made the ministry of the Apostle Paul effective

00:27:37.419 --> 00:27:42.100
was that he was dependent upon God. He understood he was enlisted by God, but he

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:46.979
also understood that he was enabled by God. It was God who called him, but it

00:27:46.979 --> 00:27:52.500
was God who enabled him. We find this, as we mentioned already in verses 11 and 12

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:57.139
of Galatians 1, when he speaks about the fact that the gospel that he preached,

00:27:57.139 --> 00:28:01.739
that he did not receive it of man, but he was taught it by Jesus Christ. And we

00:28:01.739 --> 00:28:06.019
find that he would speak of not only being enlisted by God, but being enabled

00:28:06.019 --> 00:28:11.339
by God. Paul said this in 1 Timothy 1 and verse number 12, as he's writing to

00:28:11.339 --> 00:28:17.259
his son in the faith, Timothy, he says, and I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who

00:28:17.259 --> 00:28:23.500
hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:28.820
And he understood that it was God who enabled him. I am what I am by the grace

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:34.779
of God, in 1 Corinthians 15 and verse number 10. I notice at the end, that

00:28:34.779 --> 00:28:40.299
at the end of the book of Galatians, that Paul would speak about the fact that he

00:28:40.299 --> 00:28:46.099
would glory in the cross. He says this in Galatians 6 and verse 14, but God

00:28:46.099 --> 00:28:52.260
forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:57.339
the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. What Paul is saying here

00:28:57.339 --> 00:29:03.539
is that, listen, I understand that I've been enabled by God. It's not about me.

00:29:03.539 --> 00:29:08.099
See, sometimes we look at Paul, and if we're not careful, begin to study his

00:29:08.099 --> 00:29:11.899
life, and begin to look at the passages of Scripture that deal with his

00:29:11.899 --> 00:29:16.820
ministry and his effectiveness, and we say, oh man, I wish I could be like Paul.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:21.700
The reality is that Paul was used of God the way that he was, because he was

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:28.779
completely surrendered to God. He was completely surrendered to God. And as we

00:29:28.779 --> 00:29:33.099
think about that absolute, that full surrender, and we see that in the life of

00:29:33.099 --> 00:29:36.979
the Apostle Paul, we see that that's what allowed for effectiveness in the

00:29:36.979 --> 00:29:42.380
ministry. We find that as we would go back to Galatians chapter 1, and we'd

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:46.659
pick back up here in verse number 17, and finish up through the chapter here, the

00:29:46.659 --> 00:29:50.700
Bible says, neither when I up to Jerusalem to them which were Apostles

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:55.500
before me, but I went into Arabia and returned again unto Damascus, verse 18,

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:59.659
then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and abode with

00:29:59.659 --> 00:30:04.380
him 15 days, but other of the Apostles saw I none.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:09.700
Save James, the Lord's brother, now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:10.700
I lie not.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:15.060
Afterwards, I came into the region of Syria and Cilicia, and was unknown by faith unto

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:18.260
the churches of Judea which were in Christ.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:25.960
But they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.460
once he destroyed."

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.180
And so we find that Paul is preaching, he's being faithful.

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:34.780
Still again if you look at Acts 9, and we don't have time to develop all of it in Acts

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:39.100
9 this morning, but if you look there you find that originally when Paul was going to

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:43.500
go into Jerusalem that they were afraid of him.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:49.020
They weren't really interested in this man coming, but it was Barnabas that came and

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:56.260
was used of God to let the apostles and those there in Jerusalem know that God had done

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:59.660
this great work in his life and they received him.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:05.180
And we find that the Bible says that he preached boldly the name of Jesus.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:09.500
But I want you to notice verse 24, it's an interesting verse of Scripture.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:16.100
The Bible says this, and they glorified God in me.

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:18.860
You notice that it does not say that they glorified Paul.

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:21.140
That wouldn't be appropriate, amen?

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:24.900
They glorified God in me.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.580
And I'm mindful as I look at this verse of Scripture, really just a simple truth in verse

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:32.980
number 24, but I'm mindful of what Jesus said in Matthew 5.

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:37.620
Turn back if you will to Matthew chapter number 5, and as we look at this portion of Scripture,

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:42.860
a familiar portion of Scripture, we find that Jesus as he would begin preaching and teaching

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:47.300
there and he's giving all of the Beatitudes and he's going through this whole process

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:51.900
of giving instruction and he tells the disciples and those that are gathered in verse number

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.860
13, you're the salt of the earth.

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:58.900
Then in verse number 14 of Matthew chapter number 5, he makes this great declaration,

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:03.260
ye are the light of the world.

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:08.140
He says this, a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid, neither do men light a candle

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:12.700
and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.100
house.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:20.520
Notice what it says in verse 16, let your light so shine before men that they may see

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.760
your good works and do what?

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.720
Glorify your Father which is in heaven.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:32.480
Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:37.080
And then it says this, that they would glorify your Father which is in heaven.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:44.400
What does the Bible say there in Galatians 1 and verse 24, and they glorified God in

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.400
me.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:49.760
See, the Apostle Paul as he was seeking to fulfill the ministry that God had called him

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.639
to, we find that there was effectiveness in ministry because he understood that he was

00:32:53.639 --> 00:32:59.800
enlisted by God and enabled by God and he sought to do what God called him to do.

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:06.480
And as he was living in dependence upon the Lord, as he understood that he was incapable

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:11.600
of doing any of these things on his own, that it was the grace of God that enabled him and

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:16.559
that strengthened him, we find that the Bible says that people saw this.

00:33:16.559 --> 00:33:23.160
They saw that he's now preaching that same faith which once he destroyed him.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:28.720
They see the testimony of a changed life and the evidence of his conversion, the effectiveness

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.720
of his ministry.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.200
And what did it result in?

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.120
They glorified God.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.220
Isn't that what it's all about?

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:38.279
That God would be glorified.

00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:40.600
That God would be exalted.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.720
We understand that the Word of God teaches us even as John the Baptist would make the

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:49.520
great declaration in John chapter number three when they came to him.

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:54.919
And of course, John the Baptist, he had quite a following, a number of people that followed

00:33:54.919 --> 00:33:55.919
John the Baptist.

00:33:55.919 --> 00:33:59.160
But then Jesus, see, John the Baptist understood what his role was.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.880
He was a forerunner to Christ.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:05.400
And when he saw the Lord Jesus Christ, he said, behold, the Lamb of God which taketh

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.480
away the sin of the world.

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:11.760
We find that the Lord Jesus Christ in John chapter number three, if you look at all that's

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:15.520
taking place, a number of folks begin to follow the Lord and there's some that come

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.480
to John and say, hey, does this bother you?

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.840
And he's no, no, no, no, I understand my position.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:23.559
I understand who he is and he must increase.

00:34:23.559 --> 00:34:25.559
I must decrease.

00:34:25.559 --> 00:34:32.480
See, the reality is that as we look at this testimony in Galatians 1, in fact, you can

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:36.720
look at Paul giving his testimony in a variety of portions of Scripture.

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:41.559
And you can read of Paul standing before those that he would give an account and be judged

00:34:41.559 --> 00:34:46.000
by and he would stand and testify of what God did in his life and how God changed his

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.679
life.

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:52.440
As we look here at this passage, we not only see that evidence of his conversion, but we

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.080
see the effectiveness of his ministry.

00:34:55.080 --> 00:35:03.080
And we see that his ministry resulted in exactly what we need to desire, that God would be

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.080
glorified.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:10.119
See, it's not about somebody saying, I'm of Paul.

00:35:10.119 --> 00:35:11.119
I'm of Apollos.

00:35:11.119 --> 00:35:16.119
That's what was happening in Corinth and Paul said, no, no, no, let me help you understand.

00:35:16.119 --> 00:35:19.520
We're just the servants of God.

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:25.320
We're just the tools that God is using and it's that he would be glorified.

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:26.959
Who then is Paul?

00:35:26.959 --> 00:35:28.320
Who then is Apollos?

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.920
We're just ministers.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:37.200
Today, as we begin to think about the opportunities that God would give us and we begin to think

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:42.559
about the opportunities to serve him and we think about this effectiveness in ministry,

00:35:42.559 --> 00:35:45.920
we've asked the question already, is there evidence that would prove that you've been

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.080
born again?

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.640
Is there evidence in your life?

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:54.959
Could someone evaluate your life and say, there is evidence of conversion?

00:35:54.959 --> 00:35:56.839
That's not the same guy that I used to know.

00:35:56.839 --> 00:36:00.520
You ever meet anyone that you knew before you were saved and you just kind of bumped

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:07.119
into them years later and man, it's just, it's different.

00:36:07.119 --> 00:36:10.040
You just, you've been changed.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:14.320
You've been born again and all of a sudden, maybe they say, hey, let me get your number.

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:20.920
We need to connect and there's just not much of a connection there anymore.

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:24.080
And they can look at you and they say, man, something happened to that guy.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.880
Something happened to that lady.

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.920
They said of my dad, maybe they said of you.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.640
He got religion.

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:36.080
That's how, that's how the family members kind of termed it.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:42.559
And then they said something like this, it'll just kind of blow by.

00:36:42.559 --> 00:36:48.080
I'm thankful that it hasn't because he didn't just get religion.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.679
He got born again.

00:36:50.679 --> 00:36:52.480
See Paul didn't just get religion.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.279
Paul was a religious man.

00:36:54.279 --> 00:36:58.360
I mean, you look in Galatians 1 when he talks about what his testimony was, he says in time

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:02.720
past in the Jews religion, how that beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God and

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:03.720
wasted it.

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:10.839
He was a religious man just as Nicodemus was, but he was lost and on that road to Damascus,

00:37:10.839 --> 00:37:11.839
he was born again.

00:37:11.839 --> 00:37:14.119
His life was changed.

00:37:14.119 --> 00:37:15.440
The evidence is there.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:16.440
Think about the effectiveness.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.839
I want you to consider a couple of verses of scripture and closing this morning when

00:37:19.839 --> 00:37:25.000
we think about the effectiveness and we've already kind of given some idea as to why,

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.880
what was it that would cause Paul to be effective in ministry, that he understood that he was

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:33.640
enlisted by God and enabled by God, that he could not do anything on his own.

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.760
But I want you to turn over to second Corinthians chapter number five.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:43.080
We visited this passage just a few moments ago and we looked at verse number 17, speaking

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:46.760
of if any man be in Christ, he's a new creature and what great truth that is.

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:51.000
But I want you to draw your attention for just a moment here to verses 14 and 15 and

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:58.959
I want you to think about this effectiveness in ministry and the ministry in which we have

00:37:58.959 --> 00:38:00.480
been given.

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:04.679
We understand that through this portion of scripture in second Corinthians four and five,

00:38:04.679 --> 00:38:09.940
the Bible talks about the fact that we have been given the ministry of reconciliation.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:15.160
In verse 14, the Bible says this in second Corinthians five, for the love of Christ constraineth

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:19.360
us, it holds us together, it controls us.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.360
Why?

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:25.959
Because God must judge that if one died for all, then we're all dead and that he died

00:38:25.959 --> 00:38:36.119
for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died

00:38:36.119 --> 00:38:39.239
for them and rose again.

00:38:39.239 --> 00:38:43.559
Now as Paul would be used of God to write these words in verse number 15 of second Corinthians

00:38:43.559 --> 00:38:46.940
five, he was living those words.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:51.179
He didn't simply write these words and try to instruct the church in Corinth and the

00:38:51.179 --> 00:38:53.500
believers there to live for Christ.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:58.739
No, he himself was living for Christ as he said, listen, you have to acknowledge that

00:38:58.739 --> 00:39:06.419
he died for all, that they which live should not live for themselves, but we live unto

00:39:06.419 --> 00:39:08.859
him which died for them and rose again.

00:39:08.859 --> 00:39:13.700
I'm thankful for the privilege of living for Jesus.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:21.739
Paul would say this in Philippians one in verse number 21, for to me to live is Christ.

00:39:21.739 --> 00:39:26.820
For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.140
What a powerful verse of scripture.

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:33.580
Paul is acknowledging there in Philippians one in verse number 21 that as long as I have

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:39.979
life and breath, as long as I'm here upon this earth, I'm living for Christ.

00:39:39.979 --> 00:39:42.660
I'm living for Christ.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:45.099
To die is gain.

00:39:45.099 --> 00:39:46.099
Why?

00:39:46.099 --> 00:39:49.220
Why does Paul look at it as being gain to die?

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.220
Because he's going to be with Jesus.

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.220
Amen?

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:56.539
He had testified in second Corinthians to be absent from the body is to be present with

00:39:56.539 --> 00:39:57.539
the Lord.

00:39:57.539 --> 00:40:02.260
In fact, in that same passage in Philippians one, he tells the believers in Philippi how

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.260
that he was in the straight betwixt two.

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:12.260
What was it that caused Paul to be in this situation that he would term it as being in a straight betwixt two?

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:17.260
Well, he had a desire to depart to be with Christ, which was far better.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:21.260
And we understand this morning that if we're going to be effective in ministry,

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:24.260
I understand that your ministry and my ministry are different,

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:27.260
I understand that our ministries are different than Paul's ministry,

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.260
but we're all ministers of Jesus Christ.

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:34.260
We've all been given some aspect of ministry,

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.260
and if we're going to be effective in ministry,

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:39.260
we better die to self, and we better be surrendered to God,

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:44.260
and we better understand that without Him, we can do nothing.

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:48.260
And that He will give us the boldness and the courage

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:52.260
that we would pray as the disciples prayed there in Acts,

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.260
as they were facing persecution,

00:40:54.260 --> 00:41:00.260
that they would pray that God would give them boldness to speak thy name.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:03.260
We need boldness in this hour.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.260
Our mission's theme was, I am not ashamed.

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:09.260
And oh, how we need boldness.

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:14.260
Perhaps you've experienced, even in the days since our mission's conference ended,

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:18.260
as you would seek to be more engaged in reaching our Jerusalem,

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.260
as you'd be more engaged in trying to reach people with the gospel,

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:22.260
that there are a number of people that want you to be ashamed.

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:24.260
They don't want to hear what you have to say.

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:27.260
They say, God, would you give me boldness?

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:31.260
Would you help me to speak thy word boldly?

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:37.260
And as we think about Paul, and we think about the testimony of a changed life,

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:41.260
we see it in the life of Paul.

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:45.260
And this morning, as we would begin to think about our own lives,

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:49.260
you've been born again, you've trusted Christ as your Savior,

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:53.260
you too have a testimony of a changed life.

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:58.260
The things that would be referred to as in times past,

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:01.260
as Paul referred to here in Galatians 1,

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:06.260
they may be different than what Paul's times past were.

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.260
But you have a time past.

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:11.260
You have a time when you were not saved.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:14.260
And you compare time past to now,

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:19.260
and you see that difference, and you see what Christ has done in you.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:22.260
You say, let me share with you, let me understand,

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:25.260
and let me help you understand the testimony of a changed life,

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:28.260
what God can do.

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:31.260
He is able to do exceeding great things.

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:33.260
He's changed my life.

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:36.260
And I know for you this morning, he's changed your life.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:39.260
And I hope that as we would be encouraged this morning

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:41.260
by the testimony of a changed life,

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:45.260
that we would evaluate, how's the evidence?

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.260
If it was to be taken to the court of law,

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:52.260
you know, you need evidence when you go to the court of law.

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:57.260
If we were to go and be accused of being a Christian,

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:02.260
would there be enough evidence to get a guilty verdict?

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:05.260
Amen?

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:09.260
Remember Peter, when he denied the Lord?

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.260
You're one of his disciples.

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:14.260
No, I'm not.

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:18.260
But your speech.

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.260
And so he began to speak differently.

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:24.260
But I just wonder this morning,

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:26.260
if the accusation was made against us,

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:29.260
you're a Christian, you're a follower of Jesus Christ.

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.260
Is the evidence there?

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:33.260
I hope that we'd say yes.

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:35.260
The evidence is there, the evidence is clear.

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:38.260
I'm not suggesting the evidence is perfect, because we're not.

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:42.260
But the evidence of a changed life, the evidence of conversion.

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:44.260
And then the effectiveness in ministry.

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:48.260
Perhaps at times we get bogged down in ministry,

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.260
we get overwhelmed, we get to the point where we think,

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:54.260
man, I just can't seem to make a difference,

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:57.260
I can't seem to be effective.

00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:01.260
How much are we depending upon the Lord?

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:03.260
Because as we depend upon the Lord,

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:10.260
we just kind of come to a place of full surrender.

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.260
Say, God, use me.

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:15.260
I'm not comfortable in this situation.

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:17.260
This isn't my personality.

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:20.260
Or maybe you're the kind of person that's super outgoing,

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:22.260
and you think you have the personality to do those things.

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:26.260
And you're just going to depend upon your own self.

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:29.260
We say, no, I've got to depend upon God.

00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:33.260
And as I understand that it is God who enables me,

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:36.260
He allows me to be effective in ministry.

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:39.260
The Apostle Paul, the testimony of a changed life,

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:42.260
what a great opportunity we have to say,

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:44.260
let me tell you what God did for me.

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:47.260
Let me tell you how He changed my life.

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:50.260
Let me testify of the goodness of God,

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:54.260
so that others would glorify God in me,

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:57.260
as they did in Galatians 1 and verse number 24.

00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:58.260
Let's pray.

00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.260
Father, we love You.

00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:01.260
We thank You for loving us.

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:04.260
We thank You for the Word of God.

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:07.260
We thank You this morning for the testimony

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:10.260
of a changed life, the Apostle Paul.

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:13.260
We thank You, God, for the way in which

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:18.260
You have recorded in Your Word,

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.260
not only here in Galatians 1,

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:24.260
but in other portions of Scripture,

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:28.260
the testimony of the Apostle Paul, the change.

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.260
Lord, I pray that if there's one here

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.260
that's not sure of heaven,

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.260
they've never been born again,

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.260
they don't have 100% assurance

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:39.260
that heaven is their home.

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:43.260
Lord, I pray that today would be the day of their salvation.

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.260
They would understand that truth

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:51.260
when Jesus said you must be born again.

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:55.260
Lord, I pray for each believer this morning.

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:59.260
I pray that You would help us

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:01.260
to be effective in ministry.

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:04.260
I pray that the evidence of conversion would be there.

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:07.260
And Lord, help us to be effective in ministry

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:09.260
as we seek to serve You,

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:12.260
as we seek to do Your work

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:14.260
that You've called us to do.

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:17.260
Help us to be dependent upon You.

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:19.260
I pray, God, that You would work,

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:22.260
move in ways that only You can move.

00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:26.260
I pray that You alone would be glorified

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.260
during this time of invitation.

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.260
We'll thank You for the work that You'll do.

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:32.260
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:33.260
Would you stand with me?

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.260
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:38.260
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:40.260
And as she does, we have an opportunity

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:41.260
to respond to the Lord.

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:43.260
Maybe you want to come to this old-fashioned altar.

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:45.260
Maybe you want to make your pew an altar.

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:47.260
But do business with the Lord.

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:48.260
Let God have His way.

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:51.260
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
