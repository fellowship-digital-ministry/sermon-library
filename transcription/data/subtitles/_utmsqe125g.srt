1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
Second Corinthians chapter number five,

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,779
Second Corinthians chapter number five,

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:05,800
and I'll let you know that we're going to,

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,560
that's the text that I'll be preaching from this morning,

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,439
but there's about five or six other portions of Scripture

6
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:12,479
that I'm going to read

7
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:15,439
before we get to Second Corinthians chapter number five,

8
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:17,479
and so you might wanna stick a bookmarker there

9
00:00:17,479 --> 00:00:19,200
at Second Corinthians five,

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,799
and then get your fingers ready

11
00:00:20,799 --> 00:00:23,920
to be able to look at a few other portions of Scripture

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,479
by way of introduction this morning.

13
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:29,360
I am thankful that we serve a great God,

14
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,000
and I'm thankful that He has revealed to us

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,639
within the pages of His precious word, His greatness,

16
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:39,000
and though we have the opportunity,

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,759
and we can rightly say this morning

18
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,419
that we know that the Lord is great,

19
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,639
we can make that statement based upon the revelation

20
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:49,680
that God has given us in His word,

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,279
and we would be in agreement

22
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:54,520
with a number of other Bible characters.

23
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,400
David in the Psalms plainly says,

24
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:00,360
I know that the Lord is great.

25
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,779
There are others that have testified

26
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:04,199
throughout the pages of Scripture

27
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,199
of being aware of and convinced of the greatness of God,

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,760
and we can make that statement this morning,

29
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,360
and the reality is that as we make the statement

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,760
that we know the Lord is great,

31
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,360
at the same time, we must acknowledge

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,599
another portion of Scripture where the psalmist says

33
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:26,639
that His greatness, speaking of the Lord, is unsearchable,

34
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:29,559
and though I can make the statement this morning,

35
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:31,400
and you can make the statement this morning

36
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,720
that our God is great, we cannot fully comprehend

37
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,559
just how great our God is,

38
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:41,959
and as great as He is in your mind this morning,

39
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:45,559
I promise you on the authority of God's word

40
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:49,199
that He is greater than what you can even comprehend,

41
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:52,800
and that's a wonderful promise and truth of God's word.

42
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,000
There are some today that say,

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,319
well, I just wanna figure all these things out about God.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,360
Well, if God was like you and God was like me,

45
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,319
He wouldn't be God, and the reality is

46
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,599
that He transcends us, His ways are not our ways,

47
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,480
His thoughts are not our thoughts,

48
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,320
and we serve a great God.

49
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,039
Here's what's amazing to me,

50
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,639
that that great God, Jehovah God,

51
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,320
has made Himself known to us.

52
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,119
That's absolutely amazing.

53
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:22,039
The reality is that as we look at His word

54
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:24,000
and He's revealed to us His greatness,

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,119
we've had the opportunity throughout the year,

56
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:29,199
this year in 2023,

57
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,960
to look at a number of portions of scripture

58
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,559
that would reveal to us God's greatness.

59
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:36,720
In fact, over the past few weeks,

60
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,520
we've had the opportunity to, as I've termed it,

61
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,440
to discover God's greatness

62
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,440
as it's revealed to us through His plan.

63
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,360
I'm thankful that God has a plan,

64
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,000
and the very first week we dealt with the fact

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
that God, His greatness is known to us,

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,759
is revealed to us as we examine the plan,

67
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,479
God's plan of redemption.

68
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,559
I'm so thankful that God, even though He knew

69
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:04,440
as He created man that man would sin,

70
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,839
but God, before the foundation of the world,

71
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:11,360
He developed a plan by which man could be reconciled,

72
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,000
could be redeemed.

73
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,600
We find that the Bible tells us that redemption

74
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,679
is only through the blood of Jesus Christ.

75
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:20,520
There's just one way to be redeemed,

76
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,240
to be reconciled to God,

77
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,240
and it's through the Lord Jesus Christ.

78
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,720
And we understand, as we dealt with it,

79
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,759
that the enemy, he sought to do everything

80
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,039
within his power to thwart the plan of God.

81
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,039
But I'm thankful to report to you this morning

82
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,119
that that plan that was developed

83
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:39,600
before the foundation of the world was executed

84
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,080
when the Lord Jesus Christ went to a cruel cross

85
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,039
and He was buried in a borrowed tomb

86
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:47,119
and He rose conquering sin, death, and the grave,

87
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:50,479
and redemption's plan, as He said on the cross,

88
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,559
it is finished, the plan of redemption is made available.

89
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:56,160
I would say this morning that many of us,

90
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,240
if not most or all of us this morning

91
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,520
that are gathered together could stand

92
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,460
and say, I've been redeemed.

93
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,820
Aren't you thankful for God's plan of redemption?

94
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,279
As it's been revealed to us through the pages of scripture,

95
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:10,440
it reveals to us how great He is.

96
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,720
Then in our second week, as we spoke about the plan of God,

97
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,119
we said this, that God has a plan of redemption

98
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:20,119
and that plan of redemption is to redeem all mankind

99
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,880
for all times.

100
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,000
Now we understand that not all men will be saved,

101
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,519
but it's God's heart that all men would be saved.

102
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,839
The Bible says that He's not willing that any should perish

103
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:31,000
but that all should come to repentance.

104
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,760
After we're saved, the Bible says this,

105
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,920
we, those that have been redeemed,

106
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,519
those that have been born again, we are His workmanship.

107
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:44,239
And we said this, that God's plan of redemption

108
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:47,320
is that we'd be saved, that we'd have a home in heaven,

109
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,600
but after we've been saved,

110
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,679
God has a plan for each of us as individuals.

111
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,679
And what a great God that we serve,

112
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:56,399
that He has an individual plan for every one

113
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,279
of His children.

114
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:02,459
And as we consider the plan that God has for us

115
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:05,140
as individuals, as His children,

116
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,320
that He equips us to be able to do,

117
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,480
to fulfill the plan that He has for our lives.

118
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,200
And then as we do what He's called us and equipped us to do,

119
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,440
He will reward us for doing it.

120
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,079
And ultimately, as each of us fulfill the role,

121
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:24,040
the plan that God has for us individually,

122
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,119
we find that ultimately it fulfills His master plan.

123
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,519
It's amazing.

124
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,079
It's absolutely phenomenal.

125
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,399
And when you understand and you see in the pages

126
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:37,040
of Scripture, these truths, it helps us again

127
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,079
to see how great our God truly is.

128
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:44,200
This morning, I'm thankful that though,

129
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,279
as we look at the plan of redemption

130
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,640
and we understand the plan that God has for us here

131
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,600
upon this earth, that we are His workmanship,

132
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,679
I'm thankful that God's plan for me,

133
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:57,200
that God's plan for you is an eternal plan.

134
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,019
It does not end simply with this life here upon this earth.

135
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:04,760
I'm thankful that we're pilgrims and we're strangers,

136
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,619
that we're sojourners, if you will,

137
00:06:06,619 --> 00:06:08,799
that this world, as the songwriter said,

138
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:10,440
this world is not my home.

139
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,359
I'm just a passing through.

140
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:17,160
And I'm so thankful that this world is not the end of all.

141
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,040
Wouldn't that be a sad thing if this world

142
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,500
was all that we had, but we understand this morning

143
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,200
that God's plan for His children,

144
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,359
God's plan is an eternal plan.

145
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:30,519
We sing songs about seeing God face to face.

146
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:33,559
Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful truth that is.

147
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,679
I was thinking this morning as I was praying

148
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:37,480
here in the sanctuary, early this morning,

149
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,640
I was praying for the services and various other things.

150
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,679
As I was praying, I was reminded as I was just meditating

151
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:45,640
upon what I would be preaching this morning,

152
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,679
I was reminded of some songs that we sing.

153
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:51,079
I think about that song, It Is Well With My Soul,

154
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,239
and the fourth verse says,

155
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:57,140
and Lord, when my faith shall be sight.

156
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,320
And we're gonna see Him face to face.

157
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,679
And what a blessing.

158
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:02,959
And I was in here this morning,

159
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,980
Brother Pierre, I was singing all by myself

160
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,679
and echoing off these walls and there's no piano

161
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:08,959
and nobody to mess me up.

162
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,640
It just sounded good, amen.

163
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,299
And I was singing a few songs this morning,

164
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,160
just singing to the Lord.

165
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,000
Why?

166
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,079
Because one day my faith will be made sight.

167
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,880
I will see Him face to face.

168
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,480
And I'm thankful that God's plan is an eternal plan.

169
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,079
This morning, as we consider the greatness of God

170
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,920
revealed to us through His plan,

171
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,239
I would say this in 2 Corinthians chapter five,

172
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:31,600
I'll read one verse of scripture

173
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,279
and then I'm gonna read a number of other portions

174
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,480
as we get into the text.

175
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,279
The Bible says this in verse number eight,

176
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,739
we are confident, I say, and willing,

177
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:43,119
rather to be absent from the body

178
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:45,799
and to be present with the Lord.

179
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,040
I've titled the message this morning,

180
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,480
present with the Lord.

181
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,160
As believers this morning,

182
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,760
the thought of eternity is one that should bring great joy

183
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,359
to each of our hearts.

184
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:57,760
The thought, the truth,

185
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,920
the reality of eternity this morning

186
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,760
should cause us to have an attitude of expectation

187
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,779
and anticipation that one day

188
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:09,220
I'll see my Savior face to face.

189
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,579
As we consider the truth of God's word

190
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:14,140
and the fact that people,

191
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,760
the people of God have had this understanding

192
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,440
with regard to eternity.

193
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,380
I wanna remind you of some portions of scripture.

194
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,299
Turn back to the book of Psalms, if you will.

195
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:23,700
In Psalm chapter 23,

196
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,959
a Psalm that we're very familiar with,

197
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:28,440
where the Bible speaks about the Lord is my shepherd.

198
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,359
I just wanna call your attention to verse number six,

199
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:34,080
where the Psalmist David,

200
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,479
we think about this truth of eternity

201
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,880
and notice what he says in verse number six.

202
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,640
Again, it's a portion of scripture

203
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
that we're very familiar with.

204
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,000
Many of us have memorized Psalm 23.

205
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,280
The Bible says in verse number six,

206
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,080
"'Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me

207
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,520
"'all the days of my life.'"

208
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,159
But I'm thankful there's not a period there.

209
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,080
Amen?

210
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,440
When I take my final breath,

211
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,679
when you take your final breath,

212
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,919
that's not the end.

213
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,880
It's not the end.

214
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,380
He continues and says,

215
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:07,380
"'And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.'"

216
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:08,960
Isn't that precious?

217
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,359
Psalm 73, if you will,

218
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:14,380
just turn over a few pages there in your Bible to Psalm 73.

219
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,760
Look at verse number 22

220
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,679
and we'll read down through the end of the chapter here

221
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,900
in Psalm 73.

222
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,159
And I want you to see here,

223
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,000
the Psalmist Asaph is the one

224
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,159
that this particular Psalm is ascribed to.

225
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,239
It's a Psalm of Asaph.

226
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:28,719
Notice in verse 22,

227
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:29,559
the Bible says this,

228
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:32,080
"'So foolish was I and ignorant.

229
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,520
"'I was a beast before thee.'"

230
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,859
But then notice in verse 23,

231
00:09:34,859 --> 00:09:38,359
"'Nevertheless, I am continually with thee.

232
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:41,440
"'Thou hast holden me by my right hand.

233
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,559
"'Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel.'"

234
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,320
Aren't you thankful for God's guidance and his leadership?

235
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,020
But notice the end of verse number 24,

236
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,359
"'And afterward receive me to glory.'"

237
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:56,780
And I'm thankful that as we live upon this earth,

238
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,440
as pilgrims and strangers,

239
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,559
this world is not my home.

240
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,159
I'm just passing through that God guides me

241
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:06,059
with his counsel, that he's holding me

242
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:08,219
by his right hand in verse 23.

243
00:10:08,219 --> 00:10:11,399
But I'm thankful that afterward he'll receive me to glory.

244
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,839
Verse 25 says, whom have I in heaven but thee?

245
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,399
And there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.

246
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,319
My flesh and my heart faileth,

247
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:24,959
but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.

248
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,099
For lo, they that are far from thee shall perish.

249
00:10:28,099 --> 00:10:31,819
Thou hast destroyed all them that go a-whoring from thee,

250
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:33,539
but it is good for me, notice what it says,

251
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:36,639
it is good for me to draw near to God.

252
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,419
I've put my trust in the Lord God

253
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:42,139
that I may declare all thy works.

254
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:44,019
John 14 is a portion of scripture

255
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,659
that we're very familiar with.

256
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:48,539
The Lord Jesus Christ is encouraging his disciples

257
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:52,739
after he's instructed them and revealed to them

258
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:56,539
that he is going to soon go to that cross of Calvary.

259
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:59,819
And we find that as Jesus is speaking to his disciples,

260
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:03,679
it's obvious through the tenor and all that takes place

261
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,699
that the disciples are discouraged as to what they've heard

262
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:07,939
and what they've understood.

263
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:11,099
And Jesus says, let not your heart be troubled.

264
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:13,540
Let not your heart be troubled.

265
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,819
You believe in God, believe also in me.

266
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:17,699
In my Father's house are many mansions.

267
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:19,419
If it were not so, I would have told you.

268
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:20,819
He then says this in verse two,

269
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:23,059
I go to prepare a place for you.

270
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:24,779
And if I go and prepare a place for you,

271
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,860
I will come again and receive you unto myself.

272
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,540
Notice where he says that where I am,

273
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,220
there ye may be also.

274
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,339
You know what makes heaven heaven?

275
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,599
The fact that our Savior's there.

276
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,619
People sometimes talk about heaven and they say,

277
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:41,459
talk to me about heaven, tell me about heaven.

278
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:43,059
And I wanna hear about the streets of gold

279
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:44,819
and I wanna hear about the,

280
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:47,419
Jesus is what makes heaven heaven.

281
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:49,139
The Lord is there.

282
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:53,419
And Jesus says that where I am, there ye may be also.

283
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:54,659
What a wonderful truth.

284
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:57,139
First Thessalonians chapter four.

285
00:11:57,139 --> 00:11:58,959
We find again a portion of scripture

286
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,619
that we're very familiar with.

287
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,339
In First Thessalonians four,

288
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:06,419
speaking about the soon return of the Lord Jesus Christ,

289
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:09,300
the raptures, we refer to it in verse 13 of chapter four.

290
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,539
The Bible says, but I would not have you

291
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:13,380
to be ignorant, brethren,

292
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,779
concerning them which are asleep,

293
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,580
that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope.

294
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,699
For we believe that Jesus died and rose again,

295
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,860
even so them also which sleep in Jesus

296
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,660
will God bring with him.

297
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,380
For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord,

298
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,779
that we which are alive and remain

299
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:30,739
unto the coming of the Lord

300
00:12:30,739 --> 00:12:33,300
shall not prevent them which are asleep.

301
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,339
I'm thankful this isn't just Paul's idea.

302
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,179
He says this is by the word of the Lord.

303
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:39,339
He said in verse 13, I don't want you to be ignorant.

304
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:40,300
I want you to be informed.

305
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,339
I want you to understand some things.

306
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:45,059
He says in verse 16, for the Lord himself

307
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:47,899
shall descend from heaven with a shout,

308
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:49,300
with the voice of the archangel,

309
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,139
with the trump of God,

310
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:52,279
and the dead in Christ shall rise first.

311
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:55,300
I'm thankful the Lord himself is coming for us, amen.

312
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,860
He's not sending an angel.

313
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,300
He's coming himself.

314
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,819
He said that where I am, there ye may be also.

315
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:03,739
In verse 16, it tells us that he's coming himself.

316
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:06,459
Verse 17, then we which are alive and remain

317
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:08,500
shall be caught up together with them in the clouds

318
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,259
to meet the Lord in the air, notice,

319
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:15,500
and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

320
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,580
Wherefore, comfort one another with these words.

321
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:19,940
Understand this is God's plan.

322
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,319
This is God's plan.

323
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:22,220
This is not my plan.

324
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,179
This is not Paul's plan.

325
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:26,739
This is not the plan of David or Peter or some other.

326
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,119
This is the plan of God,

327
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:31,940
and he's revealed in the pages of his precious book,

328
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,539
the Bible, he's revealed to us the plan that he has,

329
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:37,020
and it's an eternal plan.

330
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,459
Notice with me in Revelation chapter 21.

331
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,099
We'll reference in just a few moments

332
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:45,179
as we get through the message,

333
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:47,779
the portion of Scripture there in 2 Peter.

334
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:49,979
We could read the entirety of the chapter,

335
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:50,899
the third chapter.

336
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:52,539
We'll reference a portion of that

337
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:53,639
here in just a few moments,

338
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,739
but I wanna draw your attention to Revelation 21,

339
00:13:56,739 --> 00:13:58,819
and then we'll get back to 2 Corinthians 5,

340
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:01,539
dig into the passage of Scripture this morning.

341
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:03,259
Notice with me in Revelation 21.

342
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,099
The Bible says this,

343
00:14:04,099 --> 00:14:06,819
and I saw a new heaven and a new earth.

344
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:09,020
For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away,

345
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,259
and there was no more seeing.

346
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:13,919
And I, John, saw the holy city, new Jerusalem,

347
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,759
coming down from God out of heaven,

348
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,160
prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.

349
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,720
And I heard a great voice out of heaven,

350
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,279
saying, behold, the tabernacle of God is with men,

351
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:26,040
and he will dwell with them,

352
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,239
and they shall be his people,

353
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:31,160
and God himself shall be with them and be their God.

354
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,459
Listen, that's our future.

355
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,000
That's the reality.

356
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,119
Sometimes we live in this earth.

357
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:38,160
Turn back over to 2 Corinthians 5.

358
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,600
Sometimes we live in this earth and this world,

359
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,119
and we can get so caught up with the things of this world.

360
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:45,739
We can get sideways sometimes

361
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:47,220
with what's going on in our world,

362
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,720
and we can get distracted,

363
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,839
and we can get discouraged.

364
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:54,119
And I'd say this, that we can get depressed.

365
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,000
I love what the songwriter said.

366
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,519
I'm not discouraged.

367
00:14:58,519 --> 00:14:59,359
Why?

368
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:01,040
I'm heaven-bound.

369
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,899
And really, if we keep that perspective,

370
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,799
if we have that eternal perspective,

371
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:07,540
if we understand this morning,

372
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,760
as we've looked at all of these portions of Scripture,

373
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,139
and there are many more that we could go to this morning,

374
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:15,679
that we could understand that God's plan is given to us,

375
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,079
and it reveals to us how great he is,

376
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,119
that he has this plan,

377
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:24,239
and for his children to be with him forever,

378
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:25,359
that we'll dwell with him,

379
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,559
we'll be with him,

380
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,279
to be present with the Lord.

381
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,320
And as we have that understanding,

382
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,579
and as we have that perspective of the truth of eternity,

383
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,839
then this world, the things of this world,

384
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,919
will grow strangely dim, as the songwriter said,

385
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:43,320
and it will prevent us from getting discouraged

386
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,139
and defeated.

387
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:44,980
Why?

388
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,919
Because it's just a little while that we're here.

389
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:49,119
The Bible talks about,

390
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:52,040
as Peter is speaking to some people that are suffering,

391
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,760
that are dealing with great adversity,

392
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,359
and trial, and difficulty.

393
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:58,559
He says, after that you've suffered a little while.

394
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,399
And the reality is that no one knows

395
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,200
how long a little while is,

396
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,639
but what we do know is it's not forever.

397
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,600
You say, well, my little while's been too long.

398
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:09,200
Listen, it's not forever,

399
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,519
and God has a plan, and God has a purpose,

400
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,419
and God always does what's right.

401
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:17,600
And listen, we have the truth and the hope of eternity,

402
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,260
and we can rejoice in that this morning.

403
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,480
In 2 Corinthians chapter number five,

404
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,940
if you're taking notes,

405
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,399
number one, I want you to notice with me

406
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,299
what God has revealed to his people.

407
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:35,119
Notice with me, as we look at this portion of scripture,

408
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,040
what God has revealed to his people.

409
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,200
In fact, as we've looked at

410
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,040
all of those other portions of scripture,

411
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,000
we find that those portions of scripture support,

412
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,679
as we look here at this thought

413
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,480
of what God has revealed to us,

414
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,639
I'm so thankful for God's revelation.

415
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:54,079
In verse number one, notice how Paul begins.

416
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,480
Notice the first three words, for we know.

417
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,919
For we know.

418
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:00,220
Now, there's some things that you know.

419
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,839
There's some things that you think you know

420
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,519
that you don't really know.

421
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,519
You ever have somebody say,

422
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,239
I mean, you know they're wrong, but they're just,

423
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:10,919
and then they have to admit that they didn't know.

424
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,320
But listen, Paul says, for we know.

425
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,119
Paul didn't say, I think.

426
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,440
He didn't say, I hope.

427
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,079
He didn't say, this is my, no, no, no.

428
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,480
He says, I know.

429
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,399
This morning, God has revealed some things to us

430
00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:25,639
as his people that he wants us to know,

431
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:27,559
that he wants us to be assured of,

432
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:30,160
that he wants us to have confidences in.

433
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,480
He says this, for we know.

434
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,359
That if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved,

435
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,239
you know what he's talking about?

436
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:38,079
When we die.

437
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:40,720
Peter says it this way.

438
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,859
He says that I must shortly put off this, my tabernacle.

439
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:48,859
The Bible says that Jesus, the word, was made flesh

440
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,480
and dwelt among us.

441
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,959
Literally, it means that he tabernacled amongst us.

442
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:57,160
It's very interesting when you tie that together

443
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,119
with the Old Testament and the tabernacle

444
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,119
and the holy of holies and understanding the presence of God

445
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:03,480
and so on and so forth.

446
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,880
And Jesus, God in flesh, he came and he lived,

447
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,639
he dwelt, he tabernacled amongst us.

448
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:12,760
And so here, Paul is saying that if our earthly house

449
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,079
of this tabernacle were dissolved,

450
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:17,760
when you die, when I die, notice what he says.

451
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,760
We have a building of God, a house not made with hands,

452
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,380
eternal in the heavens.

453
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,399
Listen, you know what he says in 1 Corinthians 15?

454
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,380
This mortal shall put off, right?

455
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,299
This mortal shall become immortal, right?

456
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:36,979
This corruption shall become incorruption.

457
00:18:36,979 --> 00:18:38,739
And we look at that and we understand, listen,

458
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:40,299
there's going to be a change.

459
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:43,140
The Bible says that in a moment, a twinkling of an eye,

460
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,219
that we shall be changed.

461
00:18:46,219 --> 00:18:49,380
We find here that he says, for in this we groan,

462
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,260
earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house,

463
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,380
which is from heaven.

464
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:57,059
If so be that being clothed, we shall not be found naked.

465
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:01,179
Verse four, for we that are in this tabernacle do groan,

466
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,979
being burdened.

467
00:19:02,979 --> 00:19:03,820
Why?

468
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,799
Not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon.

469
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,340
Notice what he says, that mortality might be swallowed up

470
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,940
of, notice what it says, life.

471
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,140
It doesn't say of death.

472
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,140
See, the idea, most people have this idea that, well, death.

473
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,779
No, no, he says that mortality might be swallowed up

474
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:22,960
of life.

475
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,799
What is he referring to?

476
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,299
That eternal life.

477
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:28,140
The fact that we're going to be, if you're saved,

478
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,140
this morning, if you've trusted Christ as your savior,

479
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,059
that you'll forever be with the Lord.

480
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:35,580
Now, verse five, he that hath wrought us for the self,

481
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,719
same thing as God, who also hath given unto us

482
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,940
the earnest of the spirit.

483
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,059
Therefore, we are always confident,

484
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:46,619
knowing that whilst we are at home in the body,

485
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,059
we are absent from the Lord.

486
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:51,080
For we walk by faith, not by sight.

487
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,460
We are confident, I say, and willing,

488
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,779
rather to be absent from the body

489
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:55,059
than to be present with the Lord.

490
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:57,419
Wherefore, we labor, that whether present or absent,

491
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:59,619
we may be accepted of him.

492
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:01,020
Notice with me in verse.

493
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,020
He says, for we know, what is it that we know?

494
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,500
We know that we have a building of God.

495
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,380
We know that this house, this building of God

496
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,820
and house that's not made with hands,

497
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,900
that's eternal in the heavens.

498
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,700
Notice what he says in verse number six.

499
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,120
Therefore, we are always, notice, confident,

500
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,740
knowing that whilst we're at home in the body,

501
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,980
we're absent from the Lord.

502
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,500
But then he says again in verse number eight,

503
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,920
we are confident, I say, and willing rather

504
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,460
to be absent from the body and to be present

505
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,300
with the Lord.

506
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,640
It's interesting in just a few verses of scripture

507
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,080
in this fifth chapter of the book of 2 Corinthians

508
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,160
that Paul makes it known on three occasions

509
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,600
within nine verses, the confidence, the assurance

510
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,520
that we are to have as the people of God.

511
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,700
This morning, I hope that you have that confidence.

512
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,200
That as we understand what God has revealed to his people,

513
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,800
that we can understand as we look here

514
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,360
at this portion of scripture and we say,

515
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,700
we know, we are confident.

516
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,000
There are some that live their lives

517
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,400
and all of the days, in fact, many of us

518
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,660
lived this way as well.

519
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,100
Before we came to Christ, we lived fearing death.

520
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,560
Why did we fear death?

521
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,620
Honestly, I'll speak for myself this morning.

522
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,540
I didn't know what was gonna happen when I died.

523
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,760
I was afraid of dying.

524
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,800
In fact, I remember coming to the realization

525
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,100
as I heard the gospel and had not yet received

526
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,820
the Lord Jesus Christ as my personal savior,

527
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:30,280
I was convinced, I was absolutely assured and confident

528
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,040
that because I had not accepted the Lord Jesus Christ

529
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,720
as my savior, that if I were to die,

530
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,000
I'd spend eternity in the lake of fire.

531
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,260
Why, because that's the truth of God's word.

532
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,560
You say, well, that's cruel.

533
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,520
No, that's what we deserve.

534
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,760
Why, because I'm guilty and you're guilty and God is just.

535
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,660
We've broken his law and that's the just punishment,

536
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,980
but thank God for grace and mercy.

537
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,980
God doesn't give me what I deserve.

538
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,440
He offers me forgiveness, which I do not deserve.

539
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,160
He offers me redemption.

540
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,840
And in that moment, I remember driving that road,

541
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,960
I can see it right now in my mind's eye,

542
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,480
where I was fearful of death.

543
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,200
I knew, why, because I'd not yet accepted Christ

544
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,140
as my savior.

545
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,200
There was a measure of pride in my life

546
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,760
on why I had not received the Lord Jesus Christ

547
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,600
as my savior.

548
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,260
At that point in my life, and I was prideful,

549
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,020
and yet God was, the Holy Spirit was so gracious

550
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,500
and convincing me.

551
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,860
The Bible says in John 16 that he convicts

552
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,100
and he convinces, what, of sin.

553
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,880
I knew I was a sinner.

554
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,880
Of Christ's righteousness, but also of judgment to come.

555
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,820
And here's what the Bible says about those

556
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,940
that had that fear of death.

557
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,020
There in Hebrews chapter two, you don't need to turn there,

558
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,280
but in verse number 14, it says,

559
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,680
for as much then as the children are partakers

560
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,360
of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise

561
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,520
took part of the same, that through death

562
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,280
he might destroy him that had the power of death,

563
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,120
that is, the devil, and deliver them

564
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,520
who through fear of death were all their lifetime

565
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,900
subject to bondage.

566
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,080
Listen, we know people today that fear death.

567
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,520
They're afraid of dying.

568
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,520
Why, because they do not know the Lord Jesus Christ

569
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,020
as their personal savior.

570
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,220
They don't know what's gonna happen when they die.

571
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,940
And here we find that Paul is speaking

572
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,420
to these believers in Corinth,

573
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,020
and for you and I this morning,

574
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,520
that as we understand what God has revealed to us,

575
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,820
if we've trusted Christ as our savior,

576
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,060
if we've been born again, we can have that same level

577
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,540
of confidence and we can say with assurance,

578
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,320
as he says in verse number eight,

579
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,780
we are confident, I say, and willing rather

580
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,800
to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord.

581
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,580
What a wonderful Bible truth.

582
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,500
Notice with me, he says in verse number five,

583
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,080
he says, now he that hath wrought us

584
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,500
for the selfsame thing as God,

585
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,200
notice what he says at the end of verse number five,

586
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,200
who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit.

587
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,360
Begin to look at that phrase there in verse number five,

588
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,480
and we understand the Holy Spirit.

589
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,900
If you turn to the book of Ephesians in chapter number one,

590
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,960
we'll look here at this truth that is given to us,

591
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,800
and you see the same word is used

592
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,040
in Ephesians chapter number one.

593
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,440
You speak about the earnest.

594
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,160
Maybe you've purchased a house,

595
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,040
or in the past at some point,

596
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,120
you put down some earnest money.

597
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,160
They'll use that phraseology,

598
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,820
and you find here that God has given us

599
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,160
the earnest of the spirit.

600
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm thankful that at the moment of salvation,

601
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,120
the Bible would teach us that the Holy Spirit of God

602
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,120
indwells us, that at the moment,

603
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,160
the very moment that you trust that Christ is your savior,

604
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,840
the Bible says that our bodies

605
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,200
are the temple of the Holy Ghost.

606
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,720
He's in us.

607
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,120
He indwells us, and here in Ephesians one,

608
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,720
notice in verse 13, the Bible says,

609
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,760
in whom we also trusted,

610
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,880
after that you heard the word of truth,

611
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,820
the gospel of your salvation,

612
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,700
in whom also after that you believed,

613
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,180
we were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise,

614
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,780
which is the earnest, notice what he says,

615
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,380
of our inheritance,

616
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,900
until the redemption of the purchased possession

617
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,380
under the praise of his glory.

618
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,540
Listen, we have an inheritance.

619
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,460
The Bible says it this way in the book of 1 Peter.

620
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,460
As we begin to understand this inheritance,

621
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,780
he says that it's incorruptible and it's undefiled.

622
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,820
It fades not away.

623
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:40,420
It's reserved in heaven for you.

624
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,580
In 1 Peter one, in verse number four.

625
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,420
And here we find that in 2 Corinthians five,

626
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:50,820
Paul says that we have received,

627
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:55,640
that God has given unto us the earnest of the spirit.

628
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,140
God's revealed some things to us this morning.

629
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,820
And as we understand the truth of God's word

630
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,500
and what he's revealed to us,

631
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,340
yes, it helps us to understand his greatness,

632
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,220
but it gives us confidence and perspective

633
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,900
in this life.

634
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,380
I remember before I got saved.

635
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,140
Some of you remember too before you got saved.

636
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,440
You remember what life was.

637
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,440
You know, sometimes we forget when we were lost.

638
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,320
Who did you live for?

639
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,940
You lived for yourself.

640
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,900
What were your ambitions?

641
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,740
Whatever you could get here on earth.

642
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,420
The bumper sticker of years gone by,

643
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:43,700
he who dies with the most toys wins.

644
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,740
Listen, that's an earthly perspective.

645
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,900
That's a temporal viewpoint.

646
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,020
That's an understanding of someone

647
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,060
that has no knowledge of eternity,

648
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,620
but God has revealed some things to you

649
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,340
and to me in the pages of this precious book.

650
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,340
And as he's revealed those things to us,

651
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,900
he says, I want you to understand that I have a plan.

652
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,580
And yes, the plan of redemption and how grateful

653
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,620
and it is for us to know that we're saved.

654
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,140
And then he says, after you're saved,

655
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:13,260
I have a plan for you to be my workmanship

656
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,780
that he does through us and he uses us

657
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,280
for his honor and for his glory

658
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,140
to bring to pass his master plan.

659
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,380
But he says, that's not where the plan ends.

660
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,180
You're going to be with me forever.

661
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,740
I'm so thankful that our God has revealed this to us

662
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,580
in the pages of this precious book.

663
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:37,100
This morning, as we notice what God has revealed to us

664
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,180
and what God wants us to know and to have that confidence,

665
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,500
I want you to consider second with me this morning,

666
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,300
notice how God's people should respond.

667
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,660
How is it that you, how is it that I should respond

668
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,140
to what God has revealed to us?

669
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,260
When we notice within the passage that's here,

670
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,000
2 Corinthians chapter number five,

671
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,260
we notice a couple of things.

672
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,940
Number one, in the response of God's people,

673
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,080
there should be a longing for heaven.

674
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,780
I call it this, an eternal perspective.

675
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,580
Notice in verses two through five,

676
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,900
notice this longing for heaven.

677
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,900
In verse number two, the Bible says this,

678
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,100
for in this we groan,

679
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:20,640
earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house,

680
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,140
which is from heaven.

681
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,680
Notice in verse number four, he uses the phraseology again,

682
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,140
for we that are in this tabernacle do groan,

683
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,980
being burdened, not for that we would be unclothed,

684
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,739
but clothed upon that mortality

685
00:28:34,739 --> 00:28:38,020
might be swallowed up of life.

686
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,619
You ever long for something?

687
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,660
I think about kids, and not that adults

688
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,500
don't long for something, but I think about kids,

689
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,900
you tell them you're gonna go on a trip, on a vacation.

690
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:55,179
You know, kids have a difficulty understanding time, right?

691
00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:56,720
Seriously, you think about some of these little kids,

692
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,500
you tell them that something's gonna happen in three months,

693
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,960
you might as well tell them it's 30 years,

694
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,940
they have no concept.

695
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,540
Honestly, they begin to count down,

696
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,020
maybe you get a calendar, kids,

697
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,500
sometimes they long for a trip, they long for Christmas.

698
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,980
Right, a lot of kids, I remember our kids,

699
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,500
they would have these little construction paper

700
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,980
chain link things, you ever do this as you're a kid?

701
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,820
And you would take one off each day, why?

702
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,660
You're counting down the days to Christmas.

703
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,320
Well, there's a longing, what is it?

704
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,940
There's an anticipation, right?

705
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,540
What are this morning, are we longing for heaven?

706
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,739
I'm not saying that we are in a place where we hate life,

707
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,960
I'm not saying that, but I'm just saying,

708
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,660
listen, this world is not my home.

709
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,300
Do we have that eternal perspective

710
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,080
that I'm longing for heaven?

711
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,660
That one day I'm gonna see my Savior face to face?

712
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:52,179
It's not that we hate life, it's not that we're looking

713
00:29:52,179 --> 00:29:54,700
for a fast way out of here or whatever it might be,

714
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:59,260
no, it's just that I'm looking for something far better.

715
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,619
Because this world's not.

716
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:08,819
my home. And sometimes you see those little kids that are longing for something, the anticipation

717
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:13,899
and the excitement and all that goes around with it and the joy of those children and

718
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:21,219
then the anticipated activity comes and oh man, what a day it is. Listen, one day you're

719
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:32,739
going to see God face to face. I wonder this morning, are we longing for heaven? Sometimes

720
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:40,339
if we're not careful, we can live upon the face of this earth as if this is our heaven.

721
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:50,419
This is not our heaven. But if we're not careful, we can get distracted. We can get influenced.

722
00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:55,299
We can begin to live life with not having that eternal perspective, that longing for

723
00:30:55,299 --> 00:31:02,499
heaven. He says that we groan in verse two and in verse number four. I think about what

724
00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:06,499
Paul says, turn over to the book of Philippians if you will, and notice as Paul is writing

725
00:31:06,499 --> 00:31:11,659
to these believers in Philippi, he had the opportunity to have great influence in them

726
00:31:11,659 --> 00:31:15,939
and instruct them in the ways of the Lord and to take the gospel there to Philippi.

727
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:20,539
And we find that Paul is writing to them and he's speaking about his current circumstances

728
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:29,819
and his circumstances are dim. They're challenging. He's writing from prison and yet he has joy.

729
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:34,499
And though he's writing from prison and he understands his circumstances, he says I want

730
00:31:34,499 --> 00:31:41,859
you to know that God is at work. And I want you to understand that these things that have

731
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:47,259
happened to me have happened. They've fallen rather into the furtherance of the gospel.

732
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:52,059
And Paul had this eternal perspective. And as Paul is writing in the first chapter to

733
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:56,899
these believers, he says to them in verse 21, for to me to live is Christ and to die

734
00:31:56,899 --> 00:32:01,699
is gain. Notice what he says in verse 22, but if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit

735
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:06,699
of my labor, yet what I shall choose I won't not. Then notice in verse 23, for I am in

736
00:32:06,699 --> 00:32:15,940
a straight betwixt two. What was it that's causing this circumstance or this situation

737
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:20,339
in Paul's life that he would describe it as being in a straight betwixt two? You've heard

738
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:23,299
somebody say I'm going to between a rock and a hard place. I used to hear that all the

739
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:27,379
time when I was a kid, that people would use that phraseology. And here Paul says I'm in

740
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:34,419
a straight betwixt two. Notice what he says, having a desire to depart. To depart where?

741
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:39,699
To depart the prison? To depart the, no, no, no, to depart, notice what he says, and

742
00:32:39,699 --> 00:32:45,059
to be with Christ, which is far better. Again, it's not so much that we're walking around

743
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:49,399
with this death wish that we hate life, but it's understanding, listen, I'm longing to

744
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:54,699
be with my Savior. I'm longing to be with my Savior. But notice what Paul says, and

745
00:32:54,699 --> 00:32:58,739
this is what balances it all out. He says in verse number 23 that he's in this straight

746
00:32:58,739 --> 00:33:03,019
betwixt two, but in verse 24 he says nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for

747
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:07,220
you. What's he saying? He's saying, listen, I understand that God has a plan for my life.

748
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,500
I understand that God is going to use me all the days of my life, and when God is done

749
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:17,580
with me, when God's plan for my life is finished, then I'm going to go be with Him. It's a wonderful

750
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:23,339
thing. You know how I know that God has a plan for you and for me? Because we're not

751
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:28,819
with Him yet. You know what God's going to do when He's done with us? He's going to take

752
00:33:28,819 --> 00:33:33,899
us up to heaven. Remember what we read in Psalm 73? He gives us counsel all the days

753
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:39,299
of our lives, and then He receives us to glory. It's wonderful. It's amazing. And He has a

754
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:42,259
plan for you. If you're living and breathing, you've trusted Christ as your Savior this

755
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:47,619
morning. God has a plan for you. If you're here this morning, you've never trusted Christ

756
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:52,860
as your Savior. God's plan for you is that you'd be saved. He's not willing that any

757
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:58,220
should perish, but that all should come to repentance. He says that His will is that

758
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:05,500
all men would be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth. This morning, we find that this

759
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:10,899
impact upon the believers, as Paul is writing to these folks there in the city of Corinth

760
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:15,779
in 2 Corinthians 5, and we notice how God's people should respond to that which God has

761
00:34:15,779 --> 00:34:21,380
revealed to us, there should be a longing for heaven. A longing for heaven. You know

762
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,820
what happens when we have a longing for heaven? I mentioned already that the things of this

763
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:31,179
world grow strangely dim. We kind of hold on loosely to things of this earth. They don't

764
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:38,899
matter as much. Why? Because I have a longing for heaven. This world is not my home. This

765
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:43,380
morning, we find not only a longing for heaven as we look at our text of Scripture, but I

766
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:49,220
believe also, number two, a living in light of eternity. I have a longing for heaven,

767
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:54,459
an eternal perspective, but I better live in light of eternity. I better live a life

768
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:59,419
that is pleasing to the Lord. Notice again in verse number eight, Paul says, we are confident,

769
00:34:59,419 --> 00:35:04,899
I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord.

770
00:35:04,899 --> 00:35:10,820
Then notice verse number nine, wherefore we labor that whether present or absent, notice

771
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:17,979
this phrase, we may be accepted of him. We find that he then immediately, we won't take

772
00:35:17,979 --> 00:35:22,419
the time this morning, but immediately in verses 10 and following, he begins dealing

773
00:35:22,419 --> 00:35:27,739
with the fact that we're going to appear before the Lord Jesus Christ. If you're saved

774
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:32,339
this morning, he's speaking in verse number 10 about the bema seat or the judgment seat

775
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:38,380
of Christ. And he says in verse number nine that, that, that we have this understanding.

776
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:43,940
I have this confidence. I'm, I'm aware of the truth because God has revealed it to me

777
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:50,059
that I'm going to be absent from the body and present with the Lord, but I better labor

778
00:35:50,059 --> 00:35:54,699
so that whether I'm present or absent, I would be accepted of him. The last two Sunday

779
00:35:54,699 --> 00:36:01,459
evenings we've dealt with the subject matter of the example of Enoch. He had this testimony.

780
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:07,739
He walked with God. What did he do? He had a testimony that says he pleased the Lord.

781
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:15,299
He pleased the Lord. Last week we spoke about those that, that turned away and went no longer

782
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:21,459
with Jesus, but how we need to set our attention, our, our, our focus, our eyes upon the Lord

783
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:25,139
Jesus Christ and walk with him all the days of our lives that we might be pleasing in

784
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:29,139
his sight. And here, as Paul would say, that we might be accepted of him, that we might

785
00:36:29,139 --> 00:36:36,299
be pleasing in his sight. Listen, I'm thankful that heaven is my home. Listen, your eternity

786
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:43,540
with it being the truth of going to heaven was settled at the cross. This morning, if

787
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:47,899
you've accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior, you've understood that,

788
00:36:47,899 --> 00:36:52,500
that you were a sinner and that Jesus is the only savior and you placed your faith and

789
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:59,579
trust in the finished work of Christ alone. You're not going to try to help God. You can't

790
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:08,059
help God. He did it all. He said, it is finished. The word literally means paid in full. Paul

791
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:14,500
said that we do not frustrate the grace of God, that if, if, if salvation came by works,

792
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:22,459
then Christ is dead in vain. My savior did not die in vain. He died because it was the

793
00:37:22,459 --> 00:37:28,779
only way for mankind to be redeemed. I'm helpless and hopeless outside of the cross of Calvary

794
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:36,779
and an empty tomb. And this morning, if you've trusted Christ, heaven is your home. But the

795
00:37:36,779 --> 00:37:43,100
question is whether we'll be pleasing in his sight. The question here in second Corinthians

796
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:47,579
five is not whether I'm going to heaven or not. The question is whether we're going to be

797
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:53,100
pleasing. You've read, well done, thou good and faithful servant. We hear that phraseology often

798
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:58,179
as we'd refer to the gospels. And we find here this morning that we're to live in light of eternity,

799
00:37:58,179 --> 00:38:03,019
that I'm going to see my savior face to face. And, and I want to be accepted of him. I want

800
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:08,299
to be a time in which John would say it this way in first John chapter two, that I would not be

801
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:17,419
ashamed before him it is appearing. Children, sometimes I've used the analogy before. I

802
00:38:17,419 --> 00:38:23,859
remember as a kid myself being in this circumstance or the situation where you would be ashamed at

803
00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:29,339
the appearing of someone that is in a place of authority. Why? Because you were doing something

804
00:38:29,419 --> 00:38:35,820
you weren't supposed to do. You weren't found doing what you were left responsible for doing.

805
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:40,580
A parent leaves and they say, Hey, take care of these things. And we'll be back at this time.

806
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:45,059
There's this thing called procrastination that kids are really good at. You do all sorts of

807
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:50,820
other things. And a little boy that ate the cookie that mom said not to eat and had the crumbs all

808
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:56,900
over. And he said, I didn't eat it. Right. Or mom walks in just as you're taking a bite. And then

809
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,859
you think you outgrow that. And your wife makes a really good meal and says, now, listen, don't

810
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:05,059
mess around with that stuff. No taste testing before the guests get here. And you just want

811
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:11,619
to take a little bite. I jokingly said just a couple of weeks ago, well, I took one of the

812
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:15,659
cookies because I could rearrange on the platter and you wouldn't be able to tell that I took a

813
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:20,539
cookie. But on the other dessert that Holly made, there was no way I could take a piece of that

814
00:39:20,539 --> 00:39:25,940
because it would be abundantly obvious that there was a piece missing from the pie or it wasn't a

815
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:31,739
pie. It was a strawberry pretzel dessert cake. Man, if you ever had that, it's good. Amen. But I had to

816
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:38,299
take a cookie because I could try to rearrange. And then I told on myself. But listen, I don't

817
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:44,900
want to be ashamed at his appearing. He's coming again. His plan is revealed to us in his work.

818
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:50,580
Listen, there is nothing that you're going to do to change God's plan. Remember what we said

819
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:57,580
with the plan of redemption. Satan did everything within his power to thwart the plan of God.

820
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:01,659
Unsuccessful. God's plan of redemption is complete.

821
00:40:01,659 --> 00:40:06,819
And this morning, Jesus is coming again, I'm thankful for that truth.

822
00:40:06,819 --> 00:40:11,419
But we must understand that as we look at this portion of scripture, that our response

823
00:40:11,419 --> 00:40:15,499
to this, what God has revealed is that there's a longing for heaven.

824
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:19,279
He says that we groan, that we have this longing, I'm going to straight betwixt two, having

825
00:40:19,279 --> 00:40:23,319
a desire to depart to be with Christ, which is far better.

826
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:29,619
But there ought to be an impact in our lives on how we live daily.

827
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:30,619
Why?

828
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:34,939
Well, because His return is imminent.

829
00:40:34,939 --> 00:40:36,979
Why?

830
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:42,499
I like to say it this way because David said it this way, he was being hunted by Saul,

831
00:40:42,499 --> 00:40:47,959
and he made this statement, there's but a step between me and death.

832
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:51,299
You know, in a very real way for each of us here this morning, there's but a step between

833
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:53,599
me and death.

834
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:58,179
You say, oh, I'm young, I got energy, I got good health, I was just at the doctor, I was

835
00:40:58,179 --> 00:40:59,179
this, I was that.

836
00:40:59,419 --> 00:41:01,899
There's but a step between you and death.

837
00:41:01,899 --> 00:41:10,179
And this morning, what God has revealed to us better impact how we live our lives.

838
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:13,459
Notice with me a few portions of scripture, go to the book of Titus if you will, we'll

839
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:16,559
look at three portions of scripture, and we'll close this morning.

840
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,699
Look at Titus chapter number two.

841
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:25,859
I'm thankful for God's grace.

842
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:31,219
We all know that Brother Don's favorite song is Amazing Grace, in fact, he has it around

843
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:37,039
his neck today, he's got a tie that says Amazing Grace on it.

844
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:41,059
We think about that grace of God as it's mentioned to us here in Titus in chapter two in verse

845
00:41:41,059 --> 00:41:42,059
number 11.

846
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:48,279
Notice what the Bible says, for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared

847
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:49,279
to all men.

848
00:41:49,279 --> 00:41:52,059
Isn't that a wonderful verse of scripture?

849
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:56,739
The grace of God which bringeth salvation, for by grace are you saved through faith is

850
00:41:56,739 --> 00:42:01,139
what Ephesians two in verse eight says, and we find here this is the grace of God that

851
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:05,979
bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men.

852
00:42:05,979 --> 00:42:08,759
I'm thankful for God's grace.

853
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:12,819
I'm thankful to be aware of God's grace.

854
00:42:12,819 --> 00:42:17,819
To not live in some place where they do not have a Bible, where they do not have a preacher,

855
00:42:17,819 --> 00:42:20,659
where they do not have the knowledge of God's grace.

856
00:42:20,659 --> 00:42:25,379
And here this morning we sit in a place where we hear about the grace of God, but notice

857
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:28,619
it brings salvation, it's appeared to all men, but notice what he says in verse number

858
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:38,699
12, teaching us, God's grace teaches us some things, denying ungodliness and worldly lust.

859
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:47,219
Notice what he says, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world.

860
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:50,259
God's given us a prescription right there in verse number 12 as to how we're to live

861
00:42:50,259 --> 00:42:51,379
our lives.

862
00:42:51,379 --> 00:42:53,299
It's God's grace that teaches us that.

863
00:42:53,299 --> 00:42:56,379
You know what's sad about the false teachers?

864
00:42:56,379 --> 00:42:57,379
You know what they do?

865
00:42:57,379 --> 00:43:03,459
According to the book of Jude, they turn the grace of God into lasciviousness.

866
00:43:03,459 --> 00:43:08,579
You know, that word is not something that we use commonly in our everyday language,

867
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:12,059
but lasciviousness, it means unbridled lust.

868
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:14,179
Do whatever you want to do.

869
00:43:14,179 --> 00:43:18,319
They turn the grace of God into lasciviousness, but notice what God says that the grace of

870
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:19,319
God teaches us.

871
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:23,839
Yes, it brings salvation, but it teaches us that we're to deny ungodliness and worldly

872
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:29,519
lust and that we are to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world.

873
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:31,199
Why?

874
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:38,039
Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior,

875
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:39,519
Jesus Christ.

876
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:43,719
Listen, are you looking for his return?

877
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:45,399
I hope you are.

878
00:43:45,399 --> 00:43:48,239
We're groaning, we're longing for heaven.

879
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:54,599
Listen, I'm listening for the trumpet, I'm anxious to hear the sound of the trumpet.

880
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:59,559
As it's said in Revelation 4, John, he says he hears, as it were, a voice of a trumpet

881
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:02,839
saying, come up hither.

882
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:06,639
And here we find that he says that we're to be looking for that blessed hope.

883
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:11,959
Listen, the hope that we find in the Bible, that word, it's not how they use the word

884
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:12,959
today.

885
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:17,879
This word, this Bible word, hope, it's a precious word and it means that it's a confident

886
00:44:17,879 --> 00:44:20,879
expectation based on revealed truth.

887
00:44:20,879 --> 00:44:23,679
That's what we have.

888
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,679
So often today we say hope, we hope we're going to have this or we hope this is going

889
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:33,039
to happen or we hope that's going to happen, but listen, that's not the way that the Bible

890
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:37,119
uses the word hope.

891
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,799
Jesus is coming again, I'm going to be with him for all of eternity.

892
00:44:40,799 --> 00:44:46,399
Notice in verse 14, who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity

893
00:44:46,399 --> 00:44:50,679
and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.

894
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:54,319
These things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority, let no man despise them.

895
00:44:54,319 --> 00:45:00,379
It's interesting in this few verses of scripture in Titus, it covers the scope of the three

896
00:45:00,379 --> 00:45:05,119
messages that I've preached on God's plan, the plan of redemption, the plan of being

897
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,599
his workmanship and the plan that we're going to be with him for all of eternity.

898
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:13,559
It's revealed in these few verses right here in the book of Titus in chapter number two.

899
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:16,559
I'm so thankful for God's plan.

900
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:19,419
It teaches us that we're to live in light of eternity.

901
00:45:19,419 --> 00:45:23,199
Look over at second Peter chapter number three, I mentioned by way of introduction that we'd

902
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:28,399
come to this portion of scripture, we will not take the time to read the first 13 verses

903
00:45:28,399 --> 00:45:29,399
of this chapter.

904
00:45:29,399 --> 00:45:32,439
I just want to draw your attention to a few things very quickly.

905
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:36,719
As we close this morning in verse number three, the Bible says this in second Peter chapter

906
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:41,679
number three in verse number three, knowing this first that there shall come in the last

907
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:44,519
days scoffers walking after their own lusts.

908
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:45,519
Notice what they're saying.

909
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:47,759
Where is the promise of his coming?

910
00:45:47,759 --> 00:45:49,839
And they say, for instance, the father's fell asleep.

911
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:54,119
All things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.

912
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:57,319
And then it tells us for this, they willingly are ignorant of that.

913
00:45:57,319 --> 00:46:01,039
By the word of God, the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and

914
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:05,519
in the water, whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished.

915
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:10,039
And so we find that there's some scoffers are speaking about the fact that Jesus has

916
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:11,259
not come yet.

917
00:46:11,259 --> 00:46:15,599
But notice in verse number nine, the Bible says this, the Lord is not slack concerning

918
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,839
us promise as some men count slackness, but as long suffering to us, we're not willing

919
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,959
that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

920
00:46:22,959 --> 00:46:24,519
And what a precious verse that is.

921
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:32,159
But then notice the very next verse 10, but the day of the Lord, what's it say will come.

922
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:36,459
Thou is a thief in the night and the, which the heaven shall pass away with a great noise

923
00:46:36,459 --> 00:46:38,839
and the elements shall melt with fervent heat.

924
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:43,879
The earth also shall the also, and the works that are therein shall be burned up.

925
00:46:43,879 --> 00:46:48,699
But then knowing this, understanding this plan, notice the impact that it has on living

926
00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:49,759
in light of eternity.

927
00:46:49,759 --> 00:46:58,199
In verse number 11, it says, seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved.

928
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:05,999
What matter of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness?

929
00:47:05,999 --> 00:47:10,819
You know what he said earlier, as he's writing the same group of people in the first letter

930
00:47:10,819 --> 00:47:16,039
that he writes to them in first Peter chapter number one, he tells them in verse 14 as obedient

931
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:20,239
children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust and your ignorance, but

932
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:22,359
as he, which hath called you as holy.

933
00:47:22,359 --> 00:47:24,679
So be ye holy in all manner of conversation.

934
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:25,679
Why?

935
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:28,919
Why shouldn't be holy for I am holy.

936
00:47:28,919 --> 00:47:35,319
And Peter says, listen, that you understand these things, knowing that these things shall

937
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:36,319
happen.

938
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:43,579
What matter of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness?

939
00:47:43,579 --> 00:47:51,599
Notice in verse 14, what the Bible says, wherefore beloved, seeing that ye look for such things.

940
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:56,879
Isn't it amazing that the assumption of Peter is that the people that he's writing to that

941
00:47:56,879 --> 00:48:01,239
are saved people are going to be looking for these things?

942
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:02,239
Why does he assume that?

943
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:07,719
Well, Titus looking for that blessed hope and glorious appearing of our Lord, right?

944
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:11,799
So we understand there's this anticipation, this longing, but it affects how we live our

945
00:48:11,799 --> 00:48:13,119
daily lives.

946
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:18,639
He says, wherefore beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye

947
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:21,559
may be found of him, how?

948
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:26,319
In peace, without spot and blameless.

949
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:32,359
Wow, it's a tall order.

950
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:37,119
Impossible for you or for me to do in ourselves, but with the help of the Holy Spirit, the

951
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:44,519
guidance of his word, we can live a life that is pleasing to the Lord as we live in light

952
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:49,899
of eternity, that we understand that one day we're going to see him.

953
00:48:49,899 --> 00:48:53,839
And he says that since we're looking for these things, since we understand this plan that

954
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:58,739
God has revealed to us in his word, that it impacts how I respond and how I live my life.

955
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:05,440
And he says, be diligent that ye may be found in him in peace, without spot and blameless.

956
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,759
Be diligent.

957
00:49:08,759 --> 00:49:16,039
Every day we should live as if it might be today, it might be today.

958
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:20,639
Listen, that's a warning to a lost person.

959
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:25,799
If you've not trusted Christ your Savior today, the Bible says today is the day of salvation.

960
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:28,039
Boast not thyself of tomorrow.

961
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:30,759
We read that in Proverbs 27.

962
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:37,079
We use those verses with regard to the importance, the urgency of salvation and redemption so

963
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:40,879
that we'd have that confidence that heaven is our home.

964
00:49:40,879 --> 00:49:49,279
But you know, as saved people, today might be the day that the trumpet of the Lord sounds

965
00:49:49,279 --> 00:49:53,199
or that my heart stops beating and I enter into eternity.

966
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:58,399
I'm thankful that I'll see him face to face, but I wonder each day, am I being diligent

967
00:49:58,399 --> 00:50:01,599
that I'd be found in that matter?

968
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,739
by living, as we read in 2 Corinthians chapter number five,

969
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:06,539
that whether present or absent,

970
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:08,959
that we would be accepted of him.

971
00:50:08,959 --> 00:50:12,399
Again, we find, and I referenced in 1 John chapter two,

972
00:50:12,399 --> 00:50:14,919
in verse number 28, if you turn there,

973
00:50:14,919 --> 00:50:16,879
we'll finish with this portion of scripture,

974
00:50:16,879 --> 00:50:19,239
but in 1 John chapter two, in verse number 28,

975
00:50:19,239 --> 00:50:23,359
the Bible tells us again about the return of the Lord,

976
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:27,239
and obviously that we will be with him forever.

977
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:29,479
The Bible says in verse 28 of 1 John chapter two,

978
00:50:29,479 --> 00:50:31,919
and now, little children, abide in him,

979
00:50:31,919 --> 00:50:35,679
that when he shall appear, we may have confidence,

980
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:36,519
notice what he says,

981
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:40,599
and not be ashamed before him at his coming.

982
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:46,379
Not be ashamed before him at his coming.

983
00:50:46,379 --> 00:50:47,879
If you know that he is righteous,

984
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:48,959
do you know that this morning?

985
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,519
Of course we do.

986
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:52,339
You know that everyone that doeth righteousness

987
00:50:52,339 --> 00:50:53,179
is born of him.

988
00:50:53,179 --> 00:50:56,879
Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us

989
00:50:56,919 --> 00:51:00,039
that we should be called the sons of God.

990
00:51:00,039 --> 00:51:01,559
Therefore, the world knoweth us not,

991
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:02,479
because it knew him not.

992
00:51:02,479 --> 00:51:04,719
Beloved, notice verse two of chapter three.

993
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:07,879
Beloved, now are we the sons of God.

994
00:51:07,879 --> 00:51:11,879
Wow, what a privilege to know the Lord,

995
00:51:13,759 --> 00:51:15,279
to be called the sons of God.

996
00:51:15,279 --> 00:51:18,439
It says, it doth not yet appear what we shall be,

997
00:51:18,439 --> 00:51:19,939
but notice again, we know that,

998
00:51:19,939 --> 00:51:21,939
why God keeps revealing these things to us.

999
00:51:21,939 --> 00:51:24,759
When he shall appear, we shall be like him,

1000
00:51:24,759 --> 00:51:26,779
for we shall see him as he is.

1001
00:51:27,999 --> 00:51:30,559
And every man that hath this hope in him,

1002
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,859
purifieth himself, even as he is pure.

1003
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:40,819
This morning, God's revealed truth to us

1004
00:51:40,819 --> 00:51:42,159
with regard to his plan.

1005
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:49,039
And that plan that he's revealed to us

1006
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:51,259
of being with him for all of eternity

1007
00:51:51,259 --> 00:51:54,479
ought to cause us to have great excitement and joy.

1008
00:51:54,999 --> 00:51:55,919
It ought to cause us this morning

1009
00:51:55,919 --> 00:52:00,919
to have this level of anticipation.

1010
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:04,219
One day I'm gonna see him face to face.

1011
00:52:04,219 --> 00:52:05,879
But what he's revealed to us

1012
00:52:05,879 --> 00:52:08,559
ought to impact how we live every day.

1013
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,799
We have a longing, but we ought to live

1014
00:52:10,799 --> 00:52:12,019
in light of eternity.

1015
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:15,559
Somebody told me this years and years and years ago.

1016
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:17,559
I wasn't even saved when they said this.

1017
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,639
I was probably, I won't tell you how old I was,

1018
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:22,919
it was probably 30 years ago.

1019
00:52:25,479 --> 00:52:27,879
It was the church where my parents

1020
00:52:27,879 --> 00:52:30,519
trusted Christ as their savior.

1021
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:34,319
And in that church, there was a large military presence.

1022
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:37,979
It was not far from several military bases.

1023
00:52:39,259 --> 00:52:43,239
And I was just a young teenager at the time,

1024
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:45,959
and this man was talking to another man,

1025
00:52:45,959 --> 00:52:47,239
and I was just there in their presence.

1026
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:50,679
They were probably in their early 20s, young Marines.

1027
00:52:50,679 --> 00:52:52,519
This man made this statement.

1028
00:52:54,679 --> 00:52:57,119
It didn't really matter how he lived his life.

1029
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,639
All that mattered was that one day he'd be in heaven.

1030
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:01,519
And I remember hearing that.

1031
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:02,919
I wasn't even a saved person,

1032
00:53:02,919 --> 00:53:04,959
but I thought how weird that is.

1033
00:53:06,939 --> 00:53:08,239
How weird that is.

1034
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:09,079
Why?

1035
00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:13,539
Because I don't wanna just get to heaven.

1036
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:17,799
I'm thankful that because of redemption,

1037
00:53:17,799 --> 00:53:20,779
I will spend forever in heaven.

1038
00:53:20,779 --> 00:53:22,199
But I wanna be accepted of him.

1039
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,039
I wanna be pleasing in his sight.

1040
00:53:25,959 --> 00:53:29,679
I wanna live every day knowing that today could be the day.

1041
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:33,879
Listen, honestly, I don't wanna be ashamed at his appearing.

1042
00:53:33,879 --> 00:53:34,719
I don't.

1043
00:53:35,799 --> 00:53:36,759
And I hope this morning,

1044
00:53:36,759 --> 00:53:39,539
you don't wanna be ashamed at his appearing.

1045
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:41,879
You say, what would cause me to be ashamed?

1046
00:53:41,879 --> 00:53:43,279
There's some things that could cause people

1047
00:53:43,279 --> 00:53:44,399
to be ashamed at his appearing.

1048
00:53:44,399 --> 00:53:47,479
I believe that since he told us in 1 John 2,

1049
00:53:47,479 --> 00:53:49,159
it's absolutely possible there are gonna be some people

1050
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,639
that are gonna be ashamed at his appearing.

1051
00:53:51,639 --> 00:53:53,239
And I hope that wouldn't be you.

1052
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:55,959
This morning, if the Holy Spirit

1053
00:53:55,959 --> 00:53:57,959
maybe has convicted you of something,

1054
00:53:58,919 --> 00:54:01,839
man, get that right with God.

1055
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,199
I don't wanna be ashamed at his appearing.

1056
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,039
Rejoice that heaven is your home.

1057
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,279
But when you respond to what he's revealed to us,

1058
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:11,859
that we'd live godly lives,

1059
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:15,679
that we'd live lives that are pleasing in his sight.

1060
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:19,519
This morning, if you're not saved,

1061
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:22,079
man, today is the day of salvation.

1062
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:23,079
God has a plan.

1063
00:54:24,039 --> 00:54:26,639
His plan starts with redemption.

1064
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:32,119
And then you are his workers, we are his workmanship.

1065
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:34,559
And then we find one day we'll be in heaven

1066
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,239
for all of eternity, seeing him face to face.

1067
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:38,779
Isn't that wonderful?

1068
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:41,639
This morning, present with the Lord.

1069
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:42,479
Let's pray.

1070
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:43,319
Father, we love you.

1071
00:54:43,319 --> 00:54:44,319
Thank you for loving us.

1072
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:45,839
Thank you for your word.

1073
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,879
We thank you for the truth of your word.

1074
00:54:47,879 --> 00:54:49,359
God, if there's one here that's not saved,

1075
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:52,199
I pray that today they'd be saved.

1076
00:54:52,199 --> 00:54:55,359
God, I pray that many of your people this morning

1077
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:56,919
that are saved, that have trusted you,

1078
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:59,519
Lord, they would rejoice in this truth

1079
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:02,159
that you've revealed to us of your plan

1080
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:04,659
with regard to eternity.

1081
00:55:05,659 --> 00:55:08,959
Maybe there's something in our lives, Lord,

1082
00:55:08,959 --> 00:55:11,919
that you've pointed out that we need to deal with.

1083
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:17,159
That we would not be ashamed at your appearing.

1084
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:18,759
I pray, Lord, that we do business with you,

1085
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:22,079
that we'd be honest and humble before you.

1086
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,199
I pray that you'd help us to live every day of our lives

1087
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:25,439
in light of eternity.

1088
00:55:26,839 --> 00:55:28,319
We'll thank you for the work that you'll do,

1089
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:29,559
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

1090
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:30,399
Would you stand with me?

1091
00:55:30,399 --> 00:55:31,959
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

1092
00:55:31,959 --> 00:55:33,679
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano,

1093
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:35,659
and as she does, the altar is open.

1094
00:55:35,659 --> 00:55:37,039
If you're not sure of heaven,

1095
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:38,719
we'll take a Bible and show you how you can know for sure

1096
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:40,159
that heaven's your home.

1097
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:42,119
Maybe you just need to come and thank God for his plan.

1098
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:44,979
Thank God that one day you'll see him face to face.

1099
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,239
Maybe this morning, God convicted you,

1100
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:50,639
and you need to come and get something right with him

1101
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:52,239
so we would not be ashamed of his appearing.

1102
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:54,239
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
