00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
Second Corinthians chapter number five,

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.779
Second Corinthians chapter number five,

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:05.800
and I'll let you know that we're going to,

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.560
that's the text that I'll be preaching from this morning,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.439
but there's about five or six other portions of Scripture

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:12.479
that I'm going to read

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.439
before we get to Second Corinthians chapter number five,

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:17.479
and so you might wanna stick a bookmarker there

00:00:17.479 --> 00:00:19.200
at Second Corinthians five,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.799
and then get your fingers ready

00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:23.920
to be able to look at a few other portions of Scripture

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.479
by way of introduction this morning.

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:29.360
I am thankful that we serve a great God,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.000
and I'm thankful that He has revealed to us

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.639
within the pages of His precious word, His greatness,

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:39.000
and though we have the opportunity,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.759
and we can rightly say this morning

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:44.419
that we know that the Lord is great,

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:47.639
we can make that statement based upon the revelation

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:49.680
that God has given us in His word,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.279
and we would be in agreement

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:54.520
with a number of other Bible characters.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.400
David in the Psalms plainly says,

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:00.360
I know that the Lord is great.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.779
There are others that have testified

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:04.199
throughout the pages of Scripture

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.199
of being aware of and convinced of the greatness of God,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.760
and we can make that statement this morning,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.360
and the reality is that as we make the statement

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.760
that we know the Lord is great,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.360
at the same time, we must acknowledge

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.599
another portion of Scripture where the psalmist says

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:26.639
that His greatness, speaking of the Lord, is unsearchable,

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:29.559
and though I can make the statement this morning,

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:31.400
and you can make the statement this morning

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.720
that our God is great, we cannot fully comprehend

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.559
just how great our God is,

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:41.959
and as great as He is in your mind this morning,

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:45.559
I promise you on the authority of God's word

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:49.199
that He is greater than what you can even comprehend,

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:52.800
and that's a wonderful promise and truth of God's word.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.000
There are some today that say,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.319
well, I just wanna figure all these things out about God.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.360
Well, if God was like you and God was like me,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.319
He wouldn't be God, and the reality is

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.599
that He transcends us, His ways are not our ways,

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:06.480
His thoughts are not our thoughts,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.320
and we serve a great God.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.039
Here's what's amazing to me,

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.639
that that great God, Jehovah God,

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:16.320
has made Himself known to us.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.119
That's absolutely amazing.

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:22.039
The reality is that as we look at His word

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.000
and He's revealed to us His greatness,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.119
we've had the opportunity throughout the year,

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:29.199
this year in 2023,

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:31.960
to look at a number of portions of scripture

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.559
that would reveal to us God's greatness.

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:36.720
In fact, over the past few weeks,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.520
we've had the opportunity to, as I've termed it,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.440
to discover God's greatness

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.440
as it's revealed to us through His plan.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.360
I'm thankful that God has a plan,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.000
and the very first week we dealt with the fact

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
that God, His greatness is known to us,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.759
is revealed to us as we examine the plan,

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:58.479
God's plan of redemption.

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:01.559
I'm so thankful that God, even though He knew

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:04.440
as He created man that man would sin,

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.839
but God, before the foundation of the world,

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:11.360
He developed a plan by which man could be reconciled,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.000
could be redeemed.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.600
We find that the Bible tells us that redemption

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.679
is only through the blood of Jesus Christ.

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:20.520
There's just one way to be redeemed,

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.240
to be reconciled to God,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.240
and it's through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.720
And we understand, as we dealt with it,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.759
that the enemy, he sought to do everything

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:33.039
within his power to thwart the plan of God.

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:35.039
But I'm thankful to report to you this morning

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:37.119
that that plan that was developed

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:39.600
before the foundation of the world was executed

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.080
when the Lord Jesus Christ went to a cruel cross

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.039
and He was buried in a borrowed tomb

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:47.119
and He rose conquering sin, death, and the grave,

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:50.479
and redemption's plan, as He said on the cross,

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.559
it is finished, the plan of redemption is made available.

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:56.160
I would say this morning that many of us,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.240
if not most or all of us this morning

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.520
that are gathered together could stand

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.460
and say, I've been redeemed.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.820
Aren't you thankful for God's plan of redemption?

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.279
As it's been revealed to us through the pages of scripture,

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:10.440
it reveals to us how great He is.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.720
Then in our second week, as we spoke about the plan of God,

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.119
we said this, that God has a plan of redemption

00:04:16.119 --> 00:04:20.119
and that plan of redemption is to redeem all mankind

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.880
for all times.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.000
Now we understand that not all men will be saved,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.519
but it's God's heart that all men would be saved.

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:28.839
The Bible says that He's not willing that any should perish

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:31.000
but that all should come to repentance.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.760
After we're saved, the Bible says this,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.920
we, those that have been redeemed,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.519
those that have been born again, we are His workmanship.

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:44.239
And we said this, that God's plan of redemption

00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:47.320
is that we'd be saved, that we'd have a home in heaven,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.600
but after we've been saved,

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.679
God has a plan for each of us as individuals.

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:53.679
And what a great God that we serve,

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:56.399
that He has an individual plan for every one

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:58.279
of His children.

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:02.459
And as we consider the plan that God has for us

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:05.140
as individuals, as His children,

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.320
that He equips us to be able to do,

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.480
to fulfill the plan that He has for our lives.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.200
And then as we do what He's called us and equipped us to do,

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.440
He will reward us for doing it.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.079
And ultimately, as each of us fulfill the role,

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:24.040
the plan that God has for us individually,

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.119
we find that ultimately it fulfills His master plan.

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:29.519
It's amazing.

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:31.079
It's absolutely phenomenal.

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:33.399
And when you understand and you see in the pages

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:37.040
of Scripture, these truths, it helps us again

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.079
to see how great our God truly is.

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:44.200
This morning, I'm thankful that though,

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.279
as we look at the plan of redemption

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:49.640
and we understand the plan that God has for us here

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.600
upon this earth, that we are His workmanship,

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.679
I'm thankful that God's plan for me,

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:57.200
that God's plan for you is an eternal plan.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.019
It does not end simply with this life here upon this earth.

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:04.760
I'm thankful that we're pilgrims and we're strangers,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.619
that we're sojourners, if you will,

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:08.799
that this world, as the songwriter said,

00:06:08.799 --> 00:06:10.440
this world is not my home.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.359
I'm just a passing through.

00:06:12.359 --> 00:06:17.160
And I'm so thankful that this world is not the end of all.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.040
Wouldn't that be a sad thing if this world

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.500
was all that we had, but we understand this morning

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.200
that God's plan for His children,

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.359
God's plan is an eternal plan.

00:06:27.359 --> 00:06:30.519
We sing songs about seeing God face to face.

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:33.559
Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful truth that is.

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.679
I was thinking this morning as I was praying

00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:37.480
here in the sanctuary, early this morning,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.640
I was praying for the services and various other things.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.679
As I was praying, I was reminded as I was just meditating

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:45.640
upon what I would be preaching this morning,

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.679
I was reminded of some songs that we sing.

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:51.079
I think about that song, It Is Well With My Soul,

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:52.239
and the fourth verse says,

00:06:52.239 --> 00:06:57.140
and Lord, when my faith shall be sight.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.320
And we're gonna see Him face to face.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.679
And what a blessing.

00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:02.959
And I was in here this morning,

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:04.980
Brother Pierre, I was singing all by myself

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.679
and echoing off these walls and there's no piano

00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:08.959
and nobody to mess me up.

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:10.640
It just sounded good, amen.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.299
And I was singing a few songs this morning,

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:15.160
just singing to the Lord.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.000
Why?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.079
Because one day my faith will be made sight.

00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:19.880
I will see Him face to face.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.480
And I'm thankful that God's plan is an eternal plan.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.079
This morning, as we consider the greatness of God

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:27.920
revealed to us through His plan,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.239
I would say this in 2 Corinthians chapter five,

00:07:30.239 --> 00:07:31.600
I'll read one verse of scripture

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.279
and then I'm gonna read a number of other portions

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:35.480
as we get into the text.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.279
The Bible says this in verse number eight,

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:40.739
we are confident, I say, and willing,

00:07:40.739 --> 00:07:43.119
rather to be absent from the body

00:07:43.119 --> 00:07:45.799
and to be present with the Lord.

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:48.040
I've titled the message this morning,

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.480
present with the Lord.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.160
As believers this morning,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.760
the thought of eternity is one that should bring great joy

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.359
to each of our hearts.

00:07:56.359 --> 00:07:57.760
The thought, the truth,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.920
the reality of eternity this morning

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.760
should cause us to have an attitude of expectation

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.779
and anticipation that one day

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:09.220
I'll see my Savior face to face.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.579
As we consider the truth of God's word

00:08:11.579 --> 00:08:14.140
and the fact that people,

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.760
the people of God have had this understanding

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.440
with regard to eternity.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.380
I wanna remind you of some portions of scripture.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.299
Turn back to the book of Psalms, if you will.

00:08:22.299 --> 00:08:23.700
In Psalm chapter 23,

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.959
a Psalm that we're very familiar with,

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:28.440
where the Bible speaks about the Lord is my shepherd.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.359
I just wanna call your attention to verse number six,

00:08:31.359 --> 00:08:34.080
where the Psalmist David,

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.479
we think about this truth of eternity

00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:38.880
and notice what he says in verse number six.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.640
Again, it's a portion of scripture

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.640
that we're very familiar with.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.000
Many of us have memorized Psalm 23.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.280
The Bible says in verse number six,

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.080
"'Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.520
"'all the days of my life.'"

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.159
But I'm thankful there's not a period there.

00:08:53.159 --> 00:08:54.080
Amen?

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.440
When I take my final breath,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.679
when you take your final breath,

00:08:56.679 --> 00:08:57.919
that's not the end.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.880
It's not the end.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.380
He continues and says,

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:07.380
"'And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.'"

00:09:07.599 --> 00:09:08.960
Isn't that precious?

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.359
Psalm 73, if you will,

00:09:10.359 --> 00:09:14.380
just turn over a few pages there in your Bible to Psalm 73.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.760
Look at verse number 22

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.679
and we'll read down through the end of the chapter here

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:18.900
in Psalm 73.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.159
And I want you to see here,

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:23.000
the Psalmist Asaph is the one

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.159
that this particular Psalm is ascribed to.

00:09:26.159 --> 00:09:27.239
It's a Psalm of Asaph.

00:09:27.239 --> 00:09:28.719
Notice in verse 22,

00:09:28.719 --> 00:09:29.559
the Bible says this,

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:32.080
"'So foolish was I and ignorant.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.520
"'I was a beast before thee.'"

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.859
But then notice in verse 23,

00:09:34.859 --> 00:09:38.359
"'Nevertheless, I am continually with thee.

00:09:38.359 --> 00:09:41.440
"'Thou hast holden me by my right hand.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.559
"'Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel.'"

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:47.320
Aren't you thankful for God's guidance and his leadership?

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.020
But notice the end of verse number 24,

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:53.359
"'And afterward receive me to glory.'"

00:09:53.359 --> 00:09:56.780
And I'm thankful that as we live upon this earth,

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.440
as pilgrims and strangers,

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.559
this world is not my home.

00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:03.159
I'm just passing through that God guides me

00:10:03.159 --> 00:10:06.059
with his counsel, that he's holding me

00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:08.219
by his right hand in verse 23.

00:10:08.219 --> 00:10:11.399
But I'm thankful that afterward he'll receive me to glory.

00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:14.839
Verse 25 says, whom have I in heaven but thee?

00:10:14.839 --> 00:10:18.399
And there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:20.319
My flesh and my heart faileth,

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:24.959
but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.

00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:28.099
For lo, they that are far from thee shall perish.

00:10:28.099 --> 00:10:31.819
Thou hast destroyed all them that go a-whoring from thee,

00:10:31.819 --> 00:10:33.539
but it is good for me, notice what it says,

00:10:33.539 --> 00:10:36.639
it is good for me to draw near to God.

00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:38.419
I've put my trust in the Lord God

00:10:38.419 --> 00:10:42.139
that I may declare all thy works.

00:10:42.139 --> 00:10:44.019
John 14 is a portion of scripture

00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:45.659
that we're very familiar with.

00:10:45.659 --> 00:10:48.539
The Lord Jesus Christ is encouraging his disciples

00:10:48.539 --> 00:10:52.739
after he's instructed them and revealed to them

00:10:52.739 --> 00:10:56.539
that he is going to soon go to that cross of Calvary.

00:10:56.579 --> 00:10:59.819
And we find that as Jesus is speaking to his disciples,

00:10:59.819 --> 00:11:03.679
it's obvious through the tenor and all that takes place

00:11:03.679 --> 00:11:06.699
that the disciples are discouraged as to what they've heard

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:07.939
and what they've understood.

00:11:07.939 --> 00:11:11.099
And Jesus says, let not your heart be troubled.

00:11:12.199 --> 00:11:13.540
Let not your heart be troubled.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.819
You believe in God, believe also in me.

00:11:15.819 --> 00:11:17.699
In my Father's house are many mansions.

00:11:17.699 --> 00:11:19.419
If it were not so, I would have told you.

00:11:19.419 --> 00:11:20.819
He then says this in verse two,

00:11:20.819 --> 00:11:23.059
I go to prepare a place for you.

00:11:23.139 --> 00:11:24.779
And if I go and prepare a place for you,

00:11:24.779 --> 00:11:27.860
I will come again and receive you unto myself.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.540
Notice where he says that where I am,

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.220
there ye may be also.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.339
You know what makes heaven heaven?

00:11:35.339 --> 00:11:37.599
The fact that our Savior's there.

00:11:37.599 --> 00:11:39.619
People sometimes talk about heaven and they say,

00:11:39.619 --> 00:11:41.459
talk to me about heaven, tell me about heaven.

00:11:41.459 --> 00:11:43.059
And I wanna hear about the streets of gold

00:11:43.059 --> 00:11:44.819
and I wanna hear about the,

00:11:44.819 --> 00:11:47.419
Jesus is what makes heaven heaven.

00:11:47.419 --> 00:11:49.139
The Lord is there.

00:11:49.139 --> 00:11:53.419
And Jesus says that where I am, there ye may be also.

00:11:53.419 --> 00:11:54.659
What a wonderful truth.

00:11:54.659 --> 00:11:57.139
First Thessalonians chapter four.

00:11:57.139 --> 00:11:58.959
We find again a portion of scripture

00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:00.619
that we're very familiar with.

00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:02.339
In First Thessalonians four,

00:12:02.339 --> 00:12:06.419
speaking about the soon return of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:12:06.419 --> 00:12:09.300
the raptures, we refer to it in verse 13 of chapter four.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.539
The Bible says, but I would not have you

00:12:11.539 --> 00:12:13.380
to be ignorant, brethren,

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.779
concerning them which are asleep,

00:12:15.779 --> 00:12:18.580
that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.699
For we believe that Jesus died and rose again,

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:23.860
even so them also which sleep in Jesus

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.660
will God bring with him.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.380
For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord,

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.779
that we which are alive and remain

00:12:29.779 --> 00:12:30.739
unto the coming of the Lord

00:12:30.739 --> 00:12:33.300
shall not prevent them which are asleep.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.339
I'm thankful this isn't just Paul's idea.

00:12:35.339 --> 00:12:37.179
He says this is by the word of the Lord.

00:12:37.179 --> 00:12:39.339
He said in verse 13, I don't want you to be ignorant.

00:12:39.339 --> 00:12:40.300
I want you to be informed.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.339
I want you to understand some things.

00:12:42.339 --> 00:12:45.059
He says in verse 16, for the Lord himself

00:12:45.059 --> 00:12:47.899
shall descend from heaven with a shout,

00:12:47.899 --> 00:12:49.300
with the voice of the archangel,

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.139
with the trump of God,

00:12:50.139 --> 00:12:52.279
and the dead in Christ shall rise first.

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:55.300
I'm thankful the Lord himself is coming for us, amen.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.860
He's not sending an angel.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.300
He's coming himself.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.819
He said that where I am, there ye may be also.

00:13:00.819 --> 00:13:03.739
In verse 16, it tells us that he's coming himself.

00:13:03.739 --> 00:13:06.459
Verse 17, then we which are alive and remain

00:13:06.459 --> 00:13:08.500
shall be caught up together with them in the clouds

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.259
to meet the Lord in the air, notice,

00:13:11.259 --> 00:13:15.500
and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.580
Wherefore, comfort one another with these words.

00:13:18.259 --> 00:13:19.940
Understand this is God's plan.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.319
This is God's plan.

00:13:21.319 --> 00:13:22.220
This is not my plan.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.179
This is not Paul's plan.

00:13:23.179 --> 00:13:26.739
This is not the plan of David or Peter or some other.

00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:29.119
This is the plan of God,

00:13:29.119 --> 00:13:31.940
and he's revealed in the pages of his precious book,

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.539
the Bible, he's revealed to us the plan that he has,

00:13:35.539 --> 00:13:37.020
and it's an eternal plan.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:40.459
Notice with me in Revelation chapter 21.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.099
We'll reference in just a few moments

00:13:44.099 --> 00:13:45.179
as we get through the message,

00:13:45.179 --> 00:13:47.779
the portion of Scripture there in 2 Peter.

00:13:47.779 --> 00:13:49.979
We could read the entirety of the chapter,

00:13:49.979 --> 00:13:50.899
the third chapter.

00:13:50.899 --> 00:13:52.539
We'll reference a portion of that

00:13:52.539 --> 00:13:53.639
here in just a few moments,

00:13:53.639 --> 00:13:56.739
but I wanna draw your attention to Revelation 21,

00:13:56.739 --> 00:13:58.819
and then we'll get back to 2 Corinthians 5,

00:13:58.819 --> 00:14:01.539
dig into the passage of Scripture this morning.

00:14:01.539 --> 00:14:03.259
Notice with me in Revelation 21.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:04.099
The Bible says this,

00:14:04.099 --> 00:14:06.819
and I saw a new heaven and a new earth.

00:14:06.819 --> 00:14:09.020
For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away,

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.259
and there was no more seeing.

00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:13.919
And I, John, saw the holy city, new Jerusalem,

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:15.759
coming down from God out of heaven,

00:14:15.759 --> 00:14:19.160
prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.720
And I heard a great voice out of heaven,

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:24.279
saying, behold, the tabernacle of God is with men,

00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:26.040
and he will dwell with them,

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.239
and they shall be his people,

00:14:27.239 --> 00:14:31.160
and God himself shall be with them and be their God.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.459
Listen, that's our future.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.000
That's the reality.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.119
Sometimes we live in this earth.

00:14:36.119 --> 00:14:38.160
Turn back over to 2 Corinthians 5.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.600
Sometimes we live in this earth and this world,

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.119
and we can get so caught up with the things of this world.

00:14:44.119 --> 00:14:45.739
We can get sideways sometimes

00:14:45.739 --> 00:14:47.220
with what's going on in our world,

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.720
and we can get distracted,

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.839
and we can get discouraged.

00:14:50.839 --> 00:14:54.119
And I'd say this, that we can get depressed.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.000
I love what the songwriter said.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.519
I'm not discouraged.

00:14:58.519 --> 00:14:59.359
Why?

00:14:59.359 --> 00:15:01.040
I'm heaven-bound.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.899
And really, if we keep that perspective,

00:15:03.899 --> 00:15:05.799
if we have that eternal perspective,

00:15:05.799 --> 00:15:07.540
if we understand this morning,

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.760
as we've looked at all of these portions of Scripture,

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.139
and there are many more that we could go to this morning,

00:15:12.139 --> 00:15:15.679
that we could understand that God's plan is given to us,

00:15:15.679 --> 00:15:18.079
and it reveals to us how great he is,

00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:20.119
that he has this plan,

00:15:20.119 --> 00:15:24.239
and for his children to be with him forever,

00:15:24.239 --> 00:15:25.359
that we'll dwell with him,

00:15:25.359 --> 00:15:26.559
we'll be with him,

00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:29.279
to be present with the Lord.

00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:31.320
And as we have that understanding,

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:35.579
and as we have that perspective of the truth of eternity,

00:15:35.579 --> 00:15:37.839
then this world, the things of this world,

00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:40.919
will grow strangely dim, as the songwriter said,

00:15:40.919 --> 00:15:43.320
and it will prevent us from getting discouraged

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.139
and defeated.

00:15:44.139 --> 00:15:44.980
Why?

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.919
Because it's just a little while that we're here.

00:15:47.919 --> 00:15:49.119
The Bible talks about,

00:15:49.119 --> 00:15:52.040
as Peter is speaking to some people that are suffering,

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.760
that are dealing with great adversity,

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.359
and trial, and difficulty.

00:15:55.359 --> 00:15:58.559
He says, after that you've suffered a little while.

00:15:58.559 --> 00:16:00.399
And the reality is that no one knows

00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:02.200
how long a little while is,

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.639
but what we do know is it's not forever.

00:16:05.639 --> 00:16:07.600
You say, well, my little while's been too long.

00:16:08.359 --> 00:16:09.200
Listen, it's not forever,

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.519
and God has a plan, and God has a purpose,

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:13.419
and God always does what's right.

00:16:13.419 --> 00:16:17.600
And listen, we have the truth and the hope of eternity,

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.260
and we can rejoice in that this morning.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.480
In 2 Corinthians chapter number five,

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.940
if you're taking notes,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.399
number one, I want you to notice with me

00:16:28.399 --> 00:16:32.299
what God has revealed to his people.

00:16:32.299 --> 00:16:35.119
Notice with me, as we look at this portion of scripture,

00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:38.040
what God has revealed to his people.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.200
In fact, as we've looked at

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.040
all of those other portions of scripture,

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:45.000
we find that those portions of scripture support,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.679
as we look here at this thought

00:16:46.679 --> 00:16:48.480
of what God has revealed to us,

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.639
I'm so thankful for God's revelation.

00:16:51.639 --> 00:16:54.079
In verse number one, notice how Paul begins.

00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:56.480
Notice the first three words, for we know.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.919
For we know.

00:16:57.919 --> 00:17:00.220
Now, there's some things that you know.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.839
There's some things that you think you know

00:17:01.839 --> 00:17:03.519
that you don't really know.

00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:04.519
You ever have somebody say,

00:17:04.679 --> 00:17:07.239
I mean, you know they're wrong, but they're just,

00:17:07.239 --> 00:17:10.919
and then they have to admit that they didn't know.

00:17:10.919 --> 00:17:13.320
But listen, Paul says, for we know.

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.119
Paul didn't say, I think.

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:16.440
He didn't say, I hope.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.079
He didn't say, this is my, no, no, no.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.480
He says, I know.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.399
This morning, God has revealed some things to us

00:17:23.399 --> 00:17:25.639
as his people that he wants us to know,

00:17:25.639 --> 00:17:27.559
that he wants us to be assured of,

00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:30.160
that he wants us to have confidences in.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.480
He says this, for we know.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:36.359
That if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved,

00:17:36.359 --> 00:17:37.239
you know what he's talking about?

00:17:37.239 --> 00:17:38.079
When we die.

00:17:39.519 --> 00:17:40.720
Peter says it this way.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:44.859
He says that I must shortly put off this, my tabernacle.

00:17:44.859 --> 00:17:48.859
The Bible says that Jesus, the word, was made flesh

00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:50.480
and dwelt among us.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:54.959
Literally, it means that he tabernacled amongst us.

00:17:54.959 --> 00:17:57.160
It's very interesting when you tie that together

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.119
with the Old Testament and the tabernacle

00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:02.119
and the holy of holies and understanding the presence of God

00:18:02.639 --> 00:18:03.480
and so on and so forth.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.880
And Jesus, God in flesh, he came and he lived,

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.639
he dwelt, he tabernacled amongst us.

00:18:09.639 --> 00:18:12.760
And so here, Paul is saying that if our earthly house

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.079
of this tabernacle were dissolved,

00:18:15.079 --> 00:18:17.760
when you die, when I die, notice what he says.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:22.760
We have a building of God, a house not made with hands,

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.380
eternal in the heavens.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.399
Listen, you know what he says in 1 Corinthians 15?

00:18:28.399 --> 00:18:31.380
This mortal shall put off, right?

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.299
This mortal shall become immortal, right?

00:18:34.299 --> 00:18:36.979
This corruption shall become incorruption.

00:18:36.979 --> 00:18:38.739
And we look at that and we understand, listen,

00:18:38.739 --> 00:18:40.299
there's going to be a change.

00:18:40.299 --> 00:18:43.140
The Bible says that in a moment, a twinkling of an eye,

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:46.219
that we shall be changed.

00:18:46.219 --> 00:18:49.380
We find here that he says, for in this we groan,

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.260
earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house,

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.380
which is from heaven.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:57.059
If so be that being clothed, we shall not be found naked.

00:18:57.059 --> 00:19:01.179
Verse four, for we that are in this tabernacle do groan,

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:02.979
being burdened.

00:19:02.979 --> 00:19:03.820
Why?

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.799
Not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon.

00:19:06.799 --> 00:19:11.340
Notice what he says, that mortality might be swallowed up

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.940
of, notice what it says, life.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.140
It doesn't say of death.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.140
See, the idea, most people have this idea that, well, death.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.779
No, no, he says that mortality might be swallowed up

00:19:21.779 --> 00:19:22.960
of life.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:23.799
What is he referring to?

00:19:23.799 --> 00:19:25.299
That eternal life.

00:19:25.299 --> 00:19:28.140
The fact that we're going to be, if you're saved,

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.140
this morning, if you've trusted Christ as your savior,

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.059
that you'll forever be with the Lord.

00:19:32.059 --> 00:19:35.580
Now, verse five, he that hath wrought us for the self,

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.719
same thing as God, who also hath given unto us

00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:41.940
the earnest of the spirit.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.059
Therefore, we are always confident,

00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:46.619
knowing that whilst we are at home in the body,

00:19:46.619 --> 00:19:49.059
we are absent from the Lord.

00:19:49.059 --> 00:19:51.080
For we walk by faith, not by sight.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.460
We are confident, I say, and willing,

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:53.779
rather to be absent from the body

00:19:53.779 --> 00:19:55.059
than to be present with the Lord.

00:19:55.059 --> 00:19:57.419
Wherefore, we labor, that whether present or absent,

00:19:57.419 --> 00:19:59.619
we may be accepted of him.

00:19:59.619 --> 00:20:01.020
Notice with me in verse.

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:04.020
He says, for we know, what is it that we know?

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.500
We know that we have a building of God.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.380
We know that this house, this building of God

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:09.820
and house that's not made with hands,

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.900
that's eternal in the heavens.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.700
Notice what he says in verse number six.

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.120
Therefore, we are always, notice, confident,

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.740
knowing that whilst we're at home in the body,

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.980
we're absent from the Lord.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.500
But then he says again in verse number eight,

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.920
we are confident, I say, and willing rather

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.460
to be absent from the body and to be present

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.300
with the Lord.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.640
It's interesting in just a few verses of scripture

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.080
in this fifth chapter of the book of 2 Corinthians

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.160
that Paul makes it known on three occasions

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.600
within nine verses, the confidence, the assurance

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.520
that we are to have as the people of God.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.700
This morning, I hope that you have that confidence.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:52.200
That as we understand what God has revealed to his people,

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.800
that we can understand as we look here

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.360
at this portion of scripture and we say,

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.700
we know, we are confident.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.000
There are some that live their lives

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.400
and all of the days, in fact, many of us

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.660
lived this way as well.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.100
Before we came to Christ, we lived fearing death.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:10.560
Why did we fear death?

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.620
Honestly, I'll speak for myself this morning.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.540
I didn't know what was gonna happen when I died.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.760
I was afraid of dying.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.800
In fact, I remember coming to the realization

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.100
as I heard the gospel and had not yet received

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.820
the Lord Jesus Christ as my personal savior,

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:30.280
I was convinced, I was absolutely assured and confident

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.040
that because I had not accepted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.720
as my savior, that if I were to die,

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.000
I'd spend eternity in the lake of fire.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.260
Why, because that's the truth of God's word.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.560
You say, well, that's cruel.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.520
No, that's what we deserve.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.760
Why, because I'm guilty and you're guilty and God is just.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:53.660
We've broken his law and that's the just punishment,

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.980
but thank God for grace and mercy.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.980
God doesn't give me what I deserve.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.440
He offers me forgiveness, which I do not deserve.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.160
He offers me redemption.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.840
And in that moment, I remember driving that road,

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.960
I can see it right now in my mind's eye,

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.480
where I was fearful of death.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.200
I knew, why, because I'd not yet accepted Christ

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.140
as my savior.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.200
There was a measure of pride in my life

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.760
on why I had not received the Lord Jesus Christ

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:22.600
as my savior.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.260
At that point in my life, and I was prideful,

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:29.020
and yet God was, the Holy Spirit was so gracious

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.500
and convincing me.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.860
The Bible says in John 16 that he convicts

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.100
and he convinces, what, of sin.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.880
I knew I was a sinner.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:41.880
Of Christ's righteousness, but also of judgment to come.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.820
And here's what the Bible says about those

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.940
that had that fear of death.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:51.020
There in Hebrews chapter two, you don't need to turn there,

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.280
but in verse number 14, it says,

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.680
for as much then as the children are partakers

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.360
of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.520
took part of the same, that through death

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.280
he might destroy him that had the power of death,

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.120
that is, the devil, and deliver them

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.520
who through fear of death were all their lifetime

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.900
subject to bondage.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.080
Listen, we know people today that fear death.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.520
They're afraid of dying.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.520
Why, because they do not know the Lord Jesus Christ

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.020
as their personal savior.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.220
They don't know what's gonna happen when they die.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.940
And here we find that Paul is speaking

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.420
to these believers in Corinth,

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.020
and for you and I this morning,

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.520
that as we understand what God has revealed to us,

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.820
if we've trusted Christ as our savior,

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:38.060
if we've been born again, we can have that same level

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.540
of confidence and we can say with assurance,

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.320
as he says in verse number eight,

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.780
we are confident, I say, and willing rather

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:50.800
to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.580
What a wonderful Bible truth.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:56.500
Notice with me, he says in verse number five,

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.080
he says, now he that hath wrought us

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.500
for the selfsame thing as God,

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.200
notice what he says at the end of verse number five,

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:07.200
who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.360
Begin to look at that phrase there in verse number five,

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.480
and we understand the Holy Spirit.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.900
If you turn to the book of Ephesians in chapter number one,

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.960
we'll look here at this truth that is given to us,

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.800
and you see the same word is used

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.040
in Ephesians chapter number one.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.440
You speak about the earnest.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.160
Maybe you've purchased a house,

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.040
or in the past at some point,

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.120
you put down some earnest money.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.160
They'll use that phraseology,

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.820
and you find here that God has given us

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:36.160
the earnest of the spirit.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:40.000
I'm thankful that at the moment of salvation,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.120
the Bible would teach us that the Holy Spirit of God

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.120
indwells us, that at the moment,

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.160
the very moment that you trust that Christ is your savior,

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.840
the Bible says that our bodies

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:55.200
are the temple of the Holy Ghost.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.720
He's in us.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.120
He indwells us, and here in Ephesians one,

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.720
notice in verse 13, the Bible says,

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.760
in whom we also trusted,

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.880
after that you heard the word of truth,

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.820
the gospel of your salvation,

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.700
in whom also after that you believed,

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:15.180
we were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise,

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.780
which is the earnest, notice what he says,

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.380
of our inheritance,

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.900
until the redemption of the purchased possession

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.380
under the praise of his glory.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.540
Listen, we have an inheritance.

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.460
The Bible says it this way in the book of 1 Peter.

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.460
As we begin to understand this inheritance,

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.780
he says that it's incorruptible and it's undefiled.

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:36.820
It fades not away.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:40.420
It's reserved in heaven for you.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.580
In 1 Peter one, in verse number four.

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.420
And here we find that in 2 Corinthians five,

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:50.820
Paul says that we have received,

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:55.640
that God has given unto us the earnest of the spirit.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.140
God's revealed some things to us this morning.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.820
And as we understand the truth of God's word

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.500
and what he's revealed to us,

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.340
yes, it helps us to understand his greatness,

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:10.220
but it gives us confidence and perspective

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:11.900
in this life.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:16.380
I remember before I got saved.

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:22.140
Some of you remember too before you got saved.

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.440
You remember what life was.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:29.440
You know, sometimes we forget when we were lost.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.320
Who did you live for?

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.940
You lived for yourself.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:34.900
What were your ambitions?

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.740
Whatever you could get here on earth.

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:40.420
The bumper sticker of years gone by,

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.700
he who dies with the most toys wins.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.740
Listen, that's an earthly perspective.

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.900
That's a temporal viewpoint.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:50.020
That's an understanding of someone

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:52.060
that has no knowledge of eternity,

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.620
but God has revealed some things to you

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.340
and to me in the pages of this precious book.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.340
And as he's revealed those things to us,

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.900
he says, I want you to understand that I have a plan.

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.580
And yes, the plan of redemption and how grateful

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.620
and it is for us to know that we're saved.

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.140
And then he says, after you're saved,

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:13.260
I have a plan for you to be my workmanship

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:16.780
that he does through us and he uses us

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.280
for his honor and for his glory

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:21.140
to bring to pass his master plan.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.380
But he says, that's not where the plan ends.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.180
You're going to be with me forever.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:29.740
I'm so thankful that our God has revealed this to us

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.580
in the pages of this precious book.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:37.100
This morning, as we notice what God has revealed to us

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.180
and what God wants us to know and to have that confidence,

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:42.500
I want you to consider second with me this morning,

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.300
notice how God's people should respond.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:49.660
How is it that you, how is it that I should respond

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:52.140
to what God has revealed to us?

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.260
When we notice within the passage that's here,

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.000
2 Corinthians chapter number five,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.260
we notice a couple of things.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.940
Number one, in the response of God's people,

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.080
there should be a longing for heaven.

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.780
I call it this, an eternal perspective.

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.580
Notice in verses two through five,

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:08.900
notice this longing for heaven.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.900
In verse number two, the Bible says this,

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:15.100
for in this we groan,

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:20.640
earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house,

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.140
which is from heaven.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.680
Notice in verse number four, he uses the phraseology again,

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.140
for we that are in this tabernacle do groan,

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.980
being burdened, not for that we would be unclothed,

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.739
but clothed upon that mortality

00:28:34.739 --> 00:28:38.020
might be swallowed up of life.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.619
You ever long for something?

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.660
I think about kids, and not that adults

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.500
don't long for something, but I think about kids,

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.900
you tell them you're gonna go on a trip, on a vacation.

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:55.179
You know, kids have a difficulty understanding time, right?

00:28:55.179 --> 00:28:56.720
Seriously, you think about some of these little kids,

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.500
you tell them that something's gonna happen in three months,

00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.960
you might as well tell them it's 30 years,

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.940
they have no concept.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:05.540
Honestly, they begin to count down,

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.020
maybe you get a calendar, kids,

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:10.500
sometimes they long for a trip, they long for Christmas.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.980
Right, a lot of kids, I remember our kids,

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:15.500
they would have these little construction paper

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.980
chain link things, you ever do this as you're a kid?

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:19.820
And you would take one off each day, why?

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.660
You're counting down the days to Christmas.

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.320
Well, there's a longing, what is it?

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.940
There's an anticipation, right?

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.540
What are this morning, are we longing for heaven?

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:34.739
I'm not saying that we are in a place where we hate life,

00:29:34.739 --> 00:29:36.960
I'm not saying that, but I'm just saying,

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.660
listen, this world is not my home.

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.300
Do we have that eternal perspective

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.080
that I'm longing for heaven?

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:47.660
That one day I'm gonna see my Savior face to face?

00:29:48.679 --> 00:29:52.179
It's not that we hate life, it's not that we're looking

00:29:52.179 --> 00:29:54.700
for a fast way out of here or whatever it might be,

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:59.260
no, it's just that I'm looking for something far better.

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.619
Because this world's not.

00:30:01.619 --> 00:30:08.819
my home. And sometimes you see those little kids that are longing for something, the anticipation

00:30:08.819 --> 00:30:13.899
and the excitement and all that goes around with it and the joy of those children and

00:30:13.899 --> 00:30:21.219
then the anticipated activity comes and oh man, what a day it is. Listen, one day you're

00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:32.739
going to see God face to face. I wonder this morning, are we longing for heaven? Sometimes

00:30:32.739 --> 00:30:40.339
if we're not careful, we can live upon the face of this earth as if this is our heaven.

00:30:40.339 --> 00:30:50.419
This is not our heaven. But if we're not careful, we can get distracted. We can get influenced.

00:30:50.419 --> 00:30:55.299
We can begin to live life with not having that eternal perspective, that longing for

00:30:55.299 --> 00:31:02.499
heaven. He says that we groan in verse two and in verse number four. I think about what

00:31:02.499 --> 00:31:06.499
Paul says, turn over to the book of Philippians if you will, and notice as Paul is writing

00:31:06.499 --> 00:31:11.659
to these believers in Philippi, he had the opportunity to have great influence in them

00:31:11.659 --> 00:31:15.939
and instruct them in the ways of the Lord and to take the gospel there to Philippi.

00:31:15.939 --> 00:31:20.539
And we find that Paul is writing to them and he's speaking about his current circumstances

00:31:20.539 --> 00:31:29.819
and his circumstances are dim. They're challenging. He's writing from prison and yet he has joy.

00:31:29.819 --> 00:31:34.499
And though he's writing from prison and he understands his circumstances, he says I want

00:31:34.499 --> 00:31:41.859
you to know that God is at work. And I want you to understand that these things that have

00:31:41.859 --> 00:31:47.259
happened to me have happened. They've fallen rather into the furtherance of the gospel.

00:31:47.259 --> 00:31:52.059
And Paul had this eternal perspective. And as Paul is writing in the first chapter to

00:31:52.059 --> 00:31:56.899
these believers, he says to them in verse 21, for to me to live is Christ and to die

00:31:56.899 --> 00:32:01.699
is gain. Notice what he says in verse 22, but if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit

00:32:01.699 --> 00:32:06.699
of my labor, yet what I shall choose I won't not. Then notice in verse 23, for I am in

00:32:06.699 --> 00:32:15.940
a straight betwixt two. What was it that's causing this circumstance or this situation

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:20.339
in Paul's life that he would describe it as being in a straight betwixt two? You've heard

00:32:20.339 --> 00:32:23.299
somebody say I'm going to between a rock and a hard place. I used to hear that all the

00:32:23.299 --> 00:32:27.379
time when I was a kid, that people would use that phraseology. And here Paul says I'm in

00:32:27.379 --> 00:32:34.419
a straight betwixt two. Notice what he says, having a desire to depart. To depart where?

00:32:34.419 --> 00:32:39.699
To depart the prison? To depart the, no, no, no, to depart, notice what he says, and

00:32:39.699 --> 00:32:45.059
to be with Christ, which is far better. Again, it's not so much that we're walking around

00:32:45.059 --> 00:32:49.399
with this death wish that we hate life, but it's understanding, listen, I'm longing to

00:32:49.399 --> 00:32:54.699
be with my Savior. I'm longing to be with my Savior. But notice what Paul says, and

00:32:54.699 --> 00:32:58.739
this is what balances it all out. He says in verse number 23 that he's in this straight

00:32:58.739 --> 00:33:03.019
betwixt two, but in verse 24 he says nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for

00:33:03.019 --> 00:33:07.220
you. What's he saying? He's saying, listen, I understand that God has a plan for my life.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:11.500
I understand that God is going to use me all the days of my life, and when God is done

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:17.580
with me, when God's plan for my life is finished, then I'm going to go be with Him. It's a wonderful

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:23.339
thing. You know how I know that God has a plan for you and for me? Because we're not

00:33:23.339 --> 00:33:28.819
with Him yet. You know what God's going to do when He's done with us? He's going to take

00:33:28.819 --> 00:33:33.899
us up to heaven. Remember what we read in Psalm 73? He gives us counsel all the days

00:33:33.899 --> 00:33:39.299
of our lives, and then He receives us to glory. It's wonderful. It's amazing. And He has a

00:33:39.299 --> 00:33:42.259
plan for you. If you're living and breathing, you've trusted Christ as your Savior this

00:33:42.259 --> 00:33:47.619
morning. God has a plan for you. If you're here this morning, you've never trusted Christ

00:33:47.619 --> 00:33:52.860
as your Savior. God's plan for you is that you'd be saved. He's not willing that any

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:58.220
should perish, but that all should come to repentance. He says that His will is that

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:05.500
all men would be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth. This morning, we find that this

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:10.899
impact upon the believers, as Paul is writing to these folks there in the city of Corinth

00:34:10.899 --> 00:34:15.779
in 2 Corinthians 5, and we notice how God's people should respond to that which God has

00:34:15.779 --> 00:34:21.380
revealed to us, there should be a longing for heaven. A longing for heaven. You know

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:24.820
what happens when we have a longing for heaven? I mentioned already that the things of this

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:31.179
world grow strangely dim. We kind of hold on loosely to things of this earth. They don't

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:38.899
matter as much. Why? Because I have a longing for heaven. This world is not my home. This

00:34:38.899 --> 00:34:43.380
morning, we find not only a longing for heaven as we look at our text of Scripture, but I

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:49.220
believe also, number two, a living in light of eternity. I have a longing for heaven,

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:54.459
an eternal perspective, but I better live in light of eternity. I better live a life

00:34:54.459 --> 00:34:59.419
that is pleasing to the Lord. Notice again in verse number eight, Paul says, we are confident,

00:34:59.419 --> 00:35:04.899
I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord.

00:35:04.899 --> 00:35:10.820
Then notice verse number nine, wherefore we labor that whether present or absent, notice

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:17.979
this phrase, we may be accepted of him. We find that he then immediately, we won't take

00:35:17.979 --> 00:35:22.419
the time this morning, but immediately in verses 10 and following, he begins dealing

00:35:22.419 --> 00:35:27.739
with the fact that we're going to appear before the Lord Jesus Christ. If you're saved

00:35:27.739 --> 00:35:32.339
this morning, he's speaking in verse number 10 about the bema seat or the judgment seat

00:35:32.339 --> 00:35:38.380
of Christ. And he says in verse number nine that, that, that we have this understanding.

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:43.940
I have this confidence. I'm, I'm aware of the truth because God has revealed it to me

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:50.059
that I'm going to be absent from the body and present with the Lord, but I better labor

00:35:50.059 --> 00:35:54.699
so that whether I'm present or absent, I would be accepted of him. The last two Sunday

00:35:54.699 --> 00:36:01.459
evenings we've dealt with the subject matter of the example of Enoch. He had this testimony.

00:36:01.459 --> 00:36:07.739
He walked with God. What did he do? He had a testimony that says he pleased the Lord.

00:36:07.739 --> 00:36:15.299
He pleased the Lord. Last week we spoke about those that, that turned away and went no longer

00:36:15.299 --> 00:36:21.459
with Jesus, but how we need to set our attention, our, our, our focus, our eyes upon the Lord

00:36:21.459 --> 00:36:25.139
Jesus Christ and walk with him all the days of our lives that we might be pleasing in

00:36:25.139 --> 00:36:29.139
his sight. And here, as Paul would say, that we might be accepted of him, that we might

00:36:29.139 --> 00:36:36.299
be pleasing in his sight. Listen, I'm thankful that heaven is my home. Listen, your eternity

00:36:36.299 --> 00:36:43.540
with it being the truth of going to heaven was settled at the cross. This morning, if

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:47.899
you've accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior, you've understood that,

00:36:47.899 --> 00:36:52.500
that you were a sinner and that Jesus is the only savior and you placed your faith and

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:59.579
trust in the finished work of Christ alone. You're not going to try to help God. You can't

00:36:59.579 --> 00:37:08.059
help God. He did it all. He said, it is finished. The word literally means paid in full. Paul

00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:14.500
said that we do not frustrate the grace of God, that if, if, if salvation came by works,

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:22.459
then Christ is dead in vain. My savior did not die in vain. He died because it was the

00:37:22.459 --> 00:37:28.779
only way for mankind to be redeemed. I'm helpless and hopeless outside of the cross of Calvary

00:37:28.779 --> 00:37:36.779
and an empty tomb. And this morning, if you've trusted Christ, heaven is your home. But the

00:37:36.779 --> 00:37:43.100
question is whether we'll be pleasing in his sight. The question here in second Corinthians

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:47.579
five is not whether I'm going to heaven or not. The question is whether we're going to be

00:37:47.579 --> 00:37:53.100
pleasing. You've read, well done, thou good and faithful servant. We hear that phraseology often

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:58.179
as we'd refer to the gospels. And we find here this morning that we're to live in light of eternity,

00:37:58.179 --> 00:38:03.019
that I'm going to see my savior face to face. And, and I want to be accepted of him. I want

00:38:03.019 --> 00:38:08.299
to be a time in which John would say it this way in first John chapter two, that I would not be

00:38:08.299 --> 00:38:17.419
ashamed before him it is appearing. Children, sometimes I've used the analogy before. I

00:38:17.419 --> 00:38:23.859
remember as a kid myself being in this circumstance or the situation where you would be ashamed at

00:38:23.859 --> 00:38:29.339
the appearing of someone that is in a place of authority. Why? Because you were doing something

00:38:29.419 --> 00:38:35.820
you weren't supposed to do. You weren't found doing what you were left responsible for doing.

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:40.580
A parent leaves and they say, Hey, take care of these things. And we'll be back at this time.

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:45.059
There's this thing called procrastination that kids are really good at. You do all sorts of

00:38:45.059 --> 00:38:50.820
other things. And a little boy that ate the cookie that mom said not to eat and had the crumbs all

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:56.900
over. And he said, I didn't eat it. Right. Or mom walks in just as you're taking a bite. And then

00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:00.859
you think you outgrow that. And your wife makes a really good meal and says, now, listen, don't

00:39:00.859 --> 00:39:05.059
mess around with that stuff. No taste testing before the guests get here. And you just want

00:39:05.059 --> 00:39:11.619
to take a little bite. I jokingly said just a couple of weeks ago, well, I took one of the

00:39:11.619 --> 00:39:15.659
cookies because I could rearrange on the platter and you wouldn't be able to tell that I took a

00:39:15.659 --> 00:39:20.539
cookie. But on the other dessert that Holly made, there was no way I could take a piece of that

00:39:20.539 --> 00:39:25.940
because it would be abundantly obvious that there was a piece missing from the pie or it wasn't a

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:31.739
pie. It was a strawberry pretzel dessert cake. Man, if you ever had that, it's good. Amen. But I had to

00:39:31.739 --> 00:39:38.299
take a cookie because I could try to rearrange. And then I told on myself. But listen, I don't

00:39:38.299 --> 00:39:44.900
want to be ashamed at his appearing. He's coming again. His plan is revealed to us in his work.

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:50.580
Listen, there is nothing that you're going to do to change God's plan. Remember what we said

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:57.580
with the plan of redemption. Satan did everything within his power to thwart the plan of God.

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:01.659
Unsuccessful. God's plan of redemption is complete.

00:40:01.659 --> 00:40:06.819
And this morning, Jesus is coming again, I'm thankful for that truth.

00:40:06.819 --> 00:40:11.419
But we must understand that as we look at this portion of scripture, that our response

00:40:11.419 --> 00:40:15.499
to this, what God has revealed is that there's a longing for heaven.

00:40:15.499 --> 00:40:19.279
He says that we groan, that we have this longing, I'm going to straight betwixt two, having

00:40:19.279 --> 00:40:23.319
a desire to depart to be with Christ, which is far better.

00:40:23.319 --> 00:40:29.619
But there ought to be an impact in our lives on how we live daily.

00:40:29.619 --> 00:40:30.619
Why?

00:40:30.619 --> 00:40:34.939
Well, because His return is imminent.

00:40:34.939 --> 00:40:36.979
Why?

00:40:36.979 --> 00:40:42.499
I like to say it this way because David said it this way, he was being hunted by Saul,

00:40:42.499 --> 00:40:47.959
and he made this statement, there's but a step between me and death.

00:40:47.959 --> 00:40:51.299
You know, in a very real way for each of us here this morning, there's but a step between

00:40:51.299 --> 00:40:53.599
me and death.

00:40:53.599 --> 00:40:58.179
You say, oh, I'm young, I got energy, I got good health, I was just at the doctor, I was

00:40:58.179 --> 00:40:59.179
this, I was that.

00:40:59.419 --> 00:41:01.899
There's but a step between you and death.

00:41:01.899 --> 00:41:10.179
And this morning, what God has revealed to us better impact how we live our lives.

00:41:10.179 --> 00:41:13.459
Notice with me a few portions of scripture, go to the book of Titus if you will, we'll

00:41:13.459 --> 00:41:16.559
look at three portions of scripture, and we'll close this morning.

00:41:16.559 --> 00:41:20.699
Look at Titus chapter number two.

00:41:20.699 --> 00:41:25.859
I'm thankful for God's grace.

00:41:25.859 --> 00:41:31.219
We all know that Brother Don's favorite song is Amazing Grace, in fact, he has it around

00:41:31.219 --> 00:41:37.039
his neck today, he's got a tie that says Amazing Grace on it.

00:41:37.039 --> 00:41:41.059
We think about that grace of God as it's mentioned to us here in Titus in chapter two in verse

00:41:41.059 --> 00:41:42.059
number 11.

00:41:42.059 --> 00:41:48.279
Notice what the Bible says, for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared

00:41:48.279 --> 00:41:49.279
to all men.

00:41:49.279 --> 00:41:52.059
Isn't that a wonderful verse of scripture?

00:41:52.059 --> 00:41:56.739
The grace of God which bringeth salvation, for by grace are you saved through faith is

00:41:56.739 --> 00:42:01.139
what Ephesians two in verse eight says, and we find here this is the grace of God that

00:42:01.139 --> 00:42:05.979
bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men.

00:42:05.979 --> 00:42:08.759
I'm thankful for God's grace.

00:42:08.759 --> 00:42:12.819
I'm thankful to be aware of God's grace.

00:42:12.819 --> 00:42:17.819
To not live in some place where they do not have a Bible, where they do not have a preacher,

00:42:17.819 --> 00:42:20.659
where they do not have the knowledge of God's grace.

00:42:20.659 --> 00:42:25.379
And here this morning we sit in a place where we hear about the grace of God, but notice

00:42:25.379 --> 00:42:28.619
it brings salvation, it's appeared to all men, but notice what he says in verse number

00:42:28.619 --> 00:42:38.699
12, teaching us, God's grace teaches us some things, denying ungodliness and worldly lust.

00:42:38.699 --> 00:42:47.219
Notice what he says, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world.

00:42:47.219 --> 00:42:50.259
God's given us a prescription right there in verse number 12 as to how we're to live

00:42:50.259 --> 00:42:51.379
our lives.

00:42:51.379 --> 00:42:53.299
It's God's grace that teaches us that.

00:42:53.299 --> 00:42:56.379
You know what's sad about the false teachers?

00:42:56.379 --> 00:42:57.379
You know what they do?

00:42:57.379 --> 00:43:03.459
According to the book of Jude, they turn the grace of God into lasciviousness.

00:43:03.459 --> 00:43:08.579
You know, that word is not something that we use commonly in our everyday language,

00:43:08.579 --> 00:43:12.059
but lasciviousness, it means unbridled lust.

00:43:12.059 --> 00:43:14.179
Do whatever you want to do.

00:43:14.179 --> 00:43:18.319
They turn the grace of God into lasciviousness, but notice what God says that the grace of

00:43:18.319 --> 00:43:19.319
God teaches us.

00:43:19.319 --> 00:43:23.839
Yes, it brings salvation, but it teaches us that we're to deny ungodliness and worldly

00:43:23.839 --> 00:43:29.519
lust and that we are to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world.

00:43:29.519 --> 00:43:31.199
Why?

00:43:31.199 --> 00:43:38.039
Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior,

00:43:38.039 --> 00:43:39.519
Jesus Christ.

00:43:39.519 --> 00:43:43.719
Listen, are you looking for his return?

00:43:43.719 --> 00:43:45.399
I hope you are.

00:43:45.399 --> 00:43:48.239
We're groaning, we're longing for heaven.

00:43:48.239 --> 00:43:54.599
Listen, I'm listening for the trumpet, I'm anxious to hear the sound of the trumpet.

00:43:54.599 --> 00:43:59.559
As it's said in Revelation 4, John, he says he hears, as it were, a voice of a trumpet

00:43:59.559 --> 00:44:02.839
saying, come up hither.

00:44:02.839 --> 00:44:06.639
And here we find that he says that we're to be looking for that blessed hope.

00:44:06.639 --> 00:44:11.959
Listen, the hope that we find in the Bible, that word, it's not how they use the word

00:44:11.959 --> 00:44:12.959
today.

00:44:13.519 --> 00:44:17.879
This word, this Bible word, hope, it's a precious word and it means that it's a confident

00:44:17.879 --> 00:44:20.879
expectation based on revealed truth.

00:44:20.879 --> 00:44:23.679
That's what we have.

00:44:23.679 --> 00:44:27.679
So often today we say hope, we hope we're going to have this or we hope this is going

00:44:27.679 --> 00:44:33.039
to happen or we hope that's going to happen, but listen, that's not the way that the Bible

00:44:33.039 --> 00:44:37.119
uses the word hope.

00:44:37.119 --> 00:44:40.799
Jesus is coming again, I'm going to be with him for all of eternity.

00:44:40.799 --> 00:44:46.399
Notice in verse 14, who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity

00:44:46.399 --> 00:44:50.679
and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.

00:44:50.679 --> 00:44:54.319
These things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority, let no man despise them.

00:44:54.319 --> 00:45:00.379
It's interesting in this few verses of scripture in Titus, it covers the scope of the three

00:45:00.379 --> 00:45:05.119
messages that I've preached on God's plan, the plan of redemption, the plan of being

00:45:05.119 --> 00:45:08.599
his workmanship and the plan that we're going to be with him for all of eternity.

00:45:08.599 --> 00:45:13.559
It's revealed in these few verses right here in the book of Titus in chapter number two.

00:45:13.559 --> 00:45:16.559
I'm so thankful for God's plan.

00:45:16.559 --> 00:45:19.419
It teaches us that we're to live in light of eternity.

00:45:19.419 --> 00:45:23.199
Look over at second Peter chapter number three, I mentioned by way of introduction that we'd

00:45:23.199 --> 00:45:28.399
come to this portion of scripture, we will not take the time to read the first 13 verses

00:45:28.399 --> 00:45:29.399
of this chapter.

00:45:29.399 --> 00:45:32.439
I just want to draw your attention to a few things very quickly.

00:45:32.439 --> 00:45:36.719
As we close this morning in verse number three, the Bible says this in second Peter chapter

00:45:36.719 --> 00:45:41.679
number three in verse number three, knowing this first that there shall come in the last

00:45:41.679 --> 00:45:44.519
days scoffers walking after their own lusts.

00:45:44.519 --> 00:45:45.519
Notice what they're saying.

00:45:45.519 --> 00:45:47.759
Where is the promise of his coming?

00:45:47.759 --> 00:45:49.839
And they say, for instance, the father's fell asleep.

00:45:49.839 --> 00:45:54.119
All things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.

00:45:54.119 --> 00:45:57.319
And then it tells us for this, they willingly are ignorant of that.

00:45:57.319 --> 00:46:01.039
By the word of God, the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and

00:46:01.039 --> 00:46:05.519
in the water, whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished.

00:46:05.519 --> 00:46:10.039
And so we find that there's some scoffers are speaking about the fact that Jesus has

00:46:10.039 --> 00:46:11.259
not come yet.

00:46:11.259 --> 00:46:15.599
But notice in verse number nine, the Bible says this, the Lord is not slack concerning

00:46:15.599 --> 00:46:19.839
us promise as some men count slackness, but as long suffering to us, we're not willing

00:46:19.839 --> 00:46:22.959
that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

00:46:22.959 --> 00:46:24.519
And what a precious verse that is.

00:46:24.519 --> 00:46:32.159
But then notice the very next verse 10, but the day of the Lord, what's it say will come.

00:46:32.159 --> 00:46:36.459
Thou is a thief in the night and the, which the heaven shall pass away with a great noise

00:46:36.459 --> 00:46:38.839
and the elements shall melt with fervent heat.

00:46:38.839 --> 00:46:43.879
The earth also shall the also, and the works that are therein shall be burned up.

00:46:43.879 --> 00:46:48.699
But then knowing this, understanding this plan, notice the impact that it has on living

00:46:48.699 --> 00:46:49.759
in light of eternity.

00:46:49.759 --> 00:46:58.199
In verse number 11, it says, seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved.

00:46:58.199 --> 00:47:05.999
What matter of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness?

00:47:05.999 --> 00:47:10.819
You know what he said earlier, as he's writing the same group of people in the first letter

00:47:10.819 --> 00:47:16.039
that he writes to them in first Peter chapter number one, he tells them in verse 14 as obedient

00:47:16.039 --> 00:47:20.239
children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust and your ignorance, but

00:47:20.239 --> 00:47:22.359
as he, which hath called you as holy.

00:47:22.359 --> 00:47:24.679
So be ye holy in all manner of conversation.

00:47:24.679 --> 00:47:25.679
Why?

00:47:25.679 --> 00:47:28.919
Why shouldn't be holy for I am holy.

00:47:28.919 --> 00:47:35.319
And Peter says, listen, that you understand these things, knowing that these things shall

00:47:35.319 --> 00:47:36.319
happen.

00:47:36.319 --> 00:47:43.579
What matter of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness?

00:47:43.579 --> 00:47:51.599
Notice in verse 14, what the Bible says, wherefore beloved, seeing that ye look for such things.

00:47:52.199 --> 00:47:56.879
Isn't it amazing that the assumption of Peter is that the people that he's writing to that

00:47:56.879 --> 00:48:01.239
are saved people are going to be looking for these things?

00:48:01.239 --> 00:48:02.239
Why does he assume that?

00:48:02.239 --> 00:48:07.719
Well, Titus looking for that blessed hope and glorious appearing of our Lord, right?

00:48:07.719 --> 00:48:11.799
So we understand there's this anticipation, this longing, but it affects how we live our

00:48:11.799 --> 00:48:13.119
daily lives.

00:48:13.119 --> 00:48:18.639
He says, wherefore beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye

00:48:18.639 --> 00:48:21.559
may be found of him, how?

00:48:21.559 --> 00:48:26.319
In peace, without spot and blameless.

00:48:26.319 --> 00:48:32.359
Wow, it's a tall order.

00:48:32.359 --> 00:48:37.119
Impossible for you or for me to do in ourselves, but with the help of the Holy Spirit, the

00:48:37.119 --> 00:48:44.519
guidance of his word, we can live a life that is pleasing to the Lord as we live in light

00:48:44.519 --> 00:48:49.899
of eternity, that we understand that one day we're going to see him.

00:48:49.899 --> 00:48:53.839
And he says that since we're looking for these things, since we understand this plan that

00:48:53.839 --> 00:48:58.739
God has revealed to us in his word, that it impacts how I respond and how I live my life.

00:48:58.739 --> 00:49:05.440
And he says, be diligent that ye may be found in him in peace, without spot and blameless.

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.759
Be diligent.

00:49:08.759 --> 00:49:16.039
Every day we should live as if it might be today, it might be today.

00:49:16.039 --> 00:49:20.639
Listen, that's a warning to a lost person.

00:49:20.639 --> 00:49:25.799
If you've not trusted Christ your Savior today, the Bible says today is the day of salvation.

00:49:25.799 --> 00:49:28.039
Boast not thyself of tomorrow.

00:49:28.039 --> 00:49:30.759
We read that in Proverbs 27.

00:49:30.759 --> 00:49:37.079
We use those verses with regard to the importance, the urgency of salvation and redemption so

00:49:37.079 --> 00:49:40.879
that we'd have that confidence that heaven is our home.

00:49:40.879 --> 00:49:49.279
But you know, as saved people, today might be the day that the trumpet of the Lord sounds

00:49:49.279 --> 00:49:53.199
or that my heart stops beating and I enter into eternity.

00:49:53.199 --> 00:49:58.399
I'm thankful that I'll see him face to face, but I wonder each day, am I being diligent

00:49:58.399 --> 00:50:01.599
that I'd be found in that matter?

00:50:01.599 --> 00:50:04.739
by living, as we read in 2 Corinthians chapter number five,

00:50:04.739 --> 00:50:06.539
that whether present or absent,

00:50:06.539 --> 00:50:08.959
that we would be accepted of him.

00:50:08.959 --> 00:50:12.399
Again, we find, and I referenced in 1 John chapter two,

00:50:12.399 --> 00:50:14.919
in verse number 28, if you turn there,

00:50:14.919 --> 00:50:16.879
we'll finish with this portion of scripture,

00:50:16.879 --> 00:50:19.239
but in 1 John chapter two, in verse number 28,

00:50:19.239 --> 00:50:23.359
the Bible tells us again about the return of the Lord,

00:50:23.359 --> 00:50:27.239
and obviously that we will be with him forever.

00:50:27.239 --> 00:50:29.479
The Bible says in verse 28 of 1 John chapter two,

00:50:29.479 --> 00:50:31.919
and now, little children, abide in him,

00:50:31.919 --> 00:50:35.679
that when he shall appear, we may have confidence,

00:50:35.679 --> 00:50:36.519
notice what he says,

00:50:36.519 --> 00:50:40.599
and not be ashamed before him at his coming.

00:50:42.439 --> 00:50:46.379
Not be ashamed before him at his coming.

00:50:46.379 --> 00:50:47.879
If you know that he is righteous,

00:50:47.879 --> 00:50:48.959
do you know that this morning?

00:50:48.959 --> 00:50:50.519
Of course we do.

00:50:50.519 --> 00:50:52.339
You know that everyone that doeth righteousness

00:50:52.339 --> 00:50:53.179
is born of him.

00:50:53.179 --> 00:50:56.879
Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us

00:50:56.919 --> 00:51:00.039
that we should be called the sons of God.

00:51:00.039 --> 00:51:01.559
Therefore, the world knoweth us not,

00:51:01.559 --> 00:51:02.479
because it knew him not.

00:51:02.479 --> 00:51:04.719
Beloved, notice verse two of chapter three.

00:51:04.719 --> 00:51:07.879
Beloved, now are we the sons of God.

00:51:07.879 --> 00:51:11.879
Wow, what a privilege to know the Lord,

00:51:13.759 --> 00:51:15.279
to be called the sons of God.

00:51:15.279 --> 00:51:18.439
It says, it doth not yet appear what we shall be,

00:51:18.439 --> 00:51:19.939
but notice again, we know that,

00:51:19.939 --> 00:51:21.939
why God keeps revealing these things to us.

00:51:21.939 --> 00:51:24.759
When he shall appear, we shall be like him,

00:51:24.759 --> 00:51:26.779
for we shall see him as he is.

00:51:27.999 --> 00:51:30.559
And every man that hath this hope in him,

00:51:30.559 --> 00:51:34.859
purifieth himself, even as he is pure.

00:51:37.039 --> 00:51:40.819
This morning, God's revealed truth to us

00:51:40.819 --> 00:51:42.159
with regard to his plan.

00:51:46.039 --> 00:51:49.039
And that plan that he's revealed to us

00:51:49.039 --> 00:51:51.259
of being with him for all of eternity

00:51:51.259 --> 00:51:54.479
ought to cause us to have great excitement and joy.

00:51:54.999 --> 00:51:55.919
It ought to cause us this morning

00:51:55.919 --> 00:52:00.919
to have this level of anticipation.

00:52:01.679 --> 00:52:04.219
One day I'm gonna see him face to face.

00:52:04.219 --> 00:52:05.879
But what he's revealed to us

00:52:05.879 --> 00:52:08.559
ought to impact how we live every day.

00:52:08.559 --> 00:52:10.799
We have a longing, but we ought to live

00:52:10.799 --> 00:52:12.019
in light of eternity.

00:52:13.039 --> 00:52:15.559
Somebody told me this years and years and years ago.

00:52:15.559 --> 00:52:17.559
I wasn't even saved when they said this.

00:52:18.559 --> 00:52:20.639
I was probably, I won't tell you how old I was,

00:52:20.639 --> 00:52:22.919
it was probably 30 years ago.

00:52:25.479 --> 00:52:27.879
It was the church where my parents

00:52:27.879 --> 00:52:30.519
trusted Christ as their savior.

00:52:30.519 --> 00:52:34.319
And in that church, there was a large military presence.

00:52:34.319 --> 00:52:37.979
It was not far from several military bases.

00:52:39.259 --> 00:52:43.239
And I was just a young teenager at the time,

00:52:43.239 --> 00:52:45.959
and this man was talking to another man,

00:52:45.959 --> 00:52:47.239
and I was just there in their presence.

00:52:47.239 --> 00:52:50.679
They were probably in their early 20s, young Marines.

00:52:50.679 --> 00:52:52.519
This man made this statement.

00:52:54.679 --> 00:52:57.119
It didn't really matter how he lived his life.

00:52:57.119 --> 00:53:00.639
All that mattered was that one day he'd be in heaven.

00:53:00.639 --> 00:53:01.519
And I remember hearing that.

00:53:01.519 --> 00:53:02.919
I wasn't even a saved person,

00:53:02.919 --> 00:53:04.959
but I thought how weird that is.

00:53:06.939 --> 00:53:08.239
How weird that is.

00:53:08.239 --> 00:53:09.079
Why?

00:53:10.599 --> 00:53:13.539
Because I don't wanna just get to heaven.

00:53:14.719 --> 00:53:17.799
I'm thankful that because of redemption,

00:53:17.799 --> 00:53:20.779
I will spend forever in heaven.

00:53:20.779 --> 00:53:22.199
But I wanna be accepted of him.

00:53:22.199 --> 00:53:25.039
I wanna be pleasing in his sight.

00:53:25.959 --> 00:53:29.679
I wanna live every day knowing that today could be the day.

00:53:29.679 --> 00:53:33.879
Listen, honestly, I don't wanna be ashamed at his appearing.

00:53:33.879 --> 00:53:34.719
I don't.

00:53:35.799 --> 00:53:36.759
And I hope this morning,

00:53:36.759 --> 00:53:39.539
you don't wanna be ashamed at his appearing.

00:53:39.539 --> 00:53:41.879
You say, what would cause me to be ashamed?

00:53:41.879 --> 00:53:43.279
There's some things that could cause people

00:53:43.279 --> 00:53:44.399
to be ashamed at his appearing.

00:53:44.399 --> 00:53:47.479
I believe that since he told us in 1 John 2,

00:53:47.479 --> 00:53:49.159
it's absolutely possible there are gonna be some people

00:53:49.159 --> 00:53:51.639
that are gonna be ashamed at his appearing.

00:53:51.639 --> 00:53:53.239
And I hope that wouldn't be you.

00:53:54.119 --> 00:53:55.959
This morning, if the Holy Spirit

00:53:55.959 --> 00:53:57.959
maybe has convicted you of something,

00:53:58.919 --> 00:54:01.839
man, get that right with God.

00:54:01.839 --> 00:54:04.199
I don't wanna be ashamed at his appearing.

00:54:04.199 --> 00:54:06.039
Rejoice that heaven is your home.

00:54:07.119 --> 00:54:09.279
But when you respond to what he's revealed to us,

00:54:09.279 --> 00:54:11.859
that we'd live godly lives,

00:54:13.039 --> 00:54:15.679
that we'd live lives that are pleasing in his sight.

00:54:17.039 --> 00:54:19.519
This morning, if you're not saved,

00:54:19.519 --> 00:54:22.079
man, today is the day of salvation.

00:54:22.079 --> 00:54:23.079
God has a plan.

00:54:24.039 --> 00:54:26.639
His plan starts with redemption.

00:54:27.599 --> 00:54:32.119
And then you are his workers, we are his workmanship.

00:54:32.119 --> 00:54:34.559
And then we find one day we'll be in heaven

00:54:34.559 --> 00:54:37.239
for all of eternity, seeing him face to face.

00:54:37.239 --> 00:54:38.779
Isn't that wonderful?

00:54:38.779 --> 00:54:41.639
This morning, present with the Lord.

00:54:41.639 --> 00:54:42.479
Let's pray.

00:54:42.479 --> 00:54:43.319
Father, we love you.

00:54:43.319 --> 00:54:44.319
Thank you for loving us.

00:54:44.319 --> 00:54:45.839
Thank you for your word.

00:54:45.839 --> 00:54:47.879
We thank you for the truth of your word.

00:54:47.879 --> 00:54:49.359
God, if there's one here that's not saved,

00:54:50.199 --> 00:54:52.199
I pray that today they'd be saved.

00:54:52.199 --> 00:54:55.359
God, I pray that many of your people this morning

00:54:55.359 --> 00:54:56.919
that are saved, that have trusted you,

00:54:56.919 --> 00:54:59.519
Lord, they would rejoice in this truth

00:54:59.519 --> 00:55:02.159
that you've revealed to us of your plan

00:55:03.079 --> 00:55:04.659
with regard to eternity.

00:55:05.659 --> 00:55:08.959
Maybe there's something in our lives, Lord,

00:55:08.959 --> 00:55:11.919
that you've pointed out that we need to deal with.

00:55:14.159 --> 00:55:17.159
That we would not be ashamed at your appearing.

00:55:17.159 --> 00:55:18.759
I pray, Lord, that we do business with you,

00:55:19.159 --> 00:55:22.079
that we'd be honest and humble before you.

00:55:22.079 --> 00:55:24.199
I pray that you'd help us to live every day of our lives

00:55:24.199 --> 00:55:25.439
in light of eternity.

00:55:26.839 --> 00:55:28.319
We'll thank you for the work that you'll do,

00:55:28.319 --> 00:55:29.559
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:55:29.559 --> 00:55:30.399
Would you stand with me?

00:55:30.399 --> 00:55:31.959
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:55:31.959 --> 00:55:33.679
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano,

00:55:33.679 --> 00:55:35.659
and as she does, the altar is open.

00:55:35.659 --> 00:55:37.039
If you're not sure of heaven,

00:55:37.039 --> 00:55:38.719
we'll take a Bible and show you how you can know for sure

00:55:38.719 --> 00:55:40.159
that heaven's your home.

00:55:40.159 --> 00:55:42.119
Maybe you just need to come and thank God for his plan.

00:55:42.119 --> 00:55:44.979
Thank God that one day you'll see him face to face.

00:55:46.079 --> 00:55:48.239
Maybe this morning, God convicted you,

00:55:48.239 --> 00:55:50.639
and you need to come and get something right with him

00:55:50.639 --> 00:55:52.239
so we would not be ashamed of his appearing.

00:55:52.239 --> 00:55:54.239
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
