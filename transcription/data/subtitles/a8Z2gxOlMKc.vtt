WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
Chapter number 20 this evening, Genesis chapter number 20, and as we look at this portion

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.880
of scripture, we'll be looking at the entirety of the chapter this evening.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.600
And we've been studying through the book of Genesis periodically here over the last couple

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.180
of years, and there'll be certain periods of time in which we're very consistent week

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.239
after week right there in the book of Genesis, and then there are other times in which we'll

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:22.559
stray away for a little while and then get back to the book.

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:28.000
This is our 52nd lesson through the book of Genesis, and I have thoroughly enjoyed the

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.459
study and trust that you have as well.

00:00:30.459 --> 00:00:34.599
And here as we get to Genesis chapter number 20, we're really reminded of an event that

00:00:34.599 --> 00:00:39.400
took place back in Genesis chapter number 12 in the life of Abraham and Sarah.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.840
Of course, at that particular time, their names were Abram and Sarai.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.840
Their names had not yet been changed, but as we think back to that event that was recorded

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.619
back in Genesis chapter number 12, we are told that there was a great famine and they

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:58.180
traveled to Egypt, and as they would travel to Egypt because of that great famine, we

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.979
find that Sarah was taken into Pharaoh's home.

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:08.339
And we find that it was because of what Abraham said of Sarah, she is my sister.

00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:13.580
And we spoke about that portion of scripture, and we talked about the way in which God intervened

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.339
in Genesis chapter number 12, and as we looked at that portion of scripture in Genesis chapter

00:01:18.339 --> 00:01:24.019
number 12, we made several observations from that passage, but one of the things that we

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:27.739
noted was that our God is able, amen?

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:33.779
We don't have to use some type of story and use some type of deception as which Abram

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:36.860
and Sarah did there in Genesis chapter number 12.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.919
I believe with all of my heart that as Abraham was fearful because of Sarah, that he'd go

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.040
into that place, and because of her being beautiful, they would kill him for her, and

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.800
I believe that he had that fear, but I believe with all of my heart that Abraham could have

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.720
walked right into that place and said, she's my wife, what are you going to do about it?

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.120
Because God is able, amen?

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.660
Because God is able.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.600
And I dealt with that in Genesis chapter number 12, and I asked this question at the end of

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.679
that study, I wonder if as we look at that portion of scripture, and we look at that

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:20.800
event historically, and we make some application for our lives, I wonder if Abraham would learn

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.800
a lesson.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.160
Now, we could answer the question because we have the Bible, and we know that in Genesis

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.240
chapter number 20, as we'll study this evening, he does the same thing, but you know there

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.059
are times in your life and in my life when we make the same mistake more than once, amen?

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:42.740
And perhaps when we make that mistake, we fail to live by faith, we fail to trust God,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.160
and we see God work, and we see God intervene, and we say, man, I'm going to learn my lesson,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.179
but then the circumstances may change, and it may be a period of time, and we go down

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:56.179
the same path, and we doubt God.

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:58.740
Listen, God knows that we're but flesh.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.279
I'm not saying that to make an excuse for our failures, but I'm simply saying that God

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:05.580
knows our frame, amen?

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.660
As we look here at the account in Genesis chapter number 20, we would find that between

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.860
the time in Genesis chapter number 12 and the time in which we're looking here in Genesis

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.779
chapter number 20, nearly 25 years had passed.

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:22.339
In Genesis chapter number 12, the Bible tells us in that portion of Scripture that Abraham

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:24.399
is 75 years old.

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:29.539
As best we can tell, in Genesis chapter number 20, he's somewhere between 99 and 100.

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:33.639
We understand that if you look at the passage of Scripture, you'll find that just a few

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:37.759
chapters earlier, we're told of him being 99 years old, and then when you get into chapter

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:41.600
number 21, and you deal with the birth of Isaac, he's 100.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.600
And so he's somewhere between 99 and 100, he's probably closer to 100 than 99, but the

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.520
reality is that 25 years is a long time.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:04:00.860
And in those 25 years, God had proven himself to Abraham over and over and over, amen?

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.580
God had demonstrated his power to Abraham in amazing ways.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.940
We find that as we would think about this period of time, 25 years in which he'd experienced

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.660
so much, and as we look at the same mistake being made, the same deception being given

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.839
to Abimelech that was given to Pharaoh here in Genesis chapter number 20, we could ask

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:26.100
ourselves questions such as, how did this happen?

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.739
Did he not learn his lesson last time?

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:33.500
After all that God did for him, after all that God revealed to him, how is it that he

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.739
could still behave in this manner?

00:04:36.739 --> 00:04:41.220
And I would simply offer a single word as an answer, and it's flesh.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.459
It's what we dealt with this morning.

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:45.739
Crucify your flesh.

00:04:45.739 --> 00:04:46.739
Crucify your flesh.

00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:52.059
And so we think about this portion of Scripture as, by way of introduction before we get into

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:55.660
the chapter, I want you to be mindful, and I'm just going to go very quickly through

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.820
these events and just really kind of highlight several things, but I want you to be mindful

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.480
that at the end of Genesis chapter number 12, God worked in such a supernatural way

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.260
in order to restore Sarah to Abraham in the life of Pharaoh that no doubt Abraham saw

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.459
the hand of God.

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:16.420
Abraham saw God work in a very distinct way.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.980
In Genesis chapter number 13, we find that God gives that land to Abraham.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.019
Remember, he'd promised him a land, and we find that as you study chapter number 13,

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:29.380
that that land is given, we're mindful of the fact in which in chapter number 14, there

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:36.980
was that coalition, if you will, of army, those men that took captive Lot and many others,

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.420
and we find that God gave great victory to Abraham.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.739
Remember, he took those trained servants from his home, and it was in that portion of Scripture

00:05:44.739 --> 00:05:50.459
in which Abraham understood that God is the possessor of heaven and earth.

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:55.619
It was in that portion of Scripture in which God revealed to Abraham that he's El Elyon,

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:57.660
the most high God.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:04.140
It's in that portion of Scripture before this man Abraham would ever meet the king that

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.100
he would meet after the great victory and go through meeting the king of Salem that

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:16.140
he would meet, excuse me, the king of Sodom that he would meet the king of Salem, Mephibosheth.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.779
Not Mephibosheth, that was a mistake, amen?

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:24.179
He did not meet Mephibosheth, that's over in the book, in David's life.

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:30.059
It was there that he would meet, there in chapter number 13, that he would meet, somebody

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:32.179
help me out here, who is it that he's going to meet?

00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:33.179
Who is it?

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:34.179
Melchizedek.

00:06:34.179 --> 00:06:35.179
Melchizedek.

00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:36.179
What in the world?

00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:39.299
All I could keep thinking is Mephibosheth, and you ever get something stuck in your brain

00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:42.380
and like nothing else kind of can fit in your brain at that point?

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:48.779
And so, he of course goes, and remember, when he comes into that place in Genesis chapter

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:54.859
number 13, that we find that it's there in which he finds that God is the most high God,

00:06:54.859 --> 00:07:00.299
he's the possessor of heaven and earth, we find that God will tell Abraham in that portion

00:07:00.299 --> 00:07:05.739
of Scripture as Melchizedek will reveal these truths to him, and then we find that God tells

00:07:05.739 --> 00:07:13.739
Abraham in Genesis chapter number 15, fear not, I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great

00:07:13.739 --> 00:07:14.739
reward.

00:07:14.739 --> 00:07:23.299
So, oh, God is proving himself to Abraham, and we find that as he makes that covenant

00:07:23.299 --> 00:07:30.260
in chapter number 15, and he proves himself there to Abraham with regard again to a land

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:36.619
and to a seed, and we come to chapter number 16, and yes, we read about the birth of Ishmael,

00:07:36.619 --> 00:07:42.100
and we find there in that portion of Scripture, after many years had passed, that Abraham

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:47.540
and Sarah, they make this decision, but we find that after those ten years, that Ishmael

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:52.660
would be born, and God reiterates his promise to Abraham.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:58.660
Abraham, though you've operated outside of what I've communicated to you, my will for

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:03.140
you has not yet changed, and here's the promise that I make to you.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.899
Thirteen years pass between the end of chapter number 16 and the beginning of chapter number

00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:08.500
17.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.260
We find that it's there again in chapter number 17, when God tells us that Abraham

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.859
is 99 years old, that it's in that portion of Scripture when the Lord appears to him

00:08:16.859 --> 00:08:22.980
and now will reveal himself to Abraham as being El Shaddai, the Lord God Almighty.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:28.660
It begins to, again, reinforce the promises that he's made to Abraham.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:35.500
He'll ask the question in chapter number 18, is anything too hard for the Lord?

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:46.219
We find that it's there in chapter number 18, as God is interacting there with Abraham,

00:08:46.219 --> 00:08:50.859
that God is giving Abraham insight as to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah that would

00:08:50.859 --> 00:08:55.979
be forthcoming, and Abraham talks with God.

00:08:55.979 --> 00:08:58.039
He communes with God.

00:08:58.039 --> 00:09:01.940
We come to chapter number 19, and we find that the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.940
is revealed to us, and as we would think about all that has happened in a quick overview

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:13.280
of all of those chapters, I would say over 25 years, God had proven himself to Abraham.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.500
Would you not agree?

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.500
He revealed himself.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.020
He had proven himself, and yet we come to chapter number 20.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.780
The circumstances are not known.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:27.599
The circumstances are not communicated to us as to why it is that the decision is made

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:31.239
in this journey that is recorded for us in Genesis chapter number 20.

00:09:31.239 --> 00:09:36.400
In the 12th chapter of Genesis, when they go into Egypt, God reveals to us it's because

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.520
of a great famine that's in the land.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.320
Here in chapter number 20, we do not have those details.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:47.460
Many have sought to come up with some type of an idea as to why it is that they traveled,

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:52.320
but this evening I'll just tell you, I don't know.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:58.200
We don't know why they traveled, but the Bible begins, and Abraham journeyed from fence

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.039
toward the south country and dwelt.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:07.079
between Kadesh and Shur and sojourned in Gerar. And Abraham said of Sarah his wife,

00:10:07.079 --> 00:10:17.119
She is my sister. And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah." Notice in

00:10:17.119 --> 00:10:24.959
verse number 7, the Bible says, Now therefore restore the man his wife, for

00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:28.639
he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live. And if thou

00:10:28.639 --> 00:10:35.759
restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:39.799
thine. The title for the message this evening is derived from verse number 7,

00:10:39.799 --> 00:10:45.639
Restore the man his wife. Restore the man his wife. As you take notes this evening,

00:10:45.639 --> 00:10:50.559
I want you to notice first of all the fear of Abraham. The fear of Abraham. As

00:10:50.559 --> 00:10:54.359
we look at this portion of Scripture, the Bible tells us, as we've read verses 1

00:10:54.359 --> 00:10:58.919
and 2 already, that they travel, they sojourn, and they find themselves in

00:10:58.919 --> 00:11:03.799
Gerar. The Bible says that the the king of this place is Abimelech, and as we

00:11:03.799 --> 00:11:08.599
would find that Sarah and Abraham arrive in this place, remember that God had

00:11:08.599 --> 00:11:13.359
reinforced his promise, he says to Abraham in very certain terms in

00:11:13.359 --> 00:11:21.079
chapters 17 and 18, that Sarah thy wife shall have a son. We find that God has

00:11:21.079 --> 00:11:26.559
given these promises to Abraham, and now we find that as he comes to this place,

00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:34.399
that he says of Sarah that she is my sister. She is my sister. What is it

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:39.319
that would motivate Abraham to say that she is my sister? We understand that as

00:11:39.319 --> 00:11:43.039
we look at the portion of Scripture, if you skip over to verse number 11, that

00:11:43.039 --> 00:11:48.159
there's insight that is given for Abimelech asks Abraham why it is that he

00:11:48.159 --> 00:11:51.719
did this thing, and we find that Abraham says this in verse number 11,

00:11:51.719 --> 00:11:57.599
because I thought surely the fear of God is not in this place, and they will slay

00:11:57.599 --> 00:12:02.199
me for my wife's sake. Now isn't it interesting that this man, Abraham, was

00:12:02.199 --> 00:12:05.919
concerned that he was in a place in which they did not fear the Lord, but yet

00:12:05.919 --> 00:12:12.639
he himself is operating under fear. He's fearful for his own life. He's fearful

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:16.879
that, the Bible tells us in verse number 11, that they will slay me for my wife's

00:12:16.919 --> 00:12:21.759
sake, and yet indeed she is my sister. She is the daughter of my father, but not the

00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:26.359
daughter of my mother, and she became my wife. We dealt with this in chapter

00:12:26.359 --> 00:12:30.999
number 12, that this was an accepted practice during this particular era, and

00:12:30.999 --> 00:12:35.239
we find that he is making this really, I believe as you look at verse number 12

00:12:35.239 --> 00:12:40.799
and 13, that what's happening is Abraham is justifying his logic. You know the

00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:44.159
reality is that there are times in which we are really good at justifying our

00:12:44.159 --> 00:12:51.719
disobedience. We get really, really creative on how it is that we can

00:12:51.719 --> 00:12:57.639
justify operating in fear, how it is that we can operate in disobedience, and we

00:12:57.639 --> 00:13:02.479
justify our actions, and we find that Abraham is providing this justification.

00:13:02.479 --> 00:13:06.079
Not only does he say, well really she's my half-sister in verse number 12, she is

00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:09.319
the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother. Notice in verse

00:13:09.319 --> 00:13:13.559
number 13, and it came to pass when God caused me to wander from my father's

00:13:13.639 --> 00:13:18.799
house, he's gonna go all the way back to when he first left, when God first called

00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:24.519
him, and he says that at that time that I said unto her, this is thy kindness which

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:30.679
thou shalt show unto me at every place whither we shall come, say of me, he is my

00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:37.199
brother. In some way, I believe that Abraham had this belief that by

00:13:37.199 --> 00:13:42.519
following this plan that had been derived, they came up with many years

00:13:42.519 --> 00:13:47.439
earlier that this would provide him some level of safety and protection that

00:13:47.439 --> 00:13:52.599
perhaps God was not able to afford. But the reality is that he'd already

00:13:52.599 --> 00:13:59.279
experienced God providing protection for him in Egypt. This very thing that's

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:03.479
being repeated in chapter number 20 has already occurred in Abraham's life.

00:14:03.479 --> 00:14:07.279
Right now in chapter number 20, we're just in a different city with different

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:12.399
names of different characters, but really it's the same event, is it not? Have you

00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:15.639
ever felt like in your life that there's just kind of a repeat button that's been

00:14:15.639 --> 00:14:20.359
played? Like, man, I think I've been here before. Maybe I didn't learn the lesson.

00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:24.759
Why didn't I learn the lesson, right? And here's Abraham, and he says to Abimelech,

00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:29.199
she's my sister, and I said this as we note the fear of Abraham, you understand

00:14:29.199 --> 00:14:33.519
that God, as we read His Word, that many times throughout the Scriptures we read

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:44.719
these words, fear not. Fear not. Be not afraid. Do we not? Those phrases are

00:14:44.719 --> 00:14:49.079
littered all throughout the Word of God. We find that Paul says this in 2nd

00:14:49.079 --> 00:14:53.719
Timothy 1 and verse number 7, for God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but

00:14:53.719 --> 00:15:00.319
of power and of love and of a sound mind. In fact, it's there in Abraham's life

00:15:00.319 --> 00:15:05.039
after he'd experienced a great victory. In chapter number 14, as we mentioned

00:15:05.039 --> 00:15:09.239
earlier, as we did a quick review, we find that it was there in chapter number 15

00:15:09.239 --> 00:15:19.039
that God plainly says to Abraham, fear not. As often as we read the words fear

00:15:19.039 --> 00:15:24.679
not, as often as we read the words be not afraid, as often as we could speak

00:15:24.679 --> 00:15:29.879
about and preach messages on not having fear and not being controlled by fear,

00:15:29.959 --> 00:15:34.479
the reality is that we are human beings and we continue to deal with an

00:15:34.479 --> 00:15:40.799
emotion of fear. It's just how we, that's just something we deal with as human

00:15:40.799 --> 00:15:49.719
beings. We were in Branson, as you know, for vacation, and the fellow that was

00:15:49.719 --> 00:15:54.159
teaching the Sunday school class, he had kind of, the subject matter was not on

00:15:54.159 --> 00:15:58.439
fear at all, but somehow along the line during the message he got onto the

00:15:58.439 --> 00:16:02.599
subject of fear. And as he was teaching the lesson on fear, he said that if we

00:16:02.599 --> 00:16:08.479
fear God, then every other fear will go away, because we have a fear of God and

00:16:08.479 --> 00:16:11.959
we're to have a proper fear of God. And he's going through this, and his

00:16:11.959 --> 00:16:16.199
wife was not very kind, for he's going through and he's saying all of these

00:16:16.199 --> 00:16:19.439
things about we need to fear God, and she says, and he says that every other fear

00:16:19.439 --> 00:16:23.479
will go away, and she says, excuse me honey, is that applicable to snakes as

00:16:23.479 --> 00:16:28.759
well? And it was like, come on, that's not right for a wife to do that to her

00:16:28.759 --> 00:16:33.879
husband when he's teaching, you know? But he was really dealing with, listen,

00:16:33.879 --> 00:16:40.199
why is it that we fear man? Why is it that we fear things that we deal with in

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:46.239
life, and we can have this spirit of fear? You know, fear can cause us to do things

00:16:46.239 --> 00:16:52.639
that we ought not do. Fear can cause us to behave in matters in which are

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:57.919
not appropriate and accept it to God. And here in Genesis chapter number 20, I

00:16:57.919 --> 00:17:04.279
truly believe that Abraham here is motivated by fear, that he says

00:17:04.279 --> 00:17:09.119
to Abimelech, listen, I thought for sure that the fear of God was not in this

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:15.559
place, and therefore here's what you'll do, you'll slay me for my wife's sake. So

00:17:15.559 --> 00:17:21.119
therefore, I said she's my sister. We see, first of all, the fear of Abraham. I want

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:26.439
you to see number two, the faithfulness of God. The faithfulness of God. We

00:17:26.439 --> 00:17:31.479
understand this evening that our God is always faithful. We sing, great is thy

00:17:31.479 --> 00:17:35.679
faithfulness, and what a great hymn that is. And I'm so thankful for the

00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:40.519
faithfulness of God. In fact, I'm so glad that His faithfulness is not dependent

00:17:40.519 --> 00:17:47.159
upon my faithfulness. Aren't you? Can you imagine the place in which we'd be if

00:17:47.279 --> 00:17:55.879
God's faithfulness was dependent upon our faithfulness? Miserable. Honestly. But

00:17:55.879 --> 00:18:01.519
our God is faithful. And here, the first two words of verse number three in

00:18:01.519 --> 00:18:07.479
Genesis chapter number 20, but God. You know how many times you read in the

00:18:07.479 --> 00:18:14.599
Scriptures that phrase, those two words, but God? There's an event, there's a set

00:18:14.599 --> 00:18:19.559
of circumstances that are taking place, but God. But God shows up, and God

00:18:19.559 --> 00:18:25.959
intervenes, and God works, and God moves. Why? Because God is faithful. God is

00:18:25.959 --> 00:18:31.479
faithful. And here, the Bible tells us of the faithfulness of God in verse number

00:18:31.479 --> 00:18:39.039
three. It says, but God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him,

00:18:39.039 --> 00:18:46.919
behold, thou art but a dead man. That kind of gets your attention, right? Can

00:18:46.919 --> 00:18:53.599
you imagine? Abimelech, according to what we find here, God comes to him by night,

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:59.839
by a dream. He says, behold, thou art but a dead man. Why? For the woman which thou

00:18:59.839 --> 00:19:07.880
hast taken, for she is a man's wife. Now Abimelech, prior to this, has no

00:19:07.919 --> 00:19:11.959
knowledge of this, for Abraham has said, she's my sister, and Sarah says, he's my

00:19:11.959 --> 00:19:20.919
brother. But God, God is faithful. God had made a promise with regard to the seed,

00:19:20.919 --> 00:19:26.639
the promise that had been made with regard to Abraham and Sarah having a son,

00:19:26.639 --> 00:19:33.039
Isaac, as we'd find in chapter 21. It says in verse number four, but Abimelech had

00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:40.079
not come near her, and he, Abimelech said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous

00:19:40.079 --> 00:19:48.359
nation? Said he not unto me, she is my sister? And she, even she herself said, he

00:19:48.359 --> 00:19:53.359
is my brother. In the integrity of my heart, in an innocency of my hands have I

00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:58.359
done this thing? And God said unto him in a dream, yea, I know that thou didst this

00:19:58.359 --> 00:20:01.799
thing in the integrity of thy heart.

00:20:01.799 --> 00:20:08.679
For I also withheld thee from sinning against Me, therefore suffered I thee not to touch

00:20:08.679 --> 00:20:10.279
her."

00:20:10.279 --> 00:20:12.119
That's awesome, isn't it?

00:20:12.119 --> 00:20:14.639
The way that God intervened, the way that God worked.

00:20:14.639 --> 00:20:19.759
As I mentioned by way of introduction, just as I believe in Genesis chapter number 12

00:20:19.759 --> 00:20:24.299
that God could have protected both Abraham and Sarah as they marched into Egypt land

00:20:24.299 --> 00:20:29.119
and dealt with Pharaoh, that God could have protected them here as well.

00:20:29.119 --> 00:20:33.639
Abraham did not have to say, she's my sister, and Sarah did not have to say, he's my brother.

00:20:33.639 --> 00:20:38.759
I believe that God would have provided a level of protection for them in that place.

00:20:38.759 --> 00:20:43.679
And God gives some instruction in verse number 7 to Abimelech.

00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:44.679
He says,

00:20:44.679 --> 00:20:50.159
Now therefore restore the man his wife, for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee,

00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:51.239
and thou shalt live.

00:20:51.239 --> 00:20:58.839
And if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are

00:20:58.839 --> 00:21:00.719
mine.

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:03.719
Has God clearly communicated to Abimelech?

00:21:03.719 --> 00:21:04.719
Absolutely.

00:21:04.719 --> 00:21:06.959
I mean, God didn't mince any words, right?

00:21:06.959 --> 00:21:13.279
God clearly communicates to Abimelech, here's the situation, you're a dead man, because

00:21:13.279 --> 00:21:16.239
she is a man's wife.

00:21:16.239 --> 00:21:20.679
And he pleads his case, it was in the innocency of my heart, I mean, he said this and she

00:21:20.679 --> 00:21:24.999
said that, and I had no idea, and it was in the integrity of my heart that I've done this

00:21:24.999 --> 00:21:25.999
thing.

00:21:25.999 --> 00:21:28.079
And God says, I know, and that's why I've withheld thee from thee.

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:31.519
That's why I did not allow you to go in unto her.

00:21:31.519 --> 00:21:36.239
And God says, here's what you need to do, you need to restore him his wife, and if you

00:21:36.239 --> 00:21:47.199
do not do that, I want you to know that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are thine.

00:21:47.199 --> 00:21:51.879
Skip over, if you will, to verse number 17, as we consider, again, the faithfulness of

00:21:51.879 --> 00:21:52.879
God.

00:21:52.879 --> 00:21:58.039
We find in verse number 17 that Abraham prayed unto God.

00:21:58.039 --> 00:22:02.439
The Bible tells us that God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maidservants, and they

00:22:02.439 --> 00:22:07.839
bear children, for the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech

00:22:07.839 --> 00:22:12.799
because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.

00:22:12.799 --> 00:22:19.119
God told Abimelech that if he would respond in such a way, he said this, not only would

00:22:19.119 --> 00:22:24.119
the consequence of not returning or restoring Sarah to Abraham that he would die and all

00:22:24.119 --> 00:22:28.759
that are thine, but he said that if you restore his wife, according to verse number 7, he

00:22:28.759 --> 00:22:33.099
is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live.

00:22:33.099 --> 00:22:39.119
And we find that Abraham prayed unto God, and God heard that prayer, and God answered

00:22:39.119 --> 00:22:43.479
that prayer, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and the maidservants, and the Bible

00:22:43.479 --> 00:22:46.759
tells us that they bear children.

00:22:46.759 --> 00:22:51.039
God is faithful and mindful of many portions of Scripture.

00:22:51.039 --> 00:22:53.279
Turn to the book of Deuteronomy, if you will.

00:22:53.279 --> 00:22:54.279
Hold your place there in Genesis.

00:22:54.279 --> 00:22:55.839
We'll be back in just a moment.

00:22:55.839 --> 00:23:03.759
But consider what is said here in Deuteronomy chapter number 7.

00:23:03.759 --> 00:23:11.959
In Deuteronomy chapter number 7, in verse number 9, God is preparing His people for

00:23:11.959 --> 00:23:18.599
entrance into the land, Moses is providing instruction and preparation, and the Bible

00:23:18.599 --> 00:23:24.439
says, know therefore, in Deuteronomy 7 and verse number 9, that the Lord thy God, He

00:23:24.439 --> 00:23:32.159
is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love Him and keep

00:23:32.159 --> 00:23:37.959
His commandments to a thousand generations.

00:23:37.959 --> 00:23:39.399
He's faithful.

00:23:39.559 --> 00:23:45.079
Paul says to the believers in 1 Corinthians chapter number 1, in verse number 9, he says

00:23:45.079 --> 00:23:50.519
it this way very simply, God is faithful.

00:23:50.519 --> 00:23:56.799
The believers in Corinth had to understand the faithfulness of God, and Paul was rejoicing

00:23:56.799 --> 00:23:58.879
and understanding that he served a faithful God.

00:23:58.879 --> 00:24:03.759
I'm mindful of what Paul says to the believers in Thessalonica when he says this in 1 Thessalonians

00:24:03.759 --> 00:24:08.719
5 and verse number 24, faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it.

00:24:08.719 --> 00:24:10.959
Our God is faithful.

00:24:10.959 --> 00:24:17.959
According to Revelation chapter number 19, when He returns, He'll have that name, faithful

00:24:17.959 --> 00:24:19.479
and true.

00:24:19.479 --> 00:24:21.440
He is faithful.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.720
He is faithful.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.199
Consider this, if you will, Lamentations chapter 3.

00:24:25.199 --> 00:24:29.259
Hold your place there in Genesis still, but I want you to turn to the book of Lamentations

00:24:29.259 --> 00:24:31.000
in chapter number 3.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.639
It's a verse of Scripture, really a portion of Scripture in which we have come familiar

00:24:35.639 --> 00:24:38.199
with.

00:24:38.199 --> 00:24:44.399
As we consider Lamentations 3 and consider the setting really for this particular book,

00:24:44.399 --> 00:24:50.879
and we'd understand that the Babylonians have taken captive the nation of Judah.

00:24:50.879 --> 00:24:52.639
The city is laying in ruins.

00:24:52.639 --> 00:24:58.720
If you read the first chapter of the book of Lamentations, you find that the city is

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:03.919
just laid in ruins, and you find the destruction, and we find that it's in chapter number 3

00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:07.799
is really as Jeremiah is lamenting all that's taking place.

00:25:07.799 --> 00:25:12.319
He says in verse number 19, remembering my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and

00:25:12.319 --> 00:25:18.319
the gall, my soul hath them still in remembrance and is humbled in me.

00:25:18.319 --> 00:25:26.959
But notice verse number 21, this I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.

00:25:26.959 --> 00:25:34.199
It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because His compassions fail not.

00:25:34.199 --> 00:25:41.679
They are new every morning, great is thy faithfulness.

00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:47.179
The Lord is my portion, saith my soul, therefore will I hope in Him.

00:25:47.179 --> 00:25:51.959
The Lord is good unto them that wait for Him, to the soul that seeketh Him.

00:25:52.959 --> 00:25:59.279
But there in verse number 23, they are new every morning, great is thy faithfulness.

00:25:59.279 --> 00:26:05.199
Our God is faithful, and His faithfulness is not dependent upon our faithfulness, and

00:26:05.199 --> 00:26:10.720
that should cause us to rejoice greatly, because there are many times in which we fail the

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.720
Lord.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:17.279
We find that there are many times in which we get caught up, and the flesh would impact

00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:21.759
and influence us, and maybe we'd make decisions and operate in fear, even as Abraham does

00:26:21.759 --> 00:26:26.519
in this portion of Scripture in Genesis chapter number 20, but God is faithful.

00:26:26.519 --> 00:26:28.000
God is faithful.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.720
We see the fear of Abraham, we see the faithfulness of God, but I want you to consider with me

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:38.440
maybe something a little bit different, but I want you to consider with me the faith of

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.319
Abimelech.

00:26:40.319 --> 00:26:41.319
The faith of Abimelech.

00:26:41.319 --> 00:26:47.000
I'll be honest with you, as you begin to think about those that lived by faith, you begin

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.039
to make a list of those that lived by faith, and you begin to name those great heroes of

00:26:52.039 --> 00:26:58.399
the faith, if you will, Abimelech probably has never made it on your list.

00:26:58.399 --> 00:27:01.159
Not somebody that we think about having faith.

00:27:01.159 --> 00:27:07.879
But I've often said this, that faith is believing God, faith is taking God at His Word, faith

00:27:07.879 --> 00:27:13.299
is acting upon the revealed Word of God, right?

00:27:13.299 --> 00:27:18.139
We speak about having faith, and we speak about the way in which our faith is increased

00:27:18.139 --> 00:27:21.379
by the truth of the Word of God.

00:27:21.379 --> 00:27:25.819
We find that the Bible says that it's through the hearing of the Word that our faith is

00:27:25.819 --> 00:27:29.940
increased, and we understand that we're to live by faith.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:33.379
Without faith, it's impossible to please Him.

00:27:33.379 --> 00:27:37.940
But I would submit to you this evening that Abimelech operates in faith here in chapter

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:43.459
number 20 of the book of Genesis, because God speaks to Abimelech, and God gives Abimelech

00:27:43.459 --> 00:27:49.979
very clear instruction, and we find that Abimelech, when he understands that which he is told,

00:27:49.979 --> 00:27:55.059
we find that he demonstrates faith in what God said.

00:27:55.059 --> 00:28:01.059
Remember, as we looked in just a moment ago, the faithfulness of God, we see that God very

00:28:01.059 --> 00:28:07.500
plainly tells Abimelech in verse number 7 that He is to restore the man his wife, that

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:11.379
if he restores her not, that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are thine.

00:28:11.379 --> 00:28:16.079
Notice the response of Abimelech in verse number 8.

00:28:16.079 --> 00:28:22.859
The Bible says this, therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants

00:28:22.859 --> 00:28:29.179
and told all these things in their ears, and the men were sore afraid.

00:28:29.179 --> 00:28:32.279
Why are they afraid?

00:28:32.279 --> 00:28:35.279
Because God had spoken to Abimelech.

00:28:35.279 --> 00:28:41.119
And I believe that as God had spoken to Abimelech and said to Abimelech that this woman that

00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:47.159
you have, that she is a man's wife, and you need to return her, that if you do not do

00:28:47.159 --> 00:28:52.479
this, then you shall surely die and all that are thine, I believe that when he communicated

00:28:52.479 --> 00:28:57.440
this message to those that he called in verse number 8, that he communicated the message

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.640
with a level of seriousness.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.599
I mean, he believed what God said.

00:29:03.599 --> 00:29:08.839
He believed that God was able to perform that which he said.

00:29:08.839 --> 00:29:13.119
It says in verse number 9, then Abimelech called Abraham and said unto him, what hast

00:29:13.119 --> 00:29:14.239
thou done unto us?

00:29:14.239 --> 00:29:19.839
And what have I offended thee that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin?

00:29:19.839 --> 00:29:23.279
Thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.

00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:26.799
And Abimelech said unto Abraham, what sawest thou that thou hast done this thing?

00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:30.799
And we've read verses 11 through 13 already, but I want you to skip down to verse number

00:29:30.799 --> 00:29:31.799
14.

00:29:31.799 --> 00:29:32.919
Look at what Abimelech did.

00:29:32.919 --> 00:29:37.080
The Bible says that Abimelech took sheep and oxen and men's servants and woman's servants

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:44.080
and gave them unto Abraham and restored him, Sarah, his wife.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:47.880
Is that not what God told him to do?

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:55.839
God said in verse number 3, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken,

00:29:55.839 --> 00:30:01.760
for she is a man's wife, and he says in verse number 7, now therefore restore the

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:01.799
man.

00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:04.799
a man his wife."

00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:07.719
We find that in verse 14,

00:30:07.719 --> 00:30:11.519
the Bible tells us that he, Abimelech,

00:30:11.519 --> 00:30:13.759
not only did he restore Sarah to Abraham,

00:30:13.759 --> 00:30:15.759
but it says that he took sheep and oxen

00:30:15.759 --> 00:30:17.679
and men's servants and women's servants

00:30:17.679 --> 00:30:19.079
and gave them unto Abraham

00:30:19.079 --> 00:30:21.519
and restored him Sarah, his wife.

00:30:21.519 --> 00:30:23.279
You understand that it would have been

00:30:23.279 --> 00:30:25.119
all for naught if Abimelech

00:30:25.119 --> 00:30:27.279
would have simply given Abraham

00:30:27.279 --> 00:30:29.479
sheep and oxen and men's servants

00:30:29.479 --> 00:30:31.679
and women's servants.

00:30:31.679 --> 00:30:33.479
That would not have appeased God.

00:30:33.479 --> 00:30:34.599
If Abimelech said,

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:36.839
I'm going to give you all these things, Abraham,

00:30:36.839 --> 00:30:39.999
but I'm keeping Sarah.

00:30:39.999 --> 00:30:41.879
What's going to happen?

00:30:41.879 --> 00:30:44.119
He's a dead man, right?

00:30:44.119 --> 00:30:45.759
Is that what God said?

00:30:45.759 --> 00:30:48.639
Thou art but a dead man.

00:30:48.639 --> 00:30:50.559
The only condition that God gave

00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:52.119
was that he, Abimelech,

00:30:52.119 --> 00:30:55.039
restore Sarah to Abraham.

00:30:55.039 --> 00:30:56.319
And so I'm of the opinion

00:30:56.319 --> 00:30:58.679
that if he did not include all of this other spoil

00:30:58.719 --> 00:31:02.039
and simply returned Sarah to Abraham,

00:31:02.039 --> 00:31:03.799
that he would have lived

00:31:03.799 --> 00:31:05.119
because that was the condition

00:31:05.119 --> 00:31:09.119
by which God had communicated to Abimelech

00:31:09.119 --> 00:31:10.759
what it was that he needed to do.

00:31:11.719 --> 00:31:12.559
See, Abimelech,

00:31:12.559 --> 00:31:14.999
do you see how he demonstrated faith?

00:31:14.999 --> 00:31:16.919
He believed that what God said

00:31:16.919 --> 00:31:17.959
that he was going to do,

00:31:17.959 --> 00:31:19.199
that God would do.

00:31:21.399 --> 00:31:22.599
In a certain sense,

00:31:22.599 --> 00:31:24.319
we could look at Genesis chapter number 20

00:31:24.319 --> 00:31:26.159
and we could say that of the characters

00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:27.879
that are contained in this portion of scripture,

00:31:27.879 --> 00:31:30.079
that Abimelech has more faith than Abraham.

00:31:31.479 --> 00:31:33.759
Now that blows your mind, right?

00:31:33.759 --> 00:31:34.879
Because when we think of Abraham,

00:31:34.879 --> 00:31:35.799
we think of Abraham,

00:31:35.799 --> 00:31:36.799
he's the friend of God.

00:31:36.799 --> 00:31:38.799
I mean, he's faithful and he is.

00:31:38.799 --> 00:31:41.639
Abraham finds himself in Hebrews chapter 11

00:31:41.639 --> 00:31:45.359
is the great hall of faith, right?

00:31:45.359 --> 00:31:47.959
But in this particular account,

00:31:47.959 --> 00:31:50.239
Abimelech is the one that demonstrates faith.

00:31:51.319 --> 00:31:56.119
Abimelech is the one that hears what God says

00:31:56.119 --> 00:31:57.439
and responds to it.

00:31:58.039 --> 00:31:59.319
In obedience.

00:32:00.359 --> 00:32:02.079
He continues in verse number 15,

00:32:02.079 --> 00:32:04.279
and Abimelech said,

00:32:04.279 --> 00:32:05.879
behold, my land is before thee.

00:32:05.879 --> 00:32:08.759
Dwell where it pleaseth thee.

00:32:08.759 --> 00:32:09.799
And unto Sarah, he said,

00:32:09.799 --> 00:32:11.199
behold, I have given thy brother

00:32:11.199 --> 00:32:13.159
a thousand pieces of silver.

00:32:13.159 --> 00:32:15.359
Behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes

00:32:15.359 --> 00:32:17.279
and to all that are with thee

00:32:17.279 --> 00:32:18.239
and with all others.

00:32:18.239 --> 00:32:21.199
Thus, she was reproved.

00:32:21.199 --> 00:32:23.719
And then the Bible says that Abraham prayed unto God

00:32:23.719 --> 00:32:25.479
in verse number 17.

00:32:25.519 --> 00:32:29.799
Now, we understand that God had said to Abimelech

00:32:29.799 --> 00:32:31.159
in verse number seven,

00:32:31.159 --> 00:32:33.199
now therefore restore the man his wife

00:32:33.199 --> 00:32:34.799
for he is a prophet

00:32:35.799 --> 00:32:37.559
and he shall pray for thee

00:32:37.559 --> 00:32:39.079
and thou shalt live.

00:32:40.159 --> 00:32:43.399
I'm not sure if it was God who communicated to Abraham

00:32:43.399 --> 00:32:44.799
that he should pray for Abimelech

00:32:44.799 --> 00:32:47.879
or if it was Abimelech that communicated this to Abraham,

00:32:47.879 --> 00:32:50.199
but we find that Abraham prayed.

00:32:51.759 --> 00:32:52.999
And as Abraham prays,

00:32:52.999 --> 00:32:55.199
the Bible tells us that God healed Abimelech

00:32:55.879 --> 00:32:56.719
and his wife and his maidservants

00:32:56.719 --> 00:32:58.719
and their children.

00:32:58.719 --> 00:33:00.919
As we look at this portion of Scripture,

00:33:00.919 --> 00:33:04.879
we begin to see the evidence that is given to us.

00:33:04.879 --> 00:33:06.839
We find that Abraham's fear,

00:33:06.839 --> 00:33:08.759
as I started out the message this evening,

00:33:08.759 --> 00:33:11.159
I believe that his fear was known by his actions,

00:33:11.159 --> 00:33:13.959
but also as we think about the faith of Abimelech,

00:33:13.959 --> 00:33:16.639
that too was known by his actions.

00:33:17.799 --> 00:33:20.559
As we begin to look at this passage of Scripture

00:33:20.559 --> 00:33:21.919
and we consider the seriousness,

00:33:21.919 --> 00:33:25.159
listen, I've never traveled to a place

00:33:25.999 --> 00:33:27.719
where I was fearful that they would kill me

00:33:27.719 --> 00:33:29.239
and take Holly to be their wife.

00:33:29.239 --> 00:33:31.399
I've just never traveled to that place.

00:33:31.399 --> 00:33:32.879
Have you?

00:33:32.879 --> 00:33:35.039
It's not a common thing that happens.

00:33:35.039 --> 00:33:37.439
No doubt this was a common practice.

00:33:37.439 --> 00:33:38.639
It's something that's been repeated,

00:33:38.639 --> 00:33:39.799
not only in Genesis 12,

00:33:39.799 --> 00:33:41.679
but again in chapter number 20.

00:33:41.679 --> 00:33:45.479
No doubt that this was a serious fear that Abraham had.

00:33:48.759 --> 00:33:51.479
And he operates based upon that fear.

00:33:52.359 --> 00:33:56.399
As we begin to think about the specific circumstances

00:33:56.399 --> 00:33:57.679
of Genesis chapter number 20,

00:33:57.679 --> 00:34:00.359
many of us are not capable of relating

00:34:00.359 --> 00:34:02.879
to the specific circumstances.

00:34:02.879 --> 00:34:06.159
But as we begin to interpret Genesis chapter number 20

00:34:06.159 --> 00:34:07.759
and understand the context

00:34:07.759 --> 00:34:11.799
and understand the purpose of God placing this truth

00:34:11.799 --> 00:34:13.639
to us in this portion of Scripture

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:15.639
and keeping it preserved for us,

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:19.079
we say, well, what is it that God wants us to learn?

00:34:19.079 --> 00:34:20.599
What is it that God wants us to learn

00:34:20.599 --> 00:34:25.039
in this repeat story in the life of Abraham?

00:34:25.039 --> 00:34:28.879
Number one, I would say this as to the takeaways,

00:34:28.879 --> 00:34:31.039
if you will, that God would like us to learn

00:34:31.039 --> 00:34:33.079
is that we never need to get to a place

00:34:33.079 --> 00:34:35.479
where we think that we've arrived.

00:34:35.479 --> 00:34:39.319
Because after 25 years of Abraham walking with God,

00:34:39.319 --> 00:34:43.159
after 25 years of God proving himself to Abraham

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:46.519
and all that had transpired in all of those chapters,

00:34:46.519 --> 00:34:48.940
we find that when Abraham finds himself

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.940
in this particular situation again,

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.659
that he reverts back to that which he had previously done.

00:34:57.059 --> 00:34:59.899
We need to be careful to never think that we've arrived.

00:35:02.179 --> 00:35:03.979
And we need to understand this evening

00:35:03.979 --> 00:35:06.979
that as we look at a portion of Scripture like this,

00:35:06.979 --> 00:35:10.139
that it's easy for us to look at Genesis chapter number 20

00:35:10.139 --> 00:35:11.500
and kind of scratch our head and say,

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.539
what's wrong with Abraham?

00:35:13.539 --> 00:35:15.500
I mean, didn't he learn in chapter number 12?

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.099
I mean, what's wrong with this guy?

00:35:18.099 --> 00:35:20.979
But sometimes we like to evaluate other people's lives

00:35:20.979 --> 00:35:23.179
more than we like to evaluate our own lives.

00:35:25.179 --> 00:35:26.079
Why is that?

00:35:26.079 --> 00:35:27.019
It's easier.

00:35:28.699 --> 00:35:30.500
It doesn't cause us to feel so bad.

00:35:32.039 --> 00:35:32.879
Right?

00:35:32.879 --> 00:35:36.199
I mean, honestly, when I evaluate someone else's life,

00:35:36.199 --> 00:35:38.819
whether it's someone in the pages of Scripture or otherwise,

00:35:38.819 --> 00:35:41.379
it's easy for me to evaluate their lives.

00:35:41.379 --> 00:35:44.819
It's easy for you to evaluate somebody else's life.

00:35:44.819 --> 00:35:49.619
But that process of self-evaluation and self-examination

00:35:49.619 --> 00:35:51.739
and saying, what about me?

00:35:51.739 --> 00:35:53.379
I started out this evening by saying,

00:35:53.379 --> 00:35:55.059
there are things no doubt in your life

00:35:55.059 --> 00:35:57.259
that you've done more than once.

00:35:57.259 --> 00:35:58.979
I mean, failures in your life.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.139
You say, man, how did I do this again?

00:36:03.899 --> 00:36:05.659
Abraham, as he's in this situation,

00:36:05.659 --> 00:36:08.899
I mean, I don't know how he must have felt

00:36:08.899 --> 00:36:10.500
back in Genesis chapter number 12

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.019
when Sarah is in the home of Pharaoh.

00:36:13.859 --> 00:36:15.899
Any men would feel comfortable with that?

00:36:17.339 --> 00:36:18.619
No.

00:36:18.619 --> 00:36:19.979
I wouldn't be very comfortable.

00:36:19.979 --> 00:36:24.979
Now, 25 years later, his wife Sarah is now with Abimelech.

00:36:26.899 --> 00:36:28.259
Man, how do you feel?

00:36:29.579 --> 00:36:32.639
And you, I mean, is Abraham not sitting there thinking,

00:36:32.639 --> 00:36:36.220
man, if I didn't say this or if I said that, I don't know.

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.959
I'm just thinking about myself.

00:36:39.699 --> 00:36:42.979
That my wife is now in this place

00:36:43.819 --> 00:36:45.739
and perhaps a place of being vulnerable,

00:36:45.739 --> 00:36:48.179
a place of being taken advantage of,

00:36:48.179 --> 00:36:51.099
a place of I don't know all that's going to happen

00:36:51.099 --> 00:36:53.659
and it's because of this fear that I had.

00:36:54.699 --> 00:36:56.199
You understand what I'm saying?

00:36:57.179 --> 00:36:58.819
And we find this evening that, listen,

00:36:58.819 --> 00:37:02.179
we need to deal with the flesh, as I said this morning.

00:37:02.179 --> 00:37:04.379
See, because this thing of fear

00:37:04.379 --> 00:37:06.139
begins to cripple and paralyze,

00:37:06.139 --> 00:37:11.139
this thing of fear begins to dictate to Abraham what to do.

00:37:11.459 --> 00:37:12.739
See, there are times in which,

00:37:12.739 --> 00:37:14.879
even as he gives answer to Abimelech,

00:37:14.879 --> 00:37:18.019
that he says, listen, we made this agreement many years ago

00:37:19.059 --> 00:37:21.579
that anywhere we traveled that I would say she's my sister

00:37:21.579 --> 00:37:25.019
and she would say that I'm her brother.

00:37:25.019 --> 00:37:25.859
But you know what?

00:37:25.859 --> 00:37:27.139
There might be an agreement that was made

00:37:27.139 --> 00:37:29.940
that after you experience all that God has done,

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:31.339
you say, no, we don't have to operate

00:37:31.339 --> 00:37:35.179
under those agreements any longer, right?

00:37:35.179 --> 00:37:38.819
Because we've seen that God is faithful.

00:37:38.859 --> 00:37:41.539
When we see what God did in Genesis chapter number 12,

00:37:41.539 --> 00:37:43.739
it prepares us for the next encounter,

00:37:43.739 --> 00:37:46.859
the next difficulty in which we have to experience.

00:37:46.859 --> 00:37:48.859
And so I would say that as we look

00:37:48.859 --> 00:37:49.979
at this portion of scripture

00:37:49.979 --> 00:37:52.500
that we need to be careful to acknowledge

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.779
that in the life of Abraham,

00:37:53.779 --> 00:37:55.539
as we see this repeat offense,

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:59.459
that we too would understand that we're but flesh.

00:37:59.459 --> 00:38:02.579
And we must be careful to daily walk with God

00:38:02.579 --> 00:38:04.339
and to trust God.

00:38:04.339 --> 00:38:06.419
God is able to do exceeding abundantly

00:38:06.419 --> 00:38:07.979
above all that we ask or think.

00:38:09.659 --> 00:38:11.139
But how's God gonna do it?

00:38:11.139 --> 00:38:12.940
I don't know, but God is able.

00:38:13.859 --> 00:38:14.699
Amen?

00:38:14.699 --> 00:38:16.299
I mean, think about what God did here.

00:38:16.299 --> 00:38:19.379
Did not God prove His power

00:38:19.379 --> 00:38:22.699
by preventing Abimelech from violating Sarah?

00:38:22.699 --> 00:38:24.779
By preventing anything from taking place?

00:38:24.779 --> 00:38:29.299
By closing up the wombs of those people of Gerar?

00:38:29.299 --> 00:38:30.779
How did God do all of this?

00:38:30.779 --> 00:38:32.220
Because He's God.

00:38:33.259 --> 00:38:34.179
He's God.

00:38:35.539 --> 00:38:36.380
And so this evening,

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.099
as we look at this portion of scripture

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.700
and we begin to think about Abraham

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.140
and understanding what's taking place

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:43.979
and we learn some lessons from Abraham,

00:38:43.979 --> 00:38:46.219
let us also learn some lessons from God.

00:38:46.219 --> 00:38:47.979
He's always faithful.

00:38:47.979 --> 00:38:49.779
Listen, God's never gonna fail you.

00:38:51.179 --> 00:38:54.659
You can find yourself in all sorts of situations in life.

00:38:54.659 --> 00:38:56.619
You can find yourself in places.

00:38:56.619 --> 00:38:59.339
Listen, we're living in a crazy world right now.

00:39:00.299 --> 00:39:01.779
We're living in a world in which people

00:39:01.779 --> 00:39:04.859
are trying to get folks to do all sorts of crazy things

00:39:04.859 --> 00:39:08.739
and trying to force and make us do something.

00:39:08.739 --> 00:39:11.179
Listen, we have a God who's faithful.

00:39:12.019 --> 00:39:13.940
We have a God who is able.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.619
The problem sometimes in our lives

00:39:17.619 --> 00:39:20.779
is that it's a scary thing to prove God.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:22.979
What do I mean by that?

00:39:22.979 --> 00:39:23.859
It's a whole lot easier

00:39:23.859 --> 00:39:26.580
to just rely on your own understanding.

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:27.739
Amen?

00:39:27.739 --> 00:39:30.580
You know what He said there in the book of Malachi?

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:31.659
Prove me.

00:39:31.659 --> 00:39:34.339
He was speaking contextually about giving.

00:39:34.659 --> 00:39:37.019
Listen, giving is a process of proving God

00:39:37.019 --> 00:39:39.500
because you're gonna say, I'm gonna give to God first

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:40.739
and then I'm gonna expect that God's

00:39:40.739 --> 00:39:42.700
gonna take care of my needs.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:45.700
You say, I can't take care of my needs with all of it.

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.059
How am I gonna take care of my needs with less?

00:39:49.739 --> 00:39:51.979
But God says, prove me.

00:39:51.979 --> 00:39:53.500
He says, prove me.

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.500
Not only, and this is the twofold blessing

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.700
that we see in giving, is God says,

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:00.500
not only am I gonna bless you,

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.140
but I'm gonna rebuke the devout.

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:10.140
hour." And you say, well that's a pretty good deal. And guess what? God is faithful.

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:17.660
Have you not found it to be so? I remember as a kid, I was almost a

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:21.460
teenager when my parents got saved just a few months away from being 13 years

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:24.060
old. It does not mean that I knew everything that was going on in the home.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:27.220
There are plenty of things that I did not know about, but I remember hearing my

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:32.340
dad, not only that at that particular time after his conversion, but talking

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:36.100
about stories about it afterwards, when they made the decision that they were

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:42.420
gonna start giving. They were gonna start tithing. Listen, if you were raised to do

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:46.780
that, and that's something. See, Holly and I, we were we were saved and we were

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:50.380
giving before we ever got married, so it was just part of what we did. And when

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:53.500
you got all kinds of bills already, and you're already doing whatever, and then

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:58.420
it's like, hey we got saved and now we need to start doing this. Has God ever

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:06.580
failed you? Not one time. God is faithful. He's faithful. Look at what God did for

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:11.900
Abraham and Sarah here in Genesis chapter 20. We can't come up with those

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:21.180
certain... we can't concoct that plan, can we? No. There's no way that Abraham could

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:25.740
prevent Abimelech from doing anything to Sarah. There's no way in his own power

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:30.300
that he was gonna preserve his own life. But God is faithful. So we learn a lesson

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:36.060
about Abraham, and how we can, listen, we can sometimes operate in fear. We need to

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:42.660
be careful. We need to deal with the flesh. Learn a lesson about God. He's always

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:48.180
faithful, and He always will be. Let's learn a lesson about faith. How about we just

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:53.700
take God at His word? Just believe God. I don't understand how it's all gonna work

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:59.620
out. That can drive us crazy sometimes. It honestly can. And if you're the analytical

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:03.620
type as I am, and you like to figure everything out, it all needs to make sense, it can really

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:17.500
mess you up. Amen? But we've been called to live by faith. The just shall live by faith.

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:22.820
The just shall live by faith. Just believe in God. Having that kind of faith that we

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:26.580
say based upon God's word. Listen, when we talk about faith, sometimes people get this

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:31.940
idea of living by faith means that we just jump and do whatever and say, man, I was living

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:37.820
by faith. I just did all this by faith. No, faith is taking God at His word. Peter didn't

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:45.740
step out of the boat until God bid him to. Amen? He said, Lord, if it be Thou, bid me

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:57.420
come unto Thee. Right? And Jesus said, come. And based upon that, Peter went. And what

00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:02.700
happened? Peter walked on water. He didn't walk on water for long because he got his

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:08.020
eyes off of the Lord, but he walked on water. He was not presumptuous. He didn't just go.

00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:12.180
Listen, when the children of Israel, when they were told to go into the land of promise,

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:16.860
they were to go and they would bring back that report. Remember the 12 spies went. And

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:23.940
the 10 of them, they brought a report that was a report based on sight. We're not able.

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:27.900
I mean, there are giants in the land and there's all these things going on and they have walled

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:33.460
cities and fortified cities and they're too great for us. Joshua and Caleb said, if God

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:40.260
is in it, God will do it because God is able. And do you remember at the end of that portion

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:45.300
of scripture in Numbers chapter 14, there was a contingent of them that decided presumptuously

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:50.620
that they were going to go up and try to take and enter in. And guess what? Moses told them,

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:59.100
don't do it. God is not with you. And what happened? Failure. That's what happened. Why?

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:04.580
Because they weren't operating in faith. They were just doing what they wanted to do. They

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:08.140
were thinking, we're going to correct this problem by just going out and do this. No,

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:12.420
God didn't tell them to do it. And so when we think about faith, we as the people of

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:21.900
God were to be living by faith, living by faith. What does God say? Search it out, study

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:28.380
it out and say, I want to live by faith. I want to take God at His word. A portion of

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:33.380
scripture that's always been so precious to me is Acts 27, when Paul stands with great

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:40.260
boldness and declares, I believe God. It's a powerful statement. It's a powerful expression

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:48.740
of faith. Here's what God said. It doesn't matter that we've not seen the stars and the

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:53.820
moon, the sun. It doesn't matter that we are tossed in this crazy storm. It doesn't matter

00:44:53.820 --> 00:45:02.140
that all hope that we should be saved is gone. Because God said, the ship's going to be destroyed,

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:09.600
but not one of our lives are going to be lost. And I believe God that it shall be even

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:16.700
as He said. And we just begin to live by faith. Genesis chapter 20, a historical account,

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:24.200
an account in the life of Abraham. But we learn lessons for today. The enemy still tries

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:31.660
to use fear to paralyze the people of God. Still today he uses fear. But God hath not

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:38.060
given us the spirit of fear. Amen? He's not given us the spirit of fear. But what's going

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:44.340
to happen? How's this going to work? How's that? But God? That's how verse 3 starts in

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:51.700
Genesis 20, but God. What's the but God in my life and in your life? How's God going

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:59.500
to show up and show that He's faithful? Because He is, and He just wants us to trust Him.

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:07.460
Oh, that we'd live by faith. Abimelech, he believed what God said, and he acted thereon.

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:14.220
He said, here's your wife and here's a whole bunch of other stuff. Pray for me. And God

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:18.860
blessed because God is faithful. Let's pray. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:27.500
us. I pray that we'd learn some lessons from Genesis 20. It's easy for us to evaluate and

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:33.140
criticize the life of Abraham, to see his failure, if you will, in this portion of

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:44.140
Scripture, being controlled by fear. But I pray that as we evaluate that, that we'd understand

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:52.700
that we too are but dust, that our flesh is weak. You'd help us to take heed lest we also

00:46:52.700 --> 00:47:01.860
fall. I pray, God, that You'd help us to be mindful of Your faithfulness tonight. Oh,

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:10.900
God, that it would just give us a peace, knowing that You are the faithful God, that Your name

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:19.460
is faithful. And God, I pray that You'd help us to live by faith. As we see the response

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:29.660
of Abimelech to the revelation of God, I pray that we too would live in faith, live by faith.

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:35.660
We ask that You'd work in hearts and lives, that decisions would be made that would please

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:39.460
Thee. We'll thank You for it. In Christ's name we pray.
