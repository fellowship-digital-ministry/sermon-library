1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
And our faith, really, as we live out our faith,

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,800
really what's happening is our faith is being observed.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,140
And I mentioned this morning about some thoughts

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,979
with regard to others seeing Christ in us.

5
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:15,180
And I wonder this evening,

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,479
really at the beginning of the message,

7
00:00:17,479 --> 00:00:21,280
the thought tonight is, do others see Christ in me?

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,780
Do others see Christ in me?

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,979
Ask ourselves that question.

10
00:00:24,979 --> 00:00:28,659
And we desire that we would live our lives in such a way

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,040
that He alone would be exalted and magnified.

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,779
Do they see something different about us?

13
00:00:34,779 --> 00:00:38,060
Are they intrigued by the way that we live our lives,

14
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,340
by the things that we do,

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,939
by the things that we perhaps do not engage in conversation?

16
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:47,200
Do they notice something different about our speech?

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,500
Do they notice something different

18
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,099
about how we respond to difficulties and adversities?

19
00:00:52,099 --> 00:00:54,939
Is there something about our behavior

20
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:57,540
that is intriguing to those that are observing us?

21
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,740
Do they see and say,

22
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,139
something's different about this person?

23
00:01:01,139 --> 00:01:02,659
I'm not sure exactly what it is.

24
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:04,459
I can't quite put my finger on it,

25
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:05,800
but something is different.

26
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,220
They don't respond in the office

27
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,720
the same way everyone else responds in the office.

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,739
They don't respond when someone does them wrong

29
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:16,180
in like fashion and so on and so forth.

30
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,480
And our lives are being observed.

31
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,980
We could ask ourselves this question this evening.

32
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,980
Are we the salt of the earth and the light of the world?

33
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,940
Jesus told us in Matthew chapter number five

34
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,819
in verses 13 through 16,

35
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:32,260
that we are the salt of the earth

36
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,500
and you're the light of the world.

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,440
And what great responsibility that is,

38
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,819
what great opportunity that presents.

39
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:44,199
And we could ask ourselves these questions this evening.

40
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:46,059
And the reality is that as we look

41
00:01:46,059 --> 00:01:47,639
in Philippians chapter number four,

42
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:51,059
we're really gonna deal with a statement that Paul makes.

43
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:53,300
And when I think about the life of Paul,

44
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,059
I understand that his life was transformed.

45
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:58,180
In Acts chapter number nine, God tells us,

46
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,500
he records for us the conversion of Saul.

47
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,139
And we find that his life was transformed,

48
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:08,000
and I would say this, it was evidenced through his behavior.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,100
In fact, if you were to read Acts nine

50
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,820
and you read the first portion of the chapter

51
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,619
and then you skip the middle section

52
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:16,380
and go toward the end,

53
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,800
you'd be confused as all get out

54
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,240
because you'd say, what happened to this guy?

55
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,399
What happened is that he met Jesus

56
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:26,559
and his life was changed forever.

57
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:27,960
And I think about this,

58
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,800
when I think about his life being transformed

59
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,720
and it being evidenced through his behavior,

60
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,479
I would say this, his faith was observable.

61
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,320
His faith was observable.

62
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,759
And no doubt you've heard people say,

63
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,199
do this and do that,

64
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,639
and their actions really don't even line up

65
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,199
with their instruction.

66
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:55,199
But we find that Paul was a man that lived out his faith.

67
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,679
He did not simply go and travel and teach and preach

68
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,559
and write and instruct,

69
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:03,520
but he was living out the very faith

70
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,880
that he was teaching to others.

71
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,600
Notice here in Philippians four in verse number nine,

72
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,240
we'll use this as our really text verse

73
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,860
into the message this evening.

74
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,000
Notice what Paul says,

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,119
those things which you have both learned

76
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:20,020
and received and heard,

77
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:21,679
and then notice this phrase,

78
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:24,699
and seen in me.

79
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:25,539
Do.

80
00:03:26,619 --> 00:03:29,899
And the God of peace shall be with you.

81
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,539
As we think about this phrase of Scripture

82
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:35,940
when he says and seen in me,

83
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,419
I think about the impact of his behavior being observable.

84
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:44,580
I think about the importance of living out our faith.

85
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,979
It's one thing for us to teach and to give the words

86
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:49,380
and to give the instruction,

87
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:51,399
but when our faith becomes action

88
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:54,179
and we're living out the word of God,

89
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:56,020
we're living out our faith,

90
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,460
it is impactful.

91
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,020
And as we think about the text this evening,

92
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,279
he says and seen in me.

93
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:04,100
Think about the believers in Philippi

94
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,559
and think about the portion of Scripture

95
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:08,940
as we would not take the time this evening,

96
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,699
but if you went back to the book of Acts

97
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:13,779
in the 16th chapter and read about that entrance

98
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:16,579
into the city and the time in which they ministered

99
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,260
in Philippi and all of the uproar

100
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,059
and of course the imprisoned experience there

101
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:23,619
with Paul and Silas and understanding their singing

102
00:04:23,619 --> 00:04:26,220
and glorifying God and just all that takes place

103
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,899
and Paul had an opportunity to minister

104
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:32,179
and there were some that had observed his behavior

105
00:04:32,179 --> 00:04:35,940
and he says the things that not only you have learned

106
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,260
and received and heard,

107
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,899
but the things that you have seen in me.

108
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:43,700
As we begin 2022 and embark on a new year,

109
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,140
I wanna be challenged to live out my faith.

110
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,420
I wanna challenge each of us this evening

111
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,540
to live out our faith.

112
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,000
Others need to see Jesus in us.

113
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,899
They need to see that there's something different about us.

114
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,339
They need to see that when we deal with difficulties

115
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:04,299
and trials, that our God is real.

116
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,200
That it's not just a book of theory,

117
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,660
it's not just that we go through and say,

118
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,260
oh, just pray about it and just this and so on and so forth,

119
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,019
but then when the trouble comes knocking on our door,

120
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:18,100
we just kind of fall apart and they say,

121
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,540
well, what's different about you than me?

122
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,220
Do you understand what I'm saying?

123
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,339
And this evening, as we think about these truths

124
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:29,660
of living out our faith and being a doer of the word,

125
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,059
I really wanna be challenged

126
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:35,140
and I'm gonna share with you three particular areas

127
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,820
in which I think that it would be appropriate

128
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,179
for us to deal with and at the end of the message tonight,

129
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:42,859
I'm gonna give out a little card and I'm gonna ask you,

130
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:45,619
not necessarily to even fill out the card this evening,

131
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,700
but perhaps to take it and to pray over it and to meditate

132
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,579
and to ask the Lord to provide you with some direction

133
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:54,859
and I wanna challenge you to make some commitments to God.

134
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:58,140
I don't want these cards back.

135
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,100
I don't want you to put your name on them.

136
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,140
I want you to take the card

137
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,619
and I want you to put it in the Bible

138
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:06,459
and I wanna encourage you and as I remember,

139
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:08,899
I will seek to on a monthly basis,

140
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:10,820
just kind of mention, hey, how are we?

141
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,779
What kind of a monthly checkup, if you will?

142
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:15,220
How are we doing with our goals?

143
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,339
Because we make commitments to the Lord.

144
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:21,019
We set goals and if we're not reminded of them,

145
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:23,420
we can soon forget them and then all of a sudden

146
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,779
in September, we're flipping through our Bible

147
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:29,660
and you find this tucked in some part of the scriptures.

148
00:06:30,739 --> 00:06:32,459
And so we don't wanna do that.

149
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,179
Again, I'm not asking for these back.

150
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:37,420
I'm not asking for you to make some commitment to me.

151
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,459
I'm asking for us to before the Lord, make a commitment.

152
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,859
Three areas that we're gonna deal with.

153
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:47,579
The first one and I'm calling it my 2022 spiritual goals.

154
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:49,540
The first one is on prayer.

155
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,220
As believers, we have the privilege of prayer.

156
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,339
It is a unique privilege to every child of God

157
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:58,980
that we can enter into the very presence of God Almighty

158
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,500
and commune with him.

159
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,700
This unique privilege that is really reserved

160
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,500
for God's people, this unique privilege,

161
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,459
unfortunately is often neglected.

162
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:12,700
We've understood this, not only is it neglected,

163
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,700
but there are times that you will find that prayer

164
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,700
is one of those things that is used only

165
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,179
in time of emergency.

166
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:22,940
And that's not how God designed it to be.

167
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,500
We're to commune with him.

168
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,619
We're to have that fellowship with him.

169
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:29,100
The reality is that you've seen those things

170
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,579
that say in case of emergency, use this.

171
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:35,339
And maybe there's some things at your workplace

172
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:37,779
that are their medical type of equipment.

173
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:40,299
And you say, in case of emergency, use this

174
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:42,019
and perhaps you've been trained.

175
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:44,500
The door on the airplane is not to be used

176
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,260
unless it's in case of emergency, right?

177
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,859
You don't just go and open the door up

178
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:50,540
while you're at 25,000 feet.

179
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,140
That's not a good idea.

180
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,660
And so in case of emergency,

181
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,739
that's not how prayer is detailed in the word of God.

182
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,859
It's sad that there are times in which

183
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:06,100
it's tragedy or emergency that must enter into our lives

184
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,779
to really bring us to our knees.

185
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,660
But the reality is that we ought to have such a

186
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,260
pattern of prayer in our lives

187
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,579
that when that trial and that difficulty come,

188
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:20,500
it's just natural response.

189
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,059
It's not a last resort.

190
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:24,179
It's a first response.

191
00:08:24,179 --> 00:08:25,700
It's a let's pray about this.

192
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,179
Let's seek the face of God.

193
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:30,019
Let's engage in intercessory prayer.

194
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:30,859
And let me say this,

195
00:08:30,859 --> 00:08:32,820
as we look at these three particular areas

196
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,659
of the Christian life this evening

197
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,020
and make some commitments,

198
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:38,260
the reality is that I understand

199
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,500
I'm not suggesting in any one of these areas

200
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,299
that we're not doing it.

201
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:46,219
So please understand, I'm not suggesting that.

202
00:08:46,219 --> 00:08:48,659
I'm just suggesting that we ought to evaluate it

203
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:51,419
and say, let's make a commitment to the Lord.

204
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:55,739
Think about these verses, Luke 18, dealing with prayer.

205
00:08:55,739 --> 00:08:58,299
I want you to look at a few verses of Scripture with me.

206
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:03,299
And Luke chapter number 18 and verse number one,

207
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,299
in Luke 18 and verse number one,

208
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,140
the Bible says,

209
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,780
and he spake a parable unto them to this end.

210
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,659
Notice what he said,

211
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:20,659
that men ought always to pray and not to faint.

212
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:25,780
On Wednesday evening for about a month

213
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,900
or maybe six weeks this year, this past year in 2021,

214
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,260
I did a mini series on prayer, teach us to pray.

215
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,700
And I said this repeatedly through that message

216
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,739
or through that series of messages

217
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:40,820
that of all of the things that the disciples

218
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,020
could have asked the Lord Jesus Christ to teach them to do,

219
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,460
the only thing that we have recorded in the word of God

220
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,739
is that they said, teach us to pray.

221
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:50,979
Teach us to pray.

222
00:09:51,979 --> 00:09:53,739
Let me say this, prayer is tough.

223
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,500
Prayer is hard work.

224
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,580
Distractions abound.

225
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,780
The enemy doesn't want us to pray.

226
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,480
Have you found in your life that prayer is difficult?

227
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,020
Have you found in your life that prayer is spiritual battle?

228
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,980
It seems as if, as those that are moms of children,

229
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,200
as soon as you think you have that time that you have

230
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,900
to be able to go and pray, something happens.

231
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,700
Those that no longer have little kids,

232
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,240
there's something else that comes up.

233
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,040
There's a phone call, there's a text message,

234
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,280
there's a notification.

235
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,700
I think that technology is wonderful,

236
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,800
but sometimes it's such a hindrance.

237
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,180
You know, there are times in which we ought to be able

238
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,840
to take these devices and we ought to be able to unplug.

239
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,540
Like, go in and say, do not disturb,

240
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,820
turn off notifications, however your phone allows you

241
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,580
to do so, and put it aside and just get alone with God.

242
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,660
But what happens is we start to pray

243
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,760
and we've not disconnected and then,

244
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,760
bzz, bzz, if you have it on vibrate like I do,

245
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,120
if you have it on some kind of other tone,

246
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,800
I don't know, there's a hundred thousand of them,

247
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,700
it seems like, but it's a distraction, is it not?

248
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,040
And the reality is that prayer is so important,

249
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,280
it's so vital.

250
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,660
John R. Rice wrote a book, Much Prayer, Much Power.

251
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,600
He wrote a book on prayer and in that book,

252
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,420
he spoke of this, he often was known of saying this,

253
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,920
much prayer, much power.

254
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,180
Little prayer, little power.

255
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,620
No prayer, no power.

256
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,860
Someone else said this, the only place that power

257
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,920
comes before prayer is in the dictionary.

258
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,420
The only place power comes before prayer is in the dictionary

259
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,460
and the reality is that men ought always to pray.

260
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,340
We know the truth of 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 17,

261
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,500
the Bible says pray without ceasing.

262
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,360
To be in that continual spirit of prayer.

263
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,720
It doesn't mean that every waking moment of our day

264
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,720
that we're spent engaged in prayer,

265
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,960
but it means that we're so engaged in prayer

266
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,760
and we're in that spirit of prayer that at any moment,

267
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,080
we can just continue to have that dialogue with our Father.

268
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,360
That we're just in that such sweet, close communion with him.

269
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,980
Notice in 1 Timothy chapter two,

270
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,640
1 Timothy chapter number two,

271
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,280
and we'll look at all eight verses that start

272
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,440
this text of scripture, this great chapter,

273
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,640
and he deals with prayer and I want you to see

274
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,400
the priority that is placed upon prayer.

275
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,240
I've mentioned already that prayer is a unique privilege

276
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,400
that is reserved for the people of God

277
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,840
and what great joy is ours that we can enter

278
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,160
into the very presence of God Almighty,

279
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,320
that he actually invites us to enter into his presence.

280
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,780
It's never a bother, it's never a problem.

281
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,020
God wants us.

282
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,540
We sang on Friday evening as we took testimonies

283
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,020
and sang favorites, I must tell Jesus.

284
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,360
And after we sang that song, I said the wonderful thing

285
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,880
is that he wants us to tell him.

286
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,580
He invites us to tell him.

287
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,720
It's wonderful, it's glorious.

288
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,560
Notice in 1 Timothy two, I exhort therefore

289
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,360
that first of all, supplications, prayers,

290
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,500
intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men.

291
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,740
You notice where he says first of all, it's a priority.

292
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,300
If you don't plan to pray,

293
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,460
it's likely that you're not gonna pray.

294
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,460
If you do not plan to pray, if you don't have a time,

295
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:41,060
a place, if you're not intentional about prayer,

296
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,700
it's likely that it's never gonna happen

297
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,500
because things happen, right?

298
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,680
And the devil doesn't want us to pray.

299
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,080
Notice in verse number two, for kings

300
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,560
and for all that are in authority,

301
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,600
that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life

302
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,440
in all godliness and honesty.

303
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,120
I think if we'd be honest with one another

304
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,880
and with ourselves this evening,

305
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,240
we are guilty of complaining about

306
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,320
and criticizing our authorities

307
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,980
more than we are praying for them.

308
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,080
If we'd be honest tonight with ourselves,

309
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,240
with God, with one another,

310
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,440
we spend far more time criticizing and complaining

311
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,280
about our elected officials than we do praying for them.

312
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,900
It's just a sad reality of the state of the church.

313
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,800
It's where we are.

314
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,780
Verse three, for this is good and acceptable

315
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,620
in the sight of God our Savior.

316
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,820
Now when God tells us that something's good,

317
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,260
we ought to take heed to that, amen?

318
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,780
I mean, we ought to say, okay, draw my attention to that.

319
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,160
This is good, God is pleased with this.

320
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,220
Verse four, who will have all men to be saved

321
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,940
to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

322
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,300
Isn't that wonderful?

323
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,380
Whosoever will.

324
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,960
The gospel is available to everyone.

325
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,740
Those officials that make decisions

326
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,620
that we don't agree with, Jesus died for them.

327
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,660
He shed his precious blood so they'd be redeemed.

328
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,560
I understand that many of them reject.

329
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,300
Some of them, no doubt, have never even heard

330
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,140
a clear presentation of the gospel.

331
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,520
Verse number five, it says, for there is one God

332
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,040
and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,

333
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,480
who gave himself a ransom for all

334
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,680
to be testified in due time,

335
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,900
whereunto I am ordained a preacher and an apostle.

336
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,040
I speak the truth in Christ and lie not,

337
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,280
a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.

338
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,240
Notice verse eight.

339
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,040
I will, therefore, that men pray everywhere,

340
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,200
lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.

341
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,020
Prayer, asking and receiving, that was the title

342
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,940
of the book that John R. Rice wrote.

343
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,780
And you think about praying in faith

344
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,940
and believing that God hears and that God answers.

345
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,980
And what a blessing.

346
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,780
I mean, we have so many prayer promises

347
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,940
throughout the word of God.

348
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,540
Call unto me and I will answer thee

349
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,020
and show thee great and mighty things

350
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,740
which thou knowest not.

351
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,840
We think of Hebrews four and verse number 16

352
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,140
when the Bible says, let us, therefore,

353
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,700
come boldly unto the throne of grace

354
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,980
that we may obtain mercy and find grace

355
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,740
to help in time of need.

356
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,560
Prayer.

357
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,060
I ask this question, would you make a commitment to God?

358
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,940
Would I make a commitment to God

359
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,980
to spend a specific amount of time in prayer each day?

360
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,340
I have on the PowerPoint there five minutes per day,

361
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,740
10 minutes per day, or blank.

362
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,080
Because sometimes, some are maybe already praying

363
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,960
60 minutes a day.

364
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,880
And so to make a commitment to pray five minutes a day

365
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,160
would not be progress, right?

366
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,080
And I don't know how, what our commitments are.

367
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,080
I don't know, perhaps, if there are days that go by

368
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,380
where we've forgotten to pray.

369
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,880
The busyness of the schedule, we intended to,

370
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,360
we thought we would, but so many things came up.

371
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,080
But God chose, and by the way, God can,

372
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,340
because He's God, He chose that it was through

373
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,380
the means of prayer that it would move the hand of God.

374
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,820
So what He chose.

375
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,780
Prayer changes things.

376
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,780
The effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man

377
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,380
availeth much, right?

378
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,620
And so prayer.

379
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,220
I'm gonna pass these cards out at the end

380
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,280
so you don't have to take all these things in your notes,

381
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,780
but I want you to think about that.

382
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,860
And would I make a commitment to God

383
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,660
to pray each day a certain amount of time

384
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,240
that I would just commit that time to God in prayer?

385
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,240
To praying on behalf of one another,

386
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,700
to interceding on the behalf of not only our church family,

387
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,960
but the missionaries that God enables us to support.

388
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,360
It's not just about putting money in an offering plate.

389
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,880
I'm thankful for your faithfulness in giving.

390
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,200
I'm thankful that we can support missionaries financially,

391
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,860
but they need our prayer support.

392
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,760
For them to know that we're praying for them

393
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,480
to be engaged in intercessory prayer.

394
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,600
It's work, it takes time.

395
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,660
The second area in which I would deal with tonight

396
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,220
when we think about my spiritual goals

397
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,860
would be that of Bible reading.

398
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,380
The reality is that it's not possible

399
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,340
that I'm going to take heed to that which I do not know.

400
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,060
Right?

401
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,540
I can't take heed to that which I do not know.

402
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,260
When we think about Bible reading, it's sad.

403
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,640
There are many today that would sit in churches

404
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,220
all across the nation and they have answered requests,

405
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,619
polls, surveys that have been taking place

406
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,799
and they've answered questions with regard

407
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,679
to how often they read their Bible.

408
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:41,000
And you will find that, shockingly, mind-boggling

409
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,380
is that very few people that sit in church every week

410
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,040
actually read their Bible regularly.

411
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,140
It's just sad.

412
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:50,799
It's such an encouragement.

413
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,880
I mentioned this this morning.

414
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,619
It's such an encouragement to me

415
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:55,960
when people are saying, hey, I was reading my Bible

416
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,280
and I have a question about this portion of Scripture.

417
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,020
When someone says, for the first time in my Christian life,

418
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,440
I read the Bible from cover to cover in its entirety.

419
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,619
That's encouraging.

420
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,600
And what a blessing.

421
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,000
I know that there are some that have read the Bible

422
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,920
through cover to cover annually.

423
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,480
You've done it many years in a row.

424
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,840
And you've already started and continue to do so

425
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,480
and you plan to do so.

426
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,600
But I think about this.

427
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,040
When I think about reading the Bible,

428
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,880
we understand that the Bible, the Word of God,

429
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,520
it reveals to us who God is.

430
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,500
How do I know God if I don't read His Word?

431
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,360
To know God is to know His Word, right?

432
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,920
God has told us who He is.

433
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,799
If we're depending upon the school systems

434
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,400
to tell us who God is, if we're depending upon Hollywood,

435
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,059
if we're depending upon the elected officials,

436
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:48,720
if we're depending on any person to tell us who God is,

437
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,000
it's gonna be different than what God's told us in His Word.

438
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,619
God has already revealed to us in His Word.

439
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:56,860
He's defined for us who He is.

440
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,119
And all we need to do is read the Word of God.

441
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:02,699
and we'll know who God is.

442
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:05,599
The Word of God reveals the plan of God.

443
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,739
It reveals God's plan.

444
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:09,339
We understand that God has a plan, He has a purpose.

445
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:12,399
He moves with purpose.

446
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:14,899
There are times in which we may deal with life

447
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:17,219
and we may say, I don't know what the plan is.

448
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:20,539
I don't know what God is doing,

449
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:23,939
but I can rest assured that God has a plan.

450
00:20:23,939 --> 00:20:26,979
And God is not sitting in heaven saying,

451
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:28,539
oh, I didn't know that this was going to...

452
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:29,739
No, that never happens.

453
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:31,459
Nothing ever occurs to God.

454
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:32,699
He knows everything.

455
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,619
He has a plan for everything.

456
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:36,739
The Word of God provides direction.

457
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:41,739
The Word of God increases my faith.

458
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:44,499
The Word of God is so vital.

459
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:46,059
I did a little research

460
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:52,619
to determine the amount of time commitment

461
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:53,939
that would be necessary in order

462
00:20:53,939 --> 00:20:55,979
to read the Bible through annually.

463
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:00,099
There are 1,189 chapters in the Bible.

464
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:04,539
If you divide that by the number of days in a year,

465
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:07,259
it's basically three and a quarter chapters per day.

466
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:10,179
It's really not a lot.

467
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:17,639
They say at an average rate of pulpit speed,

468
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:21,879
that probably wasn't my speed

469
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:23,779
because I'm a little faster, I think.

470
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:27,259
Mady tells me, pastor, you were talking fast

471
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:28,939
when you were preaching the other day.

472
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:31,179
Sometimes I gotta get on a little roll, you know?

473
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:35,939
And the reality is that they say it takes 52 hours

474
00:21:35,939 --> 00:21:38,539
and 20 minutes to read the Old Testament,

475
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:41,839
18 hours and 20 minutes to read the New Testament.

476
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,339
So the total time commitment to read the entirety

477
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:47,499
of the Bible is 70 hours and 40 minutes.

478
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:50,339
You know that if you do the math, it's 12 minutes a day.

479
00:21:51,939 --> 00:21:52,879
12 minutes a day.

480
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:55,339
There's a lot of things that we do

481
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:59,939
for a lot longer than 12 minutes a day, right?

482
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:02,579
Any of you guys have an iPhone

483
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:05,459
that tells you weekly what your screen time was?

484
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:08,039
Or did y'all just turn that thing off?

485
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,019
You know what I'm saying?

486
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:10,419
Because it tells you, right?

487
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:12,979
Your screen time went up by 27% this week,

488
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:15,539
and you're like, man, what was I doing on my phone?

489
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,000
You know, people spend, and I didn't do all the research,

490
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,519
and I've done it before,

491
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:25,879
but it's absolutely just sad

492
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:29,399
to see how many hours a day people spend on social media.

493
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:33,000
How many hours a day people spend watching,

494
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:39,199
fill in the blank, TV shows, movies, sports.

495
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:41,279
I'm not saying that any of those things in and of themselves

496
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:44,039
are wrong or wicked, but what I'm suggesting

497
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:48,080
is that how can we spend hours a day on social media

498
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:53,039
and on news and on fill in the blank,

499
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,580
and then say, well, I just didn't have time

500
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,679
to read God's Word?

501
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:58,899
None of us can make time.

502
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,779
It's absolutely impossible to make time.

503
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,799
We simply have to use our time,

504
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:10,720
and we have to plan our time.

505
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,519
12 minutes a day, that's not a lot.

506
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:14,979
It really isn't.

507
00:23:14,979 --> 00:23:16,360
Notice some verses of Scripture.

508
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,679
First Timothy four.

509
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:22,919
First Timothy, chapter number four.

510
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:27,679
You understand this evening that I read my Bible through,

511
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,839
whether you read your Bible through or not.

512
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,039
Why do I make that statement?

513
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:36,360
Because the reality is that I wanna encourage you

514
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,179
to read your Bible because I know it will help you.

515
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:45,159
Right, it doesn't help me if every single person

516
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:48,479
in our church reads their Bible and I don't read my Bible.

517
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:50,919
It doesn't help me, right?

518
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:53,539
So for me to read my Bible through helps me,

519
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:56,839
and for you to read your Bible helps you.

520
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:03,199
Typically, I read the Bible through twice every year,

521
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:07,159
in the New Testament, a third and fourth time.

522
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:09,119
That's just what I do.

523
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:12,979
I'm not suggesting that's what somebody else should do.

524
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:17,019
I'm not suggesting, that's not what I've always done.

525
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:18,500
I remember the first year I ever read

526
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,139
the whole Bible through in one year.

527
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:23,339
I remember that as a new Christian

528
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:26,220
and being encouraged to read my Bible through in a year.

529
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,799
I remember the first time I ever did that.

530
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,459
I remember the first time I ever tried to do it

531
00:24:30,459 --> 00:24:33,380
and didn't succeed, and what happens?

532
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,019
Well, for me, I got discouraged

533
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:37,339
because I saw that little checklist and I was behind

534
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:38,779
and I knew where I was supposed to be

535
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:41,779
and I got discouraged and I got overwhelmed.

536
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:43,220
And I've tried to encourage people,

537
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,059
listen, it's not about the quantity, it's about the quality.

538
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:48,619
If you can only read a chapter a day,

539
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:51,320
then read a chapter a day, but get something from it.

540
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:55,339
In 1 Timothy 4, in verse number 13,

541
00:24:55,339 --> 00:24:57,899
the Bible says, till I come, give attendance to reading,

542
00:24:57,899 --> 00:25:00,500
to exhortation, to doctrine.

543
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,660
No doubt, when he speaks of reading,

544
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,419
he's speaking of reading the Word of God.

545
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:09,260
Many books can inform, but only the Bible can transform.

546
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:15,260
A scholar of yesteryear said that of all of the volumes,

547
00:25:15,859 --> 00:25:17,899
you remember they used to have encyclopedias

548
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:21,679
that were printed, now it's Wikipedia typically.

549
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,399
I think it was a few years ago that, what was it,

550
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:26,820
Britannica, is that the company that did the encyclopedias

551
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,660
all those years?

552
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,679
For the very first time, they didn't print out

553
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,760
a series of encyclopedia, because so many people

554
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,320
are using the internet and what have you.

555
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,419
But this particular theologian of yesteryear,

556
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:43,160
he said, of all of the books in my library,

557
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,760
and he listed a whole host of how many volumes he had,

558
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,399
he said, I could put all of those on this side of the table

559
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:51,919
and I could put the Bible over here

560
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,519
and the Bible's more valuable.

561
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:56,359
And it really is.

562
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,760
It's amazing to me, and I'm not against somebody

563
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,959
reading a novel, but it's amazing to me

564
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,600
how somebody can sit down and read a novel

565
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,720
in a couple of days and they say,

566
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,320
well, the Bible's just too big.

567
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:09,119
It changes our lives.

568
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:14,040
It's God's love letter to us, right?

569
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,079
You think about that.

570
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,660
Back in the day, if Mike and Elizabeth were here,

571
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,799
I would tell them before they started dating,

572
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,519
because they were giving me a hard time

573
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:24,559
a couple of weeks ago about how old I am.

574
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,320
There was a time when Holly and I were dating,

575
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,160
you know what we did?

576
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,160
We wrote notes to each other.

577
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,959
That was like using a piece of paper and a pen

578
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,440
and actually writing a note, right?

579
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,880
You know what that means.

580
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,880
Some people are like, we just text, we just email.

581
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,479
Used to be a time that you sent letters in the mail.

582
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,600
Many times, I would read those letters more than one time.

583
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,119
Why?

584
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:57,040
Because it was from the girl I loved.

585
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:00,000
And I wanted to read it and reread it,

586
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,919
and then after we got married,

587
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,899
she found a box of letters I wrote her,

588
00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:06,699
and one night, she's like, hey, honey, look what I found.

589
00:27:06,699 --> 00:27:08,820
Maybe I should read some of them.

590
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,220
I was like, I'm going to bed.

591
00:27:12,739 --> 00:27:13,940
I said, what?

592
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:16,299
I'm just teasing.

593
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:20,619
But the reality is that this is God's love letter to us.

594
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:26,179
When my dad was in Desert Storm back in 1990, 1991,

595
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:28,299
they didn't have FaceTime, they didn't have internet

596
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:30,380
that was available for video conferencing

597
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,399
and all that sort of thing,

598
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,519
and they didn't even have reliable phone service

599
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,679
that we could talk.

600
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,119
And he was in Desert Storm,

601
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:40,799
I think it was about seven months altogether

602
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,320
that he was there, and I don't know exactly

603
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,720
how many letters I received from my dad during that time.

604
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,399
I think it was just two or three letters.

605
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:51,320
But I remember as a 10-year-old kid,

606
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,440
the excitement.

607
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,519
I got a letter from my dad.

608
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,359
How do we neglect it?

609
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,919
But yet, so many do.

610
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:13,559
2 Timothy 2 and verse 15 tells us to study.

611
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,000
Study what?

612
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,320
Study the Word of God to show ourselves approved.

613
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,799
It tells us, study to show thyself approved unto God,

614
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:25,359
a workman that needeth not to be ashamed,

615
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:27,799
rightly dividing the Word of truth.

616
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:31,519
I gotta read it if I'm gonna study it.

617
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,440
1 Peter 2 and verse number two says,

618
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,440
as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the Word,

619
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:41,960
that ye may grow thereby.

620
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,919
2 Timothy 3 and verse 18 says,

621
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:47,799
but grow in grace in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior,

622
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:51,320
Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and honor forever and ever.

623
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,159
Amen.

624
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:58,159
This book produces growth in God's people.

625
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,119
And so the question this evening

626
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:02,080
with regard to Bible reading

627
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,520
is will we make a commitment to God

628
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,039
perhaps to read the book of Proverbs each month,

629
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,440
perhaps to read the New Testament in one year,

630
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,960
perhaps to read the entirety of God's Word in one year,

631
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,000
and make that commitment to God?

632
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,320
You say, well, I already do that.

633
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,159
Good.

634
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:20,080
Continue.

635
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,159
Maybe add to it.

636
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:25,359
I change it up year by year.

637
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,119
I think it was in 2018.

638
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,239
I read the Bible through twice,

639
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:33,359
but I read the book of Psalms every month.

640
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,799
It requires that you read five Psalms a day,

641
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:39,640
and you do that,

642
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,679
and you get through the whole book of Psalms each month.

643
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,679
Someone says, what do you do when you get to Psalm 119?

644
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,080
You spend more time reading.

645
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:49,400
It's really not a bad thing, right?

646
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,159
And so there's a whole host of things you can do.

647
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,679
Personally, I enjoy reading, starting in Genesis,

648
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,880
and going through Revelation, and then starting over.

649
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,320
That's what I personally enjoy.

650
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,159
That's what.

651
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,019
It works for me.

652
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:06,259
Some people enjoy reading the New Testament and the Old Testament at the same time.

653
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:09,619
Reading a chapter or two from the Old Testament, a chapter from the New Testament.

654
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:13,159
Some people, it just, whatever works for you.

655
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:16,799
But purpose to read the Word of God daily.

656
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,259
Make that purpose.

657
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:19,319
Make that commitment.

658
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:24,019
The third area this evening is the area of witnessing.

659
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:29,739
The reality tonight is that we have the truth and the world needs it.

660
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:34,059
We have the truth and the world needs it.

661
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:40,479
The reality is that being saved and having the truth, really more than making us prideful

662
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:47,199
or boastful or better, it really makes us indebted.

663
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:48,719
What did Paul say?

664
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:50,799
I'm a debtor.

665
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,599
I'm a debtor.

666
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:53,959
Why?

667
00:30:53,959 --> 00:31:02,839
Because God has entrusted something with me that needs to go to other people.

668
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:10,519
Just a few weeks ago, we dealt with the Christmas season, really just a week ago.

669
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:15,399
Many times you read through the accounts in Matthew and Luke.

670
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:20,119
In Luke chapter number two, we read of those shepherds.

671
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:24,759
It's always insightful to me that when the shepherds receive the great news that they

672
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:32,479
receive, the great message, the good tidings of great joy, the truth that is given to us

673
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:37,239
that is so impactful to me in that passage of Scripture is that the Bible says in verse

674
00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:38,239
number 10,

675
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:43,519
I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people.

676
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:49,279
I bring you, but it shall be to all people.

677
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,879
And as believers, having this precious book, we are indebted.

678
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:57,119
We have a responsibility.

679
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:05,479
We have been commissioned by God and He promises to bless His Word.

680
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:07,959
Sometimes we say, well, it doesn't really work.

681
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,439
Leave the results to God.

682
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:12,919
Just keep sowing the seed.

683
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:18,319
Just keep sharing the Gospel.

684
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:23,359
I'll quickly read some verses of Scripture in Matthew chapter 28.

685
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:27,599
I'll read each account in the Gospels where the great commission is given to us.

686
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:34,279
And I think it was Paul Chappell wrote a book entitled Out of Commission.

687
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:37,039
And it was a book that was written about the great commission.

688
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:41,279
Someone, I'm not sure who the author was, I believe they wrote a book or at least preached

689
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,719
a message.

690
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:48,439
He called it great omission because the church is failing to do what we've been entrusted

691
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:49,439
to do.

692
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:58,659
And the reality is that God's final command to His people remains our mission today.

693
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:01,759
In Matthew 28 verse 18, Jesus came and spake unto them saying,

694
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:04,719
All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

695
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:08,119
Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the

696
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,599
Son and of the Holy Ghost.

697
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:14,439
Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.

698
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:18,919
And lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.

699
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:20,539
Amen.

700
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:27,199
In Mark chapter number 16 and verse number 15, the record is given here in a single verse

701
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:31,239
of Scripture with regard to the great commission.

702
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:38,359
And here in Mark 16 and verse 15, He, Jesus said unto them, the disciples, go ye into

703
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:43,879
all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.

704
00:33:43,879 --> 00:33:57,519
Luke chapter number 24 and verses 47 and 48 before the ascension, the Bible tells us this

705
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:03,519
as Luke records it, that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among

706
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:09,879
all nations beginning at Jerusalem and ye are witnesses of these things.

707
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:17,719
John chapter 17 and verse number 18.

708
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:26,719
John 17 is a great passage of Scripture dealing with the prayer of the Lord Jesus Christ before

709
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,119
He'd go to the cross of Calvary.

710
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:32,919
The hour has come is how He begins that prayer in verse number 1.

711
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:38,119
And I want you to notice in verse number 18, as He's praying, He says, as thou hast

712
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:44,719
sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.

713
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,399
Why did He send us into the world?

714
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:51,359
To be the light of the world, to be the salt of the earth, to be His representatives.

715
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,479
We're familiar with the truth.

716
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:57,959
I mentioned this morning, Acts 1 and verse number 8.

717
00:34:57,959 --> 00:35:04,519
When God tells us to do something once, it's important.

718
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:10,079
God doesn't repeat Himself because He forgot that He already said it.

719
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,239
There's an obvious emphasis in the Word of God on the responsibility of the people of

720
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:18,759
God being the witnesses that He's commissioned us to be.

721
00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:22,879
In Acts 1 and verse number 8, but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has

722
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:26,799
come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and

723
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:32,239
in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.

724
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:39,879
In Acts 5 and verse number 32, the Bible tells us, and we are His witnesses of these things.

725
00:35:39,879 --> 00:35:44,599
And I think about that ownership, that we take it personally, that it is our personal

726
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:50,839
responsibility to share the gospel with the people that God places in our lives.

727
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:56,119
That we understand nothing is done by accident and that God gives us, we sometimes use the

728
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:59,319
terminology, that was a divine appointment.

729
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:04,359
You know what I really believe in my life is that I miss a lot of divine appointments.

730
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:08,359
And one of the reasons that I miss them is because I'm not looking for them.

731
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:09,799
I'm not mindful of them.

732
00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:14,999
I'm busy trying to accomplish the things on my list to do today and I have all of these

733
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:18,999
things that I need to get accomplished that I forget that He's left me here for a greater

734
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:22,079
purpose.

735
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,919
We find that really as you look at the book of Acts and you read it in its entirety and

736
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:32,599
you see the way the gospel went forth and you read about the missionary journeys and

737
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:37,559
you read the testimonies of the enemies where they say that you have filled Jerusalem with

738
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:38,559
your doctrine.

739
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:43,839
We told you, we commanded you, we threatened you not to speak in His name but yet you have

740
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,239
filled Jerusalem with your doctrine.

741
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:50,919
When they say of Paul and the others on the missionary journey, these that have turned

742
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:57,519
the world upside down have come hither also, oh that it would be said of us that we have

743
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:00,439
filled this region with the gospel.

744
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:02,139
Amen?

745
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:05,799
That the next person you try to give a gospel tract to says, man I just got one of these

746
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:07,959
a little while ago.

747
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:08,959
That's exciting.

748
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:10,639
That's encouraging.

749
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:15,719
Have you ever seen the same person repeatedly and you give them a gospel tract and you're

750
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:19,679
saying, man you kind of have that internal dilemma of I just saw this same person three

751
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:25,399
days ago because I go to the same place five times a week and I don't know if I should

752
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:28,799
give them a gospel tract again and so on and so forth.

753
00:37:28,799 --> 00:37:35,319
The last time that happened to me, I noticed the guy, I know this guy, I've given him gospel

754
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:36,959
tracts before.

755
00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:40,159
So I go to give him a gospel tract and I already kind of prepared for what he was going to

756
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,159
say.

757
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:45,639
You already gave me one of these.

758
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,039
And I said this.

759
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,039
I said, but did you read it?

760
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,999
And he just looked at me.

761
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:52,999
And that was his answer.

762
00:37:52,999 --> 00:37:53,999
Right?

763
00:37:53,999 --> 00:38:00,159
I mean, I knew his answer by his response of just that blank stare.

764
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:02,439
And I said, how about this?

765
00:38:02,439 --> 00:38:06,959
I'll give you another one if you read it.

766
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:10,799
I've never seen the guy again.

767
00:38:10,799 --> 00:38:14,559
But he took a gospel tract that day.

768
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:19,579
And the reality is that Paul said this in Romans 1, I mentioned about being indebted.

769
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:23,679
He says that if you look at verses 14 through 16, he talks about being a debtor, he talks

770
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:27,399
about being ready, and he talks about not being ashamed.

771
00:38:27,399 --> 00:38:29,599
I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.

772
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,599
Why?

773
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,000
It's the power of God unto salvation.

774
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,559
When we understand the power of the message that has been entrusted to us, we ought not

775
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:41,000
be ashamed to speak of it.

776
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,519
When we understand, as I mentioned in Sunday school this morning, when you look at that

777
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:49,519
maniac from Gadara, as we often refer to him as, that man that had his life transformed

778
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:55,879
by the power of the Lord Jesus Christ, he had a desire to be with Christ, yes, but Christ

779
00:38:55,879 --> 00:38:59,299
left him there in that place.

780
00:38:59,299 --> 00:39:02,839
He forbid him, he suffered him not to go with them.

781
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:05,399
And he left him there and he said that you're to be a witness.

782
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:11,639
Go and tell these people how great things the Lord hath done for thee.

783
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:16,919
And he went and he published it, the Bible tells us, in Decapolis, and the people marveled.

784
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:18,719
They saw what was happening.

785
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:22,799
They saw the power of God on display.

786
00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:28,399
And this evening, we are His ambassadors, we're His representatives.

787
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:33,579
Second Corinthians 5 and verse number 20 tells us that we are His ambassadors.

788
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,959
This world is not my home, I'm just a passing through.

789
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:38,519
My citizenship is in heaven.

790
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:43,519
I happen to be a United States citizen, and this is my mission field.

791
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:49,479
It is my responsibility to reach this place with the gospel.

792
00:39:49,479 --> 00:39:54,819
Psalm 126, I want you to see these verses of Scripture, and then I'll get some assistance

793
00:39:54,819 --> 00:39:57,000
here in just a moment to pass these cards out.

794
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,479
We'll use that by way of our invitation this evening.

795
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:22,479
In Psalm 126, in verses 5 and 6, I want you to see what the Bible says here.

796
00:40:22,479 --> 00:40:32,479
"'They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed,

797
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:39,479
shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.'"

798
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:44,479
I wonder, when's the last time we've really prayed for lost souls?

799
00:40:44,479 --> 00:40:50,479
When's the last time we've wept over lost souls?

800
00:40:50,479 --> 00:40:57,479
The weeping. The Bible says of Paul, you don't need to turn there, but in Acts 20 and verse 31,

801
00:40:57,479 --> 00:41:02,479
"'I cease not to warn every one night and day with tears.'"

802
00:41:02,479 --> 00:41:04,479
With tears.

803
00:41:04,479 --> 00:41:10,479
The psalmist in Psalm 119 speaks about the wickedness that he observes and the tears that are response.

804
00:41:10,479 --> 00:41:13,479
Hating every evil way.

805
00:41:13,479 --> 00:41:15,479
But it affects us.

806
00:41:15,479 --> 00:41:20,479
Do we weep for lost souls?

807
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:24,479
I preached a message.

808
00:41:24,479 --> 00:41:26,479
I guess I really shouldn't say I preached the message.

809
00:41:26,479 --> 00:41:28,479
I plan to preach a message.

810
00:41:28,479 --> 00:41:29,479
I'll give you a preview.

811
00:41:29,479 --> 00:41:32,479
I don't know when I'm going to preach it because God hasn't given me liberty.

812
00:41:32,479 --> 00:41:36,479
But I shared the thought with a small group of preachers.

813
00:41:36,479 --> 00:41:40,479
I wasn't at a pastor's meeting, just a small group of pastors.

814
00:41:40,479 --> 00:41:42,479
And they asked me if I'd share a thought.

815
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:48,479
And I was by far the youngest one there, and I felt like it would be more appropriate for someone else to share a thought.

816
00:41:48,479 --> 00:41:52,479
But nonetheless, I was the one that was asked.

817
00:41:52,479 --> 00:42:00,479
And I shared a thought from the prophet when the Bible says that the man of God wept.

818
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:07,479
And I shared a thought with the reason of him weeping was because God had revealed some things

819
00:42:07,479 --> 00:42:12,479
as destruction that was going to come upon the people of Israel.

820
00:42:12,479 --> 00:42:17,479
And then I asked this question to that small, really just a handful of preachers.

821
00:42:17,479 --> 00:42:22,479
When's the last time the man of God wept?

822
00:42:22,479 --> 00:42:25,479
When we read Revelation 20.

823
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:29,479
Dean read verse 10 this morning in our Sunday school.

824
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:32,479
Man, Satan is going to be cast in a lake of fire.

825
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:35,479
He's going to be tormented day and night forever and ever.

826
00:42:35,479 --> 00:42:36,479
It's a choice.

827
00:42:36,479 --> 00:42:37,479
That's exciting.

828
00:42:37,479 --> 00:42:42,479
But the very next verse says there was a great white throne.

829
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:53,479
And as you read verses 11 through 15, it talks about the eternal destination of those that die without Christ.

830
00:42:53,479 --> 00:43:00,479
And the Bible tells us that those that were not found written in the book of life were cast into the lake of fire.

831
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,479
This is the second death.

832
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:07,479
That's real.

833
00:43:07,479 --> 00:43:09,479
And that ought to affect us.

834
00:43:09,479 --> 00:43:11,479
It ought to impact us.

835
00:43:11,479 --> 00:43:18,479
It ought to cause us to have, obviously, let me say it this way,

836
00:43:18,479 --> 00:43:24,479
we give the gospel because we've been commissioned to do so and we walk in obedience to God.

837
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:28,479
But when we understand how desperately the world needs it,

838
00:43:28,479 --> 00:43:35,479
it ought to prompt us to be even more aggressive in sharing the truth.

839
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:38,479
Here I've given a couple of thoughts.

840
00:43:38,479 --> 00:43:40,479
Five tracks per week.

841
00:43:40,479 --> 00:43:43,479
A track per day, so seven per week.

842
00:43:43,479 --> 00:43:47,479
But then let me just make a quick comment on this third point.

843
00:43:47,479 --> 00:43:52,479
Purpose to share the gospel with one person each month.

844
00:43:52,479 --> 00:43:56,479
Let me say it this way.

845
00:43:56,479 --> 00:44:01,479
We ought to be praying that God would give us an opportunity.

846
00:44:01,479 --> 00:44:06,479
I believe that if we pray that God would give us an opportunity to share the gospel with someone each month,

847
00:44:06,479 --> 00:44:10,479
I believe that's a prayer that God would like to answer.

848
00:44:10,479 --> 00:44:11,479
Right?

849
00:44:11,479 --> 00:44:13,479
God, cross my path, give me the opportunity.

850
00:44:13,479 --> 00:44:16,479
Help me to see the opportunity.

851
00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:17,479
Help me not to miss it.

852
00:44:17,479 --> 00:44:22,479
Help me to look for and to be aware of.

853
00:44:22,479 --> 00:44:26,479
I think God will answer that prayer.

854
00:44:26,479 --> 00:44:29,479
And you'll find that he gives you opportunities and maybe that commitment,

855
00:44:29,479 --> 00:44:32,479
that purpose to once a month share the gospel, you say,

856
00:44:32,479 --> 00:44:35,479
man, God's given me an opportunity each week.

857
00:44:35,479 --> 00:44:36,479
Praise the Lord.

858
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,479
Keep sharing the gospel.

859
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:40,479
Amen?

860
00:44:40,479 --> 00:44:41,479
And we ask God.

861
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:44,479
Dio Mudi, it's said of him.

862
00:44:44,479 --> 00:44:45,479
Sorry, I just turned that off.

863
00:44:45,479 --> 00:44:47,479
I shouldn't have turned that off.

864
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:52,479
Dio Mudi, it is said of him that he made a commitment that he would not pillow his head at night

865
00:44:52,479 --> 00:44:59,479
until he had shared the gospel with one person each day.

866
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:04,479
There were times in his life, it's reported, I've read,

867
00:45:04,479 --> 00:45:08,479
where he had busy long days, all sorts of things going on.

868
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:13,479
Exhausted, tired, he gets home, he's ready to turn in for the evening, pillow his head.

869
00:45:13,479 --> 00:45:18,479
The Holy Spirit of God reminded him that he did not share the gospel with someone.

870
00:45:18,479 --> 00:45:24,479
Literally gets out of bed to go down into the city of Chicago

871
00:45:24,479 --> 00:45:27,479
to find somebody to share the gospel with.

872
00:45:27,479 --> 00:45:29,479
Why?

873
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:31,479
Because he made a commitment to God.

874
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:35,479
And he understood the power of the gospel.

875
00:45:35,479 --> 00:45:41,479
It's said of Dio Mudi that God used him to shake two continents.

876
00:45:42,479 --> 00:45:46,479
It's said that over a million people came to know Christ under his ministry.

877
00:45:46,479 --> 00:45:49,479
That's powerful.

878
00:45:49,479 --> 00:45:53,479
Someone asked, just as they asked Spurgeon what the secret to his ministry was,

879
00:45:53,479 --> 00:45:59,479
and in one report that I read, he simply pointed to the window and said,

880
00:45:59,479 --> 00:46:01,479
it's there.

881
00:46:01,479 --> 00:46:05,479
And the individual that was inquiring was perplexed,

882
00:46:05,479 --> 00:46:08,479
and he said, just go over and look, and you'll see.

883
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:10,479
And the guy still didn't understand what he was saying.

884
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:14,479
If you look out that window, you see all the people that are walking.

885
00:46:14,479 --> 00:46:18,479
He said, God's called me to reach those people.

886
00:46:18,479 --> 00:46:20,479
And he took it personally.

887
00:46:20,479 --> 00:46:22,479
So he made a commitment.

888
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:25,479
I said this this morning, little quote there in the corner,

889
00:46:25,479 --> 00:46:32,479
if you fail to plan, you plan to fail.

890
00:46:32,479 --> 00:46:36,479
It's 6.59, bear with me just a few more minutes.

891
00:46:36,479 --> 00:46:42,479
When I was in the corporate world, we used to have to set every year goals.

892
00:46:42,479 --> 00:46:44,479
It was always exciting.

893
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:50,479
You'd have reviews and determine how you did with those goals and what have you.

894
00:46:50,479 --> 00:46:56,479
But I remember as I would try to counsel with some of the people that worked for me

895
00:46:56,479 --> 00:47:01,479
and try to help them to formulate their goals, that we'd always talk about SMART goals.

896
00:47:01,479 --> 00:47:05,479
Some of you are familiar with that terminology and acronym.

897
00:47:05,479 --> 00:47:14,479
Just real quickly before we pass these out, when you set goals, the S of SMART goals,

898
00:47:14,479 --> 00:47:18,479
they should be specific and they should be stated.

899
00:47:18,479 --> 00:47:22,479
Make specific goals.

900
00:47:22,479 --> 00:47:24,479
I'm going to pray more.

901
00:47:24,479 --> 00:47:26,479
Okay, that's good, but what does that mean?

902
00:47:26,479 --> 00:47:28,479
It's really not specific enough, right?

903
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:30,479
There's not enough substance to it.

904
00:47:30,479 --> 00:47:34,479
So SMART goals start with them being specific and stated.

905
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:39,479
Measurable goals, something that we can measure.

906
00:47:39,479 --> 00:47:42,479
Let me say this, attainable goals.

907
00:47:42,479 --> 00:47:50,479
If you've never read the Bible through, if your Bible reading is very haphazard,

908
00:47:50,479 --> 00:47:54,479
maybe you just make a commitment to read the New Testament through this year.

909
00:47:54,479 --> 00:47:56,479
Don't make a commitment.

910
00:47:56,479 --> 00:47:58,479
I heard pastors say he read the Bible through two times.

911
00:47:58,479 --> 00:47:59,479
I read it three times.

912
00:47:59,479 --> 00:48:01,479
You're just going to get discouraged.

913
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:03,479
I'm just being honest with you.

914
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:05,479
You're just going to get discouraged.

915
00:48:05,479 --> 00:48:08,479
And then what's going to happen with that goal?

916
00:48:08,479 --> 00:48:10,479
It's going to go out the window.

917
00:48:10,479 --> 00:48:14,479
Set a goal that's attainable.

918
00:48:14,479 --> 00:48:18,479
R, a goal that is realistic.

919
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:21,479
And I would say this as well, relevant.

920
00:48:21,479 --> 00:48:24,479
What is the purpose of me setting these goals?

921
00:48:24,479 --> 00:48:27,479
When I speak about these spiritual goals, these commitments to the Lord,

922
00:48:27,479 --> 00:48:31,479
it's relevant to my walk with God.

923
00:48:31,479 --> 00:48:37,479
It's relevant in my development as a child of God, in my progress, in my walk with God.

924
00:48:37,479 --> 00:48:45,479
And T for SMART goals, I would say this, trackable or time-bound.

925
00:48:45,479 --> 00:48:48,479
Something that's trackable or time-bound.

926
00:48:48,479 --> 00:48:52,479
That's why I say I'm going to pass out five gospel tracks a week.

927
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,479
It's something that's specific.

928
00:48:53,479 --> 00:48:55,479
It's something that's measurable.

929
00:48:55,479 --> 00:48:57,479
It's something that's attainable.

930
00:48:57,479 --> 00:48:59,479
It's something that's relevant.

931
00:48:59,479 --> 00:49:02,479
And it's something that is time-bound.

932
00:49:02,479 --> 00:49:06,479
I'm going to make a commitment to pass out tracks.

933
00:49:06,479 --> 00:49:10,479
It doesn't really hit all of the criteria of a SMART goal.

934
00:49:10,479 --> 00:49:15,479
And so I want you to think about that, and I'm going to have some folks, Jared, Luke, Steve,

935
00:49:15,479 --> 00:49:20,479
you guys come and help me pass these out.

936
00:49:20,479 --> 00:49:25,479
And on the front is just the same thing that we had up here is on the front of this.

937
00:49:25,479 --> 00:49:30,479
And on the back is the little commitment sections.

938
00:49:30,479 --> 00:49:33,479
And again, I'm not asking you tonight to fill this out right here on the spot.

939
00:49:33,479 --> 00:49:34,479
I'm not asking you.

940
00:49:34,479 --> 00:49:35,479
I don't want it back.

941
00:49:35,479 --> 00:49:39,479
If you try to give it back to me, I don't want it.

942
00:49:39,479 --> 00:49:40,479
I honestly don't.

943
00:49:40,479 --> 00:49:42,479
I don't want it.

944
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:46,479
But I want you to, before the Lord, it's a different kind of message.

945
00:49:46,479 --> 00:49:49,479
I don't think I've ever preached a message like this.

946
00:49:49,479 --> 00:49:54,479
In ten and a half years of pastoring, I don't think I ever preached a message like this.

947
00:49:54,479 --> 00:49:57,479
But God just really put it on my heart.

948
00:49:57,479 --> 00:49:59,479
And I really think that it's important.

949
00:49:59,479 --> 00:50:01,399
it's important that we make some goals

950
00:50:01,399 --> 00:50:04,959
and make some commitments to God.

951
00:50:04,959 --> 00:50:07,059
All year, we're going to have as our theme

952
00:50:07,059 --> 00:50:08,959
walking in the light.

953
00:50:08,959 --> 00:50:12,139
How am I doing walking in the light?

954
00:50:12,139 --> 00:50:14,099
These three particular pillars,

955
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:16,059
if I could call them that this evening

956
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:17,139
that we looked at,

957
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:20,339
it's not the entirety of Christian life,

958
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:21,839
but they're three pillars,

959
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,279
three legs of biblical Christianity

960
00:50:24,279 --> 00:50:25,479
that are vital.

961
00:50:25,479 --> 00:50:29,919
Prayer, Bible reading, and witnessing.

962
00:50:29,919 --> 00:50:31,779
It's our responsibility.

963
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:32,879
See, I'm not a missionary.

964
00:50:32,879 --> 00:50:35,419
Somebody said this.

965
00:50:35,419 --> 00:50:38,459
You're a missionary if it's only to the supermarket.

966
00:50:38,459 --> 00:50:41,599
We are God's representatives.

967
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,059
And so before the Lord,

968
00:50:43,059 --> 00:50:45,059
those little circles are not as big

969
00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:46,539
as I wanted them to be.

970
00:50:46,539 --> 00:50:48,039
The font kept messing with me,

971
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:49,039
but you can fill it in.

972
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:51,439
And maybe you want to circle a couple of them.

973
00:50:51,439 --> 00:50:52,739
Maybe you want to change it up.

974
00:50:52,739 --> 00:50:54,479
You say, I thought about this goal,

975
00:50:54,479 --> 00:50:55,679
and I want to put this down

976
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:58,379
instead of one of the options that you gave.

977
00:50:58,379 --> 00:51:01,839
Man, praise the Lord.

978
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:04,479
But just be open with the Lord

979
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:07,979
and let God direct you.

980
00:51:07,979 --> 00:51:10,419
And stick that in your Bible.

981
00:51:10,419 --> 00:51:12,459
And refer back to it.

982
00:51:12,459 --> 00:51:14,399
And let's have monthly checkups.

983
00:51:14,399 --> 00:51:16,159
Not that I'm going to come to you and say,

984
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:18,859
hey, what was your commitment and how are you doing?

985
00:51:18,859 --> 00:51:22,299
But you know, accountability is good.

986
00:51:22,359 --> 00:51:24,719
Accountability is something that's missing

987
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:26,499
in our society today.

988
00:51:26,499 --> 00:51:29,599
People don't want to be accountable.

989
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,999
And it would be a benefit, I think.

990
00:51:31,999 --> 00:51:34,739
I believe that husbands and wives

991
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:36,939
share your commitments with one another.

992
00:51:36,939 --> 00:51:37,639
Why?

993
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:40,139
Because who better to pray for you,

994
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:43,279
who better to hold you accountable to help you

995
00:51:43,279 --> 00:51:44,879
than your spouse?

996
00:51:44,879 --> 00:51:46,939
Children with your parents.

997
00:51:46,939 --> 00:51:48,079
Maybe some single folks.

998
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:49,219
There's some other single folks

999
00:51:49,279 --> 00:51:52,679
that you can have an accountability partner with.

1000
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:54,579
I'd be more than happy.

1001
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:56,619
I know I said I don't want them,

1002
00:51:56,619 --> 00:51:58,819
but I'm not saying that in a standoffish way.

1003
00:51:58,819 --> 00:52:01,759
I'm not trying to check up on people.

1004
00:52:01,759 --> 00:52:03,899
But if you want me to be an accountability partner,

1005
00:52:03,899 --> 00:52:07,299
I'd be more than happy to do that.

1006
00:52:07,299 --> 00:52:10,059
I've never been offended one time

1007
00:52:10,059 --> 00:52:11,059
when someone said to me,

1008
00:52:11,059 --> 00:52:12,899
hey, did you read your Bible?

1009
00:52:12,899 --> 00:52:14,839
It doesn't offend me.

1010
00:52:14,839 --> 00:52:17,099
Because I do.

1011
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:18,739
I've never been bothered when somebody says,

1012
00:52:19,699 --> 00:52:20,859
I do.

1013
00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:22,199
I'm not ashamed of it.

1014
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:23,159
I'm not embarrassed by it.

1015
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:26,439
I'm not bothered by it.

1016
00:52:26,439 --> 00:52:27,999
I know I've shared this story before.

1017
00:52:27,999 --> 00:52:29,139
Joseph, with our children,

1018
00:52:29,139 --> 00:52:30,299
we used to ask him all the time,

1019
00:52:30,299 --> 00:52:32,039
did you read your Bible today?

1020
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:33,139
Did you read your Bible today?

1021
00:52:33,139 --> 00:52:35,379
When they got old enough to read their Bible.

1022
00:52:35,379 --> 00:52:37,479
And I was sitting in our living room in Manassas,

1023
00:52:37,479 --> 00:52:40,979
and it was a Saturday afternoon,

1024
00:52:40,979 --> 00:52:43,319
and Joseph goes to walk up the stairs

1025
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:44,659
to go to his bedroom.

1026
00:52:44,659 --> 00:52:46,359
And he stops partway up the stairs,

1027
00:52:46,359 --> 00:52:48,159
and he looks at me.

1028
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:49,879
He says, hey, Daddy,

1029
00:52:49,879 --> 00:52:52,379
did you read your Bible today?

1030
00:52:52,379 --> 00:52:56,919
That blessed my heart.

1031
00:52:56,919 --> 00:53:00,099
And I was able to say, I did.

1032
00:53:00,099 --> 00:53:01,359
I could share with you what I read

1033
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:04,999
if you want to know.

1034
00:53:04,999 --> 00:53:06,799
And it's accountability.

1035
00:53:06,799 --> 00:53:07,339
Let's pray.

1036
00:53:07,339 --> 00:53:09,539
Father, we love You.

1037
00:53:09,539 --> 00:53:11,899
We thank You for loving us.

1038
00:53:11,899 --> 00:53:13,539
I know it's been a different kind of a message

1039
00:53:13,539 --> 00:53:14,339
this evening,

1040
00:53:14,419 --> 00:53:22,659
but God, I pray that Your Spirit has moved.

1041
00:53:22,659 --> 00:53:25,579
I've sought to be obedient.

1042
00:53:25,579 --> 00:53:28,779
And I pray that it's been helpful.

1043
00:53:28,779 --> 00:53:30,339
And I pray that we make some commitments

1044
00:53:30,339 --> 00:53:33,139
to You this evening.

1045
00:53:33,139 --> 00:53:36,419
And that God, You would use us.

1046
00:53:36,419 --> 00:53:41,019
Help us to grow

1047
00:53:41,019 --> 00:53:44,259
through our time of prayer and Bible reading.

1048
00:53:44,259 --> 00:53:47,179
That our faith would be increased.

1049
00:53:47,179 --> 00:53:48,579
That we'd be ready to give an answer

1050
00:53:48,579 --> 00:53:54,859
to every man of the hope that lieth within us.

1051
00:53:54,859 --> 00:53:58,379
Help us to see the hand of God moved

1052
00:53:58,379 --> 00:54:04,139
because of prayer.

1053
00:54:04,139 --> 00:54:08,059
God, help us to see souls saved.

1054
00:54:08,059 --> 00:54:11,179
Lives changed.

1055
00:54:11,179 --> 00:54:14,779
Baptismal water stirred.

1056
00:54:14,779 --> 00:54:19,499
Discipleship classes filled up.

1057
00:54:19,499 --> 00:54:23,179
Because we've purposed to share the Gospel.

1058
00:54:23,179 --> 00:54:30,019
And we've set some specific goals.

1059
00:54:30,019 --> 00:54:34,939
As we look and evaluate the group

1060
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:37,179
that's here tonight,

1061
00:54:37,179 --> 00:54:39,859
if in this next year,

1062
00:54:39,899 --> 00:54:40,699
2022,

1063
00:54:40,699 --> 00:54:43,459
You would allow each one of us

1064
00:54:43,459 --> 00:54:48,059
to just reach one person,

1065
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:51,419
our church would double.

1066
00:54:51,419 --> 00:54:54,699
I know that's simple.

1067
00:54:54,699 --> 00:54:57,379
But it's true.

1068
00:54:57,379 --> 00:54:58,339
It's not about the numbers.

1069
00:54:58,339 --> 00:55:01,739
It's about seeing souls saved.

1070
00:55:01,739 --> 00:55:04,099
Eternal destinations changed.

1071
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:07,259
God, we want You to be glorified

1072
00:55:07,259 --> 00:55:10,099
and exalted.

1073
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:11,499
Herein is my Father glorified

1074
00:55:11,499 --> 00:55:13,979
that You bear much fruit.

1075
00:55:13,979 --> 00:55:18,299
And help us to be about Your business.

1076
00:55:18,299 --> 00:55:21,099
I pray that in the quietness of the moment,

1077
00:55:21,099 --> 00:55:24,219
as Kimberly plays on the piano,

1078
00:55:24,219 --> 00:55:27,259
that we would respond.

1079
00:55:27,259 --> 00:55:28,899
That we'd be doers of the Word.

1080
00:55:28,899 --> 00:55:31,299
That we'd leave here tonight

1081
00:55:31,299 --> 00:55:36,939
with that desire to serve You.

1082
00:55:36,939 --> 00:55:39,539
That we'd make these commitments to You.

1083
00:55:39,539 --> 00:55:40,939
Well, thank You for the work that You'll do.

1084
00:55:40,939 --> 00:55:42,139
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

1085
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:42,859
Would You stand with us?
