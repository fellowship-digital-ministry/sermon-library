1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,039
chapter number 34 and thankful for God's Word and what a blessing it is to be able

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:11,239
to study the Word of God. And as we look at Genesis chapter number 34, there's an historical

3
00:00:11,239 --> 00:00:16,180
event that is recorded for us in this passage of Scripture. The two words that I would use

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,360
to describe the event that is recorded for us are sad and unfortunate. And as we look

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,040
at this particular passage of Scripture, we understand that God has preserved this account

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,979
for us. And there's so many things that happen. In fact, as you study the life of the patriarchs

7
00:00:31,979 --> 00:00:39,159
in the book of Genesis, you'll find many times where events that follow one another in the

8
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:44,680
passage of Scripture are separated by years of time. And certainly things took place and

9
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,720
God did not see fit to record those events for us. But here He records this event for

10
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,959
us and I believe that He's recorded it for us because there is a lesson that we must

11
00:00:54,959 --> 00:01:00,959
learn. See, this evening I think each of us would agree that life is full of experiences

12
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:06,879
and at times those experiences are less than desirable. There are times in our lives where

13
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:12,319
we're mistreated by individuals. There are times in which we are wrong, that people do

14
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:17,120
us wrong, and we can look at that. We've heard people say life isn't fair and sometimes the

15
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,760
response is, well, that's just the way it is. Life isn't fair. And the reality is that

16
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:29,959
as we live life in times of offense, when someone treats us wrongly, when someone mistreats

17
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:36,519
us, we must learn to trust the Lord. And we must learn to trust the Lord and then also

18
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:42,919
we must learn to avoid taking matters into our own hands. And I would say this, admittedly

19
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:49,519
this evening, that taking matters into our own hands is common. At times, if we'd be

20
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:55,080
honest, it's desirable. Isn't it? Sometimes something happens and you say, I just want

21
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,839
to give them a piece of my mind. And you just want to take matters into your own hands.

22
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:05,279
And we find that it's a common practice and at times it's desirable. But I would say this,

23
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:10,479
that reacting in that fashion of taking matters into our own hands when we're being wronged

24
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:18,039
is short-sighted. It reveals a lack of trust in the Lord and it often results in a mess.

25
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:23,080
I take matters into my own hands and I find out how quickly I can make a mess of things.

26
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,919
And if you've lived life for any length of time, you could agree that that's happened

27
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:32,039
in your life at some point. This evening, as we look at this particular passage of Scripture,

28
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:38,160
I would like to look at the historical account, but then also have the opportunity to make

29
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,559
some application in our lives. Begin reading with me there in verse number one. The Bible

30
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:47,960
says this, And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she barren to Jacob, went out to see

31
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53,720
the daughters of the land. And when Shechem, the son of Hamar, the Hivite, prince of the

32
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:00,520
country, saw her, he took her and lay with her and defiled her. And his soul claimed

33
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,440
unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.

34
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,320
And Shechem spake unto his father Hamar, and saying this, Get me this damsel to wife. And

35
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:17,039
Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter. Now his sons were with his cattle

36
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:23,360
in the field, and Jacob held his peace until they were come. And Hamar, the father of Shechem,

37
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,199
went out unto Jacob to commune with him. The sons of Jacob came out of the field when they

38
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:34,720
heard it, and the men were grieved. They were wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel,

39
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,880
in lying with Jacob's daughter, which thing ought not to be done." I've titled the message

40
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,199
this evening, as I've already mentioned by way of introduction, Avoid Taking Matters

41
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,720
Into Your Own Hands. As we look at the account that God gives us here in this particular

42
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,039
passage of Scripture, if you're taking notes, I want you to notice under the thought of

43
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:00,160
the historical account, notice with me the recorded offense. We've read the first seven

44
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,600
verses of Genesis 34, and in this portion of Scripture, God provides us with the recorded

45
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:11,160
offense. God tells us in verse number one that Dinah, Jacob's daughter, went out and

46
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,960
she interacted with the inhabitants of the land. The Bible says at the end of verse number

47
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:22,239
one that she went out to see the daughters of the land. And we find that in that position,

48
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:26,880
perhaps we could look at that and speak about the fact of being vulnerable in the position

49
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:34,000
in which she was, but we find that in that position that Shechem takes advantage of Dinah.

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,279
The Bible records it and says that he saw her at the end of verse number two, took her

51
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:45,559
and lay with her and defiled her. And we find that Jacob hears about the situation, of course,

52
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:52,839
after he had defiled Dinah, Shechem. The Bible says that he desired her to be his wife, and

53
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:57,640
Jacob hears about what had taken place according to verse number five. And the Bible tells

54
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:03,160
us at the end of verse number five that he held his peace, and he did not answer the

55
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,279
matter, he did not engage in the conversation. He waited, rather, for his sons to return

56
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:12,239
from the field. They were out tending to the cattle. And the Bible tells us in verse number

57
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:17,399
seven that the sons of Jacob, they came out of the field and they heard the news. They

58
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:23,359
heard what had taken place. Now, I want you to notice from verse number seven the response

59
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:29,359
of these brothers when they hear what has taken place. Notice the Bible says, the men

60
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:36,799
were grieved. I think that's a normal response, don't you? With what we just read, I'm not

61
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:42,399
going into the details of what took place. You understand in verse number two the situation

62
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:48,399
between Shechem and Dinah. But you understand this evening that when Dinah's brothers, the

63
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:54,959
sons of Jacob, when they hear what has transpired, the Bible says that they were grieved. The

64
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:03,880
Bible goes on to tell us this, and they were very wroth. Again, can you understand why

65
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,440
they would have the reaction that they have based on the circumstances that had taken

66
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:14,239
place? They're grieved. They're angry. They're very wroth. And the Bible tells us at the

67
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:18,040
end of verse number seven, notice what it says, because he had wrought folly in Israel

68
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:24,920
in lying with Jacob's daughter. And then notice this phrase, which thing ought not to be done.

69
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:31,040
You know, they were right. What took place was inappropriate. What took place was a violation

70
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,799
that should not have taken place. And we find that in that moment, again, as we've mentioned

71
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:40,559
by way of introduction, and we'll get to it as we get to the application aspect of the

72
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:45,859
message this evening, there are times in your life, there are times in my life, we see the

73
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:52,200
historical account here of what's taking place that this just isn't right. It's just not

74
00:06:52,200 --> 00:07:01,679
right what took place. As brothers, I don't have a sister. But I think about the relationships

75
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:07,320
between brothers and sisters, and those that have sisters, how a brother wants to protect

76
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:14,720
his sisters. Joseph is the youngest. He's the tallest now, but he's the youngest. But

77
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:23,119
he has two older sisters, but he desires, as a brother, to protect his sisters. And

78
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:28,760
I could understand if this type of event happened where he would be grieved, where he would

79
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:37,000
be very wroth. I can understand. I can relate to the sons of Jacob, can't you? The Bible

80
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
gives us, it records for us the offense that takes place in the remaining portion of the

81
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,320
Scripture here in Genesis chapter 34. We see that there's a response that is outlined.

82
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:53,920
Notice as the sons of Jacob hear word of what has transpired beginning in verse number 8,

83
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,440
the response is outlined for us. And in verses 8 through 12, we find that there's a request

84
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,480
that is given from Hamar and Shechem to Jacob and the boys. Notice in verse number 8, the

85
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:12,200
Bible says, And Hamar communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth

86
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:19,399
for your daughter. I pray you give her him to wife, and make ye marriages with us, and

87
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:26,519
give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you. By the way, it's a subject

88
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:30,000
that we could develop from verse number 9, and we will not this evening, but you could

89
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,599
develop it quite extensively. This is the first attempt to defile the Messianic line.

90
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,559
You can understand what's taking place and all the defilement. We're saying, Hey, let

91
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:45,440
us intermarry. And we find that in verse number 10, it says, And ye shall dwell with us, and

92
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:52,599
the land shall be before you. Dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.

93
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:56,320
It's as if they're trying to sweeten the deal, if you will, in verse number 10, and make

94
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,239
it extremely attractive to get what they want. In verse number 11, it says that Shechem

95
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:06,000
said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye

96
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,799
shall say unto me I will give. Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according

97
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:22,039
as ye shall say unto me, but give me the damsel to wife. We see the request. It's quite plain,

98
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:31,840
is it not? Shechem, he wants Dinah to be his wife. Hamar says, Hey, let our group,

99
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,280
let us intermarry. You can dwell with us, and you can have of the possessions, trade

100
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:42,039
with us, so on and so forth. And we find that now there will be a proposal that is given

101
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:46,440
from the sons of Jacob. Notice in verse number 13, it's interesting that Jacob is not the

102
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,559
one having the correspondence, but he allows the boys to speak on his behalf. And it says

103
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:55,000
in verse number 13, And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamar his father, notice

104
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,960
this word, deceitfully. Deceitfully. I remember as a child hearing this

105
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,080
phrase, I'm sure you've heard it as well, two wrongs don't make a right.

106
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,960
How many of you have heard that before?

107
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,460
Two wrongs don't make a right.

108
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,960
Two wrongs make a mess, right?

109
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,520
That's how it works.

110
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,920
But we find here that these sons of Jacob, the boys now remember their grieve, they're

111
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:21,480
very wroth, they're correct in their assessment, this thing ought not to have been done.

112
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,920
But now they're devising a plan, they're making a proposal, but they're being deceitful,

113
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,520
they answer Shechem and Hamar deceitfully.

114
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,560
Notice what they say in verse 13, because he had defiled thine other sister, notice

115
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,800
they said unto them in verse 14, we cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that

116
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,540
is uncircumcised, for that were a reproach unto us.

117
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:48,600
But in this will we consent unto you, if ye will be as we be, that every male of you

118
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,000
be circumcised, then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters

119
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,760
to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.

120
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,200
But if ye will not hearken unto us to be circumcised, then we will take our daughter, and we will

121
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
be gone.

122
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,000
Again, it's quite plain.

123
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,200
The request, the proposal, and there's an agreement that is reached.

124
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,440
Notice the statement in verse 18, the Bible says that the words pleased Hamar and Shechem,

125
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,360
Hamar's son, and the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in

126
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,480
Jacob's daughter, and he was more honorable than all the house of his father.

127
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,880
And verse 20 says that Hamar and Shechem, his son, came unto the gate of their city

128
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,400
and communed with the men of their city, saying, now notice what they say to the men of the

129
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
city.

130
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
It's quite interesting.

131
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,920
It gives some insight here that what's happening.

132
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,220
In verse 21, they say this to the men of the city, these men are peaceable with us, therefore

133
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,560
let them dwell in the land and trade therein.

134
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,320
Notice what they say, for the land, behold, it is large enough for them, let us take their

135
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:57,240
daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters, verse 22, only herein

136
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,280
will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among

137
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,760
us be circumcised as they are circumcised.

138
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,880
But notice what they say in verse 23, shall not their cattle and their substance and every

139
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:19,200
beast of theirs be ours.

140
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,640
There's a lot of deceit going on.

141
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:28,920
There's a lot of, this situation is full of just unfortunate approaches and we find that

142
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:35,320
they have this attitude of, listen, we're going to be able to be increased with goods

143
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,320
and so on and so forth, and it says at the end of verse 23, only let us consent unto

144
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,880
them and they will dwell with us.

145
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:47,120
And unto Hamar and unto Shechem, verse 24, and his son hearkened all that went out of

146
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,200
the gate of his city, and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate

147
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,480
of his city.

148
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,560
So we find that there was a request that was given, there was a proposal that was made,

149
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,920
and there was an agreement that was reached, and all of the men of the city, the Bible

150
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,440
says all of them that came out of the gate of the city, they were circumcised, and we

151
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,120
find that the Bible begins to record for us in verses 25 through 29 a great slaughter

152
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,160
that took place.

153
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,240
This was exactly the plan of the sons of Jacob when the Bible tells us in verse number 13

154
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,240
that they answered them deceitfully.

155
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,680
They knew what they were doing, they understood the opportunity that this would provide them

156
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,680
with.

157
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,840
And the Bible says in verse 25, and it came to pass on the third day when they were sore

158
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,740
that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man a sword

159
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,000
and came upon the city boldly, notice what it says, and slew all the males.

160
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,880
It's a great slaughter that takes place.

161
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,120
It says that they slew Hamar and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword and took Dinah

162
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,600
out of Shechem's house and went out.

163
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,320
The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and spoiled the city.

164
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
Why?

165
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,680
Because they had defiled their sister.

166
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,320
Verse 28 says that they took their sheep and their oxen, their asses, and that which was

167
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,920
in the city and that which was in the field, and all their wealth and all their little

168
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:15,560
ones and their wives, took they captive and spoiled even all that was in the house.

169
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,960
Isn't this an unfortunate event that takes place in Genesis chapter 34?

170
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,400
I mean it begins with a violation, but we find then that matters are taken into their

171
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,540
own hands and we find that they respond deceitfully and there's this great slaughter.

172
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,920
And we know that in verse number 30 that there is a great level of fear and concern on the

173
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,640
part of Jacob for the Bible says that Jacob says to Simeon and Levi, ye have troubled

174
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,880
me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the

175
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:50,000
parasites, and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me

176
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,040
and slay me and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.

177
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,960
Now we understand as we've studied through the book of Genesis that often as we read

178
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,880
about Jacob and his response to certain circumstances and events, he's a man that's often fearful.

179
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:12,080
And we find this being expressed in verse number 30 because of what has transpired,

180
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,960
but I want you to understand the perspective of the sons as it's given to us in verse

181
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
31.

182
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:24,680
The Bible says that they said, should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?

183
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,140
Really I believe that as you look at verse number 31, this answer to Jacob when he expresses

184
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:35,580
his fear and concern in verse number 30 to his sons, to Simeon and Levi specifically,

185
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:41,340
I believe that these boys and their response as it's recorded in verse 31 is really seeking

186
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,180
to justify their actions, to justify their actions.

187
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:50,220
By the way, isn't that typically what we do when we take matters in our own hands?

188
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,260
We take matters in our own hands and then we justify our actions.

189
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,060
But do you know what they did to me?

190
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,540
Do you know what they said?

191
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,100
Do you know what...isn't that what we do?

192
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:06,180
And we find here, listen, I've already acknowledged this evening that what took place as they

193
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:10,500
say in verse number 7, this thing ought not to be done.

194
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,380
They were absolutely correct.

195
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,940
They took matters in their own hands.

196
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:22,260
Jacob will mention this very thing in Genesis 49, turn over if you will, when he's dying

197
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,700
and the blessings are being given to his sons.

198
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:37,100
Notice what he says in Genesis chapter 49, beginning in verse number 1, Genesis 49 and

199
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,940
verse 1, the Bible says, and Jacob called unto his sons and said, gather yourselves

200
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:46,260
together that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.

201
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:52,020
Gather yourselves together and hear you sons of Jacob and hearken unto Israel your father.

202
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,260
Notice beginning in verse number 5, he begins speaking to Simeon and Levi.

203
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:00,380
These are the two that we read of in Genesis 34 that we just read the entirety of the account,

204
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,500
this historical account that took place.

205
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,100
And notice what Jacob says when he's on his deathbed here.

206
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:12,260
It says, Simeon and Levi are brethren, instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.

207
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,900
Oh my soul, come not thou into their secret, unto their assembly.

208
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,340
Mine honor, be not thou united.

209
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:28,420
For in their anger, they slew a man and in their self-will, they digged down a wall.

210
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:34,460
Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce, and their wrath, for it was cruel.

211
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,260
I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel.

212
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:44,220
Isn't it interesting that Jacob makes mention specifically of this event that we just read

213
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:50,800
of Genesis 34 about Simeon and Levi and he talks about their anger and how it was fierce

214
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,200
and how their wrath was cruel.

215
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,280
There are times in our lives that we want to take matters into our own hands.

216
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,560
And I believe this evening that as we look at the historical account in Genesis 34, and

217
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:07,280
obviously I've gone very quickly at these 31 verses to kind of dig through it and look

218
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,280
at the account, but I want to spend some time this evening to seek to make an application

219
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,360
for each of us this evening.

220
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,680
Because we are tempted in our lives as we go through life, there are times in which

221
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,920
you will be tempted and I will be tempted to take matters into my own hands and into

222
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,760
your own hands.

223
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,760
Look over at the New Testament, if you will, to the book of Romans.

224
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,580
Look at Romans chapter number 12 and then we'll look at a number of passages of Scripture

225
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:40,020
this evening as we seek to make this point this evening of how important it is that we

226
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:45,280
resist, that we avoid taking matters into our own hands.

227
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,119
We said number one, the account, number two, the application, the application that we receive

228
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,960
from this portion of Scripture.

229
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,520
It's interesting in verse number 18, the Bible says this of Romans 12, if it be possible

230
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,679
as much lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.

231
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,600
Isn't that a great verse of Scripture?

232
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,920
Some people say, this is as much possibility as I have, right?

233
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:14,800
But it says in verse 19, notice what God says, dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but

234
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,280
rather give place unto wrath.

235
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:27,920
For it is written, vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.

236
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:33,480
Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him.

237
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,720
Excuse me?

238
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,320
My enemy?

239
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,240
My enemy is hungry?

240
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,800
Feed him.

241
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,200
Feed him.

242
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,040
If he thirsts, give him drink.

243
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:52,320
For in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.

244
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,000
I remember hearing my mom say when I was a kid, she didn't know anything about the Bible,

245
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,800
but she said, kill him with kindness.

246
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,040
She said that all the time.

247
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
the time.

248
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
Kill them with kindness.

249
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,840
I want to kill them, but not with kindness, you understand, right?

250
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,920
But that's what she'd say all the time.

251
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:18,320
Notice verse 21, be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

252
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:25,280
I would submit to you this evening, this is not easy to do, and you cannot do it in your

253
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,800
own power.

254
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:33,280
You cannot do it in your flesh, because your flesh wants to take matters into its own hands.

255
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,960
Your flesh wants to get even.

256
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,360
Your flesh wants to repay evil with evil, right?

257
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:48,080
That's what we want to do, revenge, get even, get back, have the last word.

258
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:55,960
It's interesting, Brother Lennon had no idea that I'd be preaching this message this evening.

259
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:01,440
We were sitting at the table last evening, and he was talking about the unique opportunities

260
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,000
that they have ministering where they are in Ecuador, and he shared some things with

261
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,880
us about ministering amongst the Latino community and amongst the Persian community, but those

262
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:20,280
of the Indian background, the natives that were there for the Incas and what have you,

263
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,600
and some of the ministry amongst that people group there, and how some of them continue

264
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,920
to have within their tribes and all of those things, the witch doctors and curses and voodoo

265
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:35,840
sorts of things and all of that, and he was sharing with me about times in which those

266
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,400
folks will get saved.

267
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,960
They'll get saved out of that false teaching and out of that false religion, and they'll

268
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,280
get saved, but there's so much of that in their background that somebody then puts a

269
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,600
curse against them, so then they want to go to the witch doctor and they want to take

270
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:59,000
and put a curse back, and Brother Lennon said, we have to teach them to trust God.

271
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,280
We've got to teach them to rely upon the Lord, and I thought it was so interesting because

272
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,200
that tendency is not only for those people that have had that experience in their life,

273
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:17,440
but just a human response when somebody does us wrong, and here God says, vengeance is

274
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:24,600
mine, I will repay, saith the Lord. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

275
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,560
I would say this tonight as we think about this truth of avoiding taking matters into

276
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:37,040
my own hands, how can I do that? Number one, I would say this, if I'm going to avoid taking

277
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,680
matters into my own hands, I must recognize God's providence. I must recognize that God's

278
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:49,320
in control. We can speak often about God being in control, but when someone does us wrong,

279
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:55,640
when there's an evil that is committed against us, this evening I wonder, do we understand

280
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:02,240
the truth that God is in control even in those moments? See, it seems as if in our lives

281
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,520
when things seem to be going well, when there seems to be a great victory, man, God is in

282
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:11,240
control. When someone does us wrong, when someone falsely accuses us, when something

283
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,480
happens in our life like what happens to Joseph at the end of the book of Genesis, he makes

284
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,400
this testimony. Of course, he's sold into slavery, and you can read all that takes place

285
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,700
beginning in chapter 37 of the book of Genesis, but he says, you meant it unto evil, but God

286
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:33,700
meant it unto good. What a perspective, understanding, recognizing God's providence. I believe that

287
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:41,940
when I recognize, when you recognize God's providence in our lives that will enable us

288
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:47,860
to demonstrate restraint in our lives. Listen, you have the flesh and I have the flesh. Our

289
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:52,900
flesh was not eradicated at the moment of salvation. That's not what happened. We're

290
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:57,140
to crucify the flesh. We're to mortify our members. That's what the New Testament tells

291
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:06,660
us, and we're to die daily. That's what Paul says, I die daily. I am crucified with Christ.

292
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:13,700
Our flesh wants to get even. Our flesh wants to react to those times of adversity, and

293
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:22,300
I'm going to recognize God's providence, and I'm going to have to exercise restraint. I

294
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:28,060
believe this evening that when I avoid taking matters into my own hands, it reveals a measure

295
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:34,500
of spiritual maturity. It reveals spiritual maturity when someone could do us wrong, could

296
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:43,700
do us harm, and we can trust God, rely upon Him, not take those things into our own hands

297
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:49,300
and not react to the circumstances and the situations, and it reveals a measure of maturity

298
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:56,580
that we understand who God is and that God is in control.

299
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,580
I want you to look at the life of David, and I know we use this passage in Romans, but

300
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,980
I want you to go to the book of 1 Samuel, if you will, and we won't have time to develop

301
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,700
everything that's taking place in the life of David. We're going to pick it up in 1 Samuel

302
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:18,660
chapter 24. Just begin to think about the life of David briefly before we get to chapter

303
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:23,020
24, and without looking at all of the chapters and verses, I want you to think about David

304
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:28,060
and his life. I want you to think about where he was in 1 Samuel chapter number 16 when

305
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:33,700
he's out tending to the sheep. I mean, he's doing what his father had instructed him to

306
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:39,420
do. He was being obedient, he was being submissive, he was being responsible to take care of that

307
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:50,940
flock. The man of God, Samuel, comes to anoint the next king, and David's not even invited.

308
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:57,300
Surely this is the one, is what Samuel says, and God says no. One by one, the sons of Jesse

309
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:04,900
pass by, no, no, no. Are there any others? Well, the youngest, he's out taking care of

310
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:15,260
the sheep. Bring him here. We're not going to sit until he comes. God says, it's him.

311
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:20,060
David is anointed to be king of Israel in 1 Samuel chapter 16. He didn't apply for the

312
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:30,260
job. You understand? God chose him to be the king of Israel. And in chapter number 16,

313
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,180
at the end of the passage, he's then again taking care of the sheep, and he's brought

314
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:39,380
in to minister to Saul, because there was an evil spirit that came. And we find that

315
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:43,980
he's brought to minister before Saul, and then he's back taking care of the sheep. And

316
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:49,100
in chapter number 17, we read about Goliath and all that takes place, and how the Philistines

317
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:53,260
are fighting against the nation of Israel, and all of the men of Israel, including Saul

318
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:58,180
the king that was head and shoulders above all the others, they're fearful, they're afraid,

319
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:03,860
they're hiding, and David comes. Again, he's just doing what his father instructed him

320
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:12,860
to do. Go and take these goods to your brothers. And he hears Goliath, and he says, is there

321
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:20,740
not a cause? He says, I'll go and fight against this uncircumcised Philistine. He wasn't looking

322
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:25,740
for any kind of recognition. He wasn't looking to be popular or promoted. He wasn't looking

323
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:33,300
for the ladies of the land to say David has slain. No, he wasn't looking for any of that.

324
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:38,500
He wanted everyone to know that there's a God in heaven. He continues to minister before

325
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:44,660
Saul, and Saul tries to kill him. Throw a javelin at him. Saul said, here's what I'm

326
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:49,420
going to do. I can't kill him myself, so I'm going to offer my daughter to be his wife.

327
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:53,140
By the way, he thought he'd offer the daughter that he did because it'd be a reproach to

328
00:27:53,140 --> 00:28:01,260
him, and it'd be a bad situation, make his life miserable. He said, give me 100 foreskins

329
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:07,500
of the Philistines as dowry. What was he saying? I'll let the Philistines kill him. David brings

330
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:15,460
back 200, victorious. Everywhere he went, the Bible says that he behaved himself wisely.

331
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:25,500
God was with him. Saul continued to try to kill David. Saul was hunting him. And David

332
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:30,860
was a man that he testifies that there's but a step between him and death. And he understood

333
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:35,940
what was taking place, and we come to 1 Samuel chapter 24, and several other things have

334
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:40,340
transpired, but I want you to see in chapter 24 and verse number 4, the Bible says that

335
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:44,740
the men of David said unto him, behold the day of which the Lord said unto thee, they're

336
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:49,580
now in the cave there, and Saul's there. He had taken these 3,000 chosen men, according

337
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,220
to verse number 2, to seek David. Obviously, he wants to kill David. And the Bible says

338
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:58,820
that the men of David, now remember there were 400 men that went with him. That continues

339
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:04,380
to grow to 600 and et cetera. And we find that the Bible says that they say, behold

340
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:08,140
the day of which the Lord said unto thee, behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine

341
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:12,620
hand that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose and

342
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:18,220
cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily. And it came to pass afterward that David's

343
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:24,020
heart smote him because he had cut off Saul's skirt. And he said unto his men, the Lord

344
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:29,140
forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the Lord's anointed. Notice what he

345
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:35,260
says, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the Lord. So

346
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:40,460
David stayed his servants with these words and suffered them not to rise against Saul.

347
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:44,860
But Saul rose up out of the cave and went on his way. David also arose afterward and

348
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:49,980
went out of the cave and cried after Saul, saying, My Lord, the king. When Saul looked

349
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,900
behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth and bowed himself. And verse 9 says

350
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:59,100
that David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh

351
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,020
thy hurt.

352
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:07,500
Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how the Lord hath delivered thee today into mine

353
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,980
hand in the cave."

354
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:15,100
Notice what he says, and some bade me kill thee.

355
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,620
Sometimes people are going to tell you to take matters into your own hands.

356
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,620
You know what they did to you?

357
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,380
Did you hear what they said to you?

358
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:28,340
People are going to provoke you, try to encourage you to take matters into your own hands.

359
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,700
You're going to let them get away with that?

360
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,740
You're going to let them talk to you that way?

361
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,740
You understand?

362
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:38,300
This is the world we live in.

363
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,960
David said, some of them said to kill you.

364
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:50,100
But mine eyes spared thee, and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my Lord, for

365
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,980
he is the Lord's anointed.

366
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,340
Wow.

367
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,140
David had to understand something about the providence of God.

368
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:02,720
He had to demonstrate, exercise a measure of restraint.

369
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,780
We find that in chapter 26, notice with me again, there's a situation that takes place.

370
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,820
And the Bible tells us that David now is in the wilderness of Ziph, and it says that the

371
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,260
Ziphites came unto Saul in verse number 1 to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself

372
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:21,380
in the hill of Hacaliah, which is before Jeshimon?

373
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,660
Then Saul arose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having 3,000 chosen men of Israel

374
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,500
with him to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.

375
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,940
Notice in verse number 3, it says that Saul pitched in the hill of Hacaliah, which is

376
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,820
before Jeshimon, by the way.

377
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:42,940
But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.

378
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,500
And so we see the setting, look down, if you will, to verse number 7.

379
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,380
The Bible says, So David and Abishai came to the people by night, and behold, Saul lay

380
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:55,500
sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster.

381
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,780
But Abner and the people lay around about him.

382
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:06,540
Then said Abishai to David, notice what Abishai says, God hath delivered thine enemy into

383
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,700
thine hand this day.

384
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,780
Now therefore, let me smite him.

385
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:19,500
I pray thee with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second

386
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,860
time.

387
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:24,500
Sometimes we say, man, I need an Abishai in my life, because he says, I'll go ahead and

388
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,500
take care of it, David.

389
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,340
You don't want to raise up your hand against him?

390
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,340
Let me do it.

391
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,340
I'll just smite him once.

392
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,340
I won't do it a second time.

393
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,100
That's what Abishai says.

394
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:40,620
But notice in verse number 9, David said to Abishai, destroy him not.

395
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:46,660
For who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord's anointed and be guiltless?

396
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:53,420
David said furthermore, as the Lord liveth, you believe that God's alive?

397
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,420
He believes in control?

398
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,640
You believe he knows what's going on?

399
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:03,860
He said, as the Lord liveth, the Lord shall smite him.

400
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:11,500
Or his day shall come to die, or he shall descend into battle and perish.

401
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:17,060
The Lord forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the Lord's anointed, but

402
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:22,100
I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is in his bolster and the crews of water,

403
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,660
and let us go.

404
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:28,900
So David took the spear and the crews of water from Saul's bolster, and they got them away.

405
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,860
No man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked.

406
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:38,500
For they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the Lord was fallen upon them.

407
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,900
David said, I'm not going to lift my hand against the Lord's anointed, but Abishai,

408
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,540
I'm not going to allow you to either.

409
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,540
He forbid him.

410
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,660
He forbade him.

411
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:55,020
The Bible says that David had this understanding that the Lord who lives will deal with Saul.

412
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:58,400
By the way, God was able to deal with Saul, was he not?

413
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,980
And Saul did go into battle and did not return from battle.

414
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:06,340
We find that God took care of Saul.

415
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:14,140
Interference between these two events in the life of David is 1 Samuel chapter 25.

416
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:23,380
And in 1 Samuel 25, I believe that God records for us a significant interaction between David

417
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:30,500
and Abigail that helps us with understanding this whole process of not taking matters into

418
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,380
our own hands.

419
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,700
In Genesis chapter 34, there was a wrong that was committed.

420
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,660
There was evil that took place against Dinah.

421
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:45,580
Jacob's sons, the brothers of Dinah, they were grieved and they were full of wrath and

422
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,540
they were angry over what had taken place.

423
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:52,260
They were right in their assessment that this thing ought not to be done.

424
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:58,940
But they took matters into their own hands and they made a mess of the situation.

425
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:06,020
We find that David, in 1 Samuel 24, God gives an opportunity when Saul enters into the cave

426
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,420
and David says, no, I'm going to resist that.

427
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,820
I'm going to trust the Lord.

428
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:14,340
In 1 Samuel chapter 26, God gives another opportunity and Abishai says, let me just

429
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,060
smite him once.

430
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,760
David says, no, I'm going to trust the Lord.

431
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,740
But in 1 Samuel 25, there's a different event that takes place that's not with Saul.

432
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:27,660
See, Saul was the Lord's anointed.

433
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,780
David had a certain perspective about not raising his hand against the Lord's anointed.

434
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,720
Saul was in the place where God had him at that particular time.

435
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:41,300
But when you look at 1 Samuel chapter number 25, the Bible records for us an interaction

436
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:46,100
between David and Abigail with regard to Nabal and his men.

437
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:51,180
Now Nabal was a fool, says it right in the passage of Scripture.

438
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:57,260
David and his men helped Nabal and did all sorts of things and it was time to be paid.

439
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,260
And Nabal says, who's David?

440
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,460
I mean, anyone can say they're anyone these days.

441
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:07,980
And David says, the men come back and David says, all right boys, saddle up.

442
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,980
We're going to go kill them all.

443
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,980
That's what he says.

444
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,780
That's what he says.

445
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:19,980
Notice David says in verse number 21 of 1 Samuel 25.

446
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:26,340
Now David had said, surely in vain have I kept all this fellow hath in the wilderness

447
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:31,340
so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him.

448
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:38,900
And he hath requited me evil for good.

449
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,380
Or do something good and somebody pays you back with evil.

450
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,500
David says, this is what happens.

451
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,460
He says in verse 22, so and more also do God unto the enemies of David.

452
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:53,180
If I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light.

453
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,580
He's going to go kill them all.

454
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:00,100
By the way, David was a mighty, mighty warrior.

455
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,780
David says, let's go boys.

456
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,860
I think Abishai was excited, don't you?

457
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,860
He was ready to kill Saul in just another chapter.

458
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:10,540
Abishai's like, let's go.

459
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,180
He's going to go.

460
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:18,100
But God allows Abigail to come.

461
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,780
And the Bible tells us, look, pick it up with me in verse 26.

462
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:27,300
Now therefore, my Lord, as the Lord liveth.

463
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,140
Is that not what he says in chapter 26?

464
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:36,260
As the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth, seeing the Lord hath withholden thee from

465
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,540
coming to shed blood.

466
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:44,380
Notice this phrase and from avenging thyself with thine own hand.

467
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:49,260
Now let thine enemies and they that seek evil to my Lord be as Nabal.

468
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:53,340
And now this blessing, which thine handmaid hath brought unto my Lord, let it even be

469
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:57,220
given unto the young men that follow my Lord.

470
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:01,420
Verse number 28, I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid for the Lord will

471
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:07,820
certainly make my Lord a sure house because my Lord fighteth the battles of the Lord and

472
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:11,580
evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.

473
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:16,340
Yet a man is risen to pursue thee and to seek thy soul, but the soul of my Lord shall

474
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,580
be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God.

475
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:25,300
The souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out of the middle of a sling.

476
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:31,100
Notice verse 30, and it shall come to pass when the Lord shall have done to my Lord according

477
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:37,220
to all the good that he had spoken concerning thee and shall have appointed thee ruler over

478
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,220
Israel.

479
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,619
Abigail knew the plan that God had for David.

480
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:45,100
Abigail was aware that he was going to become the king of Israel.

481
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:52,100
And she says that when that comes to pass, notice in verse 31, that this, what is she

482
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,100
referring to?

483
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:58,100
That you're going to kill all of the men, that this event, taking matters, avenging

484
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:04,460
thyself with thine own hand, according to verse 26, she says that this shall be no grief

485
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:10,460
unto thee, nor offense of heart unto my Lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless,

486
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,040
or that my Lord hath avenged himself.

487
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:23,119
But when the Lord shall have dealt well with my Lord, then remember thine handmaid.

488
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,820
Notice how David responds in verse 32.

489
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:34,660
David said to Abigail, blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which sent thee this day to

490
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,220
meet me.

491
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,440
Why?

492
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,900
Because David was about to take matters into his own hands.

493
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:51,179
Sometimes God might send an Abigail in your life and in my life at just the right time,

494
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:53,100
because we're about to take matters into our own hands.

495
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,619
We're about to make a mess of things.

496
00:39:56,619 --> 00:39:59,059
God sends an Abigail.

497
00:39:59,059 --> 00:39:59,820
David says.

498
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:04,240
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me.

499
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,940
He recognizes God's providence, does he not?

500
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,280
That God sent her to meet him.

501
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,820
Notice in verse 33, he says,

502
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,440
And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou,

503
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,280
which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood,

504
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:23,400
and from avenging myself with mine own hand.

505
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,120
For in very deed, as the Lord God of Israel liveth,

506
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,240
which hath kept me back from hurting thee,

507
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,860
except thou hast hasted and come to meet me,

508
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,980
surely there had not been left unto Nabal

509
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,940
by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.

510
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,160
He says, I was gonna kill all of them.

511
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,980
That's what he's gonna do.

512
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,660
It says in verse number 35,

513
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:51,060
So David received of her hand that which she had brought him

514
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,580
and said unto her, go up in peace to thine house.

515
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,700
See, I have hearkened to thy voice

516
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,320
and have accepted thy person.

517
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,320
Nabal still hasn't been dealt with,

518
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,580
but God's gonna deal with him.

519
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,480
And God's gonna deal with him in such a way

520
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,480
that David is not going to have any mark upon his testimony.

521
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,480
Not gonna be any reproach, no issues when he becomes the king.

522
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,700
It says in verse 36,

523
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,780
And Abigail came to Nabal, and behold,

524
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,940
he had a feast in his house like the feast of a king,

525
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,800
and Nabal's heart was merry within him,

526
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,960
for he was very drunken.

527
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,080
Wherefore, she told him nothing less or more

528
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,180
until the morning light.

529
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,680
But it came to pass in the morning

530
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,800
when the wine was gone out of Nabal

531
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,020
and his wife had told him these things,

532
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,960
that his heart died within him and he became as a stone.

533
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,120
And it came to pass about 10 days after

534
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,940
that the Lord smote Nabal that he died.

535
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,480
God's able, God's able.

536
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,180
Days passed, but God dealt with Nabal.

537
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,940
The Bible says in verse 39,

538
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,860
And when David heard that Nabal was dead,

539
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,540
he said, Blessed be the Lord.

540
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,740
Notice what he says,

541
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:05,340
That hath pleaded the cause of my reproach

542
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,100
from the hand of Nabal,

543
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:12,100
and hath kept his servant from evil.

544
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,180
For the Lord hath returned the wickedness of Nabal

545
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,240
upon his own head.

546
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,240
David sent and communed with Abigail

547
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,960
to take her to him, to wife.

548
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,240
I want you to notice that in this portion of Scripture

549
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,640
in Genesis, or excuse me, in 1 Samuel 25,

550
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,520
sandwiched between these two events

551
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,960
where David is dealing with Saul,

552
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,860
there's this interaction with Nabal and Abigail.

553
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,680
And David is absolutely determined.

554
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,240
In chapter 24, he's not gonna raise his hand

555
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,440
against the Lord's anointed.

556
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,460
He responds properly.

557
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,700
But now Nabal, I'm gonna kill him

558
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,820
and I'm gonna kill all the men.

559
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,660
Taking matters into my own hands.

560
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,660
And he says at the end,

561
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,980
after all that we've read

562
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,620
and after all that we considered from 1 Samuel 25,

563
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,460
he says, that he says,

564
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:07,660
Blessed be the Lord that hath pleaded the cause

565
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:10,060
of my reproach from the hand of Nabal

566
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:14,460
and hath kept his servant from evil.

567
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,560
You ever take matters into your own hands

568
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,680
and find yourself having to enter

569
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,040
into the confession closet

570
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,120
and ask God to forgive you for how you behaved?

571
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,040
Because when you take matters into your own hands,

572
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,840
make a mess of things.

573
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,840
We're not trusting the Lord.

574
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,500
We're not trusting that he's able.

575
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,840
Remember, I said this by way of introduction,

576
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,120
when we respond, when we react to being wrong

577
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,240
in this manner, then it's really demonstrating

578
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,700
a lack of trust, that God is not able,

579
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,220
that somehow I have to avenge myself,

580
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,980
but God says, vengeance is mine, saith the Lord.

581
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,540
And in our lives, listen, you're going to be wronged

582
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,620
and I'm gonna be wronged.

583
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,660
It's gonna happen.

584
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,460
It might happen tonight.

585
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,040
It might happen this week.

586
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,180
Maybe you've been wronged recently.

587
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,940
Maybe you can think this evening

588
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,580
of a specific time in which you took matters

589
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,940
into your own hands.

590
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,840
Said, man, how did I make a mess of this situation?

591
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,800
This evening, as we look at the account in Genesis 34,

592
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,160
we see the historical account that God provides.

593
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,540
Terrible situation.

594
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:25,200
Two wrongs don't make a right.

595
00:44:26,399 --> 00:44:29,160
They tried to justify their actions,

596
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,320
but what they did was wrong.

597
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,679
It was wrong, but it doesn't give you a right

598
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:34,720
to respond wrong.

599
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:39,860
And this evening, if we're gonna avoid taking matters

600
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:43,940
into our own hands, we must recognize the providence of God.

601
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,700
We must exercise restraint.

602
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,580
And we must understand this evening that God is able.

603
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:55,740
It reveals maturity in the life of a believer.

604
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,500
When we're able to be wronged,

605
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,360
God's in control.

606
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,779
God knows.

607
00:45:03,779 --> 00:45:05,220
God is able.

608
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,580
I said at the beginning of the message,

609
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,240
when we got to Romans, so not really the beginning,

610
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,540
the middle of the message,

611
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,140
this is not an easy principle.

612
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:17,460
It's not something you're gonna do in your own power.

613
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,860
It's not something you're gonna do in your own flesh.

614
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:24,440
Because my flesh and your flesh wants to get even.

615
00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:26,779
We don't like being wronged.

616
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,420
But this evening, we must avoid taking matters

617
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,119
into our own hands.

618
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:35,380
Learn the lessons from the life of David.

619
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,240
And thank God when God sends an Abigail in your life.

620
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,839
You know what happens for some of us?

621
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,220
God sends an Abigail in our life

622
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,520
and we get mad at Abigail.

623
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:46,520
Seriously.

624
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,119
Who are you to tell me?

625
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,480
Just trust the Lord.

626
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,520
He's able.

627
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,360
Let's pray.

628
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,600
Father, we love you.

629
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,860
We thank you for loving us.

630
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:00,279
God, we look at a difficult passage of scripture

631
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,500
in Genesis 34 this evening.

632
00:46:03,779 --> 00:46:07,020
I believe that you've recorded that event

633
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,820
not only to give us the historical account,

634
00:46:14,059 --> 00:46:16,260
but Lord, to help us understand the importance

635
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,300
of not taking matters into our own hands.

636
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,660
It's such a common response.

637
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,720
At times, if we'd be honest, it's desirable.

638
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:27,860
We wanna get even.

639
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,339
We want that revenge.

640
00:46:30,179 --> 00:46:34,240
That moment of feeling good.

641
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:42,240
God, we need to take the whole counsel of God into account.

642
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,960
You told us that vengeance is yours.

643
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,460
You told us to not be overcome with evil,

644
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,380
but to overcome evil with good.

645
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,640
God, I pray that you'd help us tonight.

646
00:46:56,399 --> 00:46:58,640
We live in a world in which we'll be wronged.

647
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,800
People will do us wrong and they'll treat us wrong.

648
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,500
God, I pray that you'd help us to not react,

649
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:09,240
but God, help us to respond appropriately, biblically.

650
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:13,320
Help us to respond by trusting you, relying upon you.

651
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:19,179
I pray, Lord, that those that maybe are going through

652
00:47:19,179 --> 00:47:21,100
a difficulty even at this moment,

653
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,320
where they've been wronged,

654
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,100
God, I pray that you'd give them wisdom,

655
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:30,179
give them comfort, give them strength.

656
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,679
Help us, Lord, to trust you more.

657
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:35,000
I pray that you'd move and work in our hearts and lives

658
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,100
as only you can.

659
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,320
We'll give you all the honor and glory.

660
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,360
Would you stand with me?

661
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,960
Heads are bowed, eyes are open.
