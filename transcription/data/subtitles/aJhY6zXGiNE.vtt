WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
number 11 this evening, Luke chapter number 11, and I'll be looking at verse number 4.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.319
Of course, for a number of weeks now, on Wednesday evenings, we have gone through this portion

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:16.799
of Scripture, and we have purposed to go very slowly through this portion of Scripture,

00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:23.360
really dealing with one phrase at a time, and having abbreviated services on Wednesday

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.440
evenings so that we can have extended periods of time of prayer, and I believe that prayer

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.600
is important.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.040
We see all throughout the Word of God how that God's people are encouraged to pray.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.479
We have the privilege of reading recorded prayers of God's people.

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:44.840
We have the privilege of understanding how God hears and answers prayer and how prayer

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:53.240
changes things, and I believe that we need a revival of prayer, and the songwriter wrote

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:59.439
the song about sweet hour of prayer, and you know, it's a precious thing to be able

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:05.519
to have communion with our Lord and to enter into His presence and to bring, not only to

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.879
worship Him and adore Him during our time of prayer, but to bring petitions before His

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:15.959
throne to be engaged in the ministry of intercessory prayer, and throughout the Word of God we

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:20.400
find many examples and instructions that are provided to us with regard to the subject

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.400
matter of prayer.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.839
As we have the opportunity to look at this particular portion of Scripture, of course

00:01:26.839 --> 00:01:31.760
we understand that Jesus is responding to the request of the disciple when the disciple

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.480
said, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples, and we think about,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.120
we understand the model prayer, if you will, the framework of prayer that is given here

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.559
in this portion of Scripture.

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:50.800
You can look at Matthew 6 as well, and when followed, when we look at this framework and

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:57.839
use this framework or this model to really guide our time of prayer, you'll be mindful

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:00.279
of several things.

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:06.120
Number one, you'll be mindful of your relationship to God Almighty, our Father which art in heaven.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.759
You'll be mindful of that relationship that was made possible through the sacrifice of

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.559
the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary.

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.839
You'll be mindful of His holiness and His greatness.

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.000
Hallowed be thy name.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.240
We see our Father which art in heaven, and you are mindful and you're taken in your mind

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.759
as you follow the framework and you begin to think about the names of God and you begin

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:34.839
to just worship God in the beauty of His holiness and be mindful of who He is and really standing

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:36.600
in awe of Him.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.119
Remember, the psalmist said, I know that the Lord is great, and then later on he says that

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:48.240
His greatness, speaking of the Lord, is unsearchable, and there's no contradiction there.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.960
The reality is that we know that God is great, but we cannot understand or comprehend the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.919
completeness of God's greatness.

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:01.440
In our finite minds, we're incapable of understanding an infinite God.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.520
We're mindful of His provision, give us day by day our daily bread.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.520
And we mentioned that He is Jehovah Jireh.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.759
It's a name that is ascribed to God there in Genesis chapter number 22.

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:19.600
We're mindful that He is the shepherd, our shepherd, and the shepherd provides.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.399
We're mindful as we follow this framework of His forgiveness and forgive us our sins.

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:32.119
And I'm so thankful that our God is ready to pardon and ready to forgive that with He,

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:36.639
with Thee, with the Lord, there is forgiveness.

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:41.279
Not only are we mindful of these truths, but we find that as we follow this framework that

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:46.279
we'll develop an attitude of both reverence and submission.

00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:53.639
When we understand who He is and we're mindful of who He is, we enter into that time of prayer,

00:03:53.639 --> 00:04:00.119
not in a relaxed type of an atmosphere, if you will, but really with a spirit, an attitude

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:01.119
of reverence.

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:07.520
We understand how our God is holy, and we approach Him based upon His holiness.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.600
We understand that Isaiah, in Isaiah chapter number 6, when he sees God in all of His holiness

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.519
in the year that King Uzziah died, he immediately falls and begins to worship.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.279
And what a blessing to see throughout the Scriptures the way in which God is worshipped.

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:25.239
And we have that attitude of reverence.

00:04:25.239 --> 00:04:28.079
We have that attitude of submission.

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:32.880
And you remember as we looked at this particular thought, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.359
as in heaven, so in earth, a few weeks ago.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:41.720
We said prayer is so much more than really just a grocery list of our needs, our wants,

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.720
or our demands.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.119
It's fellowship with God Almighty.

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:51.839
Last week we looked at that text at the beginning of verse number 4, and forgive us our sins.

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:56.959
This evening we will examine the next phrase in verse number 4 and really focus upon the

00:04:56.959 --> 00:05:01.679
importance of God's people having a forgiving spirit.

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:08.200
Notice what the Word of God says in Luke 11 in verse number 4, and forgive us our sins,

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:14.519
for we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us.

00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:20.320
And I've simply titled the study this evening, We Also Forgive, there that phrase in verse

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.959
number 4, and just be looking at this phrase this evening, for we also forgive everyone

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:32.239
that is indebted to us, and considering the importance of us as the people of God having

00:05:32.239 --> 00:05:33.640
a forgiving spirit.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.200
If you're taking notes to the first thought this evening is I want you to consider the

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.660
problem when we think about the statement that is made here.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.959
The problem that we face in life is that as you live life, you'll find that people will

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:48.440
sin against you, and it's something that we deal with.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.239
In fact, there are times in which we've sinned against others, that we're the offender, not

00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:58.720
the one being offended, but the subject matter is really dealing with you as the offended

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.959
party if you will, the one that's been sinned against.

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:05.899
We can look through the scriptures and we can look at examples of individuals that were

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:12.980
sinned against, that were dealt maybe improperly from their brethren, from others that were

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.920
in their lives, and we understand that this is something that we will encounter in life,

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.799
and we will deal with this, and really our response is what is important.

00:06:21.799 --> 00:06:26.059
I want you to think about this situation, and I want you to look back in the book of

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:31.119
Matthew if you will, in chapter number 18, and I want you to consider with me the inquiry

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:36.640
of Peter as we think about the problem that we all face in life of those that would sin

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.720
against us.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.920
We look at this inquiry of Peter in Matthew chapter number 18, and we know that here in

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:48.519
this passage the Lord will give great instruction with regard to forgiveness, and He'll use

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:55.040
a great example of teaching and illustrating the importance of forgiveness and the way

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.559
in which those that are forgiven should be forgiving others, but we find that Peter makes

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:02.959
this inquiry in verse number 21,

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:10.359
"...then came Peter to him and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and

00:07:10.359 --> 00:07:11.880
I forgive him?"

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:20.399
And then he offers a potential answer to the question that he's asked, till seven times?

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:27.040
And if we understand really some of the historical background there, some of those prominent

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:32.519
teachers during this particular era, they would suggest that you would forgive others

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:37.679
up to three, possibly four times for the same offense, and so really when you see

00:07:37.679 --> 00:07:44.160
Peter in his inquiry and asking the question, he's revealing to us that our brother is going

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.359
to sin against us.

00:07:46.359 --> 00:07:52.079
And he says, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:59.279
That my response to his sinning against me would be forgiveness, and he says, till seven

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:01.079
times.

00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:07.359
And really, if the common accepted practice was three or maybe four times, seven is pretty

00:08:07.359 --> 00:08:08.839
commendable, is it not?

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:13.519
I mean, Peter in his mind, I mean, three was kind of the going rate, if you will, and Peter's

00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:14.720
like, I've doubled it, right?

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.959
I mean, plus a little bit, right?

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:20.279
And so he says, till seven times.

00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:27.200
And I know that often we speak about Peter and how he's so outwardly spoken, and throughout

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.320
the Scriptures we see him asking questions and offering answers and sometimes speaking

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:38.520
things that he really doesn't have any sense of what he's talking about, but here I believe

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.919
that the question is probably one that many had.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:48.760
Peter is asking honestly, inquiring of the Lord, and we'll look at the answer in just

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:54.359
a moment, but we notice the inquiry of Peter with regard to this problem that our brother,

00:08:54.359 --> 00:08:57.640
and others, will sin against us.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.919
Look at what Jesus said.

00:08:58.919 --> 00:09:02.159
Notice the instruction of Jesus in Luke 17.

00:09:02.159 --> 00:09:04.919
We see the inquiry of Peter in Matthew 18.

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:12.280
Over in Luke 17, we find that Jesus is teaching the disciples about the subject matter of

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:18.359
forgiveness, and notice how he begins the passage of Scripture in verse number one of

00:09:18.359 --> 00:09:19.359
Luke 17.

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:29.039
And then said he unto the disciples, it is impossible but that offenses will come.

00:09:29.039 --> 00:09:31.200
But woe unto him through whom they come.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.159
It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the

00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:39.280
sea than that he should offend one of these little ones.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.440
Then he says this to these disciples, take heed to yourselves, if thy brother trespass

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:51.159
against thee, rebuke him, and if he repent, forgive him.

00:09:51.159 --> 00:09:52.520
If he repent, forgive him.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:57.559
And so we see again that Jesus is teaching this subject matter that these offenses are

00:09:57.559 --> 00:10:03.479
going to come if thy brother trespass against thee, and so we understand that in life, listen,

00:10:03.479 --> 00:10:07.400
we didn't have to live long to know that these things are going to happen.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:12.840
And how is it that sometimes we want to respond, really, Proverbs tells us this in Proverbs

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:21.359
24 and verse number 29, and really the response that many people like to have when somebody

00:10:21.359 --> 00:10:27.760
does them wrong, in Proverbs 24 and verse 29, the Bible says, say not, I will do so

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.799
to him as he hath done to me.

00:10:30.799 --> 00:10:35.119
I will render to the man according to his work.

00:10:35.119 --> 00:10:40.239
The wise man says, say not that this is what you're going to do, and the reality is that

00:10:40.239 --> 00:10:45.760
as parents, those of us that have had children, those that have worked with children, no doubt

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:51.599
at some point you receive the answer when you ask the question, why did you hit so and

00:10:51.599 --> 00:10:52.599
so?

00:10:52.599 --> 00:10:54.200
Why did you throw that at so and so?

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.400
Why did you do this?

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.880
Well, because they did it to me.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.880
We hear that, right?

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.599
And it's kind of the, I wouldn't have hit them if they didn't hit me.

00:11:01.599 --> 00:11:04.880
I wouldn't have said that if they didn't say this.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:11.320
And that's sometimes the way that we like to deal with things in the flesh, and we can

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:17.200
be in danger as we look at the way in which people would hurt us, would sin against us

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:23.200
of doing things inappropriately or responding inappropriately, but we find that the text

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:28.679
of Scripture that we're looking at here in Luke 11 says, for we also forgive everyone

00:11:28.679 --> 00:11:31.400
that is indebted to us.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:36.960
So there's a principle that's contained here that is mindful for us, again, as we think

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:42.599
about this model prayer, this framework of prayer, and we understand the way in which

00:11:42.599 --> 00:11:48.559
we would use this as a guide for our time of prayer, that we would be mindful not only

00:11:48.559 --> 00:11:53.479
of our own sinfulness, but of the importance of forgiving others in our lives.

00:11:53.479 --> 00:11:58.320
And I'm so thankful that Christ would forgive us, that with Him there's forgiveness, and

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:04.840
that we can say, forgive us our sins, but we, as people that have been forgiven, should

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.200
forgive.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:12.159
And so the principle is that we would forgive and avoid bitterness in our lives.

00:12:12.159 --> 00:12:15.280
Notice what Ephesians 4 says.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.200
Turn to the book of Ephesians, if you will, and I want you to notice what Paul is saying

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:25.719
to these believers in Ephesus, and notice throughout this portion of Scripture, really

00:12:26.239 --> 00:12:31.239
beginning in verse number 17 and going all the way through the end of Ephesians 4, Paul

00:12:31.239 --> 00:12:35.599
is dealing with this principle that we see throughout the New Testament of this putting

00:12:35.599 --> 00:12:42.400
off of the old and putting on of the new.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:47.960
And as we would see this truth, he begins, he says this in verse 22, that you put off

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:53.280
concerning the former conversation, the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.679
lust, and be renewed in the spirit of your mind.

00:12:56.679 --> 00:13:00.760
And then he's going to, throughout the next several verses of Scripture, really to the

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:07.200
end of the chapter, he's going to illustrate this put off, put on principle.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.320
These things that you did before, this banner in which you lived and behaved, your former

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:17.599
conversation that was according to the old man, that we've been born again, and so the

00:13:17.599 --> 00:13:22.159
things that we used to do, we don't do those things anymore, we're new creatures, we're

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:27.239
in Christ, and so Paul is going through and giving all of this instruction, and you find

00:13:27.239 --> 00:13:32.840
that he comes to verse number 31, and he says this, let all bitterness and wrath and anger

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:38.080
and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:47.159
And then notice verse 32, and be kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another.

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:52.760
And then he tells us this at the end of the verse, and it's so important that we understand

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:59.919
this perspective really that is given to us at the end of verse number 32, even as God,

00:13:59.919 --> 00:14:03.280
for Christ's sake, hath forgiven you.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.599
Aren't you thankful to be forgiven?

00:14:05.599 --> 00:14:11.640
I mean honestly, to know that we have been forgiven, of course if you were to be mindful

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:19.880
of the entirety really of the thought, the theme, or the tenor of this book of Ephesians,

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.919
you'll remember that in chapter number 2, that Paul dealt with their former conversation

00:14:24.919 --> 00:14:32.159
that they were dead in their trespasses and sins, and yet God, who is rich in mercy for

00:14:32.159 --> 00:14:37.440
his great love wherewith he had loved us, and how they'd been born again, and just the

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:42.559
transformation that took place in their lives, and now when Paul is teaching them on the

00:14:42.559 --> 00:14:48.280
subject matter of forgiving one another, Paul says that they are to be mindful and have

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:56.400
this perspective, even as God, for Christ's sake, hath forgiven you.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:01.520
Almighty God has forgiven us, and therefore we ought to forgive others.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:07.960
We see this principle that is given to us when the Lord Jesus Christ is giving this

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:14.359
response to the disciples and teaching them on this model, this framework for prayer,

00:15:14.359 --> 00:15:19.080
for we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:24.039
You know, the problem I've heard over the years where individuals have made some sort

00:15:24.039 --> 00:15:27.359
of statement, well they don't deserve to be forgiven.

00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:35.359
We need to be careful, because the reality is that we, while we were yet sinners, Christ

00:15:35.359 --> 00:15:38.359
died for us, Romans 5.

00:15:38.359 --> 00:15:44.679
And we understand that God's grace and his mercy that was abundant towards us in forgiving

00:15:44.679 --> 00:15:51.400
us, and when we are mindful and we're living with that perspective, it will certainly enable

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:56.440
us to be able to forgive those that would offend us, that would sin against us.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.919
Let's go back to Matthew 18, if you will, and notice the response that Jesus gives to

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:03.000
this inquiry of Peter.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.520
Remember, as we mentioned a few moments ago, Peter says, how oft, Lord, shall my brother

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.719
sin against me and I forgive him, till seven times?

00:16:12.719 --> 00:16:21.239
And Jesus saith unto him, verse number 22 of Matthew 18, I say not unto thee until seven

00:16:21.239 --> 00:16:29.599
times, but until seventy times seven.

00:16:29.599 --> 00:16:35.960
We are familiar with this portion of Scripture, and we know the way in which the Lord responds,

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:42.119
and you understand that here in this text that Jesus is not telling Peter to keep some

00:16:42.119 --> 00:16:48.559
type of a logbook and to count the number of times in which the individual would sin

00:16:48.559 --> 00:16:53.159
against him, and once he reaches 490, it's done.

00:16:53.159 --> 00:16:57.479
I have no more opportunity to forgive you of this offense.

00:16:57.479 --> 00:17:05.040
No, that wasn't the idea, to keep a logbook and to count up to that number.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:10.560
The message in which Jesus is communicating to Peter and to the other disciples and to

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.839
us as the Word of God has been preserved for us this evening, is understood that we are

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:21.920
to forgive continually, perpetually, as they come and they seek forgiveness that we would

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:27.880
forgive, we need to be careful of guarding against bitterness in our own hearts, in our

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.959
own lives.

00:17:29.959 --> 00:17:35.599
In Luke 17, we mentioned a moment ago about the instruction of Jesus, and we understand

00:17:35.599 --> 00:17:41.760
again the fact that there will be those that will sin against us, and you notice here in

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:48.079
Luke 17, in verse number 4, Jesus continues his teaching and says,

00:17:48.079 --> 00:17:54.680
And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.560
to thee, saying, I repent, thou shalt forgive him.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:03.719
And so it's a little bit different of a context of what Peter had asked and the answer that

00:18:03.719 --> 00:18:08.280
he received in Matthew chapter number 18, and Jesus is saying here, if seven times in

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:13.239
a day, and he repents, then you forgive him, thou shalt forgive him.

00:18:13.239 --> 00:18:16.719
And I want you to notice the response of the apostles as it's recorded for us in verse

00:18:16.719 --> 00:18:23.439
number 5, and the apostles said unto the Lord, increase our faith.

00:18:23.439 --> 00:18:29.719
And I believe that the response of the apostles here in verse number 5 in understanding this

00:18:29.719 --> 00:18:36.880
thing, this teaching subject of forgiveness, is that we need the help of God, especially

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.760
in dealing with someone that would be a repeated offender, as is what's being dealt with here

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.560
in this text of Scripture.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:51.520
That we would have God's help and God's grace as we would seek to have that forgiving spirit

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.839
that would be evident in the people of God.

00:18:53.839 --> 00:18:58.280
Notice with me over in Hebrews chapter number 12, and this is really what we seek to guard

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:05.319
against as we would understand the importance of forgiveness in our lives, and we'd understand

00:19:05.319 --> 00:19:08.479
the potential for bitterness.

00:19:08.479 --> 00:19:11.719
There's some people that are bitter in our world.

00:19:11.719 --> 00:19:13.680
There's some people that are bitter in churches.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:20.439
I've heard evangelists make statements of times in which they've gone to preach in revival

00:19:20.439 --> 00:19:25.880
meetings and as they've been in revival meetings, they have witnessed where there would be some

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:31.839
people in the church that had not spoken to one another for numbers of years because of

00:19:31.839 --> 00:19:35.280
some falling out that they had.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:41.160
Palmer Sean has shared a number of examples over the years, and no doubt Brother Sommerdorf

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:47.319
and Brother Hummel and others that we have had that have come and shared this pulpit

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:55.800
with us in revival meetings, they have seen bitterness even amongst the people of God.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:00.859
We see in verse number 15 of Hebrews 12 where the Bible says, looking diligently, lest any

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:06.939
man fail of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:11.339
thereby many be defiled.

00:20:11.339 --> 00:20:16.699
Bitterness is a real danger, and there are people in our world, there are people in our

00:20:16.699 --> 00:20:21.140
world, but there are people in our churches that are struggling with this thing of bitterness.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.979
They're bitter.

00:20:22.979 --> 00:20:29.140
Something that took place maybe recently, maybe years ago, and they just won't let go

00:20:29.219 --> 00:20:34.420
of it, they won't forgive, and they're holding on to that, and they're bitter.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.300
Bitterness has grown in them.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:44.180
And someone has wisely said that bitterness will destroy the vessel in which it's stored

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:48.540
more than the vessel on which it is poured.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:52.219
And I think that's a very wise statement that someone made.

00:20:52.219 --> 00:20:58.140
It's not original with me, but it's a very appropriate saying with regard to the subject

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.900
matter of bitterness.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:05.380
And the reality this evening, there are some people, somebody could be bitter at someone,

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:10.859
and the individual that you're bitter at, they probably have no idea that you're bitter

00:21:10.859 --> 00:21:18.619
at them, that you have an unforgiving spirit, and that you got this animosity towards them,

00:21:18.619 --> 00:21:23.099
and you don't want to see them, you don't want to bump into them, whatever.

00:21:23.099 --> 00:21:25.699
They probably don't even know.

00:21:25.699 --> 00:21:31.540
It's not affected them, but for us, if we would allow that bitterness to spring up within

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:38.780
us, it can destroy us, cause us to have a lack of ability to minister appropriately

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.219
and what have you.

00:21:40.219 --> 00:21:45.339
And so this evening, we're mindful of this model again that we see in Luke chapter 11,

00:21:45.339 --> 00:21:50.219
and we've taken piece by piece and looking at these individual statements that Jesus

00:21:50.219 --> 00:21:56.420
gives to these disciples in providing a model prayer framework for our prayer, that as we

00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:03.540
would seek forgiveness from our God, understanding that He is a forgiving God, that He's full

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:10.660
of mercy and grace, that He's ready to pardon and ready to forgive, that we also are mindful

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:18.859
of the importance of us as believers, of followers of Jesus Christ, of having a forgiving spirit.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:25.699
Not allowing any bitterness to creep within our lives, but to have that spirit of forgiveness.

00:22:25.699 --> 00:22:30.540
As we look at this passage in Luke chapter 11, again, we've purposed to go very slow

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:35.979
through this and to be mindful of this framework, and I hope that over this series of messages

00:22:35.979 --> 00:22:41.099
as we've sought to just dig in and to give some framework, that it would help us in our

00:22:41.099 --> 00:22:47.540
individual prayer lives, that we have maybe over the last five or six weeks of studying

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:55.739
this portion of Scripture, that we have seen our own personal prayer time grow and develop

00:22:55.739 --> 00:23:00.540
through understanding the framework that God provides for us.

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:07.780
And prayer, again, is not some religious exercise that we just, well, I said my prayers today,

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:12.459
and well, God bless this person and bless that person and bless them as well, and there's

00:23:12.459 --> 00:23:18.500
so much more to prayer, communing with our God, and as we would spend that time of adoring

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:25.060
Him and exalting Him and being mindful of who He is, and then looking as we've continued

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:29.699
to move our way through next week, we'll look at this last statement of verse number four,

00:23:29.699 --> 00:23:34.939
and consider the, lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, and we'll look at

00:23:34.939 --> 00:23:39.459
some other principles throughout the Word of God with regard to prayer, and again, I'm

00:23:39.459 --> 00:23:44.060
so thankful for the privilege of prayer, and I hope this evening that as we consider

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:49.619
this thought, that we would be mindful of the importance of a forgiving spirit as the

00:23:49.619 --> 00:23:54.099
people of God, that we would not be in a place where they say, well, they don't deserve it,

00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:59.739
and that we'd allow bitterness to destroy us, but that we would be forgiving.

00:23:59.739 --> 00:24:06.619
Remember, even as God, for Christ's sake, hath forgiven you, I'm so thankful.

00:24:06.619 --> 00:24:10.579
I know this evening if I were to ask, and if you'd be honest, if you've ever had to

00:24:10.579 --> 00:24:16.979
confess the same sin more than once, you'd probably say yes, you'd answer in the affirmative,

00:24:16.979 --> 00:24:23.420
and I'm so thankful that God still forgives, and even though we might mess up multiple

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:30.579
times in the same day and the same offense, God forgives, and oh, that we would be Christ-like,

00:24:30.579 --> 00:24:34.739
and that we would also offer forgiveness to those that would sin against us.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:39.699
Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. We thank You for the Word of God, the truth

00:24:39.699 --> 00:24:45.099
contained therein, and I pray that You would help us to have a forgiving spirit. Lord, that we would

00:24:45.099 --> 00:24:51.699
guard against bitterness in our lives, that we would be mindful of the grace and mercy that has

00:24:51.699 --> 00:24:56.939
been extended to us, and that we, in like fashion, would seek to be gracious and merciful to those

00:24:56.939 --> 00:25:01.739
that we interact with here upon earth. We pray that You'd bless our time of prayer. We pray that

00:25:01.739 --> 00:25:06.020
You'd be honored and glorified through all that we say and do. For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
