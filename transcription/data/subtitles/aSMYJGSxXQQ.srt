1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,599
to have some folks visiting with us this morning.

2
00:00:02,599 --> 00:00:04,000
We thank you for being here.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Is that Brad?

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,360
Yes, amen.

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,199
And I wasn't sure you had a mask on when I saw you,

6
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:12,119
and now you don't.

7
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:14,760
So I was like, did he have a beard or not?

8
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,200
But anyway, good to have you here, you and your wife

9
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,000
and son.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,520
And we met Brad on Friday over at Jordan Kitts

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,079
as we're looking for a new piano.

12
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:25,260
And he's here this morning with his family.

13
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,879
Certainly thankful to have him.

14
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,719
Trust the service will be a blessing to you.

15
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:30,600
Colossians chapter number 4, we're

16
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,880
looking at verses 2 through 4 this morning, of course,

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,720
our theme for this year, Complete in Christ.

18
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,520
And I am so thankful for the book of Colossians.

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,240
I'm thankful for the Bible, amen.

20
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,319
And all of it is good, and it's profitable,

21
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:43,479
is what God tells us.

22
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:46,439
All scripture is given by inspiration of God,

23
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,639
and it is profitable.

24
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:51,000
And I'm so thankful how God's word helps us

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
as we've studied through the book of Colossians

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,439
here on Sunday mornings.

27
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:56,759
We've learned many valuable lessons.

28
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,400
And as we come to this fourth chapter,

29
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,639
of course, we dealt with the first verse coupled together

30
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:04,839
with the last section of chapter number 3 a couple of weeks ago.

31
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:06,559
But as we look at the fourth chapter,

32
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:09,360
we see really that the letter, it kind of

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,680
shifts as far as the instruction and kind of some final remarks

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,599
and what have you.

35
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:16,440
And as we look at this portion of scripture,

36
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,319
I do trust that it will be a blessing to you this morning,

37
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,480
that it would encourage us and challenge us

38
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,160
in our walk with Christ.

39
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,800
The Bible begins in verse number 2 by saying this,

40
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:31,120
continue in prayer and watch in the same with thanksgiving,

41
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,319
with all praying also for us, that God would open unto us

42
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:39,720
a door of utterance to speak the mystery of Christ,

43
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,239
for which I am also in bonds, that I may make it manifest

44
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,959
as I ought to speak.

45
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:50,559
As we look at this particular passage of scripture,

46
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:53,599
the subject of prayer is obviously before us.

47
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,440
As you study through the word of God, as you read the scriptures,

48
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,680
you will notice that there's an obvious emphasis on prayer.

49
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,720
I'm thankful that God gives us many promises with regard to prayer.

50
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,839
He's given us much instruction with regard to the subject matter of prayer.

51
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:10,880
And we think about those wonderful promises

52
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,160
that we hold dear when we consider the subject matter of prayer.

53
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,759
We have the privilege as we read the word of God

54
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:23,199
to read how the people of God sought the face of God through prayer,

55
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,600
how the word of God records the prayers of many,

56
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,919
that we have the privilege of reading.

57
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,520
And not only do we have the privilege of reading those prayers,

58
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,639
but then we have the privilege of seeing how God answers those prayers.

59
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,880
And the reality is that as we think about praying

60
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,679
and we think about the subject of prayer,

61
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:45,720
we understand, I believe, that each of us that are gathered here this morning

62
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,240
would readily acknowledge that prayer is important,

63
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,479
that prayer is necessary and it's a unique privilege for the child of God.

64
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:56,839
The reality, however, is there are times in our lives

65
00:02:56,839 --> 00:03:01,479
when we find that praying is neglected.

66
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,639
Why is that so?

67
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,520
We understand the importance of it.

68
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,039
We understand that it moves the hand of God.

69
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:11,279
We understand that we're praying to the God of the impossible,

70
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:15,839
the God who said, I can do anything, that there's nothing too hard for me.

71
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:17,479
He said that He's able to do exceeding,

72
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:20,679
abundantly above all that we ask or think.

73
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:23,960
And yet, as the people of God, there are times in our lives,

74
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,600
if you would be honest and if I would be honest,

75
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:32,000
there are times in our lives when we neglect prayer.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,520
We understand what prayer is.

77
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,399
We understand the importance and the significance of prayer.

78
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:39,399
But yet we fail to pray.

79
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:40,279
Why is that so?

80
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:42,960
Well, prayer is spiritual battle.

81
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,360
The enemy, the adversary, he doesn't want us to engage in prayer.

82
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,119
He wants to distract us from praying.

83
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:51,839
He wants us to think that it's not going to really matter.

84
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:53,919
It's not going to impact or affect anything.

85
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,919
And he wants to get us busy and tied up with all sorts of other things.

86
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,679
And he wants to get us distracted.

87
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:02,039
How many times in your life, how many times in my life,

88
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:05,479
more than I'd like to really acknowledge, you

89
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,880
enter into your time of prayer and distractions come.

90
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,520
The phone rings.

91
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,919
Someone knocks at the door.

92
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,000
You get a text message, whatever it might be.

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,880
And the distractions, if you have little ones,

94
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,880
the little ones need your attention and they want this

95
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,959
and they need that and so on and so forth.

96
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,160
And it just seems as if the distractions abound.

97
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,959
It's labor.

98
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,000
It's battle.

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,119
And as we look at the passage of Scripture,

100
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:37,160
we understand that we've been instructed to pray.

101
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,040
We understand really the importance of prayer.

102
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,959
We understand the impact of prayer as we

103
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:47,040
read of how God worked and how God continues to work.

104
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,959
And we find here that the passage of Scripture

105
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:56,359
has this phrase, continue in prayer, in verse number two.

106
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:59,880
I want to use that as our title for our message

107
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,079
this morning as we think about this subject matter of prayer.

108
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,839
It's of great interest to me that as you

109
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:08,119
think about the disciples as they walked with the Lord Jesus Christ

110
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:10,399
and they observed so many wonderful things.

111
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,799
And I mean, if you study through the Gospel records

112
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:15,920
and you read of the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus

113
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,480
Christ and how the disciples had the privilege of not only

114
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,880
walking with Him, but seeing Him do great things.

115
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,880
But of all the things that they observed,

116
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,399
there's only one thing that they said to the Lord to teach us.

117
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:34,079
It's found in Luke, in chapter number 11, when they say,

118
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,920
you don't need to turn there, but he says,

119
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,440
we don't know who the disciple is.

120
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,559
It's an unnamed disciple.

121
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:40,679
I like to think it's Peter, because Peter's always

122
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:42,359
the one that's talking.

123
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:48,079
He says, Lord, teach us to pray.

124
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,320
Lord, teach us to do miracles.

125
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
No.

126
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,519
Lord, teach us how to multiply the bread and the fish

127
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:00,679
and teach us how to heal people and teach us how to, no, no.

128
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:03,640
Teach us to pray.

129
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,279
Isn't that significant?

130
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,799
It's of interest that of all the things

131
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:12,880
that the disciples could have asked the Lord to teach them,

132
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,079
we find recorded in the Word of God for us

133
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:20,399
that they say, Lord, teach us to pray.

134
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,559
Teach us to pray.

135
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:23,200
As we look at the passage of Scripture,

136
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,679
I want you to notice, number one, if you're taking notes,

137
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:28,239
the privilege to pray.

138
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:30,399
Prayer is a unique privilege that's

139
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,880
truly reserved for the believer.

140
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,519
It is a privilege that we have as the child of God

141
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,440
to enter boldly into the throne room of heaven.

142
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,720
We're to come boldly into the throne of grace,

143
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,359
is what the Scriptures tell us in the book of Hebrews

144
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:45,279
in the fourth chapter.

145
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,200
You think about the privilege that we

146
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,959
have as the people of God.

147
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:51,279
Why is it a privilege that is reserved to us

148
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,239
as the people of God?

149
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:54,600
Because we pray to God through Christ.

150
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,720
And because we belong to Him, we have direct access.

151
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,119
And I'm so thankful that at any time in my life,

152
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,640
in any situation, for any reason,

153
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,760
I can go to God in prayer.

154
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,000
It is a unique privilege.

155
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,920
And we understand that as we think

156
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,720
about this subject of prayer, and there

157
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,320
are many that have used it, some maybe that aren't even saved

158
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,559
that would talk about praying.

159
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:19,480
And I have found in recent, really,

160
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,959
years as we've looked at the cultural shift in our society,

161
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,839
that it's not so often that you hear people anymore saying,

162
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,880
I'll pray for you.

163
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,880
They'll say, I'm thinking about you.

164
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,679
And I'm not really sure the significance of someone

165
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:32,760
thinking about me.

166
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,200
But I do know the significance of someone praying for me.

167
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,440
And I do understand, as the people of God,

168
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,279
having the privilege of engaging in prayer

169
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,839
and understanding that it moves the heart of God,

170
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,119
the hand of God.

171
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:47,000
We notice as we begin in verse number two

172
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,279
that the Bible says, continue in prayer.

173
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:53,839
I believe that this word continue would reveal to you,

174
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,160
it would reveal to me that this is something that they're

175
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,959
already engaged in.

176
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,440
You're not going to continue doing something if you're not

177
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,200
actually doing that thing.

178
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,079
You wouldn't say continue to fill in the blank,

179
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,600
continue to pray, continue in prayer

180
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,359
if you're not first praying.

181
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:16,640
And so as Paul would understand the church at Colossae,

182
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,880
he did not have the privilege of being there and serving

183
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,119
amongst these individuals.

184
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:23,079
But he received a report.

185
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,839
He commends these believers.

186
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:27,200
And he then says to them, under the inspiration

187
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,640
of the Holy Spirit of God, as he concludes,

188
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,440
as we get into this fourth chapter, continue.

189
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,559
Continue in what?

190
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,599
Continue in prayer.

191
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,520
They are being encouraged to press on.

192
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,159
We find that as we would think about the idea of continuing

193
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,479
in prayer, it carries with it the idea of to persevere

194
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:48,080
and not to faint.

195
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,799
And you think about Peter, even as he was there in the garden

196
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,359
and as Jesus was praying.

197
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:54,359
And what did Peter do?

198
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:55,320
He fell asleep.

199
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,479
And Jesus says, what?

200
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,440
You could not watch and pray with me for an hour?

201
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,799
And we find that here that he says continue in prayer

202
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:06,440
to be devoted to it, to understand

203
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,000
the significance of it.

204
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,880
Generically, the word prayer means to simply ask.

205
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,760
And it means to ask with earnestness.

206
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,000
It's interesting that the verse continues.

207
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,719
It not only says continue in prayer,

208
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:24,000
but then it says this, and watch in the same.

209
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,599
Well, he's speaking of prayer.

210
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,799
So when he says, and watch in the same,

211
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,280
he's speaking of prayer.

212
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,080
And the word watch is an interesting word.

213
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,919
It means to give strict attention to.

214
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,159
How many times, again, when we seek

215
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,159
to go before the throne room of heaven

216
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,599
and pray that our minds are just diverted to so

217
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:47,359
many other things and we're distracted,

218
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:49,440
but yet this word watch, it means

219
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,440
to give strict attention to, to take heed.

220
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:57,479
And he says to watch in the same with thanksgiving.

221
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,239
With thanksgiving.

222
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:04,319
As we think about the privilege of prayer and we consider the many promises

223
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:07,599
that God has given us throughout His Word, we're familiar with a number of

224
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:11,679
those promises. I referenced Ephesians 3 20 already. You think about the great

225
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:17,239
promise in Jeremiah 33 when God says to Jeremiah, call unto me and I will answer

226
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:20,799
thee and show thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not. Last

227
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,879
Sunday afternoon, Brother Dan Hummel spent time on that particular verse of

228
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,599
Scripture in our afternoon service and encouraging us with regard to the way

229
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:34,399
that God hears and answers prayer and what a blessing. And we find the Bible

230
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,839
tells us as we would consider the truth of James chapter number 5 in verse

231
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:43,519
number 16 when the Word of God says that the effectual fervent prayer of a

232
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,999
righteous man availeth much. We think about this privilege that we have to

233
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:56,519
pray. In the 1828 Noah Webster's Dictionary, the word prayer is denoted

234
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:01,399
and given the definition in this sense. It says this, in worship a solemn

235
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:07,839
address to the Supreme Being. We're praying to God, the God of the impossible,

236
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:19,639
the God who said let there be light and there was light. Consisting of adoration,

237
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:26,599
confession of sins, supplication for mercy and forgiveness, intercession for

238
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:33,599
blessings on others, and thanksgiving. That's what the dictionary says. Noah Webster's

239
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:39,319
1828, and you look up the word prayer. We find that as we would consider the

240
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:44,399
privilege of prayer and we understand as Paul says continue in prayer and watch

241
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,559
in the same with thanksgiving. I would say to you that there's, it's not

242
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:53,199
originable with me, but someone made up an acronym of prayer acts, A-C-T-S. It

243
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:57,559
begins with adoration. You know when you begin your time of prayer and you begin

244
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,639
to just adore the Lord that you stand in all of who He is, when you begin to think

245
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:05,199
about the attributes that He's revealed to us within His Word and you begin to

246
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:08,919
pray and seek His face and you understand that you're getting into

247
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:14,639
that very presence of God Almighty and you begin to maybe reference the names

248
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,519
of God. Maybe you begin to reference the attributes of God. You're joyful and

249
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,599
rejoicing for who He is to you and what He's done for you and you're adoring

250
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:31,719
Him. And then you move into confession. How important it is that we understand

251
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:37,039
the importance of confession in our lives that the Word of God tells us

252
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:42,519
that we serve a God who is faithful and He will forgive us if we confess our

253
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:47,359
sins. He is faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all

254
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:52,479
unrighteousness. And our prayer time ought to consist of some confession, some

255
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:58,839
time in which we say, Lord search me, show me if there be any wicked way, lead me in

256
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:03,719
the way everlasting. Because we understand that he that covereth his sin

257
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:09,319
shall not prosper. But what a joy to know that he that confesseth, he receives

258
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:15,439
mercy. Amen. What a blessing. I think of Thanksgiving as we find the end of this

259
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:20,359
verse continuing prayer and watch in the same with Thanksgiving. Oh that God

260
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:24,799
would help us to be a thankful people. We understand that in the last days one of

261
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,599
the ways in which the perilous times are described as being that people will be

262
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:35,599
unthankful. I was praying this morning and I was praying right here and all the

263
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:40,319
crows were out there squawking and making all kinds of noise and I can't

264
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:45,399
stand crows. And I said to Brother Hummel last Sunday, I said I think the sound of

265
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:50,719
these crows is what God hears when we complain. Because it sounds like murmuring.

266
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:57,679
It just drives me nuts. We're to be a thankful people. It's easy to complain.

267
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:04,579
It really is. But when we give thanks in everything, we're to pray, right? But we're

268
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:09,299
to give thanks. We're to seek God's face and thank him and understanding that God

269
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:15,439
has purpose and plan and reason and that God is able. We face a difficulty. We face

270
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:21,579
a circumstance and we can thank God that that he knows what to do. He has the

271
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:27,019
power to do what has to be done. Isn't that wonderful? Can you imagine if we did not

272
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:31,139
have that confidence as he's given us his word and we just were left to our

273
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:36,099
own devices, our own resources, not having the knowledge that God is able to do

274
00:14:36,099 --> 00:14:41,019
exceeding abundantly above, that he has the power to do and the wisdom to know

275
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:49,119
what to do. That's phenomenal. So with thanksgiving, in fact, as we look at the

276
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:53,859
truth in the book of Philippians with regard to this truth, the Bible says be

277
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:59,899
careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication. With thanksgiving

278
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:07,660
let your requests be made known unto God. You know, it's biblically accurate that

279
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:13,940
we can thank God for how he's going to answer before the answer ever comes. With

280
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,619
thanksgiving, God, I thank you in advance of what you're going to do because I know

281
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:22,019
what you're going to do is right. It may not be exactly what I think should be

282
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:27,339
done, but I'm thankful that it's not up to me. Amen? And God knows far greater

283
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:30,339
than I know. He knows far greater than you know. And so we think about this

284
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:34,940
privilege, it ends as we think about that acronym of acts, adoration, confession,

285
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:42,380
thanksgiving, supplication. Supplication, not only for ourself but for others. You

286
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,380
think about the ministry of intercessory prayer. You think about the

287
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,619
opportunities that we have to bring our petitions before the throne room of

288
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:56,220
heaven. When we understand that we need wisdom and we go to God and we know that

289
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,419
he's told us that if any man lack wisdom let him ask of God who giveth to

290
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:03,619
all men liberally and upbraideth not. In James 1. And you find that I need

291
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:09,459
wisdom. Isn't it great to know the one who has all wisdom that has promised to

292
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:15,979
give it to us when we acknowledge our need for it and request it? We find that

293
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:21,299
we are able to go on the behalf of not only our own needs but as we pray one

294
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:27,179
for another, intercessory prayer. What a blessing to know that we can pray one

295
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:31,660
for another. And really in this particular passage of Scripture we find

296
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,220
that the privilege is revealed to us in verse number two when he speaks about

297
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,380
this continuing in prayer and watching the same with thanksgiving. And as we

298
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,699
enter into the third verse we really begin to see that nature of intercessory

299
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:48,619
prayer where Paul says this in verse number three, with all praying also for

300
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:54,019
us that God would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of

301
00:16:54,019 --> 00:17:01,220
Christ for which I am also in bonds that I may make it manifest as I ought to

302
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,440
speak. Number two, if you're taking notes notice a petition from Paul. A petition

303
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,059
from Paul. We find that in the first chapter of the book of Colossians in

304
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:13,979
verse number three Paul says this to these believers, we give thanks to God

305
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:19,339
and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Notice what Paul says, praying always for

306
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:23,699
you. I will not take the time this morning to read verses 9 through 14 of

307
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:28,299
chapter number 1 but we find that as Paul is encouraging the believers in

308
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:32,099
Colossians 1 and verse number 3 he tells them that he's praying always

309
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:38,339
for them. In verses 9 through 14 he gives them the specifics of how I'm

310
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:43,139
praying for you. And here's how we're praying for you. And what a blessing as

311
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:49,459
Paul would seek to encourage these believers. Now as we look at this final

312
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:53,380
chapter and we look at this subject matter we see the petition from Paul

313
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:59,259
where he now makes the request that they would pray for him. It's a blessing to be

314
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:02,819
able to pray one for another. And I would submit to you that as I look at this

315
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:08,259
petition from Paul that each one of us would say I need some people praying for

316
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:12,059
me in this manner. I need some people to pray that God would give me boldness,

317
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:15,539
that God would open up a door of utterance, that God would enable me to

318
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:20,099
speak the way that I'm supposed to speak. Notice how specific Paul is. He does not

319
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:24,539
just say in verse number 3, with all praying also for us, but he gives them

320
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:29,940
some details, some specifics as to how he's requesting that they pray. I want

321
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,419
you to understand that Paul is in bonds. He even makes note of that at the end of

322
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:37,339
verse number 3, for which I am also in bonds. You'll notice that something that

323
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:41,659
is missing from the specific prayer request that Paul gives in this passage

324
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:48,140
of Scripture is a release from prison. He doesn't pray for that. Now you and me,

325
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,820
if I was in prison and I was sending you letters, I'd probably be asking you to

326
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:58,979
pray that God would release me from prison, right? Paul doesn't ask for that.

327
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:04,059
He understood that God had him there for a reason. He understood that God's

328
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:10,500
sovereign and Paul would be in prison not one day shorter or one day longer

329
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,940
than God saw fit for him to be there. Do we believe that this morning? Do we

330
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,539
understand that our God is able? Listen, you think about Joseph when he was in

331
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:24,979
prison. He was there just as long as he was supposed to be there, right? Not a day

332
00:19:24,979 --> 00:19:29,099
sooner did he get released than what God had ordained for him to be released, and

333
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:34,779
not a day longer did he stay in that prison than what he was supposed to. You

334
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:37,859
think about the opportunity. Remember when the butler and the baker came, what

335
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:42,820
did he say? Hey, remember me! Is that not what Joseph said? But the Bible tells us

336
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:52,979
that the butler forgot him. Two full years. That's a long time. It's a long time. But

337
00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:59,779
then there was a dream, and nobody in Egypt could interpret the dream. And the butler

338
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:02,299
all of a sudden...

339
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:10,219
has a good memory. Ah, I remember this guy in prison. Do you not see the hand of God?

340
00:20:10,219 --> 00:20:15,099
Because had the butler remembered Joseph earlier than at that particular circumstance in his

341
00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:19,859
life and said, hey, Pharaoh, there's a guy that can interpret dreams in prison. Yeah,

342
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:25,439
I got a lot of those astrologers and magicians. I got a whole group of them. That's what they're

343
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:32,219
here for. That's what they're part of my cabinet for. Right? But it wasn't until all those

344
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:40,059
guys failed that Joseph is remembered. Paul doesn't ask for a release from prison. Oftentimes

345
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:46,859
we're so caught up in God delivering us from our difficulty that we fail to recognize that

346
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:55,739
God has a purpose in that difficulty. We're all guilty of it. I don't like difficulties.

347
00:20:55,739 --> 00:21:03,779
Amen? And if you like them, you're crazy. Just kidding. But seriously, we try to avoid

348
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:09,019
problems, do we not? But we find that, as Paul would say in the beginning of the book

349
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:13,419
of Philippians in chapter 1 and verse number 12, the things that happen to me happen for

350
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:19,739
the furtherance of the gospel. And so often we're saying, God, deliver me from this trial.

351
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:24,019
Deliver me from this trouble. Deliver me from this problem. And God's saying, I'm trying

352
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:29,539
to teach you something in the midst of this trial, in the midst of this storm. It was

353
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:34,139
Jesus, by the way, that told the disciples to get into the boat and to pass onto the

354
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:41,539
other side. And there was a storm in the midst of the sea. Why were they in the storm? Because

355
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:47,099
they obeyed the Lord. Right? What if they disobeyed and said, nah, we're not going to

356
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:53,859
sail tonight. We'll do it tomorrow. But was there not a great lesson in that storm? We're

357
00:21:53,859 --> 00:22:01,099
going to perish. We're going to die. Jesus came walking on the water. It's amazing. And

358
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:07,659
they see that Jesus has power even over the winds and the waves. Listen, there are times

359
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:11,179
in which He's trying to develop us. There are times in which He's trying to bring us

360
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:16,899
into contact with someone that needs to hear the truth of the gospel. And it may be through

361
00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:22,659
the time of difficulty, the time of trial, that in that very moment that God is orchestrating

362
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:27,139
it in such a way that He's bringing you into the very presence of someone that maybe a

363
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:31,939
mother and a father have prayed for, that they would understand the truth of the gospel.

364
00:22:31,939 --> 00:22:36,179
And God says, here's someone that I can bring in their life and share the gospel with them.

365
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:43,379
That's how God works. If we'd let Him. God, what are you trying to teach me in this moment

366
00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:48,419
of difficulty? How are you trying to develop me? Who is it that I'm here for? Who is it

367
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:53,979
that you want me to be able to reach? But if we're too busy complaining and murmuring

368
00:22:53,979 --> 00:22:59,859
about our circumstances and we're just, woe is me, and we have the Eeyore syndrome, oh

369
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:06,099
bother, then we miss it all. Right? We miss it all. Paul doesn't pray for deliverance.

370
00:23:06,099 --> 00:23:12,679
Notice how Paul requests prayer. Notice, number one, he says this, that God would open unto

371
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:20,159
us a door of utterance. As I think about that phraseology, we understand that he's

372
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,399
praying that God would open the door, not that we would kick down a door, not that we

373
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:31,239
would make our own opportunity, but that God would open a door of utterance for us, that

374
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:37,039
God would work in such a way that He would orchestrate that which needs to be orchestrated

375
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:42,879
and that it's not by my own engineering of an opportunity and me trying to orchestrate

376
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:50,399
this and that, but seeking God's face to open up a door of utterance. Notice what he says,

377
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:54,619
that He would open up this door of utterance. I believe that we could use a phraseology

378
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:59,359
and say that He says, open unto us a door of utterance, that it's for me to have an

379
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:04,039
opportunity. For me to have an opportunity. I wonder how often do we pray that God would

380
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:08,639
give us opportunities? Just a couple of weeks ago, as we looked at the last section of chapter

381
00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:13,679
3 and the first verse of chapter 4, we dealt with the truth of being in the workplace and

382
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,720
really the idea of revival happening in our workplace and how God has you in that place

383
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,259
for a purpose, for a reason, and that as we would consider our missions map and think

384
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:28,239
about the missionaries that we support all across the world, that as we would understand

385
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:33,839
that we as the church, as you would go into your workplace tomorrow, that really we focus

386
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:40,279
upon the fact that you're a missionary in that place. Have you been praying for that

387
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:44,079
opportunity? Have you been praying for that individual? God, would you open up a door

388
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:49,319
of utterance? Would you move and work in such a way that you would open it? Make it clear

389
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:53,759
and help me, God, to seize the opportunity. Notice what he says, not only that God would

390
00:24:53,759 --> 00:25:00,479
open unto us a door of utterance, but notice what he says, to speak the mystery of Christ,

391
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:04,759
for which I am also in bonds. You know what he, the opportunity that he seeks? To speak

392
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:10,919
of Christ. Open up a door of utterance that I can, that I can speak of the mystery of

393
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:17,299
Christ, that I can preach the gospel. He speaks about the mystery of Christ in the first chapter

394
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:23,679
of Christ in you, the hope of glory. And you think about the opportunity that he's asking

395
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,399
for these believers in Colossae, would you pray for me? Now understand, as you think

396
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:32,679
about the Apostle Paul, and you think about reading his life and his ministry, do you

397
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:37,000
really think this is somebody that you would say, he needs prayer that God would open up

398
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,559
his mouth that he would speak? No, everywhere he goes he's preaching the gospel. But you

399
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:48,519
know why I believe that is? Because he's constantly asking people to pray that God would give

400
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:53,479
him boldness to open his mouth as he should. Notice in Ephesians, what he says in Ephesians

401
00:25:53,479 --> 00:26:00,759
6, as he's, after he gives all of the information with regard to the armor of God, and he encourages

402
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:04,759
these believers in Ephesus with regard to the spiritual battle in which we're engaged

403
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:09,239
in, and he speaks about prayer in verse number 18, and notice in verse number 19, and for

404
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:15,919
me, pray for all the saints, but pray for me that utterance may be given unto me, that

405
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:22,379
I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador

406
00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:27,819
in bonds, that therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak. He's employing as many

407
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:32,619
people as he can to pray for him that God would open up doors of utterance, that God

408
00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:38,779
would give him boldness, that God would enable him, empower him to speak the mystery of Christ.

409
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:42,539
Oh, that ought to be one of the number one prayer requests that we're praying for one

410
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:47,699
another. That ought to be something that I'm saying, would you pray for me? Someone says,

411
00:26:47,699 --> 00:26:51,579
hey, how can I pray for you? Let me tell you, would you pray that God would give me

412
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:57,379
boldness to open my mouth and speak the mystery of Christ as I should? Has anyone ever asked

413
00:26:57,379 --> 00:27:05,299
you that? Amen. One. I don't know how many people are here, but one. It's not common,

414
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:12,819
but oh, it's necessary. Can you imagine if we really begin to pray this way, that we'd

415
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:19,059
understand the purpose of God, that we'd understand that he's left us here as ambassadors,

416
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:25,739
that he sent us, that we are his representatives, we are his witnesses. This is a consistent

417
00:27:25,739 --> 00:27:31,379
petition that we see throughout the word of God, that we see in the life of the apostle

418
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:37,179
Paul. He says in verse number four, that I may make it, speaking of the mystery of Christ,

419
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:42,619
the gospel of Christ, that I may make it manifest as I ought to speak. He says this to the believers

420
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:48,019
in Thessalonica. He says very simply in 1 Thessalonians chapter number 5 and verse 25,

421
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:52,699
brethren, pray for us, and there's no real detail that's given with regard to the request,

422
00:27:52,699 --> 00:27:57,459
but in chapter number 3 of 2 Thessalonians, in verse number 1, Paul says this to these

423
00:27:57,459 --> 00:28:02,699
believers in this church, finally, brethren, pray for us that the word of the Lord may

424
00:28:02,699 --> 00:28:09,879
have free course and be glorified even as it is with you. This was a consistent petition

425
00:28:09,879 --> 00:28:15,000
from Paul. When he understands the privilege of prayer and he's seeking to engage these

426
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,599
believers in Colossae, listen, continue in prayer, recognize the privilege that you have

427
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:26,279
to go before the throne room of heaven and pray, and continue in prayer, and watch in

428
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:31,359
the same with thanksgiving. And then he says, with all, also praying for us. Here's how

429
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:36,399
I want you to pray for me, how I want you to pray for us, that we would speak the mystery

430
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:43,640
of Christ, that God would open up a door of utterance. Wow! I'd like to believe that

431
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:50,559
the people in Ephesus, and the people in Colossae, and the people in Thessalonica, the church

432
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,919
members of these particular churches that we've referenced these verses of Scripture,

433
00:28:54,919 --> 00:29:02,119
I'd like to believe that they engaged in this prayer for Paul, that they took the request

434
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:09,239
seriously, and they engaged in prayer, and they saw God, they heard how God worked. God

435
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:14,159
used Paul in a great way. When you think about God using men, oftentimes you'll find that

436
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:20,679
there are people that are praying. Many of us know of C. H. Spurgeon. I had the opportunity

437
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:24,559
a number of years ago when we were visiting my brother while he was stationed in England

438
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:30,039
to go to the Metropolitan Tabernacle. And as I went to the Metropolitan Tabernacle, I was

439
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:35,679
not aware of the fact that it's only a portion of the size that it once was under the ministry

440
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,519
of C. H. Spurgeon. And as I was speaking with the man in the bookstore, they have a bookstore

441
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:43,760
that's open, and we were able to go into the auditorium, and we were able to walk around

442
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,279
the auditorium. And I asked him if he would show me the place where the pulpit was where

443
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,599
Mr. Spurgeon preached from, and if he would be able to show me the basement area of underneath

444
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:59,839
of that pulpit where there were men that gathered and prayed. And he said, Sir, I'm thankful

445
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,239
that you know about that, but unfortunately...

446
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:05,159
that portion of the building is no longer owned by us,

447
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:07,679
it was torn down and they did some remodeling

448
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,679
and so on and so forth, and so I was not able to see it.

449
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:12,899
But if you understand and you read some things

450
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:16,639
about C.H. Spurgeon, you'll find that many times

451
00:30:16,639 --> 00:30:19,639
they would ask him about the power in his ministry

452
00:30:19,639 --> 00:30:22,319
and he would refer to a room that was in the basement

453
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,359
underneath the pulpit, directly under where the pulpit sat

454
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:27,519
in that metropolitan tabernacle.

455
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:30,799
There were no less than 100 men each service

456
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,999
that he was preaching that were gathered in that place

457
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:34,759
praying for God's power.

458
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:38,659
Is there any wonder why God used him

459
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:40,199
in the way in which he did?

460
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:45,319
People were praying, they were seeking the face of God,

461
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:49,639
understanding that God is able, that God uses his word,

462
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:52,079
that God blesses and answers prayer,

463
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:55,799
and so the Apostle Paul, as he's writing to these believers

464
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,559
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

465
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:00,559
he says, number one, recognize the privilege of prayer.

466
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,439
He then gives them a petition from Paul,

467
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:06,999
this request that is given specifically with regard

468
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:10,359
to having this door of utterance open

469
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:13,999
that God would move and work and give opportunities.

470
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:16,479
And I would submit to you that as we conclude this morning

471
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:18,759
by looking at these few verses of Scripture,

472
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:21,439
that this is a pattern for God's people.

473
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:23,199
It's a pattern for God's people.

474
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:27,999
I'm encouraged as I read the word of God.

475
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:29,999
I'm comforted as I read the word of God

476
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,639
and see that we serve a God who hears and answers prayer.

477
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:35,599
I'm encouraged and I'm comforted

478
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:38,199
when I see how God answers prayer.

479
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:40,959
We could speak of a number of times

480
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,039
throughout the word of God.

481
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:45,119
I'll use one simple illustration of Hannah

482
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:49,199
when she was praying and she's pouring her heart out to God.

483
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:51,919
God answered.

484
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:54,299
Samuel was born.

485
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,199
Give you a New Testament illustration

486
00:31:58,199 --> 00:31:59,719
in Acts chapter number four.

487
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:02,319
The people of God are under persecution

488
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:04,639
because of what has happened and they're threatened

489
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:06,319
and they're told not to speak anymore

490
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:08,519
in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.

491
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:09,359
And what do they do?

492
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:12,079
They gather together and they pray.

493
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:14,039
And as they pray, they make this request

494
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:17,119
that God would grant us boldness,

495
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:19,559
that we would speak the word of God.

496
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:20,399
And guess what?

497
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,519
Just a couple of verses after the prayer,

498
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:26,399
God gives them, God answers and God blesses.

499
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:29,959
I mentioned by way of introduction

500
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:32,999
that we understand the importance of prayer,

501
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:36,679
but at times in our lives, we've neglected prayer.

502
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,459
I believe that as we would neglect prayer,

503
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:41,399
that really what we're doing is we're missing out

504
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:43,759
on seeing God work.

505
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:46,439
We're missing out on seeing what God is able to do.

506
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:48,559
Simply because we don't pray.

507
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,639
Simply because we try our own way.

508
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:52,439
We try to figure it out.

509
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:53,399
I've said this before.

510
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:54,859
It's not just true of our church,

511
00:32:54,859 --> 00:32:56,079
though it is true of our church.

512
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:59,159
It's true of churches all across this nation.

513
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,359
I would say that one of the most important meetings

514
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:03,079
of a church is the prayer meeting.

515
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:07,239
But it is regularly the least attended meeting

516
00:33:07,239 --> 00:33:08,719
of any church.

517
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:09,619
Regularly.

518
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:13,879
What does that show about what we believe about prayer?

519
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,319
We just simply can neglect it.

520
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:20,479
We don't see the significance of it, the importance of it.

521
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:24,679
We are able to just skip it or miss it.

522
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:27,359
But the reality is that this is a pattern

523
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:28,599
for the people of God.

524
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:30,759
How many of you have read the book of Acts?

525
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,099
We've read the book of Acts.

526
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:35,519
How many times when you read the book of Acts,

527
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,279
you say, man, isn't that exciting what God's doing?

528
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,799
Look at how God is moving.

529
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,479
Look at how God is working.

530
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:46,459
Let's take a quick journey through the book of Acts.

531
00:33:46,459 --> 00:33:48,719
Begin in the first chapter.

532
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:52,739
It's not every verse that deals with the subject matter,

533
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,859
but I just want to take a quick survey

534
00:33:54,859 --> 00:33:57,119
through the book of Acts in closing this morning.

535
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:59,059
Why, because when I think about the book of Acts

536
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:01,739
and I think about how God is moving and working

537
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:04,539
in the first century church and we read the book of Acts

538
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:08,079
and we read it and we say, man, look at what God is doing.

539
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,459
Look at how God is working.

540
00:34:09,459 --> 00:34:11,659
There are 3,000 saved, there are 5,000 saved,

541
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,979
there's a multitude saved, there are multitudes saved.

542
00:34:13,979 --> 00:34:16,759
God is working and moving.

543
00:34:16,759 --> 00:34:20,940
But you'll find out that the people of God are praying.

544
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,079
They're praying.

545
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:23,839
Look in Acts one.

546
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,559
Look in verse number 14.

547
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:28,119
The Bible said, these all continued with one accord

548
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:31,759
in what, in prayer and supplication with the women

549
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:34,239
and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brethren.

550
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,859
Look over in chapter number two.

551
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:39,919
After the day of Pentecost, after they received the word

552
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:42,199
and were baptized, according to verse number 41,

553
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:44,199
there were 3,000 souls added to the church.

554
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,799
Notice what the Bible tells us in verse number 42

555
00:34:46,799 --> 00:34:48,399
of Acts chapter number two.

556
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,319
And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine

557
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:56,779
and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers.

558
00:34:58,919 --> 00:35:00,119
They're praying.

559
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:02,559
Notice in chapter number four.

560
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,880
I mentioned this just a moment ago.

561
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,500
That New Testament illustration or example

562
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,559
that is given to us, they faced threats

563
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:11,959
and faced this interrogation.

564
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:15,019
In verse number 23, the Bible says, in being let go,

565
00:35:15,019 --> 00:35:16,319
they went to their own company.

566
00:35:16,319 --> 00:35:18,679
The disciples, John and Peter, that were there

567
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:20,519
standing before the religious group

568
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:23,959
that were giving them this difficulty,

569
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:26,399
they go to their own company, to the church.

570
00:35:26,399 --> 00:35:28,679
And it says that they reported all that the chief priests

571
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:30,279
and elders had said unto them.

572
00:35:30,279 --> 00:35:32,979
And when they heard that, what did they do?

573
00:35:32,979 --> 00:35:36,039
They lifted up their voice to God with one accord.

574
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,239
What is that?

575
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,359
It's prayer.

576
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:39,479
It's prayer.

577
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:42,919
They lifted up their voice to God with one accord

578
00:35:42,919 --> 00:35:47,039
and said, Lord, Thou art God, which

579
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:50,799
has made heaven and earth and the sea

580
00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:53,359
and all that in them is.

581
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,199
You think about the beginning of their prayer

582
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:56,959
here in verse number 24.

583
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:58,799
And you think about the way in which that's

584
00:35:58,799 --> 00:35:59,720
the God that we serve.

585
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,319
That's the God that we pray to.

586
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:02,919
He is the Lord God omnipotent.

587
00:36:02,919 --> 00:36:04,199
He's Jehovah.

588
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:05,559
He created everything.

589
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:07,160
He sustains everything.

590
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,279
He is able to do anything.

591
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:10,799
You think about Hezekiah.

592
00:36:10,799 --> 00:36:14,359
When Sennacherib and they come and they seize

593
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:17,559
and they try to take over, they've

594
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:21,359
already taken the northern tribe captive Israel.

595
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,599
And now Judah is under attack.

596
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,059
And Hezekiah, what does he do?

597
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:27,119
He prays.

598
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,359
Listen, he understood that Sennacherib and Rabshakeh

599
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:31,440
had made these threats.

600
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,319
And Rabshakeh says, hey, listen, we've

601
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:35,479
conquered everybody else.

602
00:36:35,479 --> 00:36:36,639
What are you going to do?

603
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:39,799
He says to the people, don't let Hezekiah deceive you

604
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:41,519
into trusting God.

605
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:43,919
You know what Hezekiah does after he gets those letters?

606
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:45,799
He lays them out before God.

607
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:48,359
And he says, God, you're the Creator.

608
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:49,919
You've made everything.

609
00:36:49,919 --> 00:36:52,279
This is nothing for you.

610
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:53,559
Amen?

611
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,479
He sought God.

612
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:58,039
Here, the immediate response, unfortunately in our lives,

613
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:00,039
there are times in which prayer is not

614
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:02,039
our immediate response to the difficulty.

615
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:03,599
It's our last resort.

616
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,440
But we don't go to God immediately.

617
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,279
We don't seek His face immediately.

618
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:12,559
But the church in Acts 4, as soon as they heard that,

619
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:16,279
they lifted up their voice to God with one accord.

620
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:19,119
They immediately responded with prayer.

621
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,239
Go over to chapter 6 and look in verse 4.

622
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:23,880
There's some trouble in the church.

623
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,639
And the deacons are sought out, these men.

624
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:30,119
And the Bible says in verse 4, as the disciples

625
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:33,319
would speak here, but we will give ourselves continually

626
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:38,559
to prayer and to the ministry of the word.

627
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:40,759
Give ourselves continually to prayer

628
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:44,319
and to the ministry of the word.

629
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:44,839
Why?

630
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:47,079
Because they understood the significance of prayer.

631
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:48,880
They understood the significance of prayer.

632
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,119
Notice in chapter number 12, it's

633
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,759
an exciting portion of scripture.

634
00:37:56,759 --> 00:37:58,799
In fact, I had the privilege on Thursday

635
00:37:58,799 --> 00:38:02,039
to preach chapel over at Fairfax Baptist Temple Academy.

636
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,199
And for the younger students, I preached from Acts 12.

637
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,799
And for the older students, I preached

638
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:09,079
from the book of 1 Samuel.

639
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:12,919
But Acts 12, this is where James was killed.

640
00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:14,839
Peter's in prison.

641
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:17,000
Herod's going to kill James.

642
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,039
He's already killed James.

643
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:19,559
He now wants to kill Peter.

644
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:22,039
But the Bible tells us that when Peter was in prison,

645
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:25,199
notice in verse number 5, Peter therefore was kept in prison,

646
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:28,639
but prayer was made without ceasing of the church

647
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,000
unto God for him.

648
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,839
They had a prayer meeting.

649
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,080
If you look in chapter number 12 and verse number 12,

650
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,119
the last phrase of the verse of scripture

651
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:41,959
says, where many were gathered together praying.

652
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:46,119
You notice that they prayed without ceasing unto God

653
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:48,039
for him because of the circumstance,

654
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:50,279
because of the situation.

655
00:38:50,279 --> 00:38:52,959
And then when he's released, they're astonished.

656
00:38:52,959 --> 00:38:55,239
They can't even believe.

657
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:59,080
Rhoda's so excited, she forgets to open the door.

658
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,320
She goes running back in and says, hey,

659
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,080
Peter's knocking at the door.

660
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,239
And they said, you're crazy.

661
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:06,919
You're mad.

662
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:10,640
And there's Peter still knocking.

663
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,760
And they let him in.

664
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,000
And the Bible tells us that, verse number 17,

665
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,679
he beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace.

666
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:18,880
I think there was excitement.

667
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,799
Peter, what happened?

668
00:39:19,799 --> 00:39:20,679
How did you?

669
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:21,440
Can you imagine?

670
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,000
You've been praying.

671
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,399
Peter's in prison.

672
00:39:24,399 --> 00:39:26,880
And now Peter's where you are.

673
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,320
You want to know what happened.

674
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,159
Everyone's talking, trying to figure it out.

675
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,159
And Peter, beckoning unto them with their hand

676
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:34,119
to hold their peace, he declared unto them

677
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:37,839
how the Lord had brought him out of the prison.

678
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:43,000
That had to be exciting because our God answers prayer.

679
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,479
But we miss out on seeing what God's able to do

680
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:48,799
because we neglect prayer.

681
00:39:48,799 --> 00:39:52,719
Notice, keep going with me, chapter 13 and verse number 3.

682
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:56,000
Notice here, this is the first missionary journey.

683
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,640
And God, the Holy Spirit of God says in verse number 2,

684
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,640
as they ministered to the Lord and fasted,

685
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,440
the Holy Ghost said, separate me, Barnabas.

686
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,980
and Saul, for the work whereinto I have called them.

687
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,180
And when they had fasted and prayed,

688
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:12,140
and laid their hands on them, they sent them away."

689
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,600
I believe that not only did the church here at Antioch

690
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,300
pray for these as they went out on this first missionary journey,

691
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,100
but I would argue that they prayed for them

692
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,560
during the entirety of the missionary journey.

693
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,140
And that's why at the end of chapter number 14,

694
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,440
when they return from this missionary journey,

695
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,940
and they're going to announce that they're going to be there

696
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:35,100
to give an update that the people show up.

697
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,640
Why? Because they want to hear how God answered prayer.

698
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,640
And if you look at the end of chapter number 14

699
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,400
in the middle of verse number 27,

700
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,640
it says that they rehearsed all that God had done with them.

701
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,940
When we hear these update letters from our missionaries,

702
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,680
when we hear of how God is working,

703
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:54,440
listen, it's exciting to us if we've been praying for them.

704
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,940
Because we get to hear how God's answering our prayers.

705
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,600
We're praying for people that sometimes we don't even know.

706
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,760
We have missionaries that we've supported

707
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,260
from before the time I got here as pastor

708
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:09,060
that we still support today that I've not met them face to face.

709
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,520
I've had interaction with them.

710
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,300
They've not been able to leave their field for a period of time

711
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,600
to be able to come for furlough and so on and so forth.

712
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,480
And I've had correspondence with them,

713
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,139
but I've not met them face to face.

714
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:23,760
And yet we pray for them and we see how God works.

715
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,680
We see what God does.

716
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,600
That's why missions conferences are so exciting to me.

717
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,560
Why? Because we get to hear what God's doing

718
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,520
in the lives of these missionaries.

719
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,639
We're invested in it.

720
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:36,600
We're not only giving to it, but we're also praying for them.

721
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,180
We find that in chapter number 16 and verse number 25.

722
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,480
Notice what the Bible says here.

723
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,360
They're in a situation there in Philippi,

724
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,840
and they're imprisoned, Paul and Silas.

725
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,600
And the Bible says in Acts 16 and 25,

726
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,940
and at midnight, Paul and Silas, what does it say?

727
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:57,060
They prayed and they sang praises unto God,

728
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:00,520
and the prisoners heard them.

729
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,360
What did God do? There's a great earthquake.

730
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,560
God released them.

731
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,900
Can you think about the impact

732
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,440
that this must have had in Philippi?

733
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,680
As Paul writes back to the believers in Philippi

734
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,760
in the letter that we call the Book of Philippians,

735
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,020
I think about this jailer.

736
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:23,139
He will soon say, sirs, what must I do to be saved?

737
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:24,860
Paul and Silas didn't lift up their voice

738
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,520
and complain about their circumstances.

739
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,820
They didn't lift up their voice

740
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,820
and have everyone hear them in a wrong manner.

741
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,820
No, they lifted up their voices and they prayed

742
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,619
and they sang praises unto God.

743
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:40,240
You say, how could we praise God in such a situation?

744
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,820
Because God's in control.

745
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,520
Were they rightly imprisoned?

746
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:49,160
No, they weren't.

747
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,020
But sometimes, even when things from a human perspective

748
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,100
don't seem to be right,

749
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,100
God is still in control of that.

750
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,720
How many times I've heard people say,

751
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,760
well, that just wasn't supposed to be this way,

752
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,059
and this happened and that happened,

753
00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:04,059
and these people this and those people that.

754
00:43:04,059 --> 00:43:06,680
God's over all of that.

755
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,440
Amen?

756
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,639
And if God still let it happen,

757
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:12,559
then God let it happen.

758
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:14,059
And I'm not going to waste my time

759
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:15,559
trying to figure out how to reverse something

760
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,059
and why I'm going to be upset about it

761
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:18,020
and so on and so forth.

762
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,559
I'm just going to press on and serve God.

763
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:22,760
Chapter 21, verse 5.

764
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,220
Again, we could look at a number of additional references

765
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:28,760
throughout the book of Acts.

766
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,520
Here in Acts 21,

767
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,419
Paul's gathered with some of the believers

768
00:43:35,419 --> 00:43:38,020
and they tarried there for seven days.

769
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,260
He was going to Jerusalem.

770
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,839
And it tells us in verse 5,

771
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:43,720
and when we'd accomplished those days,

772
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,139
we departed and went our way,

773
00:43:45,139 --> 00:43:47,100
and they all brought us on our way

774
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,260
with wives and children

775
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,800
until we were out of the city

776
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,559
and we kneeled down on the shore

777
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:54,139
and prayed.

778
00:43:54,139 --> 00:43:56,720
And prayed.

779
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,940
It's exciting to read the book of Acts.

780
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,639
It's exciting to see what God did

781
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,800
and how God worked

782
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,520
and how the Gospel there in Jerusalem

783
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,839
influenced so many

784
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,760
and the church exploded with membership

785
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,680
and attendance.

786
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,760
But God did not intend that the Gospel

787
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,380
simply stay in Jerusalem.

788
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,220
He had given the specific instruction

789
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,720
as recorded in Acts 1

790
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,519
that they're to be in Jerusalem and Judea

791
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:23,519
and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth

792
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:25,220
after they're endued with power

793
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,720
of the Holy Ghost.

794
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,220
And we find that it's in Acts 8

795
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,059
as that persecution intensifies

796
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:31,720
that they're scattered abroad

797
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,720
and they went everywhere preaching the Word.

798
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,220
And you begin to see how God's purposes

799
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,519
are being fulfilled.

800
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:39,720
And it's being fulfilled through persecution

801
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,220
in Acts chapter number 8.

802
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,220
That's what caused them to be scattered abroad

803
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,720
but they went everywhere preaching the Word.

804
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,720
And you begin to see how the Gospel reached

805
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,720
just the known world

806
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,220
throughout the book of Acts.

807
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,720
And you begin to understand

808
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,220
the implications of all that takes place

809
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,220
in the book of Acts.

810
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,720
And you say, there's a key.

811
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,220
And it's prayer.

812
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,720
And to the believers in Colossae

813
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,720
as Paul is wrapping up this book

814
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,220
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

815
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,720
he says in verse 2,

816
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,720
continue in prayer.

817
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,220
Continue in prayer.

818
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:19,220
We recognize this morning the privilege that it is

819
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,220
that is ours to pray.

820
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,220
It's a great privilege

821
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,220
that we can go before the throne room of heaven

822
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,220
and seek the face of God

823
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,220
and know that He hears us

824
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:33,220
and know that He's able.

825
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:35,220
It's not just some kind of wishful

826
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,720
I hope these things are going to happen,

827
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,220
I hope God hears me.

828
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,720
No, no, we have confidence

829
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,220
that He hears us.

830
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:45,720
The petition from Paul

831
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,220
not only continue in prayer

832
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,720
and watch in the same with Thanksgiving,

833
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,220
but for us,

834
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,720
the door of utterance would be open unto us,

835
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,220
that we would speak the mystery of God,

836
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,720
that we would do what we're supposed to do,

837
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,220
that we would pray one for another,

838
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:00,220
that we would be the ambassadors,

839
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,720
the witnesses that God's called us to be.

840
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,220
It's a pattern for God's people.

841
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,220
Prayer is not something that we just,

842
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,220
yep, I had my time of prayer.

843
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,720
It's not just some rote religion.

844
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,220
It's talking to God.

845
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:17,720
He's the creator of the universe.

846
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,220
And knowing that He hears us

847
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:22,220
and He answers us, it's amazing.

848
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,220
It's phenomenal.

849
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:26,220
We see throughout the Word of God

850
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,220
this pattern that has been established.

851
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,220
It seems as if in the busyness of life,

852
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,720
I understand we live in a busy, busy time.

853
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,220
It's amazing to me how busy we are.

854
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,220
Because we have more modern conveniences

855
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:42,220
than we've ever had.

856
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,720
We have a washing machine.

857
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,220
You know what the alternative is?

858
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,220
You know what they did 150 years ago?

859
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:51,220
They didn't have no washing machines.

860
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:55,220
Right? We got grocery stores.

861
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,220
I could go on and on of all the modern conveniences

862
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,220
that we have.

863
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,720
And yet we have less time

864
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,220
than we seem to have ever had.

865
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,220
Right?

866
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,720
The enemy doesn't want us to pray.

867
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,720
But we need to understand this pattern of prayer

868
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,720
that is established in the Word of God

869
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,720
Continue in prayer.

870
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,720
Watch in the same with Thanksgiving.

871
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,220
That we would have that encouragement

872
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,720
that Paul gives these believers in Colossae.

873
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,720
And we'd say, you know what?

874
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,220
I need to make this a priority.

875
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:30,720
Because when I pray, I get to see what God can do.

876
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,220
And God can do more than any of us can do,

877
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,220
than all of us can do collectively.

878
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,720
He can do more.

879
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,720
Amen?

880
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,220
Oh, that we'd be people of prayer.

881
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,220
Let's pray together.

882
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,720
Father, we love You.

883
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,720
We thank You so much for loving us.

884
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,220
Thank You for this instruction, this admonition.

885
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:52,720
I'm encouraged as I read the portion of Scripture.

886
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,220
I'm also challenged.

887
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:59,720
Lord, I pray that You would help us

888
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:04,220
to be honest with ourselves and with You

889
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:09,720
with regard to the subject of prayer.

890
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,220
If we've neglected prayer,

891
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:14,220
would You help us to acknowledge that and confess it?

892
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,220
Lord, would You help us to make commitments

893
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:19,220
to engage in prayer,

894
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:22,720
to intercede on the behalf of one another,

895
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,220
knowing that You're able to do exceeding abundantly

896
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:29,720
above all that we ask or think?

897
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,720
Would You help us to understand

898
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:38,720
as we consider the great acts

899
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,720
that we read of in the book of Acts,

900
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,220
how that it was a people that prayed,

901
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,220
and they saw You work?

902
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,720
God, help us to be a praying church,

903
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,220
a praying people.

904
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,220
I pray that You'd move and work as only You can

905
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:59,220
as we have an opportunity to respond.

906
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,720
As the Holy Spirit of God has worked in hearts and lives,

907
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,720
would You help us to say,

908
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,720
yes, Lord, yes?

909
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,720
Would You help us, Lord,

910
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,720
to do business with You in these moments?

911
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,720
We'll thank You for it in Christ's name we pray.

912
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,720
Would You stand?
