1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,559
the message but it was on my heart and I hope that this morning all that thrills

2
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:14,880
your soul is Jesus. Aren't you thankful for the Lord Jesus Christ? Amen. Praise

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:23,959
the Lord. Where'd we be without Him? Hopeless, helpless, right? Praise the Lord.

4
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:32,119
Jesus is the sweetest name I know. It truly is. You know when I hear the name Jesus it means

5
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:39,720
something. It means something. It brings to my mind who Jesus is. Not according to what the

6
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:45,000
world might say but according to what God's Word says, what He revealed to us. And I'm so thankful

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,479
to know the Lord Jesus Christ personally. Last week in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 we dealt with

8
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:54,599
verse number 17 and this week we're going to deal with verses 18 through 20. I've titled the

9
00:00:54,599 --> 00:00:59,799
message We Are His Ambassadors. In Acts chapter 5 and verse 32, you don't need to turn there,

10
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:06,440
but the disciples declared we are His witnesses. What a great declaration for the disciples as

11
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:12,839
they're dealing with all sorts of persecution and resistance and they'd been facing various

12
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:18,919
levels of persecution up to that point and they're given threats from the religious leaders that are

13
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:24,120
to no longer speak in the name of Jesus. They're not to preach anymore in the name of Jesus and

14
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,919
they make this declaration. There are several declarations that they make but one of them is

15
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:36,680
we are His witnesses. We find that John would later say in 1 John chapter number 1 how that

16
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:43,639
he was an eyewitness and that he's given us this account and really this morning we can rejoice in

17
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:49,239
understanding that we are His witnesses. The apostle Paul as he's writing to the church in

18
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:54,599
Corinth here in the book of 2 Corinthians, we find that he's going to provide greater instruction in

19
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:59,720
the passage of scripture that we're going to study this morning with regard to the ministry that he

20
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:05,639
spoke of in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse number 1. If you note there in your Bible that

21
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:13,720
the apostle Paul says, therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint

22
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,759
not and we find that in these few verses of scripture in 2 Corinthians 5 verses 18 through 20

23
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,440
Paul under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God is going to provide greater instruction and

24
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,919
information to us with regard to the ministry that he spoke of in 2 Corinthians chapter 4

25
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:35,880
in verse number 1. We find that in this text of scripture as I mentioned in Acts 5 in verse 32

26
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:42,440
that the disciples say we are his witnesses but we find here in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 that we see

27
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:49,000
a distinguished title given to those who are entrusted with this ministry that the apostle

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,399
Paul spoke of in 2 Corinthians 4 verse number 1. We have this ministry and that distinguished

29
00:02:55,399 --> 00:03:05,559
title that he gives to us is that of ambassador. Ambassador. What a title. What a description.

30
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:13,320
I believe that every word of God is pure. I believe that God chose his words with purpose and

31
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,600
I believe that as we look at this passage of scripture and see this word ambassador it is

32
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,520
communicating something extremely important to us this morning. I find that in the New Testament

33
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,559
that the word ambassador is only used twice in all of the New Testament. We find that the apostle

34
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:34,919
Paul as he's writing to the church in Ephesus in Ephesians chapter 6 in verse number 20

35
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:42,679
he refers to himself as being an ambassador in bonds and we understand the apostle Paul

36
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:47,639
as he would even say later to Timothy though he was bound the word of God is not bound and what

37
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:53,800
a blessing and the apostle Paul that while he was in prison he still recognized this distinguished

38
00:03:53,800 --> 00:04:00,199
title that he was an ambassador though he had been in prison though he did not have the same

39
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:07,000
level of liberties that he once had he recognized that he was still an ambassador and as you study

40
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,479
through the New Testament you study the the truth of God's word you'll find that the apostle Paul

41
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:20,679
even while he was bound even while he faced times of imprisonment that he was actively sharing the

42
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:26,679
gospel because he recognized that he was an ambassador for Christ and we find that there

43
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:33,399
were people that got saved there were people that trusted Christ as their personal Lord and Savior

44
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:41,320
why because he was faithful to do the work that God had entrusted to him to fulfill we find that

45
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,959
as he's writing to the church in Philippi it's very interesting the church in Philippi how did

46
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:50,920
the church start what was the circumstances regarding the apostle Paul in Philippi well we

47
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,839
know that shortly after the the healing and what took place with that demonic possessed girl

48
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:01,559
that we find that he's imprisoned Paul and Silas they're imprisoned in Philippi

49
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:11,640
they're singing and praising God but Paul you're in prison but God is good God has a plan

50
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:19,079
my life is his I'm in his hand he's singing praises and at midnight the Bible says

51
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:25,959
that God sent an earthquake and that jailer who is ready to kill himself supposing that all the

52
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:31,239
prisoners had escaped he he finds out Paul says we're all here do yourself no harm and he says

53
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:38,839
sirs what must I do to be saved Paul later writing to the church at Philippi he would say to that

54
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:43,320
church that he did not want them to have this misunderstanding he didn't want them to have

55
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,880
be ignorant concerning the things that befell him he tells them this in the first chapter he

56
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,160
wanted them to understand that it happened for the furtherance of the gospel we find that as

57
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,959
you come to the end of chapter four of the book of Philippians that Paul begins to write the names

58
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:05,399
and those that were saved that were of the household of Caesar how they get saved

59
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:13,880
God who knows all things who do with all things well he allowed for the apostle Paul to be

60
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,839
imprisoned and he allowed for the apostle Paul to be in that place and to have those prison guards

61
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:23,000
and those of the household and and Paul got the opportunity to share the gospel with him he didn't

62
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,880
just have a pity party he didn't just say woe is me I mean it's not fair I was just preaching I was

63
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,839
just doing what God called me to do and I I'm gonna give up no he just kept doing what God

64
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:41,480
called him to do and God blessed and here as we look at the apostle Paul making that statement

65
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:47,239
in Ephesians 6 that he was an ambassador in bonds we find that that's one use of the word but we

66
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:53,559
find that here in our text that he says to the believers in Corinth and by way of application

67
00:06:53,559 --> 00:07:00,440
to us as well this morning that we are ambassadors for Christ note the passage with me beginning in

68
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:09,399
verse 18 the bible says this and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus

69
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:18,679
Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that God was in Christ

70
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:25,160
reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed

71
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:34,679
unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did

72
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:46,519
beseech you by us we pray you in God Christ dead be ye reconciled to God this morning as we think

73
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:51,959
about this truth that we are his ambassadors I want you to consider first with me this morning

74
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:58,359
the privilege of being an ambassador it's a great privilege to be an ambassador sometimes I believe

75
00:07:58,359 --> 00:08:03,880
and I've been guilty of this in my own life in my own ministry sometimes we might focus more on the

76
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:10,679
responsibility side of things versus the privilege side of things the reality this morning we

77
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:16,920
understand it is absolutely true that that we do have a responsibility but I hope this morning that

78
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:23,000
as we think about this this truth this this this this title that is given to us as being an

79
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,640
ambassador that we recognize the privilege to be appointed by the king of kings and lord of lords

80
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:38,039
to be his representative to be his ambassador what a joy we say this this world is not my home I'm

81
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:43,960
just a passing through my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blues what the songwriter

82
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:49,640
said we sing it the bible tells us in the book of hebrews in the 11th chapter that we're strangers

83
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,880
and pilgrims the reality is that sometimes if we're not careful brother mark we dealt you dealt

84
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,919
with this a little bit in sunday school this morning if we're not careful sometimes this

85
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:05,400
world can almost be more like our home we treat it that way but this world is not my home I'm an

86
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,679
ambassador what is an ambassador it's representative it's a privilege in an appointed position

87
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:18,520
we find that that the lord jesus christ he showed to us he gave us in this passage this

88
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,760
this understanding of the privilege it's necessary that we acknowledge this morning

89
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,440
the great privilege that is ours the honor that is ours to be an ambassador for the lord jesus

90
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,400
christ the one who is the king of kings the lord of lords the one who knows all things

91
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:42,679
and he says to us that we are his ambassadors it's amazing paul would say as he's writing to

92
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:48,280
the church in ephesus that our citizenship is in heaven our citizenship is in heaven it's

93
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:53,640
interesting of an ambassador an ambassador is one who represents a foreign country you think about

94
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,559
a u.s ambassador that's going to another country it is said uh that while george schultz was

95
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,559
during the Reagan administration,

96
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,559
that he would meet with every newly appointed ambassador

97
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,559
before he or she left for the new posting.

98
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,559
As he would meet with them in his office,

99
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,559
he kept this globe there in his office,

100
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,559
and he would say, as he would bring in the individual,

101
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,559
he'd bring up that globe, and he would say this,

102
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:19,559
show me where your country is.

103
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,559
That's what he would say.

104
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,559
And it says this, this was the account,

105
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,559
that almost in every case,

106
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,559
the new ambassador would spin the globe,

107
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:30,559
they would find the country in which they were appointed to

108
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:33,559
or assigned to, and they would point to it.

109
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:36,559
And Mr. Schultz would correct them.

110
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,559
And he would point to America, and he would say this,

111
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:43,559
this is your country.

112
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,559
Why?

113
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,559
Because they had to understand they were representing the U.S.

114
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,559
in whatever country they were going to.

115
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,559
That was their purpose.

116
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,559
Can I tell you this morning,

117
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,559
we can't take a globe and point to heaven,

118
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,559
but can I tell you if you're saved this morning,

119
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,559
if you're a child of God, your citizenship is in heaven.

120
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,559
This world is not my home.

121
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,559
Amen?

122
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,559
Listen, we're here for a purpose,

123
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,559
and we're ambassadors.

124
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,559
We're to represent the Lord Jesus Christ.

125
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:13,559
It is a privilege that we have to be his ambassadors.

126
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:16,559
In John chapter 20, turn there very quickly, if you will,

127
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,559
I want you to notice what Jesus says in John chapter 20.

128
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:23,559
We understand that we could go to each of the Gospels,

129
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,559
Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.

130
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:27,559
We could go to the book of Acts,

131
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,559
and we could deal with the Great Commission this morning.

132
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:32,559
But I want you to see the way in which Jesus says it

133
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,559
in John chapter 20.

134
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,559
In John chapter 20, we find that the resurrection

135
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:39,559
has already taken place, and Jesus is appearing.

136
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,559
It's the evening of the same day,

137
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,559
according to verse number 19.

138
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,559
He appears, and he says,

139
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,559
Peace be unto you at the end of the verse.

140
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,559
But I want you to notice that as he's there,

141
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,559
in verse 20, it says,

142
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,559
When he had so said,

143
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,559
he showed unto them his hands and his side.

144
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,559
Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord.

145
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:58,559
Then said Jesus to them again,

146
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,559
Peace be unto you.

147
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,559
And then notice what Jesus says,

148
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:05,559
As my Father hath sent me,

149
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,559
even so send I you.

150
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,559
I'm thankful that Jesus left the throne room of heaven

151
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,559
to come to this sin-cursed world,

152
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,559
to die in my place and in your place,

153
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:17,559
to go to that old cross,

154
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,559
to be buried in a borrowed tomb,

155
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:22,559
to rise, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

156
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,559
But I understand this morning that the resurrected Christ,

157
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,559
that he now has ascended to heaven,

158
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:28,559
he's on the right hand of the throne of God,

159
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:30,559
and we find that what he's commissioned,

160
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,559
he said, as I've been sent,

161
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:35,559
now I'm sending you.

162
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,559
We're his ambassadors.

163
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,559
It's a privilege.

164
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,559
The apostle Paul says it this way

165
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,559
as he's talking to the church in Thessalonica.

166
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,559
Notice, if you will, in 1 Thessalonians chapter 2.

167
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:48,559
In 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,

168
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,559
the Bible tells us that, of course,

169
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,559
Paul had had the opportunity

170
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,559
during the second missionary journey.

171
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,559
You read Acts 17.

172
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,559
You can see of the time in which he went to Thessalonica.

173
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:01,559
But as he says this to this church,

174
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,559
this group of believers,

175
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,559
notice the perspective of the apostle Paul

176
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:08,559
in 1 Thessalonians 2 and verse number 4.

177
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,559
He says, but as we were allowed of God

178
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,559
to be put in trust with the gospel,

179
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,559
even so we speak,

180
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,559
not as pleasing men, but God,

181
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:22,559
which trieth our hearts.

182
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,559
He says that we were allowed of God

183
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,559
to be in trust with the gospel.

184
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,559
You think about the gospel,

185
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,559
the death, burial, and glorious resurrection

186
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,559
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

187
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:33,559
I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ,

188
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,559
for it is the power of God unto salvation

189
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:37,559
to everyone that believeth,

190
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,559
to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

191
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,559
We read that in Romans chapter 1.

192
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,559
And we find that the apostle Paul,

193
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:46,559
as he's communicating to this church in Thessalonica,

194
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,559
he says, I want you to gain this perspective

195
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,559
that we have been allowed of God

196
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:56,559
to be entrusted, to be put in trust

197
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,559
with the gospel.

198
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,559
This morning, do you recognize

199
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:03,559
the privilege that is ours

200
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:07,559
to be an ambassador of the Lord Jesus Christ?

201
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:09,559
It's absolutely amazing.

202
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:12,559
I believe this morning that it is appropriate

203
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,559
and it's necessary at times that we focus

204
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,559
and we deal with the responsibility that we have.

205
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,559
It's important we have missions conferences,

206
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:23,559
we have missionaries that come in

207
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:26,559
throughout the calendar year to stir us up

208
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,559
and to speak to us about the responsibility

209
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,559
to the desires to reach the world

210
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,559
with the gospel.

211
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:37,559
And what a task that God has given to us.

212
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,559
Yes, we've been commanded.

213
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:43,559
Yes, we have a responsibility.

214
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,559
But I want you to look at it

215
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:48,559
from a perspective of privilege.

216
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,559
Not just duty.

217
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,559
Not just duty.

218
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,559
But privilege.

219
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:57,559
There's a privilege.

220
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,559
To be able to sit down with someone

221
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:01,559
and tell them about the one

222
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:04,559
who loves them more than anyone else.

223
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,559
The one, the only one,

224
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:10,559
that can save them and change their lives.

225
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,559
What a privilege that has been given to us.

226
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,559
And we find that we recognize

227
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,559
that it's been given to us

228
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,559
for we find in our text in 2 Corinthians 5

229
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,559
that the Bible says in verse 18,

230
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:26,559
we spoke already in the past two weeks

231
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,559
about verses 14 and 15

232
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:31,559
and that he died for all in verse 15

233
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:33,559
that they which live should not henceforth

234
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,559
live unto themselves but unto him

235
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,559
which died for them and rose again.

236
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:39,559
We dealt with verse 17 last week.

237
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:41,559
Therefore, if any man be in Christ,

238
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,559
they're saved, they're born again.

239
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,559
The Bible says that he's a new creature.

240
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,559
Old things are passed away.

241
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:48,559
Behold, all things are become new.

242
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,559
But then we find in verse 18,

243
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:52,559
the Bible says that all things are of God

244
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:55,559
who hath reconciled us

245
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:59,559
to himself by Jesus Christ

246
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,559
and then notice,

247
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,559
and hath given to us

248
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:05,559
the ministry of reconciliation.

249
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:08,559
He did not give this ministry of reconciliation

250
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:10,559
to anyone other than those

251
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,559
who have been reconciled.

252
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:14,559
See, you have to be reconciled

253
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,559
before you can be engaged in the work

254
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,559
and the ministry of reconciliation.

255
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,559
The angels desire to look into it

256
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,559
but they cannot be engaged

257
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:27,559
in the ministry of reconciliation

258
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,559
because they can't, they're not reconciled.

259
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,559
They don't need to.

260
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:34,559
But this morning, we think of this passage

261
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,559
and the privilege that is ours.

262
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:40,559
I'm so thankful to know the Lord Jesus Christ

263
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,559
as my personal savior.

264
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:45,559
The privilege of knowing him and serving him

265
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,559
and knowing that he's given me.

266
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,559
You know, it's amazing to begin to think

267
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,559
about who we are in Christ.

268
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:54,559
Who he is to us and who we are in him.

269
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:56,559
We find that as many as receive him,

270
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:58,559
to them gave he power to become

271
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,559
the sons of God,

272
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,559
even to them that believe on his name.

273
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:03,559
We find in 1 John 3,

274
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,559
John stands up and says,

275
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,559
behold what manner of love the father

276
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,559
hath bestowed upon us

277
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,559
that we should be called the sons of God.

278
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:13,559
Hallelujah.

279
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,559
And he says we're his ambassadors.

280
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:17,559
What a privilege.

281
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:19,559
What a privilege this morning.

282
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,559
We have gospel tracks out there.

283
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:23,559
We have opportunities for outreach

284
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:26,559
and ministry and try to reach people.

285
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,559
Why?

286
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,559
It's a privilege.

287
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:30,559
Yes, it's a responsibility,

288
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,559
but it's a privilege.

289
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,559
It's a privilege to go

290
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,559
as a representative, as an ambassador.

291
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,559
I want you to understand not only the privilege,

292
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,559
but number two, the purpose.

293
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,559
There's a purpose in being an ambassador

294
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,559
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

295
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:48,559
We understand the ambassadors

296
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,559
that are sent from our nation to other nations

297
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,559
and we can see that physically

298
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,559
and understand that application

299
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,559
and see how they behave

300
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,559
and what they're to do

301
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,559
and what their purpose is.

302
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:01,559
And they don't always fulfill it properly

303
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:02,559
and appropriately and what have you,

304
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,559
but the reality is they have a purpose.

305
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:08,559
This morning, when we look at the text of Scripture,

306
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,559
we understand that we too have a purpose.

307
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,559
As he's given to us this distinguished title

308
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,559
that we are his ambassadors,

309
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:17,559
we have a purpose.

310
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:19,559
Notice with me in verse 18,

311
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,559
the Bible says at the end of the verse,

312
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,559
and hath given to us

313
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,559
the ministry of reconciliation.

314
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:27,559
Verse 19,

315
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:30,559
to wit that God was in Christ

316
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,559
reconciling the world unto himself,

317
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,559
not imputing their trespasses unto them.

318
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:36,559
And then notice this phrase

319
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,559
at the end of verse number 19,

320
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,559
and hath committed unto us

321
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,559
the word of reconciliation.

322
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,559
Now then, verse 20,

323
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,559
we are ambassadors for Christ.

324
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:52,559
As though God did beseech you by us,

325
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,559
we pray you in Christ's stead,

326
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,559
be ye reconciled to God.

327
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,559
Do you see the number of uses of the word reconcile

328
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,559
or some form of the word reconcile

329
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,559
in these verses of Scripture

330
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,559
that we've read this morning?

331
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:11,559
We see that the ministry,

332
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:13,559
the purpose of being an ambassador

333
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,559
is that he's given to us

334
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:17,559
this work of reconciliation.

335
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:19,559
Now here's the amazing thing.

336
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:23,559
I can't personally reconcile anybody.

337
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,559
But as an ambassador,

338
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:29,559
I've been given the ministry of reconciliation.

339
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:30,559
Notice with me,

340
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,559
specifically in verse number 20,

341
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,559
he says now then we are ambassadors for Christ

342
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,559
as though God did beseech you by us.

343
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,559
And so listen,

344
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:43,559
the Bible tells us that God is not willing

345
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,559
that any should perish,

346
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,559
but that all should come to repentance.

347
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:48,559
Amen, is that what your Bible says?

348
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,559
2 Peter 3.

349
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,559
We could turn over there if we need to.

350
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:53,559
We understand that's what he says.

351
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,559
In fact, as he's writing to Timothy,

352
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:58,559
he says that he would have all men to be saved

353
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,559
and come unto the kingdom of God.

354
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,779
the knowledge of truth.

355
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:04,819
That's God's plan.

356
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:07,779
Now we understand that not all mankind will be saved

357
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:09,939
because we understand they will not be reconciled.

358
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:11,299
There are many that reject him.

359
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:13,699
He came to his own, his own received him not.

360
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:15,539
Is that not what the Bible tells us?

361
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:18,219
We find that there is a great white throne judgment

362
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:20,179
in Revelation chapter 20,

363
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:22,339
and there will be subjects that will stand

364
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:24,019
at that great white throne judgment.

365
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:25,099
Who are those people?

366
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,579
Those that were not reconciled to God.

367
00:20:27,579 --> 00:20:30,099
Those that were never born again.

368
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,719
But we understand this morning that God's heart

369
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:38,559
and God's desire for God so loved the world.

370
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,119
He loved the world.

371
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:42,279
He is the propitiation for our sins,

372
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:44,079
but not for our sins only,

373
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,239
but also for the sins of the whole world.

374
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,799
First John chapter two.

375
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:54,599
And we find that it says as though God did beseech you

376
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:57,839
by us, and then notice this, we pray you.

377
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,119
It's an interesting word.

378
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:00,959
Sometimes we look at the New Testament

379
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,519
and there's obviously a number of Greek words

380
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:05,159
and the English language is somewhat limited,

381
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:08,439
but that word pray literally carries with it

382
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:11,919
the idea of to beseech, to beg.

383
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,639
In fact, the same Greek word that we see that's used

384
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:18,379
for pray in this verse, in verse number 20,

385
00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:21,720
it's translated 12 times in our English Bible as pray,

386
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,279
but it's translated nine times

387
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:25,759
in our English Bible as beseech.

388
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:29,119
Think about this.

389
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:31,799
The apostle Paul says, I beseech you

390
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:33,000
in Romans chapter number 12.

391
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,839
What's he saying?

392
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:35,040
I'm pleading with you.

393
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,360
I'm begging you.

394
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,839
I've laid out the truth that I've laid out

395
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,680
and now I'm begging you.

396
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,239
I'm pleading with you.

397
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:47,360
And begin to look at this truth this morning

398
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,559
and considering the purpose that we have

399
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:50,680
as being an ambassador.

400
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,199
Yes, it's a great privilege, but we have a purpose.

401
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:58,199
And it says that we pray you in Christ's stead.

402
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,959
In other words, on his behalf, the Lord Jesus Christ,

403
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:04,720
he's seated at the right hand of the throne of glory.

404
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,639
We find that he has left us as his ambassadors

405
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:10,679
and so we're his representatives.

406
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:15,199
We're going out on his behalf and we have a purpose.

407
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:19,080
The purpose that we have is not to feed the hungry.

408
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,839
The purpose that we have is not to build.

409
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:24,199
I'm not saying there's anything wrong with those things.

410
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:29,199
I'm simply saying that if we only do those things,

411
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,679
we've fallen short of what our true purpose is.

412
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:36,479
Because our true purpose is to bring,

413
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:38,880
to do the work of reconciliation.

414
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,919
Notice what he says.

415
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,919
We pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.

416
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:50,599
Why is it that man needs reconciliation?

417
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:54,039
What is it that reconciliation means?

418
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,039
It means the act of reconciling parties,

419
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:58,440
notice this, at variance.

420
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,080
Why are they at variance?

421
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,479
Why does the Bible say that he's given to us

422
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:04,440
the ministry of reconciliation?

423
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:06,279
It's because of sin.

424
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:11,080
See, God didn't do anything wrong, but humanity did.

425
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:14,520
Sin entered into the world in the garden.

426
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,720
And death passed upon all men.

427
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Amen?

428
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,559
We're all sinners for all have sinned

429
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,319
and come short of the glory of God.

430
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,440
We're all sinners.

431
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,239
And therefore, every sinner needs reconciliation.

432
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:30,080
Why?

433
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,919
He's at enmity.

434
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,679
He's at variance with God.

435
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,319
God has done everything necessary

436
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:42,399
to provide for reconciliation.

437
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:46,080
There's nothing that any of us can do to add to it.

438
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,080
It would show the fact that his offering was not sufficient.

439
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:54,160
He did it all.

440
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,440
He did it all.

441
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,360
But he's entrusted to us the ministry of reconciliation.

442
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,880
See, you know there's a lot of people

443
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,000
that we come in contact with on a daily basis

444
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,279
that do not know that they need to be reconciled to God.

445
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:11,839
They don't know it.

446
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:13,479
They have no idea.

447
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:16,160
Oh, they might admit that they're a sinner,

448
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,679
but they may have been in a position

449
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:21,399
where they've been taught some false thoughts

450
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:25,160
with regard to salvation and how to approach God.

451
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,959
And I've heard many people over the years say,

452
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:30,639
especially in their later years,

453
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:32,880
I've made my peace with God.

454
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:37,559
And I've often wondered and I've often asked the question,

455
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,519
what do you mean by that?

456
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,119
Because the Bible tells us there's only one way

457
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,440
to have peace with God.

458
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,359
The Bible is very clear with regard

459
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,720
to this ministry of reconciliation.

460
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,760
And we find that mankind is in need of reconciliation.

461
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,279
And God has entrusted to us as his ambassadors,

462
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:59,839
as his representatives, this great privileged title,

463
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,000
this distinguished title, the privilege and honor

464
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,480
that I can represent the Lord Jesus Christ here on earth,

465
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,519
but I have a purpose.

466
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:11,839
And it's the ministry of reconciliation.

467
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,279
Turn to the book of Romans, if you will.

468
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,279
We're gonna look at a few verses of scripture

469
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,040
and kind of hammer in this ministry of reconciliation

470
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,079
and what this really looks like and what we must deal with

471
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:26,839
as we consider the purpose that God has given to us.

472
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:29,880
In Romans chapter five, beginning in verse number six,

473
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,200
notice what the Bible says.

474
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,320
Romans five and verse number six.

475
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,519
For when we were yet without strength,

476
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:41,639
in due time, Christ died for the ungodly.

477
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:44,239
For scarcely for a righteous man will one die,

478
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:46,119
yet peradventure for a good man,

479
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:48,320
some would even dare to die,

480
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,320
but God commendeth his love toward us.

481
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:56,000
And that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

482
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,839
You know why he died for you?

483
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:58,799
Because you're a sinner.

484
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,279
You needed a substitute.

485
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,480
And he died for us because he loves us.

486
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,359
This is the payment that was made

487
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:07,519
so that the two parties that were at variance

488
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:10,000
could be brought to peace.

489
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,320
It tells us in verse number nine,

490
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,639
much more than being now justified, how?

491
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:17,119
By your works?

492
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:19,239
No, by his blood.

493
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:20,559
Amen.

494
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,600
Is that what it says?

495
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
How are you gonna be justified?

496
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,000
There's only one way to be justified.

497
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,359
Only one way to be reconciled.

498
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,639
Only one way to be saved.

499
00:26:28,639 --> 00:26:30,679
Jesus is the only way.

500
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:32,959
Justified by his blood,

501
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,279
we shall be saved from wrath through him.

502
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:37,519
Notice in verse 10,

503
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:40,519
for if when we were enemies,

504
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:42,279
we were, what does it say?

505
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:43,239
Reconciled.

506
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:44,760
Listen, I know sometimes we wanna,

507
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,000
I wasn't really an enemy of God.

508
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,600
You were an enemy of God.

509
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,359
God wasn't your enemy.

510
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,040
God wants you to be saved.

511
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,799
But we, in our rebellion, in our sin,

512
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,079
we were at enmity with God.

513
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:59,079
We were at variance.

514
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,639
And we needed to be reconciled.

515
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,559
And he says, for when we were enemies,

516
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:08,040
we were reconciled to God, how?

517
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,239
By the death of his son.

518
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:12,239
Much more, being reconciled,

519
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:14,760
we shall be saved by his life.

520
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,639
Hallelujah.

521
00:27:15,639 --> 00:27:17,000
Verse 11, and not only so,

522
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,839
but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ,

523
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:25,559
by whom we have now received the atonement.

524
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:27,880
Man, it's good to be reconciled.

525
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,639
It is absolutely necessary to be reconciled.

526
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:31,720
Amen?

527
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,000
If you're not saved this morning,

528
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,320
if you've not been reconciled,

529
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,279
if you're still at variance,

530
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,639
you've never accepted the Lord Jesus Christ

531
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:39,880
as your personal savior.

532
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,519
Listen, chapter number six

533
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:42,559
of the book of 2 Corinthians,

534
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,000
today is the day of salvation.

535
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:48,279
We plead with you, we pray,

536
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:50,399
we beseech you in Christ's name,

537
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,040
be reconciled to God.

538
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,559
You need to be reconciled,

539
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,880
because you're at variance.

540
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,279
Notice in verse number one of this passage,

541
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,480
I didn't read it to start out.

542
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,760
I read verses six through 11,

543
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,679
but notice verse number one,

544
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:06,679
therefore being justified,

545
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:07,959
we read of that in verse number nine,

546
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:10,279
by his blood, notice by faith,

547
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:13,279
we have peace with God

548
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,679
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

549
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,760
He's my peace.

550
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,239
I have peace with God.

551
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,119
Does it mean I'm perfect?

552
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:22,519
No, but he is.

553
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,880
He is.

554
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,440
The next verse in 2 Corinthians chapter five

555
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,480
that we'll study, probably not next Sunday,

556
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,559
but the following Sunday,

557
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,079
for he hath made him to be sin for us

558
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,559
who knew no sin, that we might be made

559
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,479
the righteousness of God in him.

560
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:36,400
Hallelujah.

561
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,239
It's that imputed righteousness.

562
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:41,239
It's not my own righteousness.

563
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:44,279
All of my own righteousness is in filthy rags.

564
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,919
It's his righteousness.

565
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:50,719
And I have peace with God.

566
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:51,640
If you're saved this morning,

567
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,479
if you've been reconciled,

568
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:54,840
you have peace with God.

569
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,039
Ephesians chapter two,

570
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,239
notice what the Bible says here

571
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:58,799
in Ephesians chapter two,

572
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,559
as we think about this truth of reconciliation.

573
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:02,599
In fact, I wish we could,

574
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:03,440
we actually will.

575
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,400
We're gonna back up and start reading

576
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,039
in verse number one.

577
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:08,440
It's just so important to see all of this this morning.

578
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,320
I'll do my best not to make many comments

579
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,880
and just let God's word speak for itself here this morning.

580
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,080
In verse number one,

581
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,599
the Bible says,

582
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,039
and you hath he quickened

583
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,000
who were dead in trespasses and sins.

584
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,760
I was dead spiritually,

585
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,840
but he made me alive.

586
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,000
I was born again.

587
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,640
We talked about that last week.

588
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,440
Verse two, wherein in time past,

589
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,760
you walked according to the course of this world,

590
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,679
according to the prince,

591
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:33,679
the power of the air,

592
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:34,960
the spirit that now worketh

593
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,440
in the children of disobedience,

594
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,880
among whom also we all had our conversation in times past

595
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,039
in the lust of our flesh,

596
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:43,919
fulfilling the desires of the flesh

597
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:45,719
and of the mind,

598
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:47,599
and were by nature the children of wrath,

599
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,719
even as others.

600
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:51,320
But God, aren't you thankful for the but God?

601
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,239
But God who is rich in mercy for his great love,

602
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:58,200
wherewith he loved us,

603
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,440
even when we were dead in sin.

604
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,700
hath quickened us together with Christ, by grace ye are saved, and hath raised us

605
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,980
up together and made us to sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in

606
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:14,340
the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his

607
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:19,780
kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. For by grace are you saved through faith,

608
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,960
and that not of yourselves, but of the gift of God, not of works, lest any man

609
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,540
should boast. For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works,

610
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:36,220
which God hath before ordained, that we should walk in them. Notice verse 11.

611
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:45,940
Wherefore remember, remember, remember what? That ye, being in time past Gentiles in

612
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:51,100
the flesh, who are called on circumcision by that which is called the circumcision,

613
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:58,660
in the flesh made by hands, that at that time, notice what it says, ye were without

614
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:06,380
Christ. Can you remember that? Can you remember in your life when you were

615
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:13,060
without Christ? I'm saying before you got saved. See, because being saved is not a

616
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:19,819
process, it's a moment, it's the miracle of a moment. You must be born again, and I

617
00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:26,819
remember in time past. I remember when I was without Christ. I remember having no

618
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:33,779
hope. I remember having no peace. I remember having no real joy, because I was without

619
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:39,060
Christ. I remember that. By the way, it's a good thing for us every once in a while

620
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:47,100
to remember what he did for us, where we were headed. A songwriter, I haven't heard the

621
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,740
song for years, but he said, speaking of his life, when he was prior to being saved, he

622
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:57,540
was on a road heading to nowhere. Now, the reality is that he was heading to the lake

623
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:06,060
of fire. This morning, we find that he says, you were without Christ, notice, being aliens

624
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:12,339
from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope

625
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:18,820
and without God in the world. In the beginning, I read the whole passage because the reality

626
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:24,419
is that in verse number three, it says that, among whom also we all had our conversation

627
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:29,100
in time past, we were all in the same boat. We were all without hope. We were all without

628
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:37,220
Christ. You weren't born saved. Amen? God has no grandchildren. Amen? Why do we pray

629
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:41,619
that our kids in our junior church, in our Sunday school ministers, why do we pray that

630
00:32:41,619 --> 00:32:45,020
they get saved at a young age? Because just having a saved mom and dad doesn't make them

631
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:51,419
saved. Amen? My grandkids are 18 months old and two weeks old, and I've already prayed

632
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:56,059
for their salvation. Why? Because just because their parents are saved and their grandparents

633
00:32:56,059 --> 00:33:01,220
are saved and just because their grandfather's a preacher doesn't mean that they're going

634
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:15,020
to heaven. Amen? They need to be saved. He tells us in verse 13, but now. But now. Remember

635
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:23,580
in time past, verse 11, but in verse 13, but now, in Christ Jesus, those that have been

636
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:33,419
ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he, the Lord Jesus

637
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:39,180
Christ, for he is our peace, who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall

638
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:46,660
of partition between us, having abolished in his flesh, notice, the enmity, even the

639
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:52,580
law of commandments contained in ordinances, for to make in himself of twain one new man,

640
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:59,779
so making peace, and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having

641
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:10,900
slain the enmity thereby. He's provided the way, but he has given to us the ministry of

642
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:18,779
reconciliation. And when we understand the privilege of being an ambassador, and then

643
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:26,299
we understand the purpose of being an ambassador, the purpose is that we are, as he says in

644
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:35,299
verse number 20 of our text of Scripture, that we pray you in Christ's stead be ye reconciled

645
00:34:35,299 --> 00:34:46,260
to God. I'll be very transparent with you this morning. I do my best to help us. God

646
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:54,700
convicted me this week on this truth in verse 20, that we pray you in Christ's stead be

647
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:59,540
ye reconciled to God. You know why God convicted me this week? I know there are times that

648
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:05,700
all we might be able to do is hand a gospel tract to somebody at a grocery store, at a

649
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:10,339
whatever, it might be all that we can do, but can I tell you this, God convicted me,

650
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:16,899
that's not praying you in Christ's stead that you be reconciled to God. It's not really

651
00:35:16,899 --> 00:35:27,059
being an ambassador and pleading with someone. It really isn't. God convicted me this week.

652
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:32,580
I think we should give out gospel tracts. I think we should send out literature. We

653
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:37,839
have things. I've asked you to take them. We use door hangers. We have invitations.

654
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:46,239
We mail things at times, but God didn't call us to be marketing agents. Amen? He didn't

655
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:52,080
call us to be marketing agents. He said you're ambassadors. An ambassador is different than

656
00:35:52,080 --> 00:36:04,399
a marketing agent. An ambassador, we pray you, we beseech you, we beg you in Christ's

657
00:36:04,399 --> 00:36:10,320
stead, be ye reconciled to God. Why? Because I understand if they're not reconciled, they're

658
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,600
going to spend eternity in the lake of fire. And I understand that they're at enmity, they're

659
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:22,480
at variance, and God's given to us the opportunity, the privilege of going in and trying to bring

660
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:31,559
these two parties that are at variance. God did nothing wrong. Man sinned, and man needs

661
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:42,040
to be brought back, reconciled, and that's our ministry. That's our ministry. I wonder

662
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:51,760
when's the last time we wept over a soul. I wonder the last time we pled with someone

663
00:36:51,760 --> 00:37:01,519
to be saved. I wonder. I examine my own life. Do you have people right now that you're praying

664
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:06,760
for? I asked this question a few weeks ago, maybe a couple of months ago now. Time goes

665
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:15,720
so quickly. When's the last time you shared the gospel with someone personally? Not the

666
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,320
last time you gave somebody a gospel tract. I think it's good to give gospel tracts. When's

667
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:31,040
the last time you personally shared the gospel with someone personally? God beat me up this

668
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:42,040
week because we are His ambassadors. Man is at variance, at enmity with God, and the

669
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:48,559
only way for them to be reconciled is if those that are true ambassadors that have already

670
00:37:48,559 --> 00:38:01,440
been reconciled are engaged in the work, the ministry of reconciliation. The government

671
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:08,559
can't reconcile man to God. And by the way, God didn't give him that responsibility. God

672
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:15,320
instituted government, but God did not give government that responsibility. He gave it

673
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:26,160
to us. We are His ambassadors. And what a privilege that is ours to have that distinguished

674
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:40,679
title, but with it comes a purpose. We pray you, we pray you, plead with you, beg you,

675
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:50,440
beseech you, in Christ's stead, be reconciled to God. I've had someone ask me at various

676
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:57,400
times, I've had people ask this question, why do you care so much if I get saved? And

677
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:02,679
I've said this, listen, I'm going to heaven whether you get saved or not. I'm going to

678
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:09,400
heaven whether someone else gets saved or not, because I've been saved. But I want them

679
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:18,400
to go to heaven. Why? Because I know the alternative. And we've been reconciled and

680
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,599
we want others to be reconciled to God to have that peace and He's given to us this

681
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:34,080
ministry of reconciliation. Can I tell you, it's not passive, it's active. It's not passive,

682
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:43,280
it's active. Listen, it's got to be purposed, intentional. I told you about the stranger,

683
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:51,080
Marcel, that we drove with for six hours and 15 minutes from Nashville to Pensacola. If

684
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,880
you don't know the story, I'm not going to give it all to you right now because I don't

685
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,840
have time, but we were stranded in Nashville and we're going to have a 14-hour layover

686
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,479
and so we're going to rent a car and drive.

687
00:40:00,479 --> 00:40:06,879
fellow said, can I ride with you? And I said, sure. And Joseph was like, what in the world

688
00:40:06,879 --> 00:40:13,199
is going on? And Armando, I promise you, I promise you, it was as if the Holy Spirit

689
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:29,039
of God said that man needs to know the truth of the gospel. I sat in that car, and I'm

690
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:37,119
just going to be transparent with you. I didn't want to bring it up too early in case it was

691
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,199
super uncomfortable. You say, Pastor, that's kind of fleshly and carnal. I'm just being

692
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:50,959
honest with you. It was a six-hour drive. But I kept watching that GPS. When it got

693
00:40:50,959 --> 00:41:06,239
to about an hour, it's go time. How do we transition? It was purposed. I wish he got

694
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:16,039
saved. He didn't. Jeff brought up somebody in Sunday school a few weeks ago they got

695
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:20,759
to share the gospel with because of a circumstance. I've been praying for that lady by name.

696
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:30,599
He's followed up with her. The prophet of God in the Old Testament wept. Elisha wept.

697
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:37,719
Why? Because he knew the destruction that was going to come. God revealed it to him.

698
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:44,919
Paul wept. He served the Lord night and day with tears. So, what the Bible tells us in

699
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:59,279
Acts chapter 20? He's pleading with people to be reconciled to God. We know God has revealed

700
00:41:59,279 --> 00:42:11,559
to us the truth of eternity. There's a lot of dry eyes in 2025. I just wonder, do we

701
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:21,179
really truly understand what it is to be an ambassador? The privilege, the privilege

702
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:31,999
to be the representative of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords and the purpose. We pray

703
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:45,599
you in Christ's stead be reconciled to God. Let's pray. Father, we love you this morning.

704
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:56,519
Thank you for reconciling me. Thank you for saving my soul. God, I pray you would help

705
00:42:56,519 --> 00:43:08,719
us, help us to be good ambassadors, to recognize the privilege, the purpose. Would you move

706
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:15,319
and work in hearts and lives. If there's one here not sure of heaven, God, I pray they'd

707
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:22,319
be saved by the grace of God. For every child of God, would you help us this morning to

708
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:29,239
be stirred, to be changed. Pray that you'd have your will and way, for it's in Christ's

709
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:34,599
name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's going

710
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:39,319
to play quietly on the piano. As she does, the altar's open. If you're not sure of heaven,

711
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:43,319
we'll take a Bible and show you how to know for sure that heaven's your home. Maybe God

712
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:50,279
just convicted you this morning. We're going to have a heart, a passion for souls. We're

713
00:43:50,279 --> 00:43:52,879
going to be known as ambassadors. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
