WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.559
the message but it was on my heart and I hope that this morning all that thrills

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:14.880
your soul is Jesus. Aren't you thankful for the Lord Jesus Christ? Amen. Praise

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:23.959
the Lord. Where'd we be without Him? Hopeless, helpless, right? Praise the Lord.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:32.119
Jesus is the sweetest name I know. It truly is. You know when I hear the name Jesus it means

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:39.720
something. It means something. It brings to my mind who Jesus is. Not according to what the

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.000
world might say but according to what God's Word says, what He revealed to us. And I'm so thankful

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.479
to know the Lord Jesus Christ personally. Last week in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 we dealt with

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:54.599
verse number 17 and this week we're going to deal with verses 18 through 20. I've titled the

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:59.799
message We Are His Ambassadors. In Acts chapter 5 and verse 32, you don't need to turn there,

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:06.440
but the disciples declared we are His witnesses. What a great declaration for the disciples as

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.839
they're dealing with all sorts of persecution and resistance and they'd been facing various

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:18.919
levels of persecution up to that point and they're given threats from the religious leaders that are

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:24.120
to no longer speak in the name of Jesus. They're not to preach anymore in the name of Jesus and

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.919
they make this declaration. There are several declarations that they make but one of them is

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:36.680
we are His witnesses. We find that John would later say in 1 John chapter number 1 how that

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.639
he was an eyewitness and that he's given us this account and really this morning we can rejoice in

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:49.239
understanding that we are His witnesses. The apostle Paul as he's writing to the church in

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:54.599
Corinth here in the book of 2 Corinthians, we find that he's going to provide greater instruction in

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:59.720
the passage of scripture that we're going to study this morning with regard to the ministry that he

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.639
spoke of in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse number 1. If you note there in your Bible that

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:13.720
the apostle Paul says, therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.759
not and we find that in these few verses of scripture in 2 Corinthians 5 verses 18 through 20

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.440
Paul under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God is going to provide greater instruction and

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.919
information to us with regard to the ministry that he spoke of in 2 Corinthians chapter 4

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:35.880
in verse number 1. We find that in this text of scripture as I mentioned in Acts 5 in verse 32

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.440
that the disciples say we are his witnesses but we find here in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 that we see

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.000
a distinguished title given to those who are entrusted with this ministry that the apostle

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.399
Paul spoke of in 2 Corinthians 4 verse number 1. We have this ministry and that distinguished

00:02:55.399 --> 00:03:05.559
title that he gives to us is that of ambassador. Ambassador. What a title. What a description.

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:13.320
I believe that every word of God is pure. I believe that God chose his words with purpose and

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.600
I believe that as we look at this passage of scripture and see this word ambassador it is

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.520
communicating something extremely important to us this morning. I find that in the New Testament

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.559
that the word ambassador is only used twice in all of the New Testament. We find that the apostle

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:34.919
Paul as he's writing to the church in Ephesus in Ephesians chapter 6 in verse number 20

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:42.679
he refers to himself as being an ambassador in bonds and we understand the apostle Paul

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:47.639
as he would even say later to Timothy though he was bound the word of God is not bound and what

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:53.800
a blessing and the apostle Paul that while he was in prison he still recognized this distinguished

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.199
title that he was an ambassador though he had been in prison though he did not have the same

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:07.000
level of liberties that he once had he recognized that he was still an ambassador and as you study

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.479
through the New Testament you study the the truth of God's word you'll find that the apostle Paul

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:20.679
even while he was bound even while he faced times of imprisonment that he was actively sharing the

00:04:20.679 --> 00:04:26.679
gospel because he recognized that he was an ambassador for Christ and we find that there

00:04:26.679 --> 00:04:33.399
were people that got saved there were people that trusted Christ as their personal Lord and Savior

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:41.320
why because he was faithful to do the work that God had entrusted to him to fulfill we find that

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.959
as he's writing to the church in Philippi it's very interesting the church in Philippi how did

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:50.920
the church start what was the circumstances regarding the apostle Paul in Philippi well we

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.839
know that shortly after the the healing and what took place with that demonic possessed girl

00:04:56.839 --> 00:05:01.559
that we find that he's imprisoned Paul and Silas they're imprisoned in Philippi

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:11.640
they're singing and praising God but Paul you're in prison but God is good God has a plan

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:19.079
my life is his I'm in his hand he's singing praises and at midnight the Bible says

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:25.959
that God sent an earthquake and that jailer who is ready to kill himself supposing that all the

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:31.239
prisoners had escaped he he finds out Paul says we're all here do yourself no harm and he says

00:05:31.239 --> 00:05:38.839
sirs what must I do to be saved Paul later writing to the church at Philippi he would say to that

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:43.320
church that he did not want them to have this misunderstanding he didn't want them to have

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.880
be ignorant concerning the things that befell him he tells them this in the first chapter he

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.160
wanted them to understand that it happened for the furtherance of the gospel we find that as

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.959
you come to the end of chapter four of the book of Philippians that Paul begins to write the names

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:05.399
and those that were saved that were of the household of Caesar how they get saved

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:13.880
God who knows all things who do with all things well he allowed for the apostle Paul to be

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.839
imprisoned and he allowed for the apostle Paul to be in that place and to have those prison guards

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:23.000
and those of the household and and Paul got the opportunity to share the gospel with him he didn't

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.880
just have a pity party he didn't just say woe is me I mean it's not fair I was just preaching I was

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.839
just doing what God called me to do and I I'm gonna give up no he just kept doing what God

00:06:33.799 --> 00:06:41.480
called him to do and God blessed and here as we look at the apostle Paul making that statement

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:47.239
in Ephesians 6 that he was an ambassador in bonds we find that that's one use of the word but we

00:06:47.239 --> 00:06:53.559
find that here in our text that he says to the believers in Corinth and by way of application

00:06:53.559 --> 00:07:00.440
to us as well this morning that we are ambassadors for Christ note the passage with me beginning in

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:09.399
verse 18 the bible says this and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:18.679
Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that God was in Christ

00:07:18.679 --> 00:07:25.160
reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:34.679
unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did

00:07:34.679 --> 00:07:46.519
beseech you by us we pray you in God Christ dead be ye reconciled to God this morning as we think

00:07:46.519 --> 00:07:51.959
about this truth that we are his ambassadors I want you to consider first with me this morning

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:58.359
the privilege of being an ambassador it's a great privilege to be an ambassador sometimes I believe

00:07:58.359 --> 00:08:03.880
and I've been guilty of this in my own life in my own ministry sometimes we might focus more on the

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:10.679
responsibility side of things versus the privilege side of things the reality this morning we

00:08:10.679 --> 00:08:16.920
understand it is absolutely true that that we do have a responsibility but I hope this morning that

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:23.000
as we think about this this truth this this this this title that is given to us as being an

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.640
ambassador that we recognize the privilege to be appointed by the king of kings and lord of lords

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:38.039
to be his representative to be his ambassador what a joy we say this this world is not my home I'm

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:43.960
just a passing through my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blues what the songwriter

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:49.640
said we sing it the bible tells us in the book of hebrews in the 11th chapter that we're strangers

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:55.880
and pilgrims the reality is that sometimes if we're not careful brother mark we dealt you dealt

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.919
with this a little bit in sunday school this morning if we're not careful sometimes this

00:08:58.919 --> 00:09:05.400
world can almost be more like our home we treat it that way but this world is not my home I'm an

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:10.679
ambassador what is an ambassador it's representative it's a privilege in an appointed position

00:09:11.559 --> 00:09:18.520
we find that that the lord jesus christ he showed to us he gave us in this passage this

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.760
this understanding of the privilege it's necessary that we acknowledge this morning

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:28.440
the great privilege that is ours the honor that is ours to be an ambassador for the lord jesus

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:33.400
christ the one who is the king of kings the lord of lords the one who knows all things

00:09:34.359 --> 00:09:42.679
and he says to us that we are his ambassadors it's amazing paul would say as he's writing to

00:09:42.679 --> 00:09:48.280
the church in ephesus that our citizenship is in heaven our citizenship is in heaven it's

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:53.640
interesting of an ambassador an ambassador is one who represents a foreign country you think about

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:59.559
a u.s ambassador that's going to another country it is said uh that while george schultz was

00:09:59.559 --> 00:10:01.559
during the Reagan administration,

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:04.559
that he would meet with every newly appointed ambassador

00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:07.559
before he or she left for the new posting.

00:10:07.559 --> 00:10:08.559
As he would meet with them in his office,

00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:10.559
he kept this globe there in his office,

00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:13.559
and he would say, as he would bring in the individual,

00:10:13.559 --> 00:10:15.559
he'd bring up that globe, and he would say this,

00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:19.559
show me where your country is.

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:21.559
That's what he would say.

00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:23.559
And it says this, this was the account,

00:10:23.559 --> 00:10:24.559
that almost in every case,

00:10:24.559 --> 00:10:27.559
the new ambassador would spin the globe,

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:30.559
they would find the country in which they were appointed to

00:10:30.559 --> 00:10:33.559
or assigned to, and they would point to it.

00:10:33.559 --> 00:10:36.559
And Mr. Schultz would correct them.

00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:40.559
And he would point to America, and he would say this,

00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:43.559
this is your country.

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:44.559
Why?

00:10:44.559 --> 00:10:47.559
Because they had to understand they were representing the U.S.

00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:49.559
in whatever country they were going to.

00:10:49.559 --> 00:10:51.559
That was their purpose.

00:10:51.559 --> 00:10:52.559
Can I tell you this morning,

00:10:52.559 --> 00:10:54.559
we can't take a globe and point to heaven,

00:10:54.559 --> 00:10:56.559
but can I tell you if you're saved this morning,

00:10:56.559 --> 00:10:59.559
if you're a child of God, your citizenship is in heaven.

00:10:59.559 --> 00:11:01.559
This world is not my home.

00:11:01.559 --> 00:11:02.559
Amen?

00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:04.559
Listen, we're here for a purpose,

00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:06.559
and we're ambassadors.

00:11:06.559 --> 00:11:09.559
We're to represent the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:11:09.559 --> 00:11:13.559
It is a privilege that we have to be his ambassadors.

00:11:13.559 --> 00:11:16.559
In John chapter 20, turn there very quickly, if you will,

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:19.559
I want you to notice what Jesus says in John chapter 20.

00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:23.559
We understand that we could go to each of the Gospels,

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:26.559
Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.

00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:27.559
We could go to the book of Acts,

00:11:27.559 --> 00:11:29.559
and we could deal with the Great Commission this morning.

00:11:29.559 --> 00:11:32.559
But I want you to see the way in which Jesus says it

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:34.559
in John chapter 20.

00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:36.559
In John chapter 20, we find that the resurrection

00:11:36.559 --> 00:11:39.559
has already taken place, and Jesus is appearing.

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:41.559
It's the evening of the same day,

00:11:41.559 --> 00:11:43.559
according to verse number 19.

00:11:43.559 --> 00:11:44.559
He appears, and he says,

00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:46.559
Peace be unto you at the end of the verse.

00:11:46.559 --> 00:11:48.559
But I want you to notice that as he's there,

00:11:48.559 --> 00:11:49.559
in verse 20, it says,

00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:50.559
When he had so said,

00:11:50.559 --> 00:11:53.559
he showed unto them his hands and his side.

00:11:53.559 --> 00:11:55.559
Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord.

00:11:55.559 --> 00:11:58.559
Then said Jesus to them again,

00:11:58.559 --> 00:12:00.559
Peace be unto you.

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:02.559
And then notice what Jesus says,

00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:05.559
As my Father hath sent me,

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:08.559
even so send I you.

00:12:08.559 --> 00:12:12.559
I'm thankful that Jesus left the throne room of heaven

00:12:12.559 --> 00:12:14.559
to come to this sin-cursed world,

00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:16.559
to die in my place and in your place,

00:12:16.559 --> 00:12:17.559
to go to that old cross,

00:12:17.559 --> 00:12:19.559
to be buried in a borrowed tomb,

00:12:19.559 --> 00:12:22.559
to rise, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:12:22.559 --> 00:12:24.559
But I understand this morning that the resurrected Christ,

00:12:24.559 --> 00:12:26.559
that he now has ascended to heaven,

00:12:26.559 --> 00:12:28.559
he's on the right hand of the throne of God,

00:12:28.559 --> 00:12:30.559
and we find that what he's commissioned,

00:12:30.559 --> 00:12:32.559
he said, as I've been sent,

00:12:32.559 --> 00:12:35.559
now I'm sending you.

00:12:35.559 --> 00:12:37.559
We're his ambassadors.

00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:38.559
It's a privilege.

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:40.559
The apostle Paul says it this way

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:42.559
as he's talking to the church in Thessalonica.

00:12:42.559 --> 00:12:45.559
Notice, if you will, in 1 Thessalonians chapter 2.

00:12:45.559 --> 00:12:48.559
In 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:51.559
the Bible tells us that, of course,

00:12:51.559 --> 00:12:52.559
Paul had had the opportunity

00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:54.559
during the second missionary journey.

00:12:54.559 --> 00:12:56.559
You read Acts 17.

00:12:56.559 --> 00:12:59.559
You can see of the time in which he went to Thessalonica.

00:12:59.559 --> 00:13:01.559
But as he says this to this church,

00:13:01.559 --> 00:13:03.559
this group of believers,

00:13:03.559 --> 00:13:05.559
notice the perspective of the apostle Paul

00:13:05.559 --> 00:13:08.559
in 1 Thessalonians 2 and verse number 4.

00:13:08.559 --> 00:13:12.559
He says, but as we were allowed of God

00:13:12.559 --> 00:13:15.559
to be put in trust with the gospel,

00:13:15.559 --> 00:13:17.559
even so we speak,

00:13:17.559 --> 00:13:19.559
not as pleasing men, but God,

00:13:19.559 --> 00:13:22.559
which trieth our hearts.

00:13:22.559 --> 00:13:24.559
He says that we were allowed of God

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:26.559
to be in trust with the gospel.

00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:27.559
You think about the gospel,

00:13:27.559 --> 00:13:29.559
the death, burial, and glorious resurrection

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:31.559
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:33.559
I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ,

00:13:33.559 --> 00:13:35.559
for it is the power of God unto salvation

00:13:35.559 --> 00:13:37.559
to everyone that believeth,

00:13:37.559 --> 00:13:39.559
to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

00:13:39.559 --> 00:13:41.559
We read that in Romans chapter 1.

00:13:41.559 --> 00:13:43.559
And we find that the apostle Paul,

00:13:43.559 --> 00:13:46.559
as he's communicating to this church in Thessalonica,

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:49.559
he says, I want you to gain this perspective

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:53.559
that we have been allowed of God

00:13:53.559 --> 00:13:56.559
to be entrusted, to be put in trust

00:13:56.559 --> 00:13:58.559
with the gospel.

00:13:58.559 --> 00:14:00.559
This morning, do you recognize

00:14:00.559 --> 00:14:03.559
the privilege that is ours

00:14:03.559 --> 00:14:07.559
to be an ambassador of the Lord Jesus Christ?

00:14:07.559 --> 00:14:09.559
It's absolutely amazing.

00:14:09.559 --> 00:14:12.559
I believe this morning that it is appropriate

00:14:12.559 --> 00:14:14.559
and it's necessary at times that we focus

00:14:14.559 --> 00:14:18.559
and we deal with the responsibility that we have.

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:21.559
It's important we have missions conferences,

00:14:21.559 --> 00:14:23.559
we have missionaries that come in

00:14:23.559 --> 00:14:26.559
throughout the calendar year to stir us up

00:14:26.559 --> 00:14:29.559
and to speak to us about the responsibility

00:14:29.559 --> 00:14:31.559
to the desires to reach the world

00:14:31.559 --> 00:14:33.559
with the gospel.

00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:37.559
And what a task that God has given to us.

00:14:37.559 --> 00:14:40.559
Yes, we've been commanded.

00:14:40.559 --> 00:14:43.559
Yes, we have a responsibility.

00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:45.559
But I want you to look at it

00:14:45.559 --> 00:14:48.559
from a perspective of privilege.

00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:51.559
Not just duty.

00:14:51.559 --> 00:14:53.559
Not just duty.

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:55.559
But privilege.

00:14:55.559 --> 00:14:57.559
There's a privilege.

00:14:57.559 --> 00:14:59.559
To be able to sit down with someone

00:14:59.559 --> 00:15:01.559
and tell them about the one

00:15:01.559 --> 00:15:04.559
who loves them more than anyone else.

00:15:04.559 --> 00:15:07.559
The one, the only one,

00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:10.559
that can save them and change their lives.

00:15:10.559 --> 00:15:14.559
What a privilege that has been given to us.

00:15:14.559 --> 00:15:16.559
And we find that we recognize

00:15:16.559 --> 00:15:18.559
that it's been given to us

00:15:18.559 --> 00:15:21.559
for we find in our text in 2 Corinthians 5

00:15:21.559 --> 00:15:23.559
that the Bible says in verse 18,

00:15:23.559 --> 00:15:26.559
we spoke already in the past two weeks

00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:29.559
about verses 14 and 15

00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:31.559
and that he died for all in verse 15

00:15:31.559 --> 00:15:33.559
that they which live should not henceforth

00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:35.559
live unto themselves but unto him

00:15:35.559 --> 00:15:37.559
which died for them and rose again.

00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:39.559
We dealt with verse 17 last week.

00:15:39.559 --> 00:15:41.559
Therefore, if any man be in Christ,

00:15:41.559 --> 00:15:43.559
they're saved, they're born again.

00:15:43.559 --> 00:15:45.559
The Bible says that he's a new creature.

00:15:45.559 --> 00:15:46.559
Old things are passed away.

00:15:46.559 --> 00:15:48.559
Behold, all things are become new.

00:15:48.559 --> 00:15:50.559
But then we find in verse 18,

00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:52.559
the Bible says that all things are of God

00:15:52.559 --> 00:15:55.559
who hath reconciled us

00:15:55.559 --> 00:15:59.559
to himself by Jesus Christ

00:15:59.559 --> 00:16:00.559
and then notice,

00:16:00.559 --> 00:16:03.559
and hath given to us

00:16:03.559 --> 00:16:05.559
the ministry of reconciliation.

00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:08.559
He did not give this ministry of reconciliation

00:16:08.559 --> 00:16:10.559
to anyone other than those

00:16:10.559 --> 00:16:12.559
who have been reconciled.

00:16:12.559 --> 00:16:14.559
See, you have to be reconciled

00:16:14.559 --> 00:16:16.559
before you can be engaged in the work

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:20.559
and the ministry of reconciliation.

00:16:20.559 --> 00:16:22.559
The angels desire to look into it

00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:25.559
but they cannot be engaged

00:16:25.559 --> 00:16:27.559
in the ministry of reconciliation

00:16:27.559 --> 00:16:29.559
because they can't, they're not reconciled.

00:16:29.559 --> 00:16:31.559
They don't need to.

00:16:31.559 --> 00:16:34.559
But this morning, we think of this passage

00:16:34.559 --> 00:16:37.559
and the privilege that is ours.

00:16:37.559 --> 00:16:40.559
I'm so thankful to know the Lord Jesus Christ

00:16:40.559 --> 00:16:42.559
as my personal savior.

00:16:42.559 --> 00:16:45.559
The privilege of knowing him and serving him

00:16:45.559 --> 00:16:47.559
and knowing that he's given me.

00:16:47.559 --> 00:16:49.559
You know, it's amazing to begin to think

00:16:49.559 --> 00:16:51.559
about who we are in Christ.

00:16:51.559 --> 00:16:54.559
Who he is to us and who we are in him.

00:16:54.559 --> 00:16:56.559
We find that as many as receive him,

00:16:56.559 --> 00:16:58.559
to them gave he power to become

00:16:58.559 --> 00:16:59.559
the sons of God,

00:16:59.559 --> 00:17:01.559
even to them that believe on his name.

00:17:01.559 --> 00:17:03.559
We find in 1 John 3,

00:17:03.559 --> 00:17:04.559
John stands up and says,

00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:06.559
behold what manner of love the father

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:07.559
hath bestowed upon us

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:11.559
that we should be called the sons of God.

00:17:11.559 --> 00:17:13.559
Hallelujah.

00:17:13.559 --> 00:17:15.559
And he says we're his ambassadors.

00:17:15.559 --> 00:17:17.559
What a privilege.

00:17:17.559 --> 00:17:19.559
What a privilege this morning.

00:17:19.559 --> 00:17:21.559
We have gospel tracks out there.

00:17:21.559 --> 00:17:23.559
We have opportunities for outreach

00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:26.559
and ministry and try to reach people.

00:17:26.559 --> 00:17:27.559
Why?

00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:29.559
It's a privilege.

00:17:29.559 --> 00:17:30.559
Yes, it's a responsibility,

00:17:30.559 --> 00:17:31.559
but it's a privilege.

00:17:32.559 --> 00:17:36.559
It's a privilege to go

00:17:36.559 --> 00:17:38.559
as a representative, as an ambassador.

00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:40.559
I want you to understand not only the privilege,

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:42.559
but number two, the purpose.

00:17:42.559 --> 00:17:44.559
There's a purpose in being an ambassador

00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:45.559
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:17:45.559 --> 00:17:48.559
We understand the ambassadors

00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:50.559
that are sent from our nation to other nations

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:52.559
and we can see that physically

00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:54.559
and understand that application

00:17:54.559 --> 00:17:56.559
and see how they behave

00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:57.559
and what they're to do

00:17:57.559 --> 00:17:59.559
and what their purpose is.

00:17:59.559 --> 00:18:01.559
And they don't always fulfill it properly

00:18:01.559 --> 00:18:02.559
and appropriately and what have you,

00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:05.559
but the reality is they have a purpose.

00:18:05.559 --> 00:18:08.559
This morning, when we look at the text of Scripture,

00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:10.559
we understand that we too have a purpose.

00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:13.559
As he's given to us this distinguished title

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:15.559
that we are his ambassadors,

00:18:15.559 --> 00:18:17.559
we have a purpose.

00:18:17.559 --> 00:18:19.559
Notice with me in verse 18,

00:18:19.559 --> 00:18:21.559
the Bible says at the end of the verse,

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:24.559
and hath given to us

00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:26.559
the ministry of reconciliation.

00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:27.559
Verse 19,

00:18:27.559 --> 00:18:30.559
to wit that God was in Christ

00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:32.559
reconciling the world unto himself,

00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:35.559
not imputing their trespasses unto them.

00:18:35.559 --> 00:18:36.559
And then notice this phrase

00:18:36.559 --> 00:18:37.559
at the end of verse number 19,

00:18:37.559 --> 00:18:40.559
and hath committed unto us

00:18:40.559 --> 00:18:43.559
the word of reconciliation.

00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:45.559
Now then, verse 20,

00:18:45.559 --> 00:18:47.559
we are ambassadors for Christ.

00:18:47.559 --> 00:18:52.559
As though God did beseech you by us,

00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:56.559
we pray you in Christ's stead,

00:18:56.559 --> 00:19:01.559
be ye reconciled to God.

00:19:01.559 --> 00:19:04.559
Do you see the number of uses of the word reconcile

00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:06.559
or some form of the word reconcile

00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:07.559
in these verses of Scripture

00:19:07.559 --> 00:19:09.559
that we've read this morning?

00:19:09.559 --> 00:19:11.559
We see that the ministry,

00:19:11.559 --> 00:19:13.559
the purpose of being an ambassador

00:19:13.559 --> 00:19:15.559
is that he's given to us

00:19:15.559 --> 00:19:17.559
this work of reconciliation.

00:19:17.559 --> 00:19:19.559
Now here's the amazing thing.

00:19:19.559 --> 00:19:23.559
I can't personally reconcile anybody.

00:19:23.559 --> 00:19:25.559
But as an ambassador,

00:19:25.559 --> 00:19:29.559
I've been given the ministry of reconciliation.

00:19:29.559 --> 00:19:30.559
Notice with me,

00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:32.559
specifically in verse number 20,

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:36.559
he says now then we are ambassadors for Christ

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:40.559
as though God did beseech you by us.

00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:41.559
And so listen,

00:19:41.559 --> 00:19:43.559
the Bible tells us that God is not willing

00:19:43.559 --> 00:19:44.559
that any should perish,

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:47.559
but that all should come to repentance.

00:19:47.559 --> 00:19:48.559
Amen, is that what your Bible says?

00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:49.559
2 Peter 3.

00:19:49.559 --> 00:19:51.559
We could turn over there if we need to.

00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:53.559
We understand that's what he says.

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:55.559
In fact, as he's writing to Timothy,

00:19:55.559 --> 00:19:58.559
he says that he would have all men to be saved

00:19:58.559 --> 00:20:00.559
and come unto the kingdom of God.

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:02.779
the knowledge of truth.

00:20:02.779 --> 00:20:04.819
That's God's plan.

00:20:04.819 --> 00:20:07.779
Now we understand that not all mankind will be saved

00:20:07.779 --> 00:20:09.939
because we understand they will not be reconciled.

00:20:09.939 --> 00:20:11.299
There are many that reject him.

00:20:11.299 --> 00:20:13.699
He came to his own, his own received him not.

00:20:13.699 --> 00:20:15.539
Is that not what the Bible tells us?

00:20:15.539 --> 00:20:18.219
We find that there is a great white throne judgment

00:20:18.219 --> 00:20:20.179
in Revelation chapter 20,

00:20:20.179 --> 00:20:22.339
and there will be subjects that will stand

00:20:22.339 --> 00:20:24.019
at that great white throne judgment.

00:20:24.019 --> 00:20:25.099
Who are those people?

00:20:25.099 --> 00:20:27.579
Those that were not reconciled to God.

00:20:27.579 --> 00:20:30.099
Those that were never born again.

00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:33.719
But we understand this morning that God's heart

00:20:33.719 --> 00:20:38.559
and God's desire for God so loved the world.

00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:40.119
He loved the world.

00:20:40.119 --> 00:20:42.279
He is the propitiation for our sins,

00:20:42.279 --> 00:20:44.079
but not for our sins only,

00:20:44.079 --> 00:20:47.239
but also for the sins of the whole world.

00:20:48.159 --> 00:20:49.799
First John chapter two.

00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:54.599
And we find that it says as though God did beseech you

00:20:54.599 --> 00:20:57.839
by us, and then notice this, we pray you.

00:20:57.839 --> 00:20:59.119
It's an interesting word.

00:20:59.119 --> 00:21:00.959
Sometimes we look at the New Testament

00:21:00.959 --> 00:21:02.519
and there's obviously a number of Greek words

00:21:02.519 --> 00:21:05.159
and the English language is somewhat limited,

00:21:05.159 --> 00:21:08.439
but that word pray literally carries with it

00:21:08.439 --> 00:21:11.919
the idea of to beseech, to beg.

00:21:11.919 --> 00:21:15.639
In fact, the same Greek word that we see that's used

00:21:15.639 --> 00:21:18.379
for pray in this verse, in verse number 20,

00:21:18.379 --> 00:21:21.720
it's translated 12 times in our English Bible as pray,

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.279
but it's translated nine times

00:21:23.279 --> 00:21:25.759
in our English Bible as beseech.

00:21:26.759 --> 00:21:29.119
Think about this.

00:21:29.119 --> 00:21:31.799
The apostle Paul says, I beseech you

00:21:31.799 --> 00:21:33.000
in Romans chapter number 12.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:33.839
What's he saying?

00:21:33.839 --> 00:21:35.040
I'm pleading with you.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.360
I'm begging you.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:40.839
I've laid out the truth that I've laid out

00:21:40.839 --> 00:21:42.680
and now I'm begging you.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.239
I'm pleading with you.

00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:47.360
And begin to look at this truth this morning

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.559
and considering the purpose that we have

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:50.680
as being an ambassador.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.199
Yes, it's a great privilege, but we have a purpose.

00:21:53.199 --> 00:21:58.199
And it says that we pray you in Christ's stead.

00:21:59.159 --> 00:22:01.959
In other words, on his behalf, the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:22:01.959 --> 00:22:04.720
he's seated at the right hand of the throne of glory.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.639
We find that he has left us as his ambassadors

00:22:08.639 --> 00:22:10.679
and so we're his representatives.

00:22:10.679 --> 00:22:15.199
We're going out on his behalf and we have a purpose.

00:22:15.199 --> 00:22:19.080
The purpose that we have is not to feed the hungry.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.839
The purpose that we have is not to build.

00:22:21.839 --> 00:22:24.199
I'm not saying there's anything wrong with those things.

00:22:24.199 --> 00:22:29.199
I'm simply saying that if we only do those things,

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.679
we've fallen short of what our true purpose is.

00:22:33.839 --> 00:22:36.479
Because our true purpose is to bring,

00:22:36.479 --> 00:22:38.880
to do the work of reconciliation.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.919
Notice what he says.

00:22:39.919 --> 00:22:44.919
We pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.

00:22:45.599 --> 00:22:50.599
Why is it that man needs reconciliation?

00:22:52.039 --> 00:22:54.039
What is it that reconciliation means?

00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:56.039
It means the act of reconciling parties,

00:22:56.039 --> 00:22:58.440
notice this, at variance.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.080
Why are they at variance?

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.479
Why does the Bible say that he's given to us

00:23:02.479 --> 00:23:04.440
the ministry of reconciliation?

00:23:05.279 --> 00:23:06.279
It's because of sin.

00:23:07.199 --> 00:23:11.080
See, God didn't do anything wrong, but humanity did.

00:23:12.279 --> 00:23:14.520
Sin entered into the world in the garden.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.720
And death passed upon all men.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.720
Amen?

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.559
We're all sinners for all have sinned

00:23:20.559 --> 00:23:22.319
and come short of the glory of God.

00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:25.440
We're all sinners.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.239
And therefore, every sinner needs reconciliation.

00:23:29.239 --> 00:23:30.080
Why?

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.919
He's at enmity.

00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:35.679
He's at variance with God.

00:23:35.679 --> 00:23:39.319
God has done everything necessary

00:23:39.319 --> 00:23:42.399
to provide for reconciliation.

00:23:42.399 --> 00:23:46.080
There's nothing that any of us can do to add to it.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:51.080
It would show the fact that his offering was not sufficient.

00:23:52.759 --> 00:23:54.160
He did it all.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.440
He did it all.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.360
But he's entrusted to us the ministry of reconciliation.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.880
See, you know there's a lot of people

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:05.000
that we come in contact with on a daily basis

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.279
that do not know that they need to be reconciled to God.

00:24:10.279 --> 00:24:11.839
They don't know it.

00:24:12.199 --> 00:24:13.479
They have no idea.

00:24:13.479 --> 00:24:16.160
Oh, they might admit that they're a sinner,

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.679
but they may have been in a position

00:24:18.679 --> 00:24:21.399
where they've been taught some false thoughts

00:24:21.399 --> 00:24:25.160
with regard to salvation and how to approach God.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.959
And I've heard many people over the years say,

00:24:28.959 --> 00:24:30.639
especially in their later years,

00:24:30.639 --> 00:24:32.880
I've made my peace with God.

00:24:35.119 --> 00:24:37.559
And I've often wondered and I've often asked the question,

00:24:37.559 --> 00:24:39.519
what do you mean by that?

00:24:39.519 --> 00:24:41.119
Because the Bible tells us there's only one way

00:24:41.119 --> 00:24:42.440
to have peace with God.

00:24:43.679 --> 00:24:46.359
The Bible is very clear with regard

00:24:46.359 --> 00:24:48.720
to this ministry of reconciliation.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.760
And we find that mankind is in need of reconciliation.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.279
And God has entrusted to us as his ambassadors,

00:24:56.279 --> 00:24:59.839
as his representatives, this great privileged title,

00:24:59.839 --> 00:25:03.000
this distinguished title, the privilege and honor

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.480
that I can represent the Lord Jesus Christ here on earth,

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.519
but I have a purpose.

00:25:09.519 --> 00:25:11.839
And it's the ministry of reconciliation.

00:25:11.839 --> 00:25:13.279
Turn to the book of Romans, if you will.

00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:15.279
We're gonna look at a few verses of scripture

00:25:15.279 --> 00:25:19.040
and kind of hammer in this ministry of reconciliation

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:23.079
and what this really looks like and what we must deal with

00:25:23.079 --> 00:25:26.839
as we consider the purpose that God has given to us.

00:25:26.839 --> 00:25:29.880
In Romans chapter five, beginning in verse number six,

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.200
notice what the Bible says.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.320
Romans five and verse number six.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.519
For when we were yet without strength,

00:25:37.519 --> 00:25:41.639
in due time, Christ died for the ungodly.

00:25:41.639 --> 00:25:44.239
For scarcely for a righteous man will one die,

00:25:44.239 --> 00:25:46.119
yet peradventure for a good man,

00:25:46.119 --> 00:25:48.320
some would even dare to die,

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.320
but God commendeth his love toward us.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:56.000
And that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:56.839
You know why he died for you?

00:25:56.839 --> 00:25:58.799
Because you're a sinner.

00:25:58.799 --> 00:26:01.279
You needed a substitute.

00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:03.480
And he died for us because he loves us.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.359
This is the payment that was made

00:26:05.359 --> 00:26:07.519
so that the two parties that were at variance

00:26:07.519 --> 00:26:10.000
could be brought to peace.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.320
It tells us in verse number nine,

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.639
much more than being now justified, how?

00:26:15.639 --> 00:26:17.119
By your works?

00:26:17.119 --> 00:26:19.239
No, by his blood.

00:26:19.239 --> 00:26:20.559
Amen.

00:26:20.559 --> 00:26:21.600
Is that what it says?

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.040
How are you gonna be justified?

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.000
There's only one way to be justified.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.359
Only one way to be reconciled.

00:26:27.359 --> 00:26:28.639
Only one way to be saved.

00:26:28.639 --> 00:26:30.679
Jesus is the only way.

00:26:30.679 --> 00:26:32.959
Justified by his blood,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.279
we shall be saved from wrath through him.

00:26:36.279 --> 00:26:37.519
Notice in verse 10,

00:26:37.519 --> 00:26:40.519
for if when we were enemies,

00:26:40.519 --> 00:26:42.279
we were, what does it say?

00:26:42.279 --> 00:26:43.239
Reconciled.

00:26:43.239 --> 00:26:44.760
Listen, I know sometimes we wanna,

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.000
I wasn't really an enemy of God.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.600
You were an enemy of God.

00:26:48.799 --> 00:26:50.359
God wasn't your enemy.

00:26:50.359 --> 00:26:52.040
God wants you to be saved.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.799
But we, in our rebellion, in our sin,

00:26:54.799 --> 00:26:57.079
we were at enmity with God.

00:26:57.079 --> 00:26:59.079
We were at variance.

00:26:59.919 --> 00:27:02.639
And we needed to be reconciled.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.559
And he says, for when we were enemies,

00:27:05.559 --> 00:27:08.040
we were reconciled to God, how?

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.239
By the death of his son.

00:27:10.239 --> 00:27:12.239
Much more, being reconciled,

00:27:12.239 --> 00:27:14.760
we shall be saved by his life.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.639
Hallelujah.

00:27:15.639 --> 00:27:17.000
Verse 11, and not only so,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.839
but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:27:20.839 --> 00:27:25.559
by whom we have now received the atonement.

00:27:25.559 --> 00:27:27.880
Man, it's good to be reconciled.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.639
It is absolutely necessary to be reconciled.

00:27:30.639 --> 00:27:31.720
Amen?

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.000
If you're not saved this morning,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.320
if you've not been reconciled,

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.279
if you're still at variance,

00:27:36.279 --> 00:27:38.639
you've never accepted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:27:38.639 --> 00:27:39.880
as your personal savior.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.519
Listen, chapter number six

00:27:41.519 --> 00:27:42.559
of the book of 2 Corinthians,

00:27:42.559 --> 00:27:45.000
today is the day of salvation.

00:27:46.119 --> 00:27:48.279
We plead with you, we pray,

00:27:48.279 --> 00:27:50.399
we beseech you in Christ's name,

00:27:50.399 --> 00:27:53.040
be reconciled to God.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.559
You need to be reconciled,

00:27:55.559 --> 00:27:56.880
because you're at variance.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.279
Notice in verse number one of this passage,

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:00.480
I didn't read it to start out.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.760
I read verses six through 11,

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.679
but notice verse number one,

00:28:04.679 --> 00:28:06.679
therefore being justified,

00:28:06.679 --> 00:28:07.959
we read of that in verse number nine,

00:28:07.959 --> 00:28:10.279
by his blood, notice by faith,

00:28:10.279 --> 00:28:13.279
we have peace with God

00:28:13.279 --> 00:28:15.679
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:28:15.679 --> 00:28:17.760
He's my peace.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.239
I have peace with God.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.119
Does it mean I'm perfect?

00:28:21.119 --> 00:28:22.519
No, but he is.

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.880
He is.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.440
The next verse in 2 Corinthians chapter five

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.480
that we'll study, probably not next Sunday,

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.559
but the following Sunday,

00:28:30.559 --> 00:28:32.079
for he hath made him to be sin for us

00:28:32.079 --> 00:28:33.559
who knew no sin, that we might be made

00:28:33.559 --> 00:28:35.479
the righteousness of God in him.

00:28:35.479 --> 00:28:36.400
Hallelujah.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.239
It's that imputed righteousness.

00:28:39.239 --> 00:28:41.239
It's not my own righteousness.

00:28:41.239 --> 00:28:44.279
All of my own righteousness is in filthy rags.

00:28:45.119 --> 00:28:46.919
It's his righteousness.

00:28:48.239 --> 00:28:50.719
And I have peace with God.

00:28:50.719 --> 00:28:51.640
If you're saved this morning,

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.479
if you've been reconciled,

00:28:52.479 --> 00:28:54.840
you have peace with God.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.039
Ephesians chapter two,

00:28:56.039 --> 00:28:57.239
notice what the Bible says here

00:28:57.239 --> 00:28:58.799
in Ephesians chapter two,

00:28:58.799 --> 00:29:01.559
as we think about this truth of reconciliation.

00:29:01.559 --> 00:29:02.599
In fact, I wish we could,

00:29:02.599 --> 00:29:03.440
we actually will.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.400
We're gonna back up and start reading

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.039
in verse number one.

00:29:06.039 --> 00:29:08.440
It's just so important to see all of this this morning.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.320
I'll do my best not to make many comments

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.880
and just let God's word speak for itself here this morning.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.080
In verse number one,

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:17.599
the Bible says,

00:29:17.599 --> 00:29:19.039
and you hath he quickened

00:29:19.039 --> 00:29:21.000
who were dead in trespasses and sins.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.760
I was dead spiritually,

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.840
but he made me alive.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.000
I was born again.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.640
We talked about that last week.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.440
Verse two, wherein in time past,

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.760
you walked according to the course of this world,

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:32.679
according to the prince,

00:29:32.679 --> 00:29:33.679
the power of the air,

00:29:33.679 --> 00:29:34.960
the spirit that now worketh

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.440
in the children of disobedience,

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.880
among whom also we all had our conversation in times past

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.039
in the lust of our flesh,

00:29:42.039 --> 00:29:43.919
fulfilling the desires of the flesh

00:29:44.799 --> 00:29:45.719
and of the mind,

00:29:45.719 --> 00:29:47.599
and were by nature the children of wrath,

00:29:47.599 --> 00:29:48.719
even as others.

00:29:48.719 --> 00:29:51.320
But God, aren't you thankful for the but God?

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.239
But God who is rich in mercy for his great love,

00:29:56.279 --> 00:29:58.200
wherewith he loved us,

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.440
even when we were dead in sin.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:05.700
hath quickened us together with Christ, by grace ye are saved, and hath raised us

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:09.980
up together and made us to sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:14.340
the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:19.780
kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. For by grace are you saved through faith,

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:23.960
and that not of yourselves, but of the gift of God, not of works, lest any man

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:29.540
should boast. For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works,

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:36.220
which God hath before ordained, that we should walk in them. Notice verse 11.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:45.940
Wherefore remember, remember, remember what? That ye, being in time past Gentiles in

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:51.100
the flesh, who are called on circumcision by that which is called the circumcision,

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:58.660
in the flesh made by hands, that at that time, notice what it says, ye were without

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:06.380
Christ. Can you remember that? Can you remember in your life when you were

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:13.060
without Christ? I'm saying before you got saved. See, because being saved is not a

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:19.819
process, it's a moment, it's the miracle of a moment. You must be born again, and I

00:31:19.819 --> 00:31:26.819
remember in time past. I remember when I was without Christ. I remember having no

00:31:26.819 --> 00:31:33.779
hope. I remember having no peace. I remember having no real joy, because I was without

00:31:33.779 --> 00:31:39.060
Christ. I remember that. By the way, it's a good thing for us every once in a while

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:47.100
to remember what he did for us, where we were headed. A songwriter, I haven't heard the

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:51.740
song for years, but he said, speaking of his life, when he was prior to being saved, he

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:57.540
was on a road heading to nowhere. Now, the reality is that he was heading to the lake

00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:06.060
of fire. This morning, we find that he says, you were without Christ, notice, being aliens

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:12.339
from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope

00:32:12.339 --> 00:32:18.820
and without God in the world. In the beginning, I read the whole passage because the reality

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:24.419
is that in verse number three, it says that, among whom also we all had our conversation

00:32:24.419 --> 00:32:29.100
in time past, we were all in the same boat. We were all without hope. We were all without

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:37.220
Christ. You weren't born saved. Amen? God has no grandchildren. Amen? Why do we pray

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:41.619
that our kids in our junior church, in our Sunday school ministers, why do we pray that

00:32:41.619 --> 00:32:45.020
they get saved at a young age? Because just having a saved mom and dad doesn't make them

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:51.419
saved. Amen? My grandkids are 18 months old and two weeks old, and I've already prayed

00:32:51.419 --> 00:32:56.059
for their salvation. Why? Because just because their parents are saved and their grandparents

00:32:56.059 --> 00:33:01.220
are saved and just because their grandfather's a preacher doesn't mean that they're going

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:15.020
to heaven. Amen? They need to be saved. He tells us in verse 13, but now. But now. Remember

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:23.580
in time past, verse 11, but in verse 13, but now, in Christ Jesus, those that have been

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:33.419
ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he, the Lord Jesus

00:33:33.419 --> 00:33:39.180
Christ, for he is our peace, who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:46.660
of partition between us, having abolished in his flesh, notice, the enmity, even the

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:52.580
law of commandments contained in ordinances, for to make in himself of twain one new man,

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:59.779
so making peace, and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having

00:33:59.779 --> 00:34:10.900
slain the enmity thereby. He's provided the way, but he has given to us the ministry of

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:18.779
reconciliation. And when we understand the privilege of being an ambassador, and then

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:26.299
we understand the purpose of being an ambassador, the purpose is that we are, as he says in

00:34:26.299 --> 00:34:35.299
verse number 20 of our text of Scripture, that we pray you in Christ's stead be ye reconciled

00:34:35.299 --> 00:34:46.260
to God. I'll be very transparent with you this morning. I do my best to help us. God

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:54.700
convicted me this week on this truth in verse 20, that we pray you in Christ's stead be

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:59.540
ye reconciled to God. You know why God convicted me this week? I know there are times that

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:05.700
all we might be able to do is hand a gospel tract to somebody at a grocery store, at a

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:10.339
whatever, it might be all that we can do, but can I tell you this, God convicted me,

00:35:10.339 --> 00:35:16.899
that's not praying you in Christ's stead that you be reconciled to God. It's not really

00:35:16.899 --> 00:35:27.059
being an ambassador and pleading with someone. It really isn't. God convicted me this week.

00:35:27.059 --> 00:35:32.580
I think we should give out gospel tracts. I think we should send out literature. We

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:37.839
have things. I've asked you to take them. We use door hangers. We have invitations.

00:35:37.839 --> 00:35:46.239
We mail things at times, but God didn't call us to be marketing agents. Amen? He didn't

00:35:46.239 --> 00:35:52.080
call us to be marketing agents. He said you're ambassadors. An ambassador is different than

00:35:52.080 --> 00:36:04.399
a marketing agent. An ambassador, we pray you, we beseech you, we beg you in Christ's

00:36:04.399 --> 00:36:10.320
stead, be ye reconciled to God. Why? Because I understand if they're not reconciled, they're

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:15.600
going to spend eternity in the lake of fire. And I understand that they're at enmity, they're

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:22.480
at variance, and God's given to us the opportunity, the privilege of going in and trying to bring

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:31.559
these two parties that are at variance. God did nothing wrong. Man sinned, and man needs

00:36:31.559 --> 00:36:42.040
to be brought back, reconciled, and that's our ministry. That's our ministry. I wonder

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:51.760
when's the last time we wept over a soul. I wonder the last time we pled with someone

00:36:51.760 --> 00:37:01.519
to be saved. I wonder. I examine my own life. Do you have people right now that you're praying

00:37:01.519 --> 00:37:06.760
for? I asked this question a few weeks ago, maybe a couple of months ago now. Time goes

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:15.720
so quickly. When's the last time you shared the gospel with someone personally? Not the

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:20.320
last time you gave somebody a gospel tract. I think it's good to give gospel tracts. When's

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:31.040
the last time you personally shared the gospel with someone personally? God beat me up this

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:42.040
week because we are His ambassadors. Man is at variance, at enmity with God, and the

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:48.559
only way for them to be reconciled is if those that are true ambassadors that have already

00:37:48.559 --> 00:38:01.440
been reconciled are engaged in the work, the ministry of reconciliation. The government

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:08.559
can't reconcile man to God. And by the way, God didn't give him that responsibility. God

00:38:08.559 --> 00:38:15.320
instituted government, but God did not give government that responsibility. He gave it

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:26.160
to us. We are His ambassadors. And what a privilege that is ours to have that distinguished

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:40.679
title, but with it comes a purpose. We pray you, we pray you, plead with you, beg you,

00:38:40.679 --> 00:38:50.440
beseech you, in Christ's stead, be reconciled to God. I've had someone ask me at various

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:57.400
times, I've had people ask this question, why do you care so much if I get saved? And

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:02.679
I've said this, listen, I'm going to heaven whether you get saved or not. I'm going to

00:39:02.679 --> 00:39:09.400
heaven whether someone else gets saved or not, because I've been saved. But I want them

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:18.400
to go to heaven. Why? Because I know the alternative. And we've been reconciled and

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:23.599
we want others to be reconciled to God to have that peace and He's given to us this

00:39:23.599 --> 00:39:34.080
ministry of reconciliation. Can I tell you, it's not passive, it's active. It's not passive,

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:43.280
it's active. Listen, it's got to be purposed, intentional. I told you about the stranger,

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:51.080
Marcel, that we drove with for six hours and 15 minutes from Nashville to Pensacola. If

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.880
you don't know the story, I'm not going to give it all to you right now because I don't

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:58.840
have time, but we were stranded in Nashville and we're going to have a 14-hour layover

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.479
and so we're going to rent a car and drive.

00:40:00.479 --> 00:40:06.879
fellow said, can I ride with you? And I said, sure. And Joseph was like, what in the world

00:40:06.879 --> 00:40:13.199
is going on? And Armando, I promise you, I promise you, it was as if the Holy Spirit

00:40:13.199 --> 00:40:29.039
of God said that man needs to know the truth of the gospel. I sat in that car, and I'm

00:40:29.039 --> 00:40:37.119
just going to be transparent with you. I didn't want to bring it up too early in case it was

00:40:37.119 --> 00:40:41.199
super uncomfortable. You say, Pastor, that's kind of fleshly and carnal. I'm just being

00:40:41.199 --> 00:40:50.959
honest with you. It was a six-hour drive. But I kept watching that GPS. When it got

00:40:50.959 --> 00:41:06.239
to about an hour, it's go time. How do we transition? It was purposed. I wish he got

00:41:06.239 --> 00:41:16.039
saved. He didn't. Jeff brought up somebody in Sunday school a few weeks ago they got

00:41:16.039 --> 00:41:20.759
to share the gospel with because of a circumstance. I've been praying for that lady by name.

00:41:21.519 --> 00:41:30.599
He's followed up with her. The prophet of God in the Old Testament wept. Elisha wept.

00:41:30.599 --> 00:41:37.719
Why? Because he knew the destruction that was going to come. God revealed it to him.

00:41:37.719 --> 00:41:44.919
Paul wept. He served the Lord night and day with tears. So, what the Bible tells us in

00:41:44.919 --> 00:41:59.279
Acts chapter 20? He's pleading with people to be reconciled to God. We know God has revealed

00:41:59.279 --> 00:42:11.559
to us the truth of eternity. There's a lot of dry eyes in 2025. I just wonder, do we

00:42:11.559 --> 00:42:21.179
really truly understand what it is to be an ambassador? The privilege, the privilege

00:42:21.179 --> 00:42:31.999
to be the representative of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords and the purpose. We pray

00:42:31.999 --> 00:42:45.599
you in Christ's stead be reconciled to God. Let's pray. Father, we love you this morning.

00:42:45.599 --> 00:42:56.519
Thank you for reconciling me. Thank you for saving my soul. God, I pray you would help

00:42:56.519 --> 00:43:08.719
us, help us to be good ambassadors, to recognize the privilege, the purpose. Would you move

00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:15.319
and work in hearts and lives. If there's one here not sure of heaven, God, I pray they'd

00:43:15.319 --> 00:43:22.319
be saved by the grace of God. For every child of God, would you help us this morning to

00:43:22.319 --> 00:43:29.239
be stirred, to be changed. Pray that you'd have your will and way, for it's in Christ's

00:43:29.239 --> 00:43:34.599
name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's going

00:43:34.599 --> 00:43:39.319
to play quietly on the piano. As she does, the altar's open. If you're not sure of heaven,

00:43:39.319 --> 00:43:43.319
we'll take a Bible and show you how to know for sure that heaven's your home. Maybe God

00:43:43.319 --> 00:43:50.279
just convicted you this morning. We're going to have a heart, a passion for souls. We're

00:43:50.279 --> 00:43:52.879
going to be known as ambassadors. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
