1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,359
9, verses 15-28.

2
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:04,619
Really, as we look at the passage of Scripture,

3
00:00:04,619 --> 00:00:07,019
I'll begin reading in v. 15.

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:10,600
We understand that part of the thought

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,260
that we finished last week's message with

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,319
is a continuation into this week.

7
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:17,139
And so, we'll mention several things

8
00:00:17,139 --> 00:00:18,280
by way of introduction.

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,079
But look at v. 15.

10
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:20,840
The Bible says,

11
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,180
"...and for this cause He,"

12
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,780
speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ,

13
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,079
God in flesh,

14
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,860
"...He is the mediator of the New Testament,

15
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,500
that by means of death,

16
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,840
for the redemption of the transgressions

17
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,439
that were under the first testament,

18
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,459
they which are called might receive

19
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:42,060
the promise of eternal inheritance.

20
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,900
For where a testament is,"

21
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,459
notice v. 16,

22
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:48,740
"...there must also of necessity

23
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,979
be the death of the testator.

24
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:55,259
For a testament is of force after men are dead,

25
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:58,659
but otherwise it is of no strength at all

26
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,319
while the testator liveth."

27
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:03,159
We look at this passage of Scripture.

28
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:06,260
We'll actually go through the end of chapter 9 this morning.

29
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,199
I've simply entitled the message there

30
00:01:08,199 --> 00:01:09,580
from v. 16-17,

31
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,519
The Death of the Testator.

32
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,919
And you look at the passage of Scripture

33
00:01:13,919 --> 00:01:16,059
and you understand the entirety

34
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:18,099
of what we're dealing with in the book of Hebrews

35
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:20,879
and the main thought and the subject matter

36
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,860
and how the writer exalts the Lord Jesus Christ

37
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,339
and proves His superiority.

38
00:01:27,339 --> 00:01:29,400
And what a joy to understand

39
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,959
how these original recipients of this book

40
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,559
that is titled Hebrews,

41
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:36,559
and we are mindful of that

42
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:37,919
which they were dealing with

43
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:39,379
and the immense pressure

44
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:41,180
to return to Judaism

45
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,680
coupled with the fact that they were living

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,080
under intensified persecution

47
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,040
at the hand of Nero.

48
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,940
And you think about those two factors

49
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,160
and you think about all that they were dealing with

50
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,959
and how the content of this book,

51
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,180
the book of Hebrews,

52
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,080
would provide them with encouragement.

53
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,639
It would provide them with instruction.

54
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:04,540
And we find this morning in 2020,

55
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,660
a couple thousand years almost

56
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,979
since the original writing of this book,

57
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,360
we find that still today,

58
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,119
the people of God are in need of encouragement.

59
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:19,160
We're in need of instruction.

60
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,580
And we find that the content of this book

61
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,759
will help us in our daily walk with God.

62
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,440
It will remind us over and over

63
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,899
as we read the book of Hebrews,

64
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,320
as we study the book of Hebrews,

65
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,520
that Jesus is superior.

66
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,160
He is better.

67
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,199
There's nothing better than you're ever going to get.

68
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,080
Amen?

69
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,119
There's no other world system.

70
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:45,279
There's no other religious system.

71
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:47,580
There's no other thing

72
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,220
that is better than Jesus.

73
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,199
The reality, however,

74
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:55,020
is that we have an enemy

75
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,020
that is seeking to devour and destroy.

76
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,240
We have an enemy that seeks to say to you

77
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,940
and to say to me

78
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,240
that this is better.

79
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,199
Is it true?

80
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:11,720
He walketh about seeking whom He may devour.

81
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,679
And He says this is better.

82
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:16,259
And we say, no, we have Jesus.

83
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:20,440
Nothing is better than Jesus.

84
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,520
No thing that the world can offer you

85
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,360
is better than Jesus.

86
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,559
No promotion, no person, no popularity.

87
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:35,380
Nothing is better than Jesus.

88
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,639
Not only does the passage of Scripture tell us

89
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,520
as we study the book of Hebrews as a whole

90
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,199
that Jesus is superior,

91
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,139
but we find that after spending

92
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:47,580
and laboring through 11 chapters

93
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,779
and really the first 10,

94
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:50,259
we know that in chapter 11,

95
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:52,179
dealing with the example of those

96
00:03:52,179 --> 00:03:53,699
that lived by faith,

97
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:56,339
we come and we find that the writer says

98
00:03:56,339 --> 00:03:59,500
because Jesus is so much better,

99
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,179
because He is superior,

100
00:04:01,179 --> 00:04:03,880
look to Him.

101
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,580
Looking unto Jesus.

102
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,979
Our theme for this year

103
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:08,740
from Hebrews 12.

104
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,179
And we understand the truth of looking to Him.

105
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,839
And can I tell you that as we gaze upon our Savior,

106
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,880
as we fix our eyes upon our Savior,

107
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,799
that the things of this world

108
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,200
will grow strangely dim.

109
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,000
The songwriter penned those words.

110
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,079
Run your race.

111
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:31,459
The truth from the book of Hebrews.

112
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:35,359
Listen, he didn't say the race was going to be easy.

113
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:38,920
He didn't say there would be no obstacles

114
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,119
or hindrances.

115
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,859
Difficulties along the way.

116
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:45,940
But he said run your race when or how

117
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,619
as you're looking to your Savior.

118
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:51,100
And understanding that He will give you

119
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,179
what you need to run that race.

120
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:56,820
Paul said that there was an open door.

121
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,820
Great and effectual.

122
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,619
But there were many adversaries.

123
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:05,140
We read throughout the passages

124
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,260
of the Old Testament,

125
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,540
we see how that as the work of God

126
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,420
would go forward in the book of Ezra

127
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,480
and Nehemiah,

128
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,239
you find that they were constantly

129
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:17,600
met with opposition.

130
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,440
I believe that as we look at Hebrews,

131
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,519
we are reminded that heaven is real.

132
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,839
Heaven is real.

133
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,040
This world is not my home.

134
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,679
I'm just a passing through.

135
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,239
We're looking for a better city.

136
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,239
Heavenly.

137
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:32,239
Amen?

138
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,559
And as we come to look at the text

139
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:36,799
of Hebrews as a whole, as a book,

140
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:41,019
we are reminded of those great truths of Scripture.

141
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:43,500
And we continue in this 9th chapter

142
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,100
and we find that here as we're going

143
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,459
through this process and the reality

144
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:49,739
this morning as we get in really

145
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:50,739
to the beginning of the message

146
00:05:50,739 --> 00:05:54,459
is that we find that for us today,

147
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:56,380
that we look at the cross

148
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,100
as being something wonderful.

149
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,540
Because we understand that it was there

150
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,019
at the cross that my Savior bled and died.

151
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:06,540
It was there at the cross that He did

152
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:10,880
that which He had come to this earth to do.

153
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,440
But you understand for the Jewish people

154
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,359
at the original time of this writing,

155
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:16,119
in fact, many times even still today

156
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:18,359
as we see in the book of 1 Corinthians,

157
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:22,279
that the cross is a stumbling block.

158
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:25,239
They ask this question immediately

159
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:28,839
following the timing of the life and death

160
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,399
and of course the resurrection

161
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,519
and the ascension of Christ

162
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,079
and all that's moving forward

163
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,440
with the early church

164
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,640
and all that's taking place

165
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,739
and you find that there are many

166
00:06:37,739 --> 00:06:41,980
that would say, why did He have to die?

167
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,299
The death of Christ really kind of

168
00:06:44,299 --> 00:06:47,820
adversely affected many that were Jews.

169
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,500
Why? Because they were looking for a Messiah

170
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,179
who was going to set up a kingdom,

171
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:52,660
who was going to deal with the Romans,

172
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,059
who was going to do all of those things

173
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:57,500
and they missed the fact that the Old Testament

174
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,820
had consistently given the truth,

175
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,739
the picture, the typology

176
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,000
that the Messiah would die

177
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,160
for the sins of the world.

178
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,320
And so as we look at this passage of Scripture,

179
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,519
we find that as the writer is kind of again

180
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,160
peeling back another peel of the onion

181
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,959
and providing another glimpse

182
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:22,679
into the understanding that He's better.

183
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:24,959
Why? He's a better priest

184
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,959
and He served in a better place, right?

185
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,839
The sanctuary in heaven.

186
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,600
That true tabernacle.

187
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,600
He presented a better offering.

188
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,579
It was His own blood.

189
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:39,079
And we find that He gave us through that

190
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:41,299
a better gift.

191
00:07:41,299 --> 00:07:42,700
And as we look at the truth

192
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,940
of what the passage that we're dealing with

193
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,540
in Hebrews 9 is dealing with,

194
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,579
we come and we notice first of all,

195
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:50,640
if you're taking notes,

196
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,899
it's the bulk of the section

197
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:53,100
in which we'll be dealing with.

198
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,380
In fact, as I mentioned,

199
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,820
that really the latter part of last week's message

200
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,140
goes right into it.

201
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,380
And it's this, number one,

202
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,579
notice the atonement of Christ.

203
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:06,320
That word atonement is the expiation of sin

204
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,320
made by the obedience and suffering of Christ.

205
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,200
We understand when we speak about the death of Christ,

206
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,200
we understand that as He said there in John 17,

207
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,760
the hour has come.

208
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,119
Jesus understood the purpose

209
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:22,920
in which He came to this earth.

210
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,839
In fact, earlier in the book of John,

211
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:27,160
He mentions about destroying this temple

212
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,160
and in three days I'll raise it up.

213
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,040
And speaking of His own body

214
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,479
and of course, not only the death,

215
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:33,900
but the resurrection.

216
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,619
You remember that during the time

217
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:37,099
in which the Lord Jesus Christ

218
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,340
interacted with His disciples and He said,

219
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,059
whom do men say that I am?

220
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:44,580
And then He says, but who do you say that I am?

221
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,059
And after Peter stands up with great boldness

222
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,500
and says, thou art the Christ,

223
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,520
the Son of the living God,

224
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,820
we find that Jesus,

225
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,700
if you look at the text of Scripture,

226
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,500
He then began to share with them

227
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,979
the things that would shortly come to pass

228
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,320
concerning what?

229
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,719
His death and His resurrection.

230
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:06,440
And so we notice the atonement of Christ

231
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,039
as we look at those few verses

232
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:08,960
that we've mentioned.

233
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,440
Actually, back up into verse 12.

234
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,200
The Bible says,

235
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,039
neither by the blood of goats and calves,

236
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,159
but by His own blood,

237
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,760
He entered in once into the holy place,

238
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,919
having obtained eternal redemption for us.

239
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,880
Remember, He went to a better place,

240
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,479
the heavenly tabernacle.

241
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:28,320
He offered a better sacrifice.

242
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,539
It was His own blood,

243
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:31,460
not the blood of bulls and goats.

244
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,739
And we find that He obtained for us

245
00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:39,619
a better gift, eternal redemption.

246
00:09:39,619 --> 00:09:41,580
We see it unfolded in verse 12.

247
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,020
The Bible says that He entered in once.

248
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,380
As I mentioned last week,

249
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,900
as we look at that phraseology

250
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,580
and we even couple it with what we find

251
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,020
in verse 26,

252
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,900
the latter part of verse 26,

253
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,619
but now once in the end of the world

254
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:57,299
hath He appeared to put away sin

255
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:59,859
by the sacrifice of Himself.

256
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:02,159
It's interesting as we understand

257
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,419
the beginning of the ninth chapter

258
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:05,619
of the book of Hebrews

259
00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:09,019
dealing with the earthly tabernacle

260
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:10,659
and dealing with the holy place

261
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:11,819
and the Holy of Holies.

262
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,019
And I told you last week

263
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,459
that what was in view

264
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,979
was really the Day of Atonement.

265
00:10:16,979 --> 00:10:19,139
And it's interesting because we understand

266
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:21,059
that it says that He entered in once.

267
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:23,539
Not only did He only go in once,

268
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,259
but He only had to do it once.

269
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:26,539
Once for all.

270
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:27,859
The High Priest,

271
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:30,059
when He would go in on the Day of Atonement,

272
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:32,299
He would enter in that first time

273
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,739
to present the blood of a bull

274
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:36,659
for His own sins.

275
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:38,859
And then He would come out

276
00:10:38,859 --> 00:10:42,299
and He'd have to go in a second time.

277
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:44,579
Look at Leviticus 16. You can see it.

278
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:46,139
With the blood of the goat.

279
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:48,339
Why? For the sins of the people.

280
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:50,259
Jesus had no sin.

281
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:52,179
The just for the unjust.

282
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:54,899
Therefore, He only had to enter

283
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,379
into the Holy of Holies once

284
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:01,179
to present His perfect, sinless blood.

285
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:02,459
And by the way,

286
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:05,379
as you look at the truth of the Day of Atonement,

287
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:07,339
not only did the High Priest go in twice

288
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:08,699
on that same day,

289
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:10,779
but then next year it would have to be repeated

290
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:14,419
and the year after that and the year after that.

291
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:17,739
But with the sacrifice of Jesus, it's not so.

292
00:11:17,739 --> 00:11:19,859
We see the atonement of Christ.

293
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:20,979
It's in full view.

294
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:23,819
We understand that it's a substitutionary atonement.

295
00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:25,339
He took your place.

296
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:26,419
He took my place.

297
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,379
We understand that it was a blood atonement

298
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:31,099
as we continue looking through the passage of Scripture.

299
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:34,019
Pick it up with me in verse 18.

300
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:34,859
The Bible says,

301
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:36,619
"...whereupon neither the First Testament

302
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:38,819
was dedicated without blood.

303
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:40,939
Notice, for when Moses had spoken

304
00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:42,899
every precept to all the people

305
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:44,179
according to the law,

306
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:46,779
he took the blood of calves and of goats

307
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:49,699
with water and scarlet wool and hyssop

308
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:52,379
and sprinkled both the book and all the people,

309
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:55,099
saying, this is the blood of the Testament

310
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:58,419
which God hath enjoined unto you.

311
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:00,859
Moreover, he sprinkled with blood

312
00:12:00,859 --> 00:12:02,899
both the tabernacle and all the vessels

313
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:04,299
of the ministry.

314
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:05,899
And almost all things are by the law

315
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:07,579
purged with blood,

316
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:12,139
and without shedding of blood is no remission."

317
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:13,939
What is the writer saying to these believers?

318
00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:15,779
What is he saying to us this morning?

319
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:20,019
The death of Christ was absolutely necessary.

320
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:22,459
We find that as we read in v. 16,

321
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:24,539
it says for where a Testament is,

322
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:27,179
there must also of necessity

323
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,019
be the death of the testator.

324
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:32,179
As we understand that truth

325
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:33,779
and we understand through His death

326
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,299
and glorious resurrection

327
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:37,819
that the promise of eternal redemption

328
00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:40,459
can now be received.

329
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,099
See, the reality is that at the end of v. 15,

330
00:12:43,099 --> 00:12:45,099
it says they which are called

331
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:49,459
might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.

332
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:50,939
Remember, in v. 12,

333
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:52,339
He said that He had obtained

334
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:55,819
eternal redemption for us.

335
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:59,019
How many of you have a will?

336
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:00,499
Not very many of you.

337
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:02,539
You need to go see a lawyer or something.

338
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:05,019
I'm not trying to get anything on the side.

339
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:07,619
I'm just simply saying it's common, right?

340
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:10,419
People have wills.

341
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:13,899
The reality is that if you have a will,

342
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:17,179
until you are deceased,

343
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:19,419
it is not in effect.

344
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:21,419
Correct?

345
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:22,939
In fact, I am often reminded,

346
00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:24,699
though my dad's not here this morning,

347
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:26,219
I believe he's watching live stream,

348
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:28,699
he has a will.

349
00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:30,099
And he'll say something like this

350
00:13:30,099 --> 00:13:31,579
every once in a while.

351
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:34,579
I'm going to change my will.

352
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:35,859
Right? Doesn't he?

353
00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:37,739
Taking you out of my will.

354
00:13:37,739 --> 00:13:39,579
Why can he say that?

355
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:42,739
Because he's still alive.

356
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:43,659
You have a will.

357
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:46,579
It can be changed if you're alive.

358
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:50,859
What probates the will is the death.

359
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:52,299
Correct?

360
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,219
So understand that as we're looking

361
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:55,859
at the passage of Scripture,

362
00:13:55,859 --> 00:13:58,299
and we find that the writer of Hebrews

363
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:01,579
is presenting to these Jewish believers

364
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:04,459
that it was absolutely imperative,

365
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:08,939
it was necessary for Christ to die.

366
00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:12,099
We find that all the way back in Genesis.

367
00:14:12,099 --> 00:14:13,739
We find that in chapter 3,

368
00:14:13,739 --> 00:14:15,179
when sin entered into the world,

369
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:17,619
you see the truth in Genesis 3

370
00:14:17,619 --> 00:14:20,979
in verse 15 concerning the first mention

371
00:14:20,979 --> 00:14:22,979
of the truth that God Himself,

372
00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:24,500
the Lord Jesus Christ,

373
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,779
would die for the sins of man.

374
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,259
You find that there in Genesis 3,

375
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:32,379
immediately after Adam and Eve

376
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:33,779
committed the sin,

377
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:34,779
what did they try to do?

378
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:36,299
They tried to cover it with the works

379
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:37,419
of their own hands,

380
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,819
with the fig leaves that they sowed together,

381
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:43,539
but it was not accepted.

382
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:45,019
What did God do?

383
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:47,059
He sacrificed an animal

384
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:51,219
and He made a coat of skins.

385
00:14:51,219 --> 00:14:52,500
From that day forward,

386
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,779
you read, as you think about Cain and Abel,

387
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:58,339
the reality of the accepted offering

388
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:00,779
was the one that was blood.

389
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:02,739
And you go through the whole

390
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:03,859
of the Old Testament,

391
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:06,539
and you see that God has designed it

392
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:09,179
such that without shedding of blood

393
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:11,579
is no remission.

394
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,459
And therefore, God Himself,

395
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:14,659
the Lord Jesus Christ,

396
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:16,939
He would go to the cross of Calvary

397
00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:19,379
and He would shed His precious blood

398
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:22,339
so that that which He had promised

399
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:25,859
could be obtained.

400
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:28,419
We find that what had been pictured

401
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:31,699
has now been purchased.

402
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:33,939
We find the necessity.

403
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:35,739
We see the Old Testament type

404
00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:37,739
in the verses that we just read

405
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:38,979
speaking of Moses

406
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:43,739
and how He took and He sprinkled that blood.

407
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:45,259
The people. The book.

408
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:46,299
And all that He did.

409
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:48,099
He talks about the fact that He

410
00:15:48,099 --> 00:15:50,219
did all those vessels of the ministry.

411
00:15:50,219 --> 00:15:52,339
And you look back in the books of Exodus

412
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:53,179
and Leviticus,

413
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:54,939
and you see the carrying out

414
00:15:54,939 --> 00:15:58,459
and the reference in which the writer is making.

415
00:15:58,459 --> 00:15:59,739
And we're mindful this morning

416
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:01,699
of this wonderful truth again

417
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:04,179
as we think about the death of Christ

418
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:05,899
and His glorious resurrection.

419
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:07,779
We find that the offering of Himself

420
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:09,819
was accepted.

421
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:12,459
It was an acceptable offering.

422
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:14,500
In verse 23 of our text of Scripture,

423
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:14,939
it says,

424
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:16,500
it was therefore necessary...

425
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,819
We see that word again.

426
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:20,459
That the patterns of things in the heavens

427
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,739
should be purified with these,

428
00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:24,619
but the heavenly things themselves

429
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:28,099
with better sacrifices than these.

430
00:16:28,099 --> 00:16:30,899
For Christ is not entered into the holy places

431
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:32,539
made with hands,

432
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:36,339
which are the figures of the true,

433
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:38,139
but into heaven itself,

434
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:42,059
now to appear in the presence of God for us.

435
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:45,019
For yet, that He should offer Himself often

436
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:47,139
as the high priest entereth into the holy place

437
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,779
every year with blood of others.

438
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:52,819
For then must He often have suffered

439
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:54,939
since the foundation of the world.

440
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:56,500
But now once in the end of the world

441
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,859
hath He appeared to put away sin

442
00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:02,219
by the sacrifice of Himself.

443
00:17:02,219 --> 00:17:04,139
Let's look at several passages of Scripture

444
00:17:04,139 --> 00:17:06,779
throughout the Word of God this morning.

445
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:08,899
Look over to the book of Philippians if you will.

446
00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:11,339
I'm going to reference a number of passages

447
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:13,059
and hope that we understand

448
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:16,219
not only the necessity of the death of Christ

449
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:17,339
and His shed blood,

450
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,939
but we understand this morning

451
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:20,819
what it accomplished.

452
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,859
How that our redemption was paid for

453
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,259
with the blood of Christ.

454
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:26,339
How that the problem of sin

455
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:29,619
is dealt with only with the blood of Christ.

456
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:31,699
And is dealt with once and for all.

457
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:33,779
And what a joy that is.

458
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:36,019
Remember, I mentioned last week

459
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:38,939
how that the Old Testament sacrificial system

460
00:17:38,939 --> 00:17:43,699
was a constant reminder of sin

461
00:17:43,699 --> 00:17:46,019
while the sacrificial offering of Christ

462
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:51,419
once for all offers remission for sin.

463
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:54,099
What a blessing.

464
00:17:54,099 --> 00:17:55,659
We find in the book of Philippians

465
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:58,419
in chapter 2, beginning in verse 5,

466
00:17:58,419 --> 00:17:59,259
the Bible says,

467
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:00,299
let this mind be in you,

468
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,579
which was also in Christ Jesus,

469
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:03,939
who being in the form of God

470
00:18:03,939 --> 00:18:06,059
thought it not robbery to be equal with God.

471
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:07,779
Why? Because He is God.

472
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:08,419
Verse 7,

473
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:11,059
But made Himself of no reputation

474
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:13,139
and took upon Him the form of a servant,

475
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:14,659
was made in the likeness of men.

476
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:15,699
Notice verse 8,

477
00:18:15,699 --> 00:18:17,619
And being found in fashion as a man,

478
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:19,939
He humbled Himself

479
00:18:19,939 --> 00:18:22,059
and became obedient unto death,

480
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:26,539
even the death of the cross.

481
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:30,899
My sin, O the bliss of this glorious thought,

482
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:36,459
my sin, not in part, but the whole,

483
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:40,299
is nailed to His cross,

484
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:42,299
and I bear it no more.

485
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,940
Praise the Lord! Amen?

486
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,859
Look at Colossians, if you will,

487
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,019
and notice in chapter 2,

488
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:51,500
in verse 14,

489
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,219
the Bible says,

490
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:56,179
blotting out the handwriting of ordinances

491
00:18:56,179 --> 00:18:58,380
that was against us,

492
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,140
which was contrary to us,

493
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,979
and took it out of the way,

494
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:07,979
nailing it to His cross.

495
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:09,260
Do you know this morning

496
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,779
that every sin that you've ever committed

497
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:16,779
was future when Jesus died?

498
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:19,380
You say that's not very deep.

499
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,140
I understand.

500
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,700
But we need to be reminded of that.

501
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,700
Why?

502
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,940
Because we sing, even as our family in the past

503
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,899
has sung that song,

504
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:29,659
it's under the blood.

505
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:32,739
Listen, there is an accuser of the brethren

506
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,219
in Revelation 12.

507
00:19:34,219 --> 00:19:36,140
I understand you don't need to turn there.

508
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,299
It's about the midpoint of the tribulation.

509
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:39,779
And you understand the Bible speaks

510
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,940
about the accuser of the brethren.

511
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,459
And He is.

512
00:19:43,459 --> 00:19:45,179
And here's an interesting truth

513
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:47,820
that is given with regard to our adversary.

514
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,179
The Bible says that He came down to them.

515
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:52,219
Again, I understand contextually

516
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:54,419
in the midst of the tribulation,

517
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:56,700
but it says having great wrath.

518
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,419
Why?

519
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:00,140
Because He knoweth?

520
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,340
that He hath but a short time.

521
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,420
I believe this morning,

522
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,080
more than I've ever believed it,

523
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,260
that our Enemy is real

524
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,760
and He is active.

525
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,260
He is active.

526
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,020
But we have the blood.

527
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,100
We have the blood!

528
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,220
And this morning, as we understand

529
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,040
the atonement of Christ

530
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,940
and we understand what was accomplished

531
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,020
through the atonement,

532
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,220
we understand this morning

533
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,460
that we rejoice in it.

534
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,500
We see glory in the cross.

535
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,860
But again, for these Jewish believers,

536
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,700
and even still to this day,

537
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,580
many Jewish folks have a challenge

538
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,300
speaking about the cross.

539
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,420
And we find that Paul reveals to us

540
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,340
as he's writing to the believers in Corinth

541
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,540
in 1 Corinthians 1,

542
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,700
he's speaking often about the preaching

543
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,500
of the cross.

544
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,420
But he says in verse 23,

545
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,020
but we preach Christ crucified

546
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,980
unto the Jews a stumbling block

547
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,220
and unto the Greeks foolishness.

548
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,380
But, verse 24,

549
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,500
unto them which are called

550
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,060
both Jews and Greeks,

551
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,220
Christ, the power of God,

552
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,020
and the wisdom of God.

553
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,100
I'm so thankful for the privilege

554
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,780
and the opportunity to preach the cross.

555
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,740
To understand what happened

556
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,620
on the cross of Calvary

557
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,340
and how the wrath of God

558
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:29,460
was poured out upon the Son of God.

559
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,860
God Himself.

560
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,940
He hath made Him to be sin for us

561
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,900
who knew no sin

562
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,060
that we might be made

563
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:42,500
the righteousness of God in Him.

564
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,140
We find that as we look at the passage of Scripture

565
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,460
and we are mindful of what was accomplished

566
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,900
on the cross of Calvary,

567
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,780
I want you to understand this morning

568
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,860
that as a child of God,

569
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,940
you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

570
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,020
as your Savior,

571
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,220
that it was the payment of His blood

572
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,380
that allowed for you to receive that free gift.

573
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,260
But can I tell you this morning

574
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,580
that the enemy's still working?

575
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,100
We find that the Bible would reveal to us

576
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,500
as we mentioned in previous messages

577
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
the truth of 1 John 1

578
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,540
and even going into the second chapter

579
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,460
about the fact that the sin

580
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,700
in the life of a believer,

581
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,300
if we confess our sins,

582
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,900
He is faithful and just to forgive us

583
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,380
from our sins and to cleanse us

584
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,460
from all unrighteousness.

585
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,580
What a wonderful truth.

586
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,620
What a wonderful promise of the Word of God.

587
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,700
See, this morning,

588
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,780
turn over if you will to the book of Jeremiah.

589
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,900
I'm going to go to Isaiah in a moment,

590
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,700
but I want to start here in Jeremiah 2.

591
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,380
Because I want you to understand

592
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,580
the power of the blood.

593
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,180
We sing about the power of the blood, right?

594
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,220
There's power, power,

595
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,500
wonder-working power.

596
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,460
We sing about the blood

597
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,780
in many references.

598
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,660
Are you washed in the blood?

599
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:12,260
In the soul-cleansing blood of the Lamb?

600
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,380
When we sing that chorus,

601
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,420
I love to say these words.

602
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,100
When it says, are you washed in the blood?

603
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,500
I love to say, yes, I am.

604
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,460
Isn't that wonderful?

605
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,580
Notice in Jeremiah,

606
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,940
you understand that the people of God

607
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,700
are under a great indictment.

608
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,900
In fact, as you look at the second chapter

609
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,180
of the book of Jeremiah,

610
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,460
you will find many things

611
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,900
with regard to the indictment

612
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,740
that is laid against the nation of Judah.

613
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,940
And you would understand

614
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,380
that they had forsaken God.

615
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,780
Why? Because they had forgotten God.

616
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,700
And because they had forgotten God

617
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,980
and forsaken God,

618
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,140
they followed after idols.

619
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,100
We find that throughout the Old Testament

620
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,980
in many of the messages of the prophets,

621
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,460
amend your ways.

622
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,220
Right?

623
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,820
Look at what God says in Jeremiah 2

624
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,500
in verse 22.

625
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,940
For though thou wash thee with niter

626
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,060
and take thee much soap,

627
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,900
yet thine iniquity is marked before Me,

628
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:19,260
saith the Lord God.

629
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,940
Niter and soap doesn't do it.

630
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,540
It doesn't work.

631
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,020
By the way, these are two very powerful things

632
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,460
that can cleanse a lot of stuff.

633
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,660
But it can't cleanse you and it can't cleanse me.

634
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,700
It's only the blood.

635
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,260
He said, look, there's the indictment.

636
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,420
Here's what's going on.

637
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,500
Here's the sin.

638
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,660
And I want you to know,

639
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,180
it's interesting in the book of Ezekiel,

640
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,540
I'm going to go to Isaiah 1 if you will,

641
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,620
but I want you to understand that there

642
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,100
as we read through the book of Ezekiel again

643
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,740
as the prophet is prophesying,

644
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,260
and the Bible tells us

645
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,020
at the end of chapter 33

646
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,820
in the book of Ezekiel

647
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,460
about the fact that they heard the words,

648
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,700
but they didn't do it.

649
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,820
Jeremiah's calling them to a place of repentance

650
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,700
God had often given

651
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,140
through the prophets

652
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,660
not only in Jeremiah 2,

653
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,700
but there in Ezekiel,

654
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:16,180
He had given a voice.

655
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,540
In Isaiah 1,

656
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,940
I wish I could read the entirety of the passage.

657
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,860
Let me read just a couple of verses.

658
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,260
In verse 2, the Bible says,

659
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,820
Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth,

660
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,820
for the Lord hath spoken.

661
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,540
I have nourished and brought up children

662
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,700
and they have rebelled against Me.

663
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,860
The ox knoweth his owner,

664
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,100
the ass his master's crib,

665
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,780
but Israel doth not know My people,

666
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:44,500
and they doth not consider.

667
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,620
Look what it says in verse 4.

668
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,540
All sinful nation.

669
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,420
A people laden with iniquity.

670
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,780
A seed of evildoers.

671
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,380
Children that are corruptors.

672
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,740
They have forsaken the Lord.

673
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,500
They have provoked the Holy One of Israel into anger.

674
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,980
They are gone away backward.

675
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,620
Can I tell you this morning

676
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,940
that as we look at the truth of the New Testament,

677
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,940
even if you're saved this morning

678
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,300
and your relationship with God

679
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,020
is settled at Calvary,

680
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,940
that there can be sin in the life of a believer.

681
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,060
And that sin in the life of a believer

682
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:24,460
causes our fellowship to be hindered.

683
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,700
It's not worth it.

684
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,300
Why?

685
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,700
Because Christ is better.

686
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,100
Because He's better.

687
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,060
He's better than that position.

688
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,580
He's better than that person.

689
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,820
He's better than whatever!

690
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:40,140
He's better.

691
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,700
And here's what God says in Isaiah 1.

692
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,620
Again, I wish we could read the entirety of the passage.

693
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,060
But the indictment is clear

694
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,940
in the first few verses that I've read.

695
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,740
You come in verse 18.

696
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:55,060
Come now, and let us reason together,

697
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,620
saith the Lord.

698
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:00,460
Though your sins be as scarlet,

699
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,460
they shall be as white as snow.

700
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,940
Though they be red like crimson,

701
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:10,100
they shall be as wool.

702
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,340
If ye be willing and obedient,

703
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,260
ye shall eat the good of the land.

704
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,820
But if ye refuse and rebel,

705
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,780
ye shall be devoured with the sword.

706
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:23,100
For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.

707
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,900
The reality this morning,

708
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,540
when we think about the death of Christ

709
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,940
and we notice the atonement of Christ

710
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,740
there in Hebrews 9 and verses 12-26

711
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,820
and we see the necessity of it.

712
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,260
In Isaiah 53, by the way,

713
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,060
the passage that we referenced last week

714
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,140
on Sunday evening,

715
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,620
we talked about the eunuch, right?

716
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,260
That was the passage he was reading.

717
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,700
And we find that it would be clear

718
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,260
in the passage that Christ would suffer,

719
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,260
that He would go to the cross of Calvary,

720
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,100
that our iniquities were laid upon Him,

721
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,020
the Messiah.

722
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,020
We find that Christ's death

723
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:00,220
accomplished for us eternal redemption.

724
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,300
We find that as believers,

725
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,100
that as we walk in this life

726
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,540
after we've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ,

727
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,300
that we have the accuser of the brethren,

728
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,340
that we understand that He attacks,

729
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:15,900
we understand that we have this flesh.

730
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,020
And when we sin, we have an advocate with the Father.

731
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,020
Isn't that precious?

732
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,380
1 John 2.

733
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,660
We have an advocate with the Father

734
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:30,340
who says, I paid for that with my blood.

735
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,739
What shall we say then?

736
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:34,619
Shall we continue in sin

737
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:36,299
that grace may abound?

738
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:39,179
God forbid!

739
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:41,140
We don't live as if we say,

740
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,380
well, I have this liberty.

741
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,260
I can do whatever.

742
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,540
I can do what pleases me

743
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:48,100
because I can just confess it.

744
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,900
Oh, but what we miss out on.

745
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,420
The joy of what we have on this earth

746
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,179
with our fellowship with God,

747
00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:59,299
that we willingly surrender that

748
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:03,299
for something far inferior.

749
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:05,780
For some momentary pleasure.

750
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,540
Hebrews 11 says that there is pleasure in sin

751
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,140
for a season.

752
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,580
And as we look at the truth of God's Word,

753
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,220
we say Christ is superior.

754
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,980
We see that the believers in Hebrews 9,

755
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,660
they're being instructed with regard

756
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,020
to the necessity of Christ's death,

757
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,179
but their understanding as the writer

758
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:29,980
is packaging this thing together.

759
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,739
He's saying, listen, Jesus died

760
00:29:32,739 --> 00:29:34,420
so that you could be saved

761
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,020
and His blood is sufficient

762
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,299
and it's accepted.

763
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:40,100
And if He didn't die,

764
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,179
these promises that we've spoken of

765
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:46,140
could never be in effect.

766
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,580
Remember, all the way back in Hebrews 2,

767
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,420
in verse 14,

768
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,540
the Bible says for as much then

769
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,900
as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,

770
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,140
He also Himself likewise took part of the same,

771
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,140
that through death...

772
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:09,100
he might destroy him that had the power of death. That is the devil. 1st John

773
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:14,820
chapter number 3 and verse number 18 we find that the Bible tells us there that

774
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,420
that we excuse me in verse number 8 he that committed sin is of the devil for

775
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,860
the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was

776
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:29,380
manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil. I'll repeat what I

777
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:39,500
said moments ago our enemy is real and our enemy is active he's active he's

778
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:47,220
seeking whom he may devour you have a target on you I have a target on me the

779
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:52,820
world the flesh and the devil it's against us but we have something so much

780
00:30:52,820 --> 00:31:03,420
greater we have Jesus but the enemy knows he knows how to get you he knows

781
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:08,220
how to get me he knows how to get you he's been studying mankind for a long

782
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,780
time he's not God praise God for that he's far listen greater see that is in

783
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:20,740
you than he that is in the world but here's the problem sometimes we make

784
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:27,020
ourselves vulnerable submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil what

785
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:38,620
does it say and he will flee from you I often compare to known Bible accounts

786
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:51,260
when I think about this truth one of Joseph and one of David the wife of

787
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:59,420
Potiphar cast her eyes upon Joseph day by day listen just because you say no

788
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:05,060
once doesn't mean the devil is gonna give up he didn't keep coming you can

789
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,980
keep knocking on your doors and keep knocking on your door he's gonna keep

790
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:16,980
tempting you but Joseph he put on his running shoes so to speak he got out of

791
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:23,340
there I've often said of Joseph that he lost his coat but he retained his

792
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:31,780
integrity his character oh he was lied about he suffered in prison it's part of

793
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:36,340
God's plan it was not part of God's plan for him to commit that sin with that

794
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:48,060
woman amen what about David who is that it's Bathsheba she's the daughter of but

795
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:56,700
she's the wife of Uriah the Hittite God given warning through his servant what

796
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:05,380
did David say bring her to me for I want her if you read about the confession of

797
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:13,740
David in Psalms 51 in Psalm 51 you read a brokenhearted man that receives

798
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:20,900
forgiveness and restoration because we have a great God we have a merciful God

799
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:25,780
who's ready to pardon ready to forgive we have a God who is extending that

800
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:33,740
mercy and we find that David praise many things in Psalm 51 but one thing that he

801
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:43,820
prays restore unto me the joy of my salvation David what took your joy sin

802
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:54,980
it robbed my joy it stole it from me see the atonement of Christ is so important

803
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:59,620
we understand what it does for us in salvation but understand this morning

804
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:05,980
what it does for you daily to understand the blood the fact that based

805
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:11,140
on what Christ did at the cross of Calvary I can confess my sins and know

806
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:18,020
that I have an advocate with the father and know that we can plead the blood and

807
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:22,580
when the devil as the accuser of the brethren wants to come to you and accuse

808
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:30,220
you say I have Jesus and here's what he provided for me here's what he did for

809
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:35,420
me see the world's not worth it but can I tell you the devil wants you to think

810
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:41,620
it is the devil wants to make it look shiny and pretty and fill in the blank

811
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:49,620
right the devil he knows what he's doing this morning we see we notice the

812
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:55,700
atonement of Christ as you look back in Hebrews 9 we read through verse 24 look

813
00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:00,100
at verse 25 nor yet that he should offer himself often actually read this verse

814
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,780
2 but that's okay and verse 25 as the high priest enters in the holy place

815
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:08,900
every year with blood of others notice 26 for then must he often have suffered

816
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,580
since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he

817
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:16,860
appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself do you like that

818
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:25,140
phrase to put away sin I've often said and I appreciate the truth that we find

819
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,500
in the Word of God with regard to the fact that prior to salvation we were

820
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:41,020
bound we were slaves to sin we're lost and undone strangers foreigners we're

821
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:49,860
bound by our sin we were under a heavy penalty death for the wages of sin is

822
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:57,180
death I'm so thankful that the death burial and resurrection of the Lord

823
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:03,140
Jesus Christ gave me freedom from the penalty of sin but can I tell you this

824
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:09,900
morning that it gave me the victory over sin it power over sin sin no longer I'm

825
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:15,660
no longer bound by sin Romans chapter 6 you look through there and you see the

826
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:22,660
the wondrous truth of the fact that I'm no longer bound by sin I said this as we

827
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,980
look at the passage that's there in Romans chapter number 6 I've said this

828
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,420
in the past that that the reality is that what we need in America what we

829
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:35,220
need in our homes of salvation with that transformation and then we need to walk

830
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:40,940
with Christ because we understand our identity in Christ Ephesians you look at

831
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:46,100
the passages throughout the book and you find that it is absolutely hammered home

832
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:51,220
in Ephesians 1 through 3 that if you've trusted Christ your Savior you are his

833
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:59,260
child you are secure in Christ but now you better start living like it walk

834
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:05,860
worthy of your calling of your vocation walk not as other Gentiles walk walk in

835
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:12,420
truth walk in love we look at all of that truth walk circumspectly right and

836
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:17,420
we find that as we look at the truth of the Word of God that Paul says this in

837
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:22,820
Romans 6 and verse 17 but God be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye

838
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:27,740
have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you being

839
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:36,780
made free from sin you became the servants of righteousness praise God

840
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:47,260
sin no longer has that power over us but sometimes we we walk in the flesh and

841
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:57,540
not in the spirit the enemy makes it look real good but he's a liar he's the

842
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:05,020
father of it he hates you he hates God we see the atonement notice most out of

843
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,740
time and I got a lot more to say amen does anyone got a roast on this morning

844
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:14,180
that you're afraid is gonna burn don't answer change that timer on the thing

845
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:20,540
hope you have a Wi-Fi oven amen they sell those things now by the way notice

846
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:24,100
as we continue through the passage notice our appointment with death verse

847
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,300
27 I won't spend much time here I'd like to get to the latter part of the

848
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:33,940
passage Hebrews 9 in verse 27 it's a verse that we often quote the Bible says

849
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:40,900
as it and as it is appointed unto men wants to die but after this the judgment

850
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,100
you know there are people today that have this belief that you just die like

851
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,660
you just die and you buried and it's all over it's not true on the authority of

852
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:56,580
the Word of God why is it appointed unto man wants to die because of sin right

853
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:01,780
the penalty of sin is death but we understand that this is speaking of a

854
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,920
spiritual death right there's a physical death and a spiritual death we live in

855
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,780
this sin cursed world where everything's breaking down the disease and all that's

856
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:15,580
taking place in our society in our world it's because of sin God didn't make it

857
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:22,260
that way in the beginning it was perfect but sin entered in the the society

858
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,940
begins to break down and we have death as a result and you find that physical

859
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,820
death but more importantly the truth of the spiritual death or the Bible says

860
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:35,420
that in row in Revelation chapter number 20 that death and hell were cast in a

861
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:41,900
lake of fire this is the second death I've often mentioned that to be born

862
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:49,140
once is to die twice but to be born twice is to die but once why because

863
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:54,780
Jesus said to Nicodemus in John chapter number three he must be born again he

864
00:39:54,780 --> 00:40:02,020
must be born again we've been born physically and praise God

865
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:06,940
I thought I was born spiritually, I was born again.

866
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,980
The first birth, we celebrate annually, typically.

867
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,320
Some people don't like celebrating it

868
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,100
once they get to a certain age.

869
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,020
Or they like to pretend that it's number 29 or 39

870
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:21,940
for the however many times, you know, that sort of thing.

871
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:25,020
Can I tell you that I'm more excited

872
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,660
about my spiritual birth even than I am my physical birth?

873
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,160
I understand this morning that I couldn't have

874
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,960
a spiritual birth if I didn't have a physical birth.

875
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,920
I get that.

876
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,440
But can I tell you that August 31st is my spiritual birthday

877
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,860
and that day in so many ways is more important to me

878
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,760
than my physical birthday?

879
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,000
Because I was born again.

880
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,680
I was delivered from the penalty of sin.

881
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,980
I didn't understand on that day all that Christ did for me.

882
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,000
But the more I walk with Christ,

883
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,380
the more over these 23 some years

884
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,780
that I've been walking with the Lord and reading His Word,

885
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,860
oh, how precious it becomes

886
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,860
what Christ did for me on that day.

887
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,760
The Bible says,

888
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,660
no point unto man once to die, after this the judgment.

889
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,900
We know of two judgments specifically,

890
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,940
there's a bema seed, the judgment seed of Christ.

891
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,180
If you're a believer this morning,

892
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,260
you will stand before Christ at that judgment.

893
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,940
Paul deals with it, he speaks of it

894
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,200
as he's giving truth with regard to the bema.

895
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,360
But we find the Bible speaks

896
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,880
about the great white throne judgment

897
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,560
in Revelation chapter number 20.

898
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,440
I quoted part of that when I said death and hell

899
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,320
were cast in like a fire, this is the second death.

900
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:39,560
That's the verdict at that great white throne judgment.

901
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:45,200
If you've been born again, thank God,

902
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,560
you will not have to stand

903
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,320
at the great white throne judgment.

904
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,400
Thank God that the second death has no power over you.

905
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,960
We look at the last part of Hebrews 9,

906
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,160
we notice the atonement,

907
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,400
we notice our appointment with death,

908
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,000
but I want you to consider the appearing of Christ.

909
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,800
I mentioned how that the song service,

910
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,720
especially the last song that we sang this morning

911
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,480
as a congregation, it is well with my soul,

912
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,200
how wonderful to think about how verse three and four

913
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,800
fit so beautifully with the passage that is before us.

914
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,760
My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought,

915
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,920
my sin not in part, but the whole, right?

916
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,240
And we rejoice that it's nailed to His cross,

917
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,960
I bear it no more, but then we come to the fourth verse,

918
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,960
and Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight.

919
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:41,000
Hebrews 9 and verse 28, so Christ was once offered,

920
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,640
remember, we've mentioned this multiple times

921
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,000
through the passage of Scripture,

922
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,360
not only was it once as opposed to twice

923
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,360
as the day of atonement with the high priest,

924
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,880
he only had to enter once, why?

925
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,240
Because he didn't have to make a sacrifice for his own sin,

926
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,400
just for the sin of the world.

927
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,320
I say just, that's a significant truth,

928
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,560
but he didn't have to for his own sin, he had no sin.

929
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:07,080
And he only had to do it one time forever.

930
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,160
We see that it says, to bear the sins of many,

931
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,720
notice, and unto them that look for him

932
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,720
shall he appear the second time,

933
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,480
without sin unto salvation.

934
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,240
The reality is the first time he came,

935
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,040
he came to deal with sin, and he's dealt with it.

936
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:35,200
We've often said that he came as a lamb the first time.

937
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,200
When he comes at the end of the tribulation,

938
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,440
he will come as a conquering king,

939
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,200
the lion of the tribe of Judah.

940
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,360
He is king of kings and Lord of lords.

941
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,000
Can I tell you this morning,

942
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,240
that though this truth of his second appearing

943
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,000
has not taken place,

944
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
we have full confidence that he shall appear.

945
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,240
It says, they that look, notice,

946
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,240
and unto them that look for him

947
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,400
shall he appear the second time

948
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,760
without sin unto salvation.

949
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,600
The reality is that it's not meaning

950
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,480
that if we're not looking that he's not gonna come,

951
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,600
but I want you to think about the truth

952
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:21,360
and the splendor, the joy of those that are looking for.

953
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,080
We find that Paul says it this way to Titus

954
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,760
in the second chapter.

955
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,120
He's speaking of the blessed hope looking,

956
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,560
and we understand the appearing of our great God and Savior,

957
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,360
the Lord Jesus Christ.

958
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,480
This blessed hope that he shall appear.

959
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,120
I'm listening for the trumpet, amen.

960
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,240
I know that Brother Mershawn often says,

961
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,760
I'm not looking for the undertaker,

962
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,920
I'm looking for the upper taker.

963
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,640
I mean, I'm thrilled to be able to report to you this morning

964
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,880
that we are closer than we've ever been.

965
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,600
And I can say that every day until he returns, amen.

966
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,360
We are closer than we've ever been.

967
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,280
There are many things, I believe,

968
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,680
in the world that seem to be indicators

969
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,600
of the fact that we are really, really

970
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,320
on the doorstep of the rapture.

971
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,960
But the reality is that no man knows the hour.

972
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,360
The truth of the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ,

973
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,280
his second coming ought to affect his people.

974
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,640
It ought to impact you.

975
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,320
Think about how it influenced

976
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,560
the disciples in the book of Acts.

977
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,640
I got 25 verses to look at.

978
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,840
We don't have anywhere near the time.

979
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,680
So let me just share a few things with you.

980
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,480
Actually, Jason, you sent me a really nice note recently.

981
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,160
Amen.

982
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,640
You know what he said to me in the note?

983
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,520
He said, sometimes I'm watching live stream

984
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,000
and it seems like you kind of feel like

985
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
you're looking at the clock and you need to kind of hurry.

986
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,560
He said, just preach the word.

987
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,400
Amen.

988
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,760
He gave me permission, amen.

989
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,880
I like it.

990
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,600
Let's look at the verses, amen.

991
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,080
God's word is powerful.

992
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,480
John 14 and verse number six.

993
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,080
He says, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

994
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,200
But before that, we look at John chapter number 14

995
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,200
and we find that he says, let not your heart be troubled.

996
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,880
You believe in God, believe also in me.

997
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,080
In my Father's house are many mansions.

998
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,160
If it were not so, I would have told you.

999
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,000
I go to prepare a place for you.

1000
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,720
He then says this, and if I go and prepare a place for you,

1001
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:27,720
I will come again and receive you unto myself

1002
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,840
that where I am, there you may be also.

1003
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,960
In Acts chapter number one,

1004
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,760
now understand that the disciples heard that

1005
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,400
in John chapter number 14.

1006
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,720
They heard that truth before Jesus went

1007
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,040
to the cross of Calvary.

1008
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,600
In Acts chapter number one,

1009
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,800
Jesus has already been crucified.

1010
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,680
He's already been buried.

1011
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,240
He's already raised from the dead.

1012
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,520
He's been there for 40 days.

1013
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,160
He's about to ascend.

1014
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,120
And in fact, he gives that great commission once again

1015
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,520
about being his witnesses.

1016
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,000
And in verse number eight,

1017
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,240
and the Bible says that when he had spoken these things

1018
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:08,240
in verse number nine, while they beheld, he was taken up

1019
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,920
and a cloud received him out of their sight.

1020
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,120
And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven

1021
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,840
as he went up, behold, two men stood by them

1022
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,080
in white apparel, which also said,

1023
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,960
ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?

1024
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,960
This same Jesus, which was taken up from you into heaven,

1025
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,680
notice, shall so come in like manner

1026
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,440
as you have seen him go into heaven.

1027
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,760
I like the absolutes of God's word

1028
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,640
where he uses the word shall.

1029
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,760
I like that word.

1030
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,720
He says, I will come again.

1031
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,480
By the way, every promise that God has ever given,

1032
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,800
he fulfills.

1033
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,320
Amen?

1034
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,720
We notice that in the book of 1 Thessalonians

1035
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,560
in chapter number four,

1036
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,880
and really 1 and 2 Thessalonians are full of truth

1037
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,280
with regard to the subject of eschatology

1038
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,440
and the instruction to the people of God.

1039
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,280
In 1 Thessalonians chapter number four,

1040
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,720
Paul says, I don't want you to be ignorant.

1041
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,680
I want you to be informed.

1042
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,080
I want to give you the word of the Lord.

1043
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,280
I want you to understand the truth.

1044
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,560
He tells them in 1 Thessalonians chapter number four

1045
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,040
in verses 16 and 17,

1046
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,000
for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven

1047
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,160
with a shout,

1048
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,040
the voice of the archangel,

1049
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,760
with the trump of God,

1050
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,320
the dead in Christ shall rise first.

1051
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,520
Then we which are alive and remain

1052
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,760
shall be caught up together with them in the clouds

1053
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,600
to meet the Lord in the air.

1054
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:38,720
And so shall we ever be with the Lord.

1055
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,520
I mentioned earlier the truth of Titus two in verse 13,

1056
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,720
where Paul says, looking for that blessed hope

1057
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,760
and the glorious appearing of the great God

1058
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,200
and our savior, Jesus Christ.

1059
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,920
Hebrews nine and verse 28,

1060
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,040
the verse that we've looked at,

1061
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,880
but I want you to see in chapter 10,

1062
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,800
what the Bible says about the truth of Christ's return.

1063
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,440
It says at the end of chapter number nine

1064
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:08,440
that he shall appear in Hebrews 10 in verse number 37.

1065
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,080
And it says for yet a little while

1066
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:15,080
and he that shall come will come and will not tarry.

1067
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,400
James five in verse number eight.

1068
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,040
You say this is a repeated message.

1069
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,280
Yes, because it has a powerful impact

1070
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,440
and we'll get to that in just a moment.

1071
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,200
Notice James five in verse number eight,

1072
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,640
but be ye also patient,

1073
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,760
establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord.

1074
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,600
And draweth nigh.

1075
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,800
First Peter five in verse number four.

1076
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,200
Peter is speaking in the passage to pastors

1077
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,600
and about the importance of our responsibility

1078
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,960
to feed the flock of God, so on and so forth.

1079
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,960
And he goes through that process

1080
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,520
and he comes to verse number four and says,

1081
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:59,400
and when the chief shepherd shall appear.

1082
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,239
Who is that?

1083
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:01,080
That's Jesus.

1084
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,360
shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away."

1085
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:08,040
Peter didn't say if, he said when the chief shepherd

1086
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,760
shall appear, amen?

1087
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,560
Because he's going to.

1088
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,820
Second Peter three, in verse number nine,

1089
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,800
the Lord is not slack concerning his promise, right?

1090
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,960
We find that it says as some men count slackness,

1091
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,760
but what he is long suffering to us,

1092
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,200
we're not willing that any should perish,

1093
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,800
but that all should come to repentance.

1094
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,160
The context of what Peter is saying here

1095
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,080
is that there are those that are walking around

1096
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,440
that are scoffers and mockers, and they're saying,

1097
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,880
hey, where is the promise of his coming?

1098
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,400
And Peter says, don't get discouraged.

1099
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,400
He's coming.

1100
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,940
He's going to come, right on time.

1101
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,920
First John chapter two.

1102
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,600
Let me make some comments

1103
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,000
before I read the portion of scripture.

1104
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,680
I've read many passages to you

1105
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,920
with regard to the promise of his coming.

1106
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,400
We see as we finish Hebrews chapter nine,

1107
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,120
we consider the appearing of Christ,

1108
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,680
the fact that he is going to return,

1109
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,480
and we find that this truth of God's word

1110
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,240
had a great impact and influence on the people of God.

1111
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,240
No doubt as you read the book of Acts

1112
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,420
and you see all that happened to the church

1113
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,480
in that first century,

1114
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:21,400
and you see how the gospel went forward

1115
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,680
under great levels of persecution,

1116
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,100
and you read of all that happened,

1117
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:28,020
I believe that it was mindful to those disciples

1118
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,660
that they watched Jesus ascend up into heaven,

1119
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,540
and they heard those angels say, he's coming again.

1120
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,380
Listen, when we live daily,

1121
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,940
understanding that today could be the day,

1122
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,660
when we're looking for his appearing,

1123
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:44,860
it will change our behavior.

1124
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,300
It will change what we do.

1125
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:50,220
We'll be living under the understanding

1126
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,500
that today will be the day.

1127
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,140
It could be the day.

1128
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,500
No doubt it influenced the people of God

1129
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,260
that we read of in the word of God.

1130
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,420
The New Testament, full of truth

1131
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:05,820
with regard to the return of Christ.

1132
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:09,500
We can look at history of the church.

1133
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:13,260
We can see how this truth of the return of Christ

1134
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:16,360
has influenced generations of believers.

1135
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:22,340
We come to 1 John 2 and notice verse 28.

1136
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:27,260
And now little children abide in him,

1137
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:32,260
that when he shall appear, we may have confidence.

1138
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,140
Notice what this says.

1139
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:40,980
And not be ashamed before him at his coming.

1140
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,180
I asked a question on Wednesday evening.

1141
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,380
Some of you were here.

1142
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:48,020
Hopefully some of you are watching live stream.

1143
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,220
If not, it's recorded, you can go watch it.

1144
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,820
I would encourage you to do so.

1145
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:57,060
Exodus chapter number 16, would you have passed the test?

1146
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,980
Would you have passed the test?

1147
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,940
I said I wanted to ask myself the question.

1148
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,480
I said I want you to ask yourself the question.

1149
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,320
You say, what test?

1150
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,340
I didn't know there was a test.

1151
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:07,180
Exactly.

1152
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,220
Go listen to the message.

1153
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:15,000
They didn't know there was gonna be a test either.

1154
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,600
Some passed, praise God.

1155
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,440
Some failed.

1156
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,880
I'll ask you to ask yourself the question here

1157
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,440
just as I've asked myself.

1158
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,760
I'm not asking you to answer me.

1159
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,740
I'm asking you to be honest before the Lord God.

1160
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,120
It says that we may have confidence

1161
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,540
and not be ashamed before him at his coming.

1162
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,640
What if he came today, would you be ashamed?

1163
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,800
What if he came last Tuesday at, name the time?

1164
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,880
Would you have been ashamed?

1165
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,460
You say, hold on, let me check my calendar.

1166
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,520
You shouldn't have to check your calendar.

1167
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,420
It shouldn't matter where you were or what you were doing.

1168
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:54,920
Why, because you're living with this truth

1169
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,840
that he shall appear.

1170
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,040
And notice what the passage tells us.

1171
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,740
If ye know that he is righteous,

1172
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,660
ye know that everyone that doeth righteousness

1173
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,500
is born of him.

1174
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,660
Go into chapter three.

1175
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:09,400
Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us

1176
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,440
that we should be called the sons of God.

1177
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,600
Therefore the world knoweth us not

1178
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,160
because it knew him not.

1179
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:20,800
Beloved, now are we, sorry,

1180
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,280
now are we the sons of God.

1181
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,720
And it doth not yet appear what we shall be.

1182
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,520
But we know when he, what's it say again?

1183
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,540
Shall appear.

1184
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,720
You see it repeated.

1185
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,080
We shall be like him for we shall see him as he is.

1186
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,840
I'm not gonna read verse three yet.

1187
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,400
Listen, we know the truth

1188
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,320
that we're dealing with this morning.

1189
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,560
We consider the appearing of our Savior.

1190
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,480
We know that it says repeatedly that he shall appear.

1191
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,640
Notice it says that the world knoweth us not.

1192
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,520
But the enemy continues to seek to attack us

1193
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,440
and destroy us and devour us.

1194
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,160
I'm thankful to report this morning

1195
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,800
that the devil can never take your salvation.

1196
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,160
We believe in the eternal security of the believer.

1197
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,400
That as I was born of the Spirit

1198
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,760
that I am washed in the blood,

1199
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,520
that I am redeemed.

1200
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,400
That positionally speaking,

1201
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,880
I am righteous before Almighty God.

1202
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,640
Not because of my righteousness,

1203
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,120
because of the righteousness of God

1204
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,760
that was imputed upon me and you.

1205
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:27,840
By the way, if you're trying to stand

1206
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,840
in your own righteousness,

1207
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,160
it's just a bunch of filthy rags.

1208
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,840
And I don't say that to be unkind.

1209
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:35,520
I'm telling you what the Bible says in Isaiah 64.

1210
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,680
The reality is that as we look at the truth

1211
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,760
of the Word of God and we understand this truth

1212
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,080
of the atonement and what it provided for us

1213
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,960
not only in salvation, but in sanctification.

1214
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,280
In walking a life that is pleasing.

1215
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,800
Remember what Paul says in the book of Ephesians

1216
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:54,760
in chapter number five.

1217
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,640
Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

1218
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,960
And we come to the third verse

1219
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,600
of 1 John chapter number three

1220
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,400
after he speaks about the return

1221
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,640
and the truth of Christ's return

1222
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,840
and how it should impact and influence us.

1223
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,720
It says in every man,

1224
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,800
that's every individual,

1225
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:18,200
that hath this hope in him.

1226
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,040
Pause.

1227
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,200
I know the verse isn't done there.

1228
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,120
There's not even a comma there.

1229
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:21,960
I don't believe.

1230
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,880
But I want you to pause.

1231
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,560
Do you have that hope within you?

1232
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,040
If you don't, you need to get it in you

1233
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,200
because it's a Bible truth.

1234
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,040
Amen?

1235
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,280
You say, but I'm just hoping he doesn't come yet

1236
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,680
because there's some things I wanna do.

1237
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,400
Man, you don't understand that Christ is better.

1238
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,160
You don't understand that he's superior.

1239
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,520
You don't understand that there's nothing

1240
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,280
the world can offer you that comes close.

1241
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,000
If we have this hope,

1242
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,320
it says every man that hath this hope in him

1243
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,680
purifieth himself,

1244
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:03,440
even as he is pure.

1245
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,760
The songwriter wrote a song,

1246
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:10,600
nothing between my soul and my savior.

1247
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,560
How can we have that?

1248
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:16,880
Because of what Christ did on the cross of Calvary.

1249
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,440
Because of that atonement,

1250
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,560
because of what he provides for us

1251
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:23,400
even as we walk here upon this earth.

1252
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,640
You say, but it's hard.

1253
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,880
The devil's attacking.

1254
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,400
I know he's real and he's active.

1255
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,040
I understand it.

1256
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,840
But can I tell you that greater is he that is in you

1257
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,320
than he that is in the world.

1258
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,560
We are more than conquerors through Christ.

1259
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,960
We are on the winning side.

1260
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,560
We do have victory.

1261
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,320
And if we have this hope,

1262
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:47,920
if we're influenced and impacted by the Bible truth,

1263
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,560
then we purify ourselves,

1264
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,480
even as he is pure.

1265
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,640
We say, I don't want there to be anything

1266
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,200
between my soul and my savior.

1267
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,760
I asked you this morning,

1268
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,280
would you be ashamed of his coming?

1269
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,960
Have you purified yourself?

1270
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,640
Are you able to say, as the songwriter wrote,

1271
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,600
there's nothing between my soul and my savior?

1272
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,920
I'm not asking you if you're perfect

1273
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,720
because none of us are perfect.

1274
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,720
But I'm asking you this,

1275
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,240
are you living in sin?

1276
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,520
Are you being attacked by the enemy?

1277
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,720
Are you giving place to the devil?

1278
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,440
Because he's real and he's active.

1279
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,120
If there's known sin,

1280
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,880
oh, thank God that you have an advocate with the Father.

1281
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,640
You can have forgiveness and restoration

1282
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,600
and the joy of your salvation

1283
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,200
that the devil stole from you.

1284
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,440
This morning, we look at Hebrews 9.

1285
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,960
It could have been three separate messages,

1286
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,080
but I tried to put it all together.

1287
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:54,080
The atonement, the appointment, and the appearing.

1288
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,840
Jesus Christ is coming again.

1289
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,119
I know I've mentioned this before,

1290
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:03,520
Holly was in a singing group in college.

1291
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,920
They never let me join one of those tour groups.

1292
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,760
We won't go there.

1293
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:11,720
She was in a tour group.

1294
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:14,160
There was a song that they sang that was impactful.

1295
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,200
It wasn't the most beautiful song I ever heard

1296
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:21,799
from a melody, whatever kind of perspective.

1297
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:25,559
But the question throughout the song was this,

1298
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:26,440
are you ready?

1299
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,760
Are you ready, are you ready?

1300
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,679
It would repeat it, repeat it, repeat it.

1301
00:59:30,679 --> 00:59:33,840
Are you ready for the coming of the Lord?

1302
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,920
Because he could come today.

1303
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,480
I don't want to be ashamed of his appearing.

1304
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,440
Can I tell you this morning?

1305
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,239
Look, you look, I'm not, I don't have my head in the sand.

1306
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,520
You look at our world, you see what's going on.

1307
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,520
God's people need revival.

1308
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,640
We need revival.

1309
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:59,960
We need to understand the seriousness of walking with Christ.

1310
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,840
and understand what his atonement not only provides for me

1311
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:05,360
in eternal security and eternal salvation,

1312
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:08,840
but what it can enable me to do here even now

1313
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,160
in walking in victory.

1314
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:14,860
The death of the testator, he had to die,

1315
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:17,140
and I'm so thankful that he did.

1316
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:21,860
Again, our approach to the cross is much different

1317
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:26,460
than these original recipients would have been.

1318
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,980
And so we find that the writer is saying,

1319
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:32,020
here's why, and here's what's accomplished.

1320
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:35,020
Praise God for the cross.

1321
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:35,860
Father, we love you.

1322
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:37,440
We thank you for loving us.

1323
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,700
We thank you for the word of God,

1324
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,940
the truth contained therein.

1325
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,480
God, I pray this morning,

1326
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:48,020
the Holy Spirit of God would work as only he can.

1327
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,580
God, I've sought this morning to use your word

1328
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,020
and to preach your word.

1329
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:57,020
I've sought to give the sense of it,

1330
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,260
to make the application,

1331
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:08,460
to draw the line in the sand, so to speak,

1332
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:12,820
as Moses did when he said,

1333
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:15,560
who is on the Lord's side?

1334
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:20,560
God, if there's one not sure of heaven,

1335
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,940
would you help him today to be saved?

1336
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,440
God, if there's one this morning,

1337
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,860
that if they're honest before you,

1338
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,200
they'd have to admit that there have been activities

1339
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,500
that they've been engaged in in recent days,

1340
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,800
weeks, months, years, however long it's been,

1341
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,080
that if you would have appeared,

1342
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,480
they would have been ashamed.

1343
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:50,720
They've not purified themselves.

1344
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,640
What I believe for each one of us,

1345
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,400
because we'll never be perfect until we get to heaven,

1346
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,960
there's a need to purify ourselves.

1347
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,600
So we think about the truth of John 13.

1348
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,160
The disciples' feet got dirty

1349
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,640
because they were in the world.

1350
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:16,600
We're in the world, but we're not of the world.

1351
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,600
We're thankful for the cleansing power

1352
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,560
of your word and the blood.

1353
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,960
I pray that you'd have your will and way,

1354
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,260
that decisions would be made,

1355
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:29,640
that we truly would reflect on the truth of thy word

1356
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:33,400
and say, can I honestly say, ask ourselves,

1357
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:36,720
can I say there's nothing between my soul and my savior?

1358
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,040
Not asking if I'm perfect.

1359
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,120
Is there a known sin?

1360
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,560
Have you given place to the devil?

1361
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,640
Are you playing with fire?

1362
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,200
Run to the cross.

1363
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:51,560
Understand that Jesus is better.

1364
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,800
There's nothing that old serpent,

1365
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:57,040
that old liar, the devil, can offer you

1366
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,520
that would even pale in comparison

1367
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,180
to what Christ has provided.

1368
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:03,680
Lord, would you have your way?

1369
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,880
It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

1370
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:08,840
Would you stand with me?

1371
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:11,240
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

1372
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:12,160
No one's looking around.

1373
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,840
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

1374
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,760
Come to this old-fashioned altar.

1375
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,400
Make your seat an altar.

1376
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:21,960
Get along with God.

1377
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,320
Let God have his way.

1378
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,040
I beg you not to allow it to just be

1379
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:31,120
another Sunday checkbox.

1380
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,740
Went to church.

1381
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:35,440
Let God have his way in your life as Kimberly plays.
