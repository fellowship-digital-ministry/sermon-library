00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
9, verses 15-28.

00:00:02.359 --> 00:00:04.619
Really, as we look at the passage of Scripture,

00:00:04.619 --> 00:00:07.019
I'll begin reading in v. 15.

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:10.600
We understand that part of the thought

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.260
that we finished last week's message with

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.319
is a continuation into this week.

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:17.139
And so, we'll mention several things

00:00:17.139 --> 00:00:18.280
by way of introduction.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.079
But look at v. 15.

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:20.840
The Bible says,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.180
"...and for this cause He,"

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.780
speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.079
God in flesh,

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:27.860
"...He is the mediator of the New Testament,

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.500
that by means of death,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.840
for the redemption of the transgressions

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.439
that were under the first testament,

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:38.459
they which are called might receive

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:42.060
the promise of eternal inheritance.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.900
For where a testament is,"

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.459
notice v. 16,

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:48.740
"...there must also of necessity

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.979
be the death of the testator.

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:55.259
For a testament is of force after men are dead,

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:58.659
but otherwise it is of no strength at all

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.319
while the testator liveth."

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:03.159
We look at this passage of Scripture.

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.260
We'll actually go through the end of chapter 9 this morning.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.199
I've simply entitled the message there

00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:09.580
from v. 16-17,

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.519
The Death of the Testator.

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:13.919
And you look at the passage of Scripture

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:16.059
and you understand the entirety

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:18.099
of what we're dealing with in the book of Hebrews

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:20.879
and the main thought and the subject matter

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:24.860
and how the writer exalts the Lord Jesus Christ

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.339
and proves His superiority.

00:01:27.339 --> 00:01:29.400
And what a joy to understand

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.959
how these original recipients of this book

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:34.559
that is titled Hebrews,

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:36.559
and we are mindful of that

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:37.919
which they were dealing with

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:39.379
and the immense pressure

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:41.180
to return to Judaism

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.680
coupled with the fact that they were living

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.080
under intensified persecution

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.040
at the hand of Nero.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.940
And you think about those two factors

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.160
and you think about all that they were dealing with

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.959
and how the content of this book,

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:56.180
the book of Hebrews,

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.080
would provide them with encouragement.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.639
It would provide them with instruction.

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:04.540
And we find this morning in 2020,

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.660
a couple thousand years almost

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.979
since the original writing of this book,

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.360
we find that still today,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.119
the people of God are in need of encouragement.

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:19.160
We're in need of instruction.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.580
And we find that the content of this book

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.759
will help us in our daily walk with God.

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.440
It will remind us over and over

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.899
as we read the book of Hebrews,

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:30.320
as we study the book of Hebrews,

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.520
that Jesus is superior.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.160
He is better.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.199
There's nothing better than you're ever going to get.

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:40.080
Amen?

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.119
There's no other world system.

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:45.279
There's no other religious system.

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:47.580
There's no other thing

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.220
that is better than Jesus.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.199
The reality, however,

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:55.020
is that we have an enemy

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.020
that is seeking to devour and destroy.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.240
We have an enemy that seeks to say to you

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.940
and to say to me

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.240
that this is better.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.199
Is it true?

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:11.720
He walketh about seeking whom He may devour.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.679
And He says this is better.

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:16.259
And we say, no, we have Jesus.

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:20.440
Nothing is better than Jesus.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.520
No thing that the world can offer you

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.360
is better than Jesus.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.559
No promotion, no person, no popularity.

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:35.380
Nothing is better than Jesus.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.639
Not only does the passage of Scripture tell us

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.520
as we study the book of Hebrews as a whole

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.199
that Jesus is superior,

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.139
but we find that after spending

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.580
and laboring through 11 chapters

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.779
and really the first 10,

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:50.259
we know that in chapter 11,

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:52.179
dealing with the example of those

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:53.699
that lived by faith,

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.339
we come and we find that the writer says

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:59.500
because Jesus is so much better,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.179
because He is superior,

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:03.880
look to Him.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.580
Looking unto Jesus.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.979
Our theme for this year

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:08.740
from Hebrews 12.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.179
And we understand the truth of looking to Him.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.839
And can I tell you that as we gaze upon our Savior,

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:18.880
as we fix our eyes upon our Savior,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.799
that the things of this world

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.200
will grow strangely dim.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.000
The songwriter penned those words.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.079
Run your race.

00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:31.459
The truth from the book of Hebrews.

00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:35.359
Listen, he didn't say the race was going to be easy.

00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:38.920
He didn't say there would be no obstacles

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.119
or hindrances.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.859
Difficulties along the way.

00:04:42.859 --> 00:04:45.940
But he said run your race when or how

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.619
as you're looking to your Savior.

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:51.100
And understanding that He will give you

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.179
what you need to run that race.

00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:56.820
Paul said that there was an open door.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.820
Great and effectual.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.619
But there were many adversaries.

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:05.140
We read throughout the passages

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.260
of the Old Testament,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.540
we see how that as the work of God

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.420
would go forward in the book of Ezra

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.480
and Nehemiah,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.239
you find that they were constantly

00:05:13.239 --> 00:05:17.600
met with opposition.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.440
I believe that as we look at Hebrews,

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.519
we are reminded that heaven is real.

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:23.839
Heaven is real.

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:26.040
This world is not my home.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.679
I'm just a passing through.

00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:30.239
We're looking for a better city.

00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:31.239
Heavenly.

00:05:31.239 --> 00:05:32.239
Amen?

00:05:32.239 --> 00:05:34.559
And as we come to look at the text

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:36.799
of Hebrews as a whole, as a book,

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:41.019
we are reminded of those great truths of Scripture.

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:43.500
And we continue in this 9th chapter

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.100
and we find that here as we're going

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.459
through this process and the reality

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:49.739
this morning as we get in really

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:50.739
to the beginning of the message

00:05:50.739 --> 00:05:54.459
is that we find that for us today,

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:56.380
that we look at the cross

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.100
as being something wonderful.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.540
Because we understand that it was there

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.019
at the cross that my Savior bled and died.

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:06.540
It was there at the cross that He did

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:10.880
that which He had come to this earth to do.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.440
But you understand for the Jewish people

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.359
at the original time of this writing,

00:06:14.359 --> 00:06:16.119
in fact, many times even still today

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:18.359
as we see in the book of 1 Corinthians,

00:06:18.359 --> 00:06:22.279
that the cross is a stumbling block.

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:25.239
They ask this question immediately

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:28.839
following the timing of the life and death

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:30.399
and of course the resurrection

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:31.519
and the ascension of Christ

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:33.079
and all that's moving forward

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:34.440
with the early church

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.640
and all that's taking place

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.739
and you find that there are many

00:06:37.739 --> 00:06:41.980
that would say, why did He have to die?

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.299
The death of Christ really kind of

00:06:44.299 --> 00:06:47.820
adversely affected many that were Jews.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.500
Why? Because they were looking for a Messiah

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.179
who was going to set up a kingdom,

00:06:51.179 --> 00:06:52.660
who was going to deal with the Romans,

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.059
who was going to do all of those things

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:57.500
and they missed the fact that the Old Testament

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.820
had consistently given the truth,

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.739
the picture, the typology

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.000
that the Messiah would die

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.160
for the sins of the world.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.320
And so as we look at this passage of Scripture,

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.519
we find that as the writer is kind of again

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:17.160
peeling back another peel of the onion

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.959
and providing another glimpse

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:22.679
into the understanding that He's better.

00:07:22.679 --> 00:07:24.959
Why? He's a better priest

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:26.959
and He served in a better place, right?

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:28.839
The sanctuary in heaven.

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:30.600
That true tabernacle.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.600
He presented a better offering.

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:35.579
It was His own blood.

00:07:35.579 --> 00:07:39.079
And we find that He gave us through that

00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:41.299
a better gift.

00:07:41.299 --> 00:07:42.700
And as we look at the truth

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.940
of what the passage that we're dealing with

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.540
in Hebrews 9 is dealing with,

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.579
we come and we notice first of all,

00:07:48.579 --> 00:07:50.640
if you're taking notes,

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.899
it's the bulk of the section

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:53.100
in which we'll be dealing with.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.380
In fact, as I mentioned,

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.820
that really the latter part of last week's message

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.140
goes right into it.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.380
And it's this, number one,

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.579
notice the atonement of Christ.

00:08:03.559 --> 00:08:06.320
That word atonement is the expiation of sin

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.320
made by the obedience and suffering of Christ.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.200
We understand when we speak about the death of Christ,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.200
we understand that as He said there in John 17,

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.760
the hour has come.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.119
Jesus understood the purpose

00:08:21.119 --> 00:08:22.920
in which He came to this earth.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.839
In fact, earlier in the book of John,

00:08:24.839 --> 00:08:27.160
He mentions about destroying this temple

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.160
and in three days I'll raise it up.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.040
And speaking of His own body

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.479
and of course, not only the death,

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:33.900
but the resurrection.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.619
You remember that during the time

00:08:35.619 --> 00:08:37.099
in which the Lord Jesus Christ

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:39.340
interacted with His disciples and He said,

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.059
whom do men say that I am?

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:44.580
And then He says, but who do you say that I am?

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.059
And after Peter stands up with great boldness

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:49.500
and says, thou art the Christ,

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.520
the Son of the living God,

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.820
we find that Jesus,

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.700
if you look at the text of Scripture,

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.500
He then began to share with them

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.979
the things that would shortly come to pass

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.320
concerning what?

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.719
His death and His resurrection.

00:09:04.719 --> 00:09:06.440
And so we notice the atonement of Christ

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.039
as we look at those few verses

00:09:08.039 --> 00:09:08.960
that we've mentioned.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.440
Actually, back up into verse 12.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.200
The Bible says,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.039
neither by the blood of goats and calves,

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:14.159
but by His own blood,

00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:17.760
He entered in once into the holy place,

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.919
having obtained eternal redemption for us.

00:09:21.919 --> 00:09:23.880
Remember, He went to a better place,

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.479
the heavenly tabernacle.

00:09:26.479 --> 00:09:28.320
He offered a better sacrifice.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.539
It was His own blood,

00:09:29.539 --> 00:09:31.460
not the blood of bulls and goats.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.739
And we find that He obtained for us

00:09:34.739 --> 00:09:39.619
a better gift, eternal redemption.

00:09:39.619 --> 00:09:41.580
We see it unfolded in verse 12.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.020
The Bible says that He entered in once.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.380
As I mentioned last week,

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.900
as we look at that phraseology

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.580
and we even couple it with what we find

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.020
in verse 26,

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.900
the latter part of verse 26,

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.619
but now once in the end of the world

00:09:55.619 --> 00:09:57.299
hath He appeared to put away sin

00:09:57.299 --> 00:09:59.859
by the sacrifice of Himself.

00:09:59.859 --> 00:10:02.159
It's interesting as we understand

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:04.419
the beginning of the ninth chapter

00:10:04.419 --> 00:10:05.619
of the book of Hebrews

00:10:05.619 --> 00:10:09.019
dealing with the earthly tabernacle

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:10.659
and dealing with the holy place

00:10:10.659 --> 00:10:11.819
and the Holy of Holies.

00:10:11.819 --> 00:10:13.019
And I told you last week

00:10:13.019 --> 00:10:14.459
that what was in view

00:10:14.459 --> 00:10:16.979
was really the Day of Atonement.

00:10:16.979 --> 00:10:19.139
And it's interesting because we understand

00:10:19.139 --> 00:10:21.059
that it says that He entered in once.

00:10:21.059 --> 00:10:23.539
Not only did He only go in once,

00:10:23.539 --> 00:10:25.259
but He only had to do it once.

00:10:25.259 --> 00:10:26.539
Once for all.

00:10:26.539 --> 00:10:27.859
The High Priest,

00:10:27.859 --> 00:10:30.059
when He would go in on the Day of Atonement,

00:10:30.059 --> 00:10:32.299
He would enter in that first time

00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:34.739
to present the blood of a bull

00:10:34.739 --> 00:10:36.659
for His own sins.

00:10:36.659 --> 00:10:38.859
And then He would come out

00:10:38.859 --> 00:10:42.299
and He'd have to go in a second time.

00:10:42.299 --> 00:10:44.579
Look at Leviticus 16. You can see it.

00:10:44.579 --> 00:10:46.139
With the blood of the goat.

00:10:46.139 --> 00:10:48.339
Why? For the sins of the people.

00:10:48.339 --> 00:10:50.259
Jesus had no sin.

00:10:50.259 --> 00:10:52.179
The just for the unjust.

00:10:52.179 --> 00:10:54.899
Therefore, He only had to enter

00:10:54.899 --> 00:10:58.379
into the Holy of Holies once

00:10:58.379 --> 00:11:01.179
to present His perfect, sinless blood.

00:11:01.179 --> 00:11:02.459
And by the way,

00:11:02.459 --> 00:11:05.379
as you look at the truth of the Day of Atonement,

00:11:05.379 --> 00:11:07.339
not only did the High Priest go in twice

00:11:07.339 --> 00:11:08.699
on that same day,

00:11:08.699 --> 00:11:10.779
but then next year it would have to be repeated

00:11:10.779 --> 00:11:14.419
and the year after that and the year after that.

00:11:14.419 --> 00:11:17.739
But with the sacrifice of Jesus, it's not so.

00:11:17.739 --> 00:11:19.859
We see the atonement of Christ.

00:11:19.859 --> 00:11:20.979
It's in full view.

00:11:20.979 --> 00:11:23.819
We understand that it's a substitutionary atonement.

00:11:23.859 --> 00:11:25.339
He took your place.

00:11:25.339 --> 00:11:26.419
He took my place.

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:28.379
We understand that it was a blood atonement

00:11:28.379 --> 00:11:31.099
as we continue looking through the passage of Scripture.

00:11:31.099 --> 00:11:34.019
Pick it up with me in verse 18.

00:11:34.019 --> 00:11:34.859
The Bible says,

00:11:34.859 --> 00:11:36.619
"...whereupon neither the First Testament

00:11:36.619 --> 00:11:38.819
was dedicated without blood.

00:11:38.819 --> 00:11:40.939
Notice, for when Moses had spoken

00:11:40.939 --> 00:11:42.899
every precept to all the people

00:11:42.899 --> 00:11:44.179
according to the law,

00:11:44.179 --> 00:11:46.779
he took the blood of calves and of goats

00:11:46.779 --> 00:11:49.699
with water and scarlet wool and hyssop

00:11:49.699 --> 00:11:52.379
and sprinkled both the book and all the people,

00:11:52.419 --> 00:11:55.099
saying, this is the blood of the Testament

00:11:55.099 --> 00:11:58.419
which God hath enjoined unto you.

00:11:58.419 --> 00:12:00.859
Moreover, he sprinkled with blood

00:12:00.859 --> 00:12:02.899
both the tabernacle and all the vessels

00:12:02.899 --> 00:12:04.299
of the ministry.

00:12:04.299 --> 00:12:05.899
And almost all things are by the law

00:12:05.899 --> 00:12:07.579
purged with blood,

00:12:07.579 --> 00:12:12.139
and without shedding of blood is no remission."

00:12:12.139 --> 00:12:13.939
What is the writer saying to these believers?

00:12:13.939 --> 00:12:15.779
What is he saying to us this morning?

00:12:15.779 --> 00:12:20.019
The death of Christ was absolutely necessary.

00:12:20.059 --> 00:12:22.459
We find that as we read in v. 16,

00:12:22.459 --> 00:12:24.539
it says for where a Testament is,

00:12:24.539 --> 00:12:27.179
there must also of necessity

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:30.019
be the death of the testator.

00:12:30.019 --> 00:12:32.179
As we understand that truth

00:12:32.179 --> 00:12:33.779
and we understand through His death

00:12:33.779 --> 00:12:35.299
and glorious resurrection

00:12:35.299 --> 00:12:37.819
that the promise of eternal redemption

00:12:37.819 --> 00:12:40.459
can now be received.

00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:43.099
See, the reality is that at the end of v. 15,

00:12:43.099 --> 00:12:45.099
it says they which are called

00:12:45.099 --> 00:12:49.459
might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.

00:12:49.499 --> 00:12:50.939
Remember, in v. 12,

00:12:50.939 --> 00:12:52.339
He said that He had obtained

00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:55.819
eternal redemption for us.

00:12:55.819 --> 00:12:59.019
How many of you have a will?

00:12:59.019 --> 00:13:00.499
Not very many of you.

00:13:00.499 --> 00:13:02.539
You need to go see a lawyer or something.

00:13:02.539 --> 00:13:05.019
I'm not trying to get anything on the side.

00:13:05.019 --> 00:13:07.619
I'm just simply saying it's common, right?

00:13:07.619 --> 00:13:10.419
People have wills.

00:13:10.419 --> 00:13:13.899
The reality is that if you have a will,

00:13:13.899 --> 00:13:17.179
until you are deceased,

00:13:17.219 --> 00:13:19.419
it is not in effect.

00:13:19.419 --> 00:13:21.419
Correct?

00:13:21.419 --> 00:13:22.939
In fact, I am often reminded,

00:13:22.939 --> 00:13:24.699
though my dad's not here this morning,

00:13:24.699 --> 00:13:26.219
I believe he's watching live stream,

00:13:26.219 --> 00:13:28.699
he has a will.

00:13:28.699 --> 00:13:30.099
And he'll say something like this

00:13:30.099 --> 00:13:31.579
every once in a while.

00:13:31.579 --> 00:13:34.579
I'm going to change my will.

00:13:34.579 --> 00:13:35.859
Right? Doesn't he?

00:13:35.859 --> 00:13:37.739
Taking you out of my will.

00:13:37.739 --> 00:13:39.579
Why can he say that?

00:13:39.579 --> 00:13:42.739
Because he's still alive.

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:43.659
You have a will.

00:13:43.659 --> 00:13:46.579
It can be changed if you're alive.

00:13:46.619 --> 00:13:50.859
What probates the will is the death.

00:13:50.859 --> 00:13:52.299
Correct?

00:13:52.299 --> 00:13:54.219
So understand that as we're looking

00:13:54.219 --> 00:13:55.859
at the passage of Scripture,

00:13:55.859 --> 00:13:58.299
and we find that the writer of Hebrews

00:13:58.299 --> 00:14:01.579
is presenting to these Jewish believers

00:14:01.579 --> 00:14:04.459
that it was absolutely imperative,

00:14:04.459 --> 00:14:08.939
it was necessary for Christ to die.

00:14:08.939 --> 00:14:12.099
We find that all the way back in Genesis.

00:14:12.099 --> 00:14:13.739
We find that in chapter 3,

00:14:13.739 --> 00:14:15.179
when sin entered into the world,

00:14:15.219 --> 00:14:17.619
you see the truth in Genesis 3

00:14:17.619 --> 00:14:20.979
in verse 15 concerning the first mention

00:14:20.979 --> 00:14:22.979
of the truth that God Himself,

00:14:22.979 --> 00:14:24.500
the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.779
would die for the sins of man.

00:14:27.779 --> 00:14:30.259
You find that there in Genesis 3,

00:14:30.259 --> 00:14:32.379
immediately after Adam and Eve

00:14:32.379 --> 00:14:33.779
committed the sin,

00:14:33.779 --> 00:14:34.779
what did they try to do?

00:14:34.779 --> 00:14:36.299
They tried to cover it with the works

00:14:36.299 --> 00:14:37.419
of their own hands,

00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:39.819
with the fig leaves that they sowed together,

00:14:39.819 --> 00:14:43.539
but it was not accepted.

00:14:43.539 --> 00:14:45.019
What did God do?

00:14:45.099 --> 00:14:47.059
He sacrificed an animal

00:14:47.059 --> 00:14:51.219
and He made a coat of skins.

00:14:51.219 --> 00:14:52.500
From that day forward,

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.779
you read, as you think about Cain and Abel,

00:14:55.779 --> 00:14:58.339
the reality of the accepted offering

00:14:58.339 --> 00:15:00.779
was the one that was blood.

00:15:00.779 --> 00:15:02.739
And you go through the whole

00:15:02.739 --> 00:15:03.859
of the Old Testament,

00:15:03.859 --> 00:15:06.539
and you see that God has designed it

00:15:06.539 --> 00:15:09.179
such that without shedding of blood

00:15:09.179 --> 00:15:11.579
is no remission.

00:15:11.579 --> 00:15:13.459
And therefore, God Himself,

00:15:13.459 --> 00:15:14.659
the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:15:14.699 --> 00:15:16.939
He would go to the cross of Calvary

00:15:16.939 --> 00:15:19.379
and He would shed His precious blood

00:15:19.379 --> 00:15:22.339
so that that which He had promised

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:25.859
could be obtained.

00:15:25.859 --> 00:15:28.419
We find that what had been pictured

00:15:28.419 --> 00:15:31.699
has now been purchased.

00:15:31.699 --> 00:15:33.939
We find the necessity.

00:15:33.939 --> 00:15:35.739
We see the Old Testament type

00:15:35.739 --> 00:15:37.739
in the verses that we just read

00:15:37.739 --> 00:15:38.979
speaking of Moses

00:15:38.979 --> 00:15:43.739
and how He took and He sprinkled that blood.

00:15:43.739 --> 00:15:45.259
The people. The book.

00:15:45.259 --> 00:15:46.299
And all that He did.

00:15:46.299 --> 00:15:48.099
He talks about the fact that He

00:15:48.099 --> 00:15:50.219
did all those vessels of the ministry.

00:15:50.219 --> 00:15:52.339
And you look back in the books of Exodus

00:15:52.339 --> 00:15:53.179
and Leviticus,

00:15:53.179 --> 00:15:54.939
and you see the carrying out

00:15:54.939 --> 00:15:58.459
and the reference in which the writer is making.

00:15:58.459 --> 00:15:59.739
And we're mindful this morning

00:15:59.739 --> 00:16:01.699
of this wonderful truth again

00:16:01.699 --> 00:16:04.179
as we think about the death of Christ

00:16:04.179 --> 00:16:05.899
and His glorious resurrection.

00:16:05.899 --> 00:16:07.779
We find that the offering of Himself

00:16:07.779 --> 00:16:09.819
was accepted.

00:16:09.819 --> 00:16:12.459
It was an acceptable offering.

00:16:12.459 --> 00:16:14.500
In verse 23 of our text of Scripture,

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:14.939
it says,

00:16:14.939 --> 00:16:16.500
it was therefore necessary...

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.819
We see that word again.

00:16:17.819 --> 00:16:20.459
That the patterns of things in the heavens

00:16:20.459 --> 00:16:22.739
should be purified with these,

00:16:22.739 --> 00:16:24.619
but the heavenly things themselves

00:16:24.619 --> 00:16:28.099
with better sacrifices than these.

00:16:28.099 --> 00:16:30.899
For Christ is not entered into the holy places

00:16:30.899 --> 00:16:32.539
made with hands,

00:16:32.539 --> 00:16:36.339
which are the figures of the true,

00:16:36.339 --> 00:16:38.139
but into heaven itself,

00:16:38.139 --> 00:16:42.059
now to appear in the presence of God for us.

00:16:42.099 --> 00:16:45.019
For yet, that He should offer Himself often

00:16:45.019 --> 00:16:47.139
as the high priest entereth into the holy place

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:49.779
every year with blood of others.

00:16:49.779 --> 00:16:52.819
For then must He often have suffered

00:16:52.819 --> 00:16:54.939
since the foundation of the world.

00:16:54.939 --> 00:16:56.500
But now once in the end of the world

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.859
hath He appeared to put away sin

00:16:58.859 --> 00:17:02.219
by the sacrifice of Himself.

00:17:02.219 --> 00:17:04.139
Let's look at several passages of Scripture

00:17:04.139 --> 00:17:06.779
throughout the Word of God this morning.

00:17:06.779 --> 00:17:08.899
Look over to the book of Philippians if you will.

00:17:08.899 --> 00:17:11.339
I'm going to reference a number of passages

00:17:11.379 --> 00:17:13.059
and hope that we understand

00:17:13.059 --> 00:17:16.219
not only the necessity of the death of Christ

00:17:16.219 --> 00:17:17.339
and His shed blood,

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:18.939
but we understand this morning

00:17:18.939 --> 00:17:20.819
what it accomplished.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:22.859
How that our redemption was paid for

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:24.259
with the blood of Christ.

00:17:24.259 --> 00:17:26.339
How that the problem of sin

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:29.619
is dealt with only with the blood of Christ.

00:17:29.619 --> 00:17:31.699
And is dealt with once and for all.

00:17:31.699 --> 00:17:33.779
And what a joy that is.

00:17:33.779 --> 00:17:36.019
Remember, I mentioned last week

00:17:36.019 --> 00:17:38.939
how that the Old Testament sacrificial system

00:17:38.939 --> 00:17:43.699
was a constant reminder of sin

00:17:43.699 --> 00:17:46.019
while the sacrificial offering of Christ

00:17:46.019 --> 00:17:51.419
once for all offers remission for sin.

00:17:51.419 --> 00:17:54.099
What a blessing.

00:17:54.099 --> 00:17:55.659
We find in the book of Philippians

00:17:55.659 --> 00:17:58.419
in chapter 2, beginning in verse 5,

00:17:58.419 --> 00:17:59.259
the Bible says,

00:17:59.259 --> 00:18:00.299
let this mind be in you,

00:18:00.299 --> 00:18:02.579
which was also in Christ Jesus,

00:18:02.579 --> 00:18:03.939
who being in the form of God

00:18:03.939 --> 00:18:06.059
thought it not robbery to be equal with God.

00:18:06.059 --> 00:18:07.779
Why? Because He is God.

00:18:07.779 --> 00:18:08.419
Verse 7,

00:18:08.419 --> 00:18:11.059
But made Himself of no reputation

00:18:11.059 --> 00:18:13.139
and took upon Him the form of a servant,

00:18:13.139 --> 00:18:14.659
was made in the likeness of men.

00:18:14.659 --> 00:18:15.699
Notice verse 8,

00:18:15.699 --> 00:18:17.619
And being found in fashion as a man,

00:18:17.619 --> 00:18:19.939
He humbled Himself

00:18:19.939 --> 00:18:22.059
and became obedient unto death,

00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:26.539
even the death of the cross.

00:18:26.539 --> 00:18:30.899
My sin, O the bliss of this glorious thought,

00:18:30.899 --> 00:18:36.459
my sin, not in part, but the whole,

00:18:36.459 --> 00:18:40.299
is nailed to His cross,

00:18:40.299 --> 00:18:42.299
and I bear it no more.

00:18:42.299 --> 00:18:44.940
Praise the Lord! Amen?

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.859
Look at Colossians, if you will,

00:18:46.859 --> 00:18:49.019
and notice in chapter 2,

00:18:49.019 --> 00:18:51.500
in verse 14,

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.219
the Bible says,

00:18:52.219 --> 00:18:56.179
blotting out the handwriting of ordinances

00:18:56.179 --> 00:18:58.380
that was against us,

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.140
which was contrary to us,

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.979
and took it out of the way,

00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:07.979
nailing it to His cross.

00:19:07.979 --> 00:19:09.260
Do you know this morning

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.779
that every sin that you've ever committed

00:19:11.779 --> 00:19:16.779
was future when Jesus died?

00:19:16.779 --> 00:19:19.380
You say that's not very deep.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.140
I understand.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.700
But we need to be reminded of that.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:24.700
Why?

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.940
Because we sing, even as our family in the past

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:27.899
has sung that song,

00:19:27.899 --> 00:19:29.659
it's under the blood.

00:19:29.659 --> 00:19:32.739
Listen, there is an accuser of the brethren

00:19:32.739 --> 00:19:34.219
in Revelation 12.

00:19:34.219 --> 00:19:36.140
I understand you don't need to turn there.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.299
It's about the midpoint of the tribulation.

00:19:38.299 --> 00:19:39.779
And you understand the Bible speaks

00:19:39.779 --> 00:19:41.940
about the accuser of the brethren.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.459
And He is.

00:19:43.459 --> 00:19:45.179
And here's an interesting truth

00:19:45.179 --> 00:19:47.820
that is given with regard to our adversary.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.179
The Bible says that He came down to them.

00:19:50.179 --> 00:19:52.219
Again, I understand contextually

00:19:52.219 --> 00:19:54.419
in the midst of the tribulation,

00:19:54.419 --> 00:19:56.700
but it says having great wrath.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.419
Why?

00:19:58.419 --> 00:20:00.140
Because He knoweth?

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:03.340
that He hath but a short time.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.420
I believe this morning,

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.080
more than I've ever believed it,

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.260
that our Enemy is real

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.760
and He is active.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.260
He is active.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.020
But we have the blood.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.100
We have the blood!

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.220
And this morning, as we understand

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.040
the atonement of Christ

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.940
and we understand what was accomplished

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.020
through the atonement,

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.220
we understand this morning

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.460
that we rejoice in it.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.500
We see glory in the cross.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.860
But again, for these Jewish believers,

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.700
and even still to this day,

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.580
many Jewish folks have a challenge

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.300
speaking about the cross.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.420
And we find that Paul reveals to us

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.340
as he's writing to the believers in Corinth

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:46.540
in 1 Corinthians 1,

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.700
he's speaking often about the preaching

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.500
of the cross.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.420
But he says in verse 23,

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.020
but we preach Christ crucified

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.980
unto the Jews a stumbling block

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.220
and unto the Greeks foolishness.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.380
But, verse 24,

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.500
unto them which are called

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.060
both Jews and Greeks,

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:11.220
Christ, the power of God,

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.020
and the wisdom of God.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.100
I'm so thankful for the privilege

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:18.780
and the opportunity to preach the cross.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.740
To understand what happened

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.620
on the cross of Calvary

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.340
and how the wrath of God

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:29.460
was poured out upon the Son of God.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:30.860
God Himself.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.940
He hath made Him to be sin for us

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.900
who knew no sin

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.060
that we might be made

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:42.500
the righteousness of God in Him.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.140
We find that as we look at the passage of Scripture

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.460
and we are mindful of what was accomplished

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:48.900
on the cross of Calvary,

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.780
I want you to understand this morning

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.860
that as a child of God,

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.940
you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.020
as your Savior,

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.220
that it was the payment of His blood

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.380
that allowed for you to receive that free gift.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.260
But can I tell you this morning

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:09.580
that the enemy's still working?

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.100
We find that the Bible would reveal to us

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.500
as we mentioned in previous messages

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.500
the truth of 1 John 1

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.540
and even going into the second chapter

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.460
about the fact that the sin

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.700
in the life of a believer,

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.300
if we confess our sins,

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.900
He is faithful and just to forgive us

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.380
from our sins and to cleanse us

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.460
from all unrighteousness.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.580
What a wonderful truth.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.620
What a wonderful promise of the Word of God.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.700
See, this morning,

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:43.780
turn over if you will to the book of Jeremiah.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.900
I'm going to go to Isaiah in a moment,

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:49.700
but I want to start here in Jeremiah 2.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.380
Because I want you to understand

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.580
the power of the blood.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:56.180
We sing about the power of the blood, right?

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.220
There's power, power,

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.500
wonder-working power.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.460
We sing about the blood

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:04.780
in many references.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.660
Are you washed in the blood?

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:12.260
In the soul-cleansing blood of the Lamb?

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.380
When we sing that chorus,

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.420
I love to say these words.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.100
When it says, are you washed in the blood?

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.500
I love to say, yes, I am.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.460
Isn't that wonderful?

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:23.580
Notice in Jeremiah,

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.940
you understand that the people of God

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.700
are under a great indictment.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.900
In fact, as you look at the second chapter

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.180
of the book of Jeremiah,

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.460
you will find many things

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.900
with regard to the indictment

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.740
that is laid against the nation of Judah.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:37.940
And you would understand

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.380
that they had forsaken God.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.780
Why? Because they had forgotten God.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:44.700
And because they had forgotten God

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:45.980
and forsaken God,

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:51.140
they followed after idols.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.100
We find that throughout the Old Testament

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.980
in many of the messages of the prophets,

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.460
amend your ways.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.220
Right?

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.820
Look at what God says in Jeremiah 2

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:04.500
in verse 22.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.940
For though thou wash thee with niter

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.060
and take thee much soap,

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:13.900
yet thine iniquity is marked before Me,

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:19.260
saith the Lord God.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.940
Niter and soap doesn't do it.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.540
It doesn't work.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:27.020
By the way, these are two very powerful things

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.460
that can cleanse a lot of stuff.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.660
But it can't cleanse you and it can't cleanse me.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.700
It's only the blood.

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.260
He said, look, there's the indictment.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:38.420
Here's what's going on.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:39.500
Here's the sin.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.660
And I want you to know,

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.180
it's interesting in the book of Ezekiel,

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:46.540
I'm going to go to Isaiah 1 if you will,

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.620
but I want you to understand that there

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.100
as we read through the book of Ezekiel again

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.740
as the prophet is prophesying,

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.260
and the Bible tells us

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.020
at the end of chapter 33

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.820
in the book of Ezekiel

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.460
about the fact that they heard the words,

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.700
but they didn't do it.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.820
Jeremiah's calling them to a place of repentance

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.700
God had often given

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.140
through the prophets

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.660
not only in Jeremiah 2,

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.700
but there in Ezekiel,

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:16.180
He had given a voice.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.540
In Isaiah 1,

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.940
I wish I could read the entirety of the passage.

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:22.860
Let me read just a couple of verses.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:24.260
In verse 2, the Bible says,

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.820
Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth,

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:30.820
for the Lord hath spoken.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.540
I have nourished and brought up children

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.700
and they have rebelled against Me.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:35.860
The ox knoweth his owner,

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.100
the ass his master's crib,

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.780
but Israel doth not know My people,

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:44.500
and they doth not consider.

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.620
Look what it says in verse 4.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.540
All sinful nation.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.420
A people laden with iniquity.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.780
A seed of evildoers.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.380
Children that are corruptors.

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.740
They have forsaken the Lord.

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:59.500
They have provoked the Holy One of Israel into anger.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.980
They are gone away backward.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.620
Can I tell you this morning

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.940
that as we look at the truth of the New Testament,

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.940
even if you're saved this morning

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.300
and your relationship with God

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.020
is settled at Calvary,

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:16.940
that there can be sin in the life of a believer.

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:19.060
And that sin in the life of a believer

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:24.460
causes our fellowship to be hindered.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:25.700
It's not worth it.

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:26.300
Why?

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.700
Because Christ is better.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.100
Because He's better.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.060
He's better than that position.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.580
He's better than that person.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.820
He's better than whatever!

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:40.140
He's better.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:42.700
And here's what God says in Isaiah 1.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.620
Again, I wish we could read the entirety of the passage.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.060
But the indictment is clear

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.940
in the first few verses that I've read.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.740
You come in verse 18.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:55.060
Come now, and let us reason together,

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.620
saith the Lord.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:00.460
Though your sins be as scarlet,

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:03.460
they shall be as white as snow.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.940
Though they be red like crimson,

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:10.100
they shall be as wool.

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:13.340
If ye be willing and obedient,

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.260
ye shall eat the good of the land.

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.820
But if ye refuse and rebel,

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.780
ye shall be devoured with the sword.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:23.100
For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.900
The reality this morning,

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.540
when we think about the death of Christ

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.940
and we notice the atonement of Christ

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.740
there in Hebrews 9 and verses 12-26

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.820
and we see the necessity of it.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.260
In Isaiah 53, by the way,

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:38.060
the passage that we referenced last week

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:39.140
on Sunday evening,

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:40.620
we talked about the eunuch, right?

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.260
That was the passage he was reading.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.700
And we find that it would be clear

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.260
in the passage that Christ would suffer,

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.260
that He would go to the cross of Calvary,

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.100
that our iniquities were laid upon Him,

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.020
the Messiah.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.020
We find that Christ's death

00:27:55.020 --> 00:28:00.220
accomplished for us eternal redemption.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.300
We find that as believers,

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.100
that as we walk in this life

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.540
after we've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:09.300
that we have the accuser of the brethren,

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.340
that we understand that He attacks,

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:15.900
we understand that we have this flesh.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:20.020
And when we sin, we have an advocate with the Father.

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.020
Isn't that precious?

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.380
1 John 2.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.660
We have an advocate with the Father

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:30.340
who says, I paid for that with my blood.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.739
What shall we say then?

00:28:32.739 --> 00:28:34.619
Shall we continue in sin

00:28:34.619 --> 00:28:36.299
that grace may abound?

00:28:36.299 --> 00:28:39.179
God forbid!

00:28:39.179 --> 00:28:41.140
We don't live as if we say,

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.380
well, I have this liberty.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:43.260
I can do whatever.

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.540
I can do what pleases me

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:48.100
because I can just confess it.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.900
Oh, but what we miss out on.

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.420
The joy of what we have on this earth

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.179
with our fellowship with God,

00:28:56.179 --> 00:28:59.299
that we willingly surrender that

00:28:59.299 --> 00:29:03.299
for something far inferior.

00:29:03.299 --> 00:29:05.780
For some momentary pleasure.

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:10.540
Hebrews 11 says that there is pleasure in sin

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.140
for a season.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.580
And as we look at the truth of God's Word,

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:18.220
we say Christ is superior.

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.980
We see that the believers in Hebrews 9,

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.660
they're being instructed with regard

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.020
to the necessity of Christ's death,

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.179
but their understanding as the writer

00:29:28.179 --> 00:29:29.980
is packaging this thing together.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:32.739
He's saying, listen, Jesus died

00:29:32.739 --> 00:29:34.420
so that you could be saved

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.020
and His blood is sufficient

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.299
and it's accepted.

00:29:38.299 --> 00:29:40.100
And if He didn't die,

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.179
these promises that we've spoken of

00:29:42.179 --> 00:29:46.140
could never be in effect.

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:49.580
Remember, all the way back in Hebrews 2,

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.420
in verse 14,

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:53.540
the Bible says for as much then

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.900
as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.140
He also Himself likewise took part of the same,

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.140
that through death...

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:09.100
he might destroy him that had the power of death. That is the devil. 1st John

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:14.820
chapter number 3 and verse number 18 we find that the Bible tells us there that

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:19.420
that we excuse me in verse number 8 he that committed sin is of the devil for

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:22.860
the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:29.380
manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil. I'll repeat what I

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:39.500
said moments ago our enemy is real and our enemy is active he's active he's

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:47.220
seeking whom he may devour you have a target on you I have a target on me the

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:52.820
world the flesh and the devil it's against us but we have something so much

00:30:52.820 --> 00:31:03.420
greater we have Jesus but the enemy knows he knows how to get you he knows

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:08.220
how to get me he knows how to get you he's been studying mankind for a long

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:12.780
time he's not God praise God for that he's far listen greater see that is in

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:20.740
you than he that is in the world but here's the problem sometimes we make

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:27.020
ourselves vulnerable submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil what

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:38.620
does it say and he will flee from you I often compare to known Bible accounts

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:51.260
when I think about this truth one of Joseph and one of David the wife of

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:59.420
Potiphar cast her eyes upon Joseph day by day listen just because you say no

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:05.060
once doesn't mean the devil is gonna give up he didn't keep coming you can

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.980
keep knocking on your doors and keep knocking on your door he's gonna keep

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:16.980
tempting you but Joseph he put on his running shoes so to speak he got out of

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:23.340
there I've often said of Joseph that he lost his coat but he retained his

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:31.780
integrity his character oh he was lied about he suffered in prison it's part of

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:36.340
God's plan it was not part of God's plan for him to commit that sin with that

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:48.060
woman amen what about David who is that it's Bathsheba she's the daughter of but

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:56.700
she's the wife of Uriah the Hittite God given warning through his servant what

00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:05.380
did David say bring her to me for I want her if you read about the confession of

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:13.740
David in Psalms 51 in Psalm 51 you read a brokenhearted man that receives

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:20.900
forgiveness and restoration because we have a great God we have a merciful God

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:25.780
who's ready to pardon ready to forgive we have a God who is extending that

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:33.740
mercy and we find that David praise many things in Psalm 51 but one thing that he

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:43.820
prays restore unto me the joy of my salvation David what took your joy sin

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:54.980
it robbed my joy it stole it from me see the atonement of Christ is so important

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:59.620
we understand what it does for us in salvation but understand this morning

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:05.980
what it does for you daily to understand the blood the fact that based

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:11.140
on what Christ did at the cross of Calvary I can confess my sins and know

00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:18.020
that I have an advocate with the father and know that we can plead the blood and

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:22.580
when the devil as the accuser of the brethren wants to come to you and accuse

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:30.220
you say I have Jesus and here's what he provided for me here's what he did for

00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:35.420
me see the world's not worth it but can I tell you the devil wants you to think

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:41.620
it is the devil wants to make it look shiny and pretty and fill in the blank

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:49.620
right the devil he knows what he's doing this morning we see we notice the

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:55.700
atonement of Christ as you look back in Hebrews 9 we read through verse 24 look

00:34:55.700 --> 00:35:00.100
at verse 25 nor yet that he should offer himself often actually read this verse

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:03.780
2 but that's okay and verse 25 as the high priest enters in the holy place

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:08.900
every year with blood of others notice 26 for then must he often have suffered

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.580
since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:16.860
appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself do you like that

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:25.140
phrase to put away sin I've often said and I appreciate the truth that we find

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:29.500
in the Word of God with regard to the fact that prior to salvation we were

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:41.020
bound we were slaves to sin we're lost and undone strangers foreigners we're

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:49.860
bound by our sin we were under a heavy penalty death for the wages of sin is

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:57.180
death I'm so thankful that the death burial and resurrection of the Lord

00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:03.140
Jesus Christ gave me freedom from the penalty of sin but can I tell you this

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:09.900
morning that it gave me the victory over sin it power over sin sin no longer I'm

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:15.660
no longer bound by sin Romans chapter 6 you look through there and you see the

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:22.660
the wondrous truth of the fact that I'm no longer bound by sin I said this as we

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:25.980
look at the passage that's there in Romans chapter number 6 I've said this

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:30.420
in the past that that the reality is that what we need in America what we

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:35.220
need in our homes of salvation with that transformation and then we need to walk

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:40.940
with Christ because we understand our identity in Christ Ephesians you look at

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:46.100
the passages throughout the book and you find that it is absolutely hammered home

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:51.220
in Ephesians 1 through 3 that if you've trusted Christ your Savior you are his

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:59.260
child you are secure in Christ but now you better start living like it walk

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:05.860
worthy of your calling of your vocation walk not as other Gentiles walk walk in

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:12.420
truth walk in love we look at all of that truth walk circumspectly right and

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:17.420
we find that as we look at the truth of the Word of God that Paul says this in

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:22.820
Romans 6 and verse 17 but God be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:27.740
have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you being

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:36.780
made free from sin you became the servants of righteousness praise God

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:47.260
sin no longer has that power over us but sometimes we we walk in the flesh and

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:57.540
not in the spirit the enemy makes it look real good but he's a liar he's the

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:05.020
father of it he hates you he hates God we see the atonement notice most out of

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:08.740
time and I got a lot more to say amen does anyone got a roast on this morning

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:14.180
that you're afraid is gonna burn don't answer change that timer on the thing

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:20.540
hope you have a Wi-Fi oven amen they sell those things now by the way notice

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:24.100
as we continue through the passage notice our appointment with death verse

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:28.300
27 I won't spend much time here I'd like to get to the latter part of the

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:33.940
passage Hebrews 9 in verse 27 it's a verse that we often quote the Bible says

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:40.900
as it and as it is appointed unto men wants to die but after this the judgment

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:45.100
you know there are people today that have this belief that you just die like

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:49.660
you just die and you buried and it's all over it's not true on the authority of

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:56.580
the Word of God why is it appointed unto man wants to die because of sin right

00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:01.780
the penalty of sin is death but we understand that this is speaking of a

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:05.920
spiritual death right there's a physical death and a spiritual death we live in

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.780
this sin cursed world where everything's breaking down the disease and all that's

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:15.580
taking place in our society in our world it's because of sin God didn't make it

00:39:15.619 --> 00:39:22.260
that way in the beginning it was perfect but sin entered in the the society

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:26.940
begins to break down and we have death as a result and you find that physical

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:30.820
death but more importantly the truth of the spiritual death or the Bible says

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:35.420
that in row in Revelation chapter number 20 that death and hell were cast in a

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:41.900
lake of fire this is the second death I've often mentioned that to be born

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:49.140
once is to die twice but to be born twice is to die but once why because

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:54.780
Jesus said to Nicodemus in John chapter number three he must be born again he

00:39:54.780 --> 00:40:02.020
must be born again we've been born physically and praise God

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:06.940
I thought I was born spiritually, I was born again.

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:10.980
The first birth, we celebrate annually, typically.

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:12.320
Some people don't like celebrating it

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.100
once they get to a certain age.

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:17.020
Or they like to pretend that it's number 29 or 39

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:21.940
for the however many times, you know, that sort of thing.

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:25.020
Can I tell you that I'm more excited

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:28.660
about my spiritual birth even than I am my physical birth?

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.160
I understand this morning that I couldn't have

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.960
a spiritual birth if I didn't have a physical birth.

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.920
I get that.

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:37.440
But can I tell you that August 31st is my spiritual birthday

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:41.860
and that day in so many ways is more important to me

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:43.760
than my physical birthday?

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.000
Because I was born again.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.680
I was delivered from the penalty of sin.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.980
I didn't understand on that day all that Christ did for me.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.000
But the more I walk with Christ,

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.380
the more over these 23 some years

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:01.780
that I've been walking with the Lord and reading His Word,

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:03.860
oh, how precious it becomes

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.860
what Christ did for me on that day.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:08.760
The Bible says,

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.660
no point unto man once to die, after this the judgment.

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:13.900
We know of two judgments specifically,

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:17.940
there's a bema seed, the judgment seed of Christ.

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.180
If you're a believer this morning,

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:22.260
you will stand before Christ at that judgment.

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:24.940
Paul deals with it, he speaks of it

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.200
as he's giving truth with regard to the bema.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.360
But we find the Bible speaks

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.880
about the great white throne judgment

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.560
in Revelation chapter number 20.

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.440
I quoted part of that when I said death and hell

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.320
were cast in like a fire, this is the second death.

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:39.560
That's the verdict at that great white throne judgment.

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:45.200
If you've been born again, thank God,

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.560
you will not have to stand

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.320
at the great white throne judgment.

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:54.400
Thank God that the second death has no power over you.

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.960
We look at the last part of Hebrews 9,

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.160
we notice the atonement,

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.400
we notice our appointment with death,

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.000
but I want you to consider the appearing of Christ.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.800
I mentioned how that the song service,

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.720
especially the last song that we sang this morning

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.480
as a congregation, it is well with my soul,

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:17.200
how wonderful to think about how verse three and four

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:19.800
fit so beautifully with the passage that is before us.

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.760
My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought,

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.920
my sin not in part, but the whole, right?

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.240
And we rejoice that it's nailed to His cross,

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.960
I bear it no more, but then we come to the fourth verse,

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:34.960
and Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:41.000
Hebrews 9 and verse 28, so Christ was once offered,

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.640
remember, we've mentioned this multiple times

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.000
through the passage of Scripture,

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.360
not only was it once as opposed to twice

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.360
as the day of atonement with the high priest,

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:50.880
he only had to enter once, why?

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:54.240
Because he didn't have to make a sacrifice for his own sin,

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.400
just for the sin of the world.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:58.320
I say just, that's a significant truth,

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.560
but he didn't have to for his own sin, he had no sin.

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:07.080
And he only had to do it one time forever.

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:10.160
We see that it says, to bear the sins of many,

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:14.720
notice, and unto them that look for him

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:19.720
shall he appear the second time,

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:23.480
without sin unto salvation.

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.240
The reality is the first time he came,

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:29.040
he came to deal with sin, and he's dealt with it.

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:35.200
We've often said that he came as a lamb the first time.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.200
When he comes at the end of the tribulation,

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.440
he will come as a conquering king,

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.200
the lion of the tribe of Judah.

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.360
He is king of kings and Lord of lords.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:50.000
Can I tell you this morning,

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.240
that though this truth of his second appearing

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.000
has not taken place,

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
we have full confidence that he shall appear.

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.240
It says, they that look, notice,

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.240
and unto them that look for him

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:08.400
shall he appear the second time

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.760
without sin unto salvation.

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.600
The reality is that it's not meaning

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.480
that if we're not looking that he's not gonna come,

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.600
but I want you to think about the truth

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:21.360
and the splendor, the joy of those that are looking for.

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.080
We find that Paul says it this way to Titus

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:25.760
in the second chapter.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.120
He's speaking of the blessed hope looking,

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:31.560
and we understand the appearing of our great God and Savior,

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:33.360
the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.480
This blessed hope that he shall appear.

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.120
I'm listening for the trumpet, amen.

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.240
I know that Brother Mershawn often says,

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.760
I'm not looking for the undertaker,

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:46.920
I'm looking for the upper taker.

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:50.640
I mean, I'm thrilled to be able to report to you this morning

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.880
that we are closer than we've ever been.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:57.600
And I can say that every day until he returns, amen.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:59.360
We are closer than we've ever been.

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.280
There are many things, I believe,

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.680
in the world that seem to be indicators

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.600
of the fact that we are really, really

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.320
on the doorstep of the rapture.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.960
But the reality is that no man knows the hour.

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.360
The truth of the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:23.280
his second coming ought to affect his people.

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.640
It ought to impact you.

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.320
Think about how it influenced

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:32.560
the disciples in the book of Acts.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:34.640
I got 25 verses to look at.

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:35.840
We don't have anywhere near the time.

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.680
So let me just share a few things with you.

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:41.480
Actually, Jason, you sent me a really nice note recently.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.160
Amen.

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.640
You know what he said to me in the note?

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.520
He said, sometimes I'm watching live stream

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.000
and it seems like you kind of feel like

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000
you're looking at the clock and you need to kind of hurry.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.560
He said, just preach the word.

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:54.400
Amen.

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.760
He gave me permission, amen.

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:56.880
I like it.

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.600
Let's look at the verses, amen.

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.080
God's word is powerful.

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:02.480
John 14 and verse number six.

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:04.080
He says, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:07.200
But before that, we look at John chapter number 14

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:10.200
and we find that he says, let not your heart be troubled.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.880
You believe in God, believe also in me.

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.080
In my Father's house are many mansions.

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:16.160
If it were not so, I would have told you.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:19.000
I go to prepare a place for you.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.720
He then says this, and if I go and prepare a place for you,

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:27.720
I will come again and receive you unto myself

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.840
that where I am, there you may be also.

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:31.960
In Acts chapter number one,

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:34.760
now understand that the disciples heard that

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.400
in John chapter number 14.

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.720
They heard that truth before Jesus went

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.040
to the cross of Calvary.

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:41.600
In Acts chapter number one,

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.800
Jesus has already been crucified.

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:44.680
He's already been buried.

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.240
He's already raised from the dead.

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.520
He's been there for 40 days.

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.160
He's about to ascend.

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:54.120
And in fact, he gives that great commission once again

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.520
about being his witnesses.

00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.000
And in verse number eight,

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.240
and the Bible says that when he had spoken these things

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:08.240
in verse number nine, while they beheld, he was taken up

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:11.920
and a cloud received him out of their sight.

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.120
And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.840
as he went up, behold, two men stood by them

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.080
in white apparel, which also said,

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:22.960
ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:27.960
This same Jesus, which was taken up from you into heaven,

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:33.680
notice, shall so come in like manner

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.440
as you have seen him go into heaven.

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:38.760
I like the absolutes of God's word

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.640
where he uses the word shall.

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:41.760
I like that word.

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:45.720
He says, I will come again.

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:48.480
By the way, every promise that God has ever given,

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.800
he fulfills.

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.320
Amen?

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:54.720
We notice that in the book of 1 Thessalonians

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:55.560
in chapter number four,

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:58.880
and really 1 and 2 Thessalonians are full of truth

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.280
with regard to the subject of eschatology

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:03.440
and the instruction to the people of God.

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:05.280
In 1 Thessalonians chapter number four,

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:06.720
Paul says, I don't want you to be ignorant.

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:07.680
I want you to be informed.

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.080
I want to give you the word of the Lord.

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.280
I want you to understand the truth.

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.560
He tells them in 1 Thessalonians chapter number four

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.040
in verses 16 and 17,

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:18.000
for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.160
with a shout,

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:24.040
the voice of the archangel,

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.760
with the trump of God,

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:27.320
the dead in Christ shall rise first.

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:30.520
Then we which are alive and remain

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.760
shall be caught up together with them in the clouds

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:34.600
to meet the Lord in the air.

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:38.720
And so shall we ever be with the Lord.

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:44.520
I mentioned earlier the truth of Titus two in verse 13,

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.720
where Paul says, looking for that blessed hope

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.760
and the glorious appearing of the great God

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:51.200
and our savior, Jesus Christ.

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:54.920
Hebrews nine and verse 28,

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:56.040
the verse that we've looked at,

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:57.880
but I want you to see in chapter 10,

00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:01.800
what the Bible says about the truth of Christ's return.

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:03.440
It says at the end of chapter number nine

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:08.440
that he shall appear in Hebrews 10 in verse number 37.

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:10.080
And it says for yet a little while

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:15.080
and he that shall come will come and will not tarry.

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:20.400
James five in verse number eight.

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:25.040
You say this is a repeated message.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.280
Yes, because it has a powerful impact

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.440
and we'll get to that in just a moment.

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.200
Notice James five in verse number eight,

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.640
but be ye also patient,

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:37.760
establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord.

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:39.600
And draweth nigh.

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.800
First Peter five in verse number four.

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:47.200
Peter is speaking in the passage to pastors

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.600
and about the importance of our responsibility

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:51.960
to feed the flock of God, so on and so forth.

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:53.960
And he goes through that process

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.520
and he comes to verse number four and says,

00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:59.400
and when the chief shepherd shall appear.

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.239
Who is that?

00:50:00.239 --> 00:50:01.080
That's Jesus.

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:04.360
shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away."

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:08.040
Peter didn't say if, he said when the chief shepherd

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.760
shall appear, amen?

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.560
Because he's going to.

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.820
Second Peter three, in verse number nine,

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:20.800
the Lord is not slack concerning his promise, right?

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.960
We find that it says as some men count slackness,

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:25.760
but what he is long suffering to us,

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:27.200
we're not willing that any should perish,

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.800
but that all should come to repentance.

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.160
The context of what Peter is saying here

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:33.080
is that there are those that are walking around

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.440
that are scoffers and mockers, and they're saying,

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:38.880
hey, where is the promise of his coming?

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.400
And Peter says, don't get discouraged.

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.400
He's coming.

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.940
He's going to come, right on time.

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:48.920
First John chapter two.

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:51.600
Let me make some comments

00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:54.000
before I read the portion of scripture.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.680
I've read many passages to you

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.920
with regard to the promise of his coming.

00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:01.400
We see as we finish Hebrews chapter nine,

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:03.120
we consider the appearing of Christ,

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.680
the fact that he is going to return,

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:08.480
and we find that this truth of God's word

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:12.240
had a great impact and influence on the people of God.

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.240
No doubt as you read the book of Acts

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.420
and you see all that happened to the church

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:17.480
in that first century,

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:21.400
and you see how the gospel went forward

00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.680
under great levels of persecution,

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.100
and you read of all that happened,

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:28.020
I believe that it was mindful to those disciples

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:30.660
that they watched Jesus ascend up into heaven,

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:33.540
and they heard those angels say, he's coming again.

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:37.380
Listen, when we live daily,

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:39.940
understanding that today could be the day,

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:41.660
when we're looking for his appearing,

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:44.860
it will change our behavior.

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:46.300
It will change what we do.

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:50.220
We'll be living under the understanding

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:52.500
that today will be the day.

00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:54.140
It could be the day.

00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:57.500
No doubt it influenced the people of God

00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:59.260
that we read of in the word of God.

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.420
The New Testament, full of truth

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:05.820
with regard to the return of Christ.

00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:09.500
We can look at history of the church.

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:13.260
We can see how this truth of the return of Christ

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:16.360
has influenced generations of believers.

00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:22.340
We come to 1 John 2 and notice verse 28.

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:27.260
And now little children abide in him,

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:32.260
that when he shall appear, we may have confidence.

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.140
Notice what this says.

00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:40.980
And not be ashamed before him at his coming.

00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:44.180
I asked a question on Wednesday evening.

00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:45.380
Some of you were here.

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:48.020
Hopefully some of you are watching live stream.

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:51.220
If not, it's recorded, you can go watch it.

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:52.820
I would encourage you to do so.

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:57.060
Exodus chapter number 16, would you have passed the test?

00:52:58.260 --> 00:52:59.980
Would you have passed the test?

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:01.940
I said I wanted to ask myself the question.

00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:04.480
I said I want you to ask yourself the question.

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:05.320
You say, what test?

00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:06.340
I didn't know there was a test.

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:07.180
Exactly.

00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:12.220
Go listen to the message.

00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:15.000
They didn't know there was gonna be a test either.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.600
Some passed, praise God.

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.440
Some failed.

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:22.880
I'll ask you to ask yourself the question here

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.440
just as I've asked myself.

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.760
I'm not asking you to answer me.

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:29.740
I'm asking you to be honest before the Lord God.

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.120
It says that we may have confidence

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:34.540
and not be ashamed before him at his coming.

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:38.640
What if he came today, would you be ashamed?

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:41.800
What if he came last Tuesday at, name the time?

00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:42.880
Would you have been ashamed?

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.460
You say, hold on, let me check my calendar.

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:47.520
You shouldn't have to check your calendar.

00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:52.420
It shouldn't matter where you were or what you were doing.

00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:54.920
Why, because you're living with this truth

00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:56.840
that he shall appear.

00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:59.040
And notice what the passage tells us.

00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:01.740
If ye know that he is righteous,

00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:03.660
ye know that everyone that doeth righteousness

00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:04.500
is born of him.

00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:05.660
Go into chapter three.

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:09.400
Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:12.440
that we should be called the sons of God.

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.600
Therefore the world knoweth us not

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:17.160
because it knew him not.

00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:20.800
Beloved, now are we, sorry,

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.280
now are we the sons of God.

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:25.720
And it doth not yet appear what we shall be.

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.520
But we know when he, what's it say again?

00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:29.540
Shall appear.

00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:31.720
You see it repeated.

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:34.080
We shall be like him for we shall see him as he is.

00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:35.840
I'm not gonna read verse three yet.

00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.400
Listen, we know the truth

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.320
that we're dealing with this morning.

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:46.560
We consider the appearing of our Savior.

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:49.480
We know that it says repeatedly that he shall appear.

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:52.640
Notice it says that the world knoweth us not.

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:56.520
But the enemy continues to seek to attack us

00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.440
and destroy us and devour us.

00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:00.160
I'm thankful to report this morning

00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:02.800
that the devil can never take your salvation.

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:07.160
We believe in the eternal security of the believer.

00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:09.400
That as I was born of the Spirit

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:11.760
that I am washed in the blood,

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:14.520
that I am redeemed.

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.400
That positionally speaking,

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:19.880
I am righteous before Almighty God.

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:21.640
Not because of my righteousness,

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:23.120
because of the righteousness of God

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:26.760
that was imputed upon me and you.

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:27.840
By the way, if you're trying to stand

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:28.840
in your own righteousness,

00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:30.160
it's just a bunch of filthy rags.

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:31.840
And I don't say that to be unkind.

00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:35.520
I'm telling you what the Bible says in Isaiah 64.

00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:40.680
The reality is that as we look at the truth

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:43.760
of the Word of God and we understand this truth

00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:46.080
of the atonement and what it provided for us

00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.960
not only in salvation, but in sanctification.

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:51.280
In walking a life that is pleasing.

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:53.800
Remember what Paul says in the book of Ephesians

00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:54.760
in chapter number five.

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:57.640
Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:59.960
And we come to the third verse

00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.600
of 1 John chapter number three

00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.400
after he speaks about the return

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.640
and the truth of Christ's return

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:08.840
and how it should impact and influence us.

00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:11.720
It says in every man,

00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:13.800
that's every individual,

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:18.200
that hath this hope in him.

00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:19.040
Pause.

00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:20.200
I know the verse isn't done there.

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.120
There's not even a comma there.

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:21.960
I don't believe.

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:24.880
But I want you to pause.

00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:26.560
Do you have that hope within you?

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:30.040
If you don't, you need to get it in you

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.200
because it's a Bible truth.

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.040
Amen?

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.280
You say, but I'm just hoping he doesn't come yet

00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.680
because there's some things I wanna do.

00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:41.400
Man, you don't understand that Christ is better.

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.160
You don't understand that he's superior.

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.520
You don't understand that there's nothing

00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:48.280
the world can offer you that comes close.

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:53.000
If we have this hope,

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.320
it says every man that hath this hope in him

00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:59.680
purifieth himself,

00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:03.440
even as he is pure.

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.760
The songwriter wrote a song,

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:10.600
nothing between my soul and my savior.

00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.560
How can we have that?

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:16.880
Because of what Christ did on the cross of Calvary.

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:18.440
Because of that atonement,

00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:20.560
because of what he provides for us

00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:23.400
even as we walk here upon this earth.

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:24.640
You say, but it's hard.

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:25.880
The devil's attacking.

00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:28.400
I know he's real and he's active.

00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:30.040
I understand it.

00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:32.840
But can I tell you that greater is he that is in you

00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:34.320
than he that is in the world.

00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:37.560
We are more than conquerors through Christ.

00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.960
We are on the winning side.

00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:41.560
We do have victory.

00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:43.320
And if we have this hope,

00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:47.920
if we're influenced and impacted by the Bible truth,

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:49.560
then we purify ourselves,

00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:52.480
even as he is pure.

00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:53.640
We say, I don't want there to be anything

00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:55.200
between my soul and my savior.

00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:57.760
I asked you this morning,

00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:00.280
would you be ashamed of his coming?

00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:04.960
Have you purified yourself?

00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:07.640
Are you able to say, as the songwriter wrote,

00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:09.600
there's nothing between my soul and my savior?

00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:10.920
I'm not asking you if you're perfect

00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:12.720
because none of us are perfect.

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:13.720
But I'm asking you this,

00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:15.240
are you living in sin?

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:18.520
Are you being attacked by the enemy?

00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:21.720
Are you giving place to the devil?

00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:26.440
Because he's real and he's active.

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:30.120
If there's known sin,

00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:33.880
oh, thank God that you have an advocate with the Father.

00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:36.640
You can have forgiveness and restoration

00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:39.600
and the joy of your salvation

00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:41.200
that the devil stole from you.

00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:44.440
This morning, we look at Hebrews 9.

00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:46.960
It could have been three separate messages,

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:49.080
but I tried to put it all together.

00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:54.080
The atonement, the appointment, and the appearing.

00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:56.840
Jesus Christ is coming again.

00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:59.119
I know I've mentioned this before,

00:58:59.119 --> 00:59:03.520
Holly was in a singing group in college.

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:05.920
They never let me join one of those tour groups.

00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:07.760
We won't go there.

00:59:09.679 --> 00:59:11.720
She was in a tour group.

00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:14.160
There was a song that they sang that was impactful.

00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:17.200
It wasn't the most beautiful song I ever heard

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:21.799
from a melody, whatever kind of perspective.

00:59:22.799 --> 00:59:25.559
But the question throughout the song was this,

00:59:25.559 --> 00:59:26.440
are you ready?

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:28.760
Are you ready, are you ready?

00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:30.679
It would repeat it, repeat it, repeat it.

00:59:30.679 --> 00:59:33.840
Are you ready for the coming of the Lord?

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:36.920
Because he could come today.

00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:39.480
I don't want to be ashamed of his appearing.

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:41.440
Can I tell you this morning?

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:45.239
Look, you look, I'm not, I don't have my head in the sand.

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:49.520
You look at our world, you see what's going on.

00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:52.520
God's people need revival.

00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:54.640
We need revival.

00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:59.960
We need to understand the seriousness of walking with Christ.

00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:02.840
and understand what his atonement not only provides for me

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.360
in eternal security and eternal salvation,

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.840
but what it can enable me to do here even now

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.160
in walking in victory.

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:14.860
The death of the testator, he had to die,

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:17.140
and I'm so thankful that he did.

01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:21.860
Again, our approach to the cross is much different

01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:26.460
than these original recipients would have been.

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:28.980
And so we find that the writer is saying,

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:32.020
here's why, and here's what's accomplished.

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:35.020
Praise God for the cross.

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:35.860
Father, we love you.

01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:37.440
We thank you for loving us.

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:39.700
We thank you for the word of God,

01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:41.940
the truth contained therein.

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:43.480
God, I pray this morning,

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:48.020
the Holy Spirit of God would work as only he can.

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:50.580
God, I've sought this morning to use your word

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:52.020
and to preach your word.

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:57.020
I've sought to give the sense of it,

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.260
to make the application,

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:08.460
to draw the line in the sand, so to speak,

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:12.820
as Moses did when he said,

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:15.560
who is on the Lord's side?

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:20.560
God, if there's one not sure of heaven,

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.940
would you help him today to be saved?

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.440
God, if there's one this morning,

01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:31.860
that if they're honest before you,

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:37.200
they'd have to admit that there have been activities

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.500
that they've been engaged in in recent days,

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:42.800
weeks, months, years, however long it's been,

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.080
that if you would have appeared,

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.480
they would have been ashamed.

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:50.720
They've not purified themselves.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.640
What I believe for each one of us,

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.400
because we'll never be perfect until we get to heaven,

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.960
there's a need to purify ourselves.

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:06.600
So we think about the truth of John 13.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.160
The disciples' feet got dirty

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.640
because they were in the world.

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:16.600
We're in the world, but we're not of the world.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.600
We're thankful for the cleansing power

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.560
of your word and the blood.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.960
I pray that you'd have your will and way,

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.260
that decisions would be made,

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:29.640
that we truly would reflect on the truth of thy word

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:33.400
and say, can I honestly say, ask ourselves,

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:36.720
can I say there's nothing between my soul and my savior?

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.040
Not asking if I'm perfect.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:40.120
Is there a known sin?

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.560
Have you given place to the devil?

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:45.640
Are you playing with fire?

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.200
Run to the cross.

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:51.560
Understand that Jesus is better.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.800
There's nothing that old serpent,

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:57.040
that old liar, the devil, can offer you

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.520
that would even pale in comparison

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:02.180
to what Christ has provided.

01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:03.680
Lord, would you have your way?

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.880
It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:08.840
Would you stand with me?

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:11.240
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:12.160
No one's looking around.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.840
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.760
Come to this old-fashioned altar.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.400
Make your seat an altar.

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:21.960
Get along with God.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.320
Let God have his way.

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:28.040
I beg you not to allow it to just be

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:31.120
another Sunday checkbox.

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.740
Went to church.

01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:35.440
Let God have his way in your life as Kimberly plays.
