1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
One, I'll be looking at verses one through 11,

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,960
the entirety of this first chapter this morning.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,280
And I've titled the message,

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,399
if you've seen in the bulletin already this morning,

5
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:12,199
The Need for Revival.

6
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:16,159
And we are going to have our fall revival

7
00:00:16,159 --> 00:00:17,680
in just a few weeks.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,840
Brother Jason Caldwell will be with us

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,000
and we're looking forward to a great time

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,959
and looking that God would move and work

11
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,620
in and through our midst.

12
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,620
And I am so thankful that we can have a revival meeting.

13
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,340
I believe it's important for us to have

14
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,299
this special type of meeting on our church calendar

15
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:38,779
with the emphasis on revival.

16
00:00:38,779 --> 00:00:41,580
And the reality is that just because

17
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,540
you put a special meeting on the calendar

18
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,099
doesn't really mean a whole lot.

19
00:00:46,099 --> 00:00:48,259
Amen, and we don't just put it on the calendar

20
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:50,619
because to be a good independent Baptist church,

21
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:52,500
you gotta have a revival meeting.

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,099
That's not the purpose, that's not the point.

23
00:00:55,099 --> 00:00:59,580
We earnestly desire that God would move and work

24
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,020
in and through our lives.

25
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,660
Over the next three weeks today and the next two Sundays,

26
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,199
I plan to preach a mini series

27
00:01:08,199 --> 00:01:12,739
that really is intended to be a preparation for revival.

28
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,699
The reality is that as an individual believer

29
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:19,500
and as your pastor, I desire personally,

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,379
and I desire for you personally, to be revival ready.

31
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,379
It is possible that we could be revival resistant.

32
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,540
I don't wanna be revival resistant.

33
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,699
I wanna be revival ready.

34
00:01:32,699 --> 00:01:35,620
We begin to think about the preparation

35
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,620
as we would personally and corporately as a church

36
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,180
prepare for this special meeting,

37
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,540
that we would ask God that we would have

38
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,940
that longing in our hearts to see God work

39
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,419
in our lives individually, to see God work in our homes,

40
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:53,900
to see God work in our church,

41
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,620
to see God work in our city and in our state

42
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,860
and in our nation.

43
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,220
We long to see God work.

44
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,419
God is able, by the way.

45
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:06,220
We begin to think about the truth of revival

46
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,779
and the need for revival,

47
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:10,619
and I came across this definition of revival.

48
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,380
It's a very simple definition, and I like it.

49
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,339
And the definition is simply this.

50
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:21,339
God bringing His people back to spiritual health.

51
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:27,179
God bringing His people back to spiritual health.

52
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:31,779
I believe that a New Testament phrase

53
00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:35,539
that would very adequately define for us

54
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:39,979
the idea, the thought of revival is found in John 15

55
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:43,020
when we speak about the truth of abiding.

56
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,220
Abiding.

57
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,179
We find that in that passage of Scripture,

58
00:02:46,179 --> 00:02:48,660
Jesus is giving the truth that He's the vine

59
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,979
and we're the branches,

60
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:52,339
and He says repeatedly about the importance

61
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,179
of abiding in Him.

62
00:02:55,179 --> 00:02:57,300
And I believe that that word abiding,

63
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,220
it carries with it the idea of a continuance

64
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,220
or a remaining.

65
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,619
You think about the truth of abiding in Him.

66
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:11,619
If I am abiding in Him, if you are abiding in Him,

67
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:16,100
the reality is that we ought to be learning of Him.

68
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,940
Why?

69
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,779
Because we're continuing with Him.

70
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:19,220
We're remaining in His presence

71
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,179
and we're learning of Him.

72
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:23,380
And then as we learn of Him,

73
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,380
we ought to live in obedience to His Word.

74
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,380
Oftentimes we speak about God's blessing.

75
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,899
No doubt we pray that God would bless individuals,

76
00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:39,699
that God would bless our church corporately,

77
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:43,580
and we pray about God's blessing upon our nation.

78
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,860
The reality is that more than us

79
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,899
maybe using the term that God would you bless them,

80
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:54,580
the truth of God's Word, as I grow and learn,

81
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:59,580
I find that it's more that we would live blessable lives.

82
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,619
Because God's blessing is the result

83
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:05,500
of the obedience of His people.

84
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,539
We long for God's blessing in our lives individually,

85
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,460
but we ought to be living lives that are blessable.

86
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,860
We long for God's blessing upon our church corporately,

87
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,940
but we have to be a church that is blessable.

88
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,940
As a nation, we long for God's blessing.

89
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,179
I would tell you that as a nation,

90
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,700
we are not very blessable right now.

91
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,779
The Bible says that righteousness exalteth the nation,

92
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:34,820
but sin is a reproach to any people.

93
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,500
And we find that as we think about

94
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,700
the subject matter of revival,

95
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,179
as I use that definition, that simple definition,

96
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,220
that it is God bringing His people back to spiritual health.

97
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,179
We would find that at the very onset of this message

98
00:04:52,179 --> 00:04:54,260
this morning that it's important to note

99
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,299
that revival is biblical.

100
00:04:57,299 --> 00:05:00,339
Revival is a biblical concept.

101
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:03,899
Revival, as you study the truth of revival,

102
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:06,380
you find in the Old Testament,

103
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,339
historically biblical record of the nation of Israel,

104
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:15,339
really Judah in particular, experiencing periods of revival

105
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,660
when God brought His people back into spiritual health.

106
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:25,339
Not only is revival biblical,

107
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:28,940
I would say this, revival is possible.

108
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,019
You know, there's some people today, unfortunately,

109
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:33,820
that would take the perspective

110
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,940
that revival is just not possible.

111
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,700
But I believe this morning that revival is possible.

112
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,420
I believe this morning that it is possible

113
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,179
for God to bring His people back to spiritual health.

114
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:49,739
And I would say this, that revival is for God's people.

115
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:54,059
It is God bringing His people back to spiritual health.

116
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:56,339
So revival is for God's people.

117
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:59,019
With understanding those truths,

118
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:02,619
it will help us to be able to conclude with accuracy

119
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:04,540
that we need revival.

120
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,220
Oftentimes when we think about revival,

121
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,660
we think about the nation as a large entity.

122
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,140
We think about the wickedness of our nation.

123
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,100
We say, man, we need revival.

124
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,579
No, no, no, the church, revival's for God's people.

125
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:20,100
Now, as God's people have revival,

126
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,420
as God brings His people back to spiritual health,

127
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,619
it will impact the world.

128
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,940
It will.

129
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,339
You read about some revivals historically,

130
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:33,299
not only biblically,

131
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:36,140
but you read about some revivals historically

132
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:37,899
in our own nation,

133
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:38,940
and you begin to think about some revivals,

134
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,500
and you see how the people of God

135
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,380
were brought back to spiritual health,

136
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,500
and it affected the nation, the impact.

137
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,179
As we look at Nehemiah 1 this morning,

138
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:53,220
I wanna examine this passage of Scripture,

139
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,940
and then I want us to make some application

140
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,980
that will, I believe, enable us

141
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,820
to establish the need for revival.

142
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,859
Before we establish the need for revival,

143
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:07,299
let's examine this passage of Scripture.

144
00:07:07,299 --> 00:07:08,420
Beginning in verse number one,

145
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,260
the Bible says,

146
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,980
the words of Nehemiah, the son of Hakaliah,

147
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,260
and it came to pass in the month Chislu

148
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,739
in the 20th year as I was in Shushan, the palace.

149
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:20,739
And so we find the setting is given to us in verse number one

150
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:22,779
with regard to the timing and the place,

151
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:26,619
and we find that Nehemiah is about to reveal some things

152
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:28,220
to us with regard to the condition.

153
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,540
If you're taking notes,

154
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,940
I've simply given the thought for the first point,

155
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,660
the report received.

156
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:36,299
In verses two and three,

157
00:07:36,299 --> 00:07:37,940
we read of this report that is being received.

158
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,339
Notice the Bible says that Hanani,

159
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:44,019
one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah.

160
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:45,859
And notice the Bible says in verse number two,

161
00:07:45,859 --> 00:07:50,260
and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped,

162
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,660
which were left of the captivity,

163
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,660
and concerning Jerusalem.

164
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,420
We understand that Nehemiah is written

165
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,500
after the Babylonian captivity.

166
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,980
There's already been an opportunity for a remnant to return,

167
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,739
and we find that Nehemiah reveals to us here

168
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:07,859
in verse number two that Hanani

169
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:09,179
and some of the brethren came,

170
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:12,660
and notice what the Bible says that Nehemiah inquired.

171
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,619
He says, I asked of them concerning the Jews

172
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:19,820
that had escaped, which were left of the captivity,

173
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,739
and concerning Jerusalem.

174
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:24,660
As I note that Nehemiah requested the report,

175
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,700
it reveals to me that Nehemiah had a measure of concern.

176
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,500
Nehemiah, though he was there in Shushan,

177
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,859
according to verse number one,

178
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:35,619
he had a concern for what was happening in Jerusalem.

179
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:37,700
He had a concern, he wanted to know,

180
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,260
he did not want his head to be in the sand.

181
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,260
He wanted to know what was going on.

182
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,859
And so he requested the report,

183
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:46,659
and we find that in verse number three,

184
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,619
the report is provided, the report is received,

185
00:08:49,619 --> 00:08:52,260
and notice the Bible tells us that they answer,

186
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,099
Hanani and these other certain men of Judah,

187
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:57,299
they answer, and it says in verse number three,

188
00:08:57,299 --> 00:08:59,340
that they said unto me,

189
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,700
notice there are three things that are mentioned,

190
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,299
the remnant that are left of the captivity

191
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:06,780
there in the province, notice number one,

192
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,780
are in great affliction and reproach.

193
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:18,140
Not only are the people that remain

194
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,739
in great affliction and reproach,

195
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:21,340
but we find number two,

196
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,219
that the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down.

197
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:29,219
And number three, that the gates thereof

198
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:31,820
are burned with fire.

199
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:35,979
I'm not sure what Nehemiah expected to receive

200
00:09:35,979 --> 00:09:38,820
in the report when he requested it,

201
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,140
but we find that what he received was an honest evaluation,

202
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,460
it was an honest report of the condition in Jerusalem.

203
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,979
And it started with the people

204
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:50,340
that they're in great affliction and reproach,

205
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,140
and then he talked about the wall and the gates,

206
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,539
and we find that Nehemiah receives this report.

207
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:00,340
And what I'm most interested in.

208
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,860
and as we could examine and speak about the report,

209
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,340
but what I'm most interested in is number two this morning,

210
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,220
his response is recorded,

211
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,500
how he responds to the report that he receives,

212
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,740
and we find that his response is recorded for us.

213
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,220
And I believe that as we look at the response of Nehemiah

214
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,340
in this text of Scripture that we ought to take heed,

215
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,660
and we find that the Bible says this in verse number four,

216
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,780
and it came to pass,

217
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,740
notice this phrase,

218
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,580
when I heard these words,

219
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,220
he inquired,

220
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,660
he requested the report,

221
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,820
the report was then received by Nehemiah,

222
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,220
the men, Hanani and those other brethren,

223
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,380
they gave him an honest report of the condition

224
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,980
of the people and of the city,

225
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,140
and we find that Nehemiah responds to these words,

226
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,060
and it tells us this fourfold response in verse number four,

227
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,420
that I sat down, noticed, and wept,

228
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,100
and mourned certain days,

229
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,540
and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven.

230
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,020
You think he was impacted

231
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,980
because of the report that he received?

232
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:13,540
Man, he asked, and he received a report,

233
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,300
and it was broken.

234
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,460
The Bible says that he wept,

235
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,180
he mourned,

236
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,100
he fasted, and he prayed.

237
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,620
In the next several verses,

238
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,140
we read the prayer of Nehemiah.

239
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,740
Again, very insightful,

240
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,860
as we begin to think about the need for revival

241
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,980
and establishing here this historical account

242
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,380
and then seeking to make application

243
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,420
for our own lives and our own time

244
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,020
so that we would establish this need for revival.

245
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,660
Notice as Nehemiah begins to pray,

246
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,060
it says that he prayed before the God of heaven

247
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,780
at the end of verse number four,

248
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,420
and we notice as we come to verse number five

249
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,540
that his prayer begins with adoration.

250
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,220
His prayer begins with adoring the God of heaven

251
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,340
and recognizing who God is.

252
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,020
Notice it says, and I said,

253
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:10,020
I beseech thee, O Lord God of heaven,

254
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,980
the great and terrible God

255
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,060
that keepeth covenant and mercy

256
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:21,060
for them that love him and observe his commandments.

257
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,940
Wow.

258
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,020
Nehemiah is recognizing, he's acknowledging who God is.

259
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,860
He says that he is the Lord God of heaven.

260
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,260
We must never forget that we serve the Lord God omnipotent.

261
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,700
We must never forget that he is king of kings

262
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,100
and Lord of lords, that he is the great I am,

263
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,100
that he sits upon his throne,

264
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,460
that he rules and he is able,

265
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,780
and we find that Nehemiah approaches God

266
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,020
in adoration, acknowledging who God is.

267
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,700
He says the great and the terrible God,

268
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,540
notice what he says, that keepeth covenant.

269
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,220
Aren't you thankful that our God is faithful?

270
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,580
Aren't you thankful this morning

271
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,940
that he is trustworthy, that he's dependable,

272
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,620
that he always does what he says he would do?

273
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,660
And it says that he keeps covenant,

274
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,300
notice what he says, and mercy.

275
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,860
Now understand that our God is gracious

276
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,500
and our God is merciful,

277
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,860
and Nehemiah is recognizing that the God that he serves,

278
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,500
the God that he is praying to is a God

279
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,420
that keeps covenant and is merciful.

280
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,340
Now we'll mention in just a few moments

281
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,660
as you come to verse number eight

282
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,140
how that Nehemiah rehearses the very covenant

283
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,940
by which he speaks of here in verse number five.

284
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,220
We find that he then continues,

285
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:41,220
for them that love him and observe his commandments.

286
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,980
By way of introduction,

287
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,980
I mentioned that we need to live blessable lives.

288
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:56,180
See, God blesses those who are living lives of obedience.

289
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,300
You say, well, God's blessing,

290
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,820
I understand that there are times

291
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,380
in which there are blessings,

292
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,820
and the Bible says the goodness of God

293
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,620
leadeth thee to repentance,

294
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,100
but I want you to understand that the Bible says

295
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,140
that the way of the transgressor is hard.

296
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,020
God resisteth the proud.

297
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,740
He gives grace to the humble.

298
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,420
And we find here that our God is a God who keeps covenant,

299
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,660
our God is a God who is merciful,

300
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,900
and then notice as he continues to pray,

301
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,700
this adoration for God quickly turns

302
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,260
to an acknowledgement of sin in verses six and seven.

303
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,540
Notice what he says, let thine ear now be attentive.

304
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,660
By the way, aren't you thankful

305
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,300
that God hears us when we pray?

306
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,500
We have a God who hears and answers.

307
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,140
Let thine ear now be attentive and thine eyes open,

308
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,540
that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant,

309
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,180
which I pray before thee now,

310
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,700
day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants,

311
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,540
notice this, and confess the sins

312
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,340
of the children of Israel,

313
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,980
which we have sinned against thee,

314
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,980
both I and my Father's house have sinned.

315
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Notice he continues,

316
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,940
we have dealt very corruptly against thee

317
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,420
and have not kept the commandments nor the statutes

318
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,420
nor the judgments which thou commandest thy servant Moses.

319
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,540
This acknowledgement of sin is a necessary step

320
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,020
when we speak about revival,

321
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,380
and we'll deal with this a little bit more

322
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,980
next week in our message,

323
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,380
but the reality is that we find

324
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,180
that Nehemiah is acknowledging the sin,

325
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,660
he's not sugarcoating it.

326
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,540
There's an honest evaluation that's taking place here.

327
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,620
And he says, we're guilty, we're guilty.

328
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,620
And notice that he then anticipates God's working,

329
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,380
for he says in verse number eight,

330
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,740
remember I beseech thee,

331
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,620
the word that thou commandest thy servant Moses,

332
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,460
saying, if ye transgress,

333
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,980
I will scatter you abroad among the nations.

334
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,360
Why did they just go through the captivity

335
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,200
that they went through?

336
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,420
Why were they dealing with what they were dealing with?

337
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,060
Because they had forsaken the Lord.

338
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,220
Jeremiah spells it out very plainly

339
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,460
as you read the prophet Jeremiah,

340
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,180
he says, listen, you have forsaken me,

341
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,820
you have forgotten me,

342
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,900
and you have followed after idols.

343
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,600
That's what God's indictment against Judah is

344
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,860
in the book of Jeremiah,

345
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,540
and we find that here,

346
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:31,540
Nehemiah is recognizing that God had already said to Moses,

347
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,020
he'd already said that if we transgress,

348
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,980
I will scatter you abroad among the nations.

349
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,100
Notice, but, aren't you thankful for that conjunction?

350
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,860
But, if ye turn unto me

351
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,520
and keep my commandments and do them.

352
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,980
Though there were of you cast out

353
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,600
unto the uttermost part of the heaven,

354
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,760
yet will I gather thee from thence

355
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,420
and will bring them unto the place

356
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,920
that I have chosen to set my name there.

357
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,200
Now these are thy servants and thy people

358
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,680
whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power

359
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,320
and by thy strong hand.

360
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,800
Oh, Lord, I beseech thee,

361
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,520
let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant,

362
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,960
to the prayer of thy servants

363
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,400
who desire to fear thy name and prosper.

364
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,200
I pray thee, thy servant, this day,

365
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,320
and grant him mercy in the sight of this man,

366
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,840
for I was the king's cupbearer.

367
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,760
I want you to notice the truth of verse number nine,

368
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,480
when he says, but if ye turn unto me

369
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,440
and keep my commandments and do them.

370
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,040
God bringing His people back to spiritual health.

371
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,760
We think about revival and we understand here

372
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,980
in the nation of Judah and the timing

373
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,320
and Nehemiah acknowledging all that had taken place

374
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,840
as he receives the report.

375
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,880
And we find that he receives that report

376
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,800
and he responds really with brokenness.

377
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,720
He responds by seeking God.

378
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,200
He responds by not talking about

379
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,400
the wickedness of the Babylonians.

380
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,400
He doesn't sit here and confess

381
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,800
how bad the Babylonians are.

382
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,440
He doesn't confess the sin of the Egyptians

383
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,920
or of any other people group.

384
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,560
No, he confesses their sin.

385
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,600
Amen.

386
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,080
Were the Babylonians wicked people?

387
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,840
Sure they were.

388
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,520
God used them to judge Judah

389
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,640
and then God judged them because they were wicked.

390
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,600
And we find here, you read the book of Habakkuk.

391
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,560
It's a very interesting book in the Old Testament,

392
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,320
the prophet, because Habakkuk's asking questions

393
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,640
and God's giving them answers to help them understand

394
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,480
the revelation of God and understanding the truth

395
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,640
of all that was taking place with the judgment of God.

396
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,120
But we find that in this response,

397
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,200
we find that Nehemiah acknowledged that there was a need

398
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,200
for the people of God to have revival in their time.

399
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,800
I believe this morning that it is important,

400
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,120
even as I said that we would examine

401
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,520
this portion of Scripture,

402
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,280
but then as we would seek to make application

403
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,080
and then establish the need for revival,

404
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,040
I want to provide you with a report.

405
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,280
The report that I provide you with is different

406
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,600
than the report that Hanani

407
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,480
and these brethren provided Nehemiah with.

408
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,320
And quite frankly, you didn't ask me for the report.

409
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,320
But if it's okay with you, I'm gonna give you the report.

410
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,000
And I hope that even as Nehemiah had inquired of the report

411
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,840
he had required of the condition

412
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,840
that he receives the report and he's broken,

413
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,480
that as we receive the report this morning

414
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,040
to seek to establish the need for revival,

415
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,760
again, revival is God bringing His people

416
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,240
back to spiritual health.

417
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,559
So when we think about the need for revival,

418
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,240
listen, the reality is that we could sit around

419
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,280
and we could talk about all of the problems in America

420
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,400
and certainly there are plenty.

421
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,480
But revival is for God's people, so what we really need to do is talk about the problems

422
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:10,240
with God's people, the church.

423
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:17,080
Now understand this morning as I speak about the church, I'm using the term very broadly.

424
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,040
Understand this morning that as I use the term church and share with you the statistics

425
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,440
that I'm going to share with you, that it is cross-denomination, all right?

426
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,400
Because we understand that at the very beginning, and I would hope that as I share these statistics

427
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:37,040
with you this morning, that these statistics would not be representative of our church.

428
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,840
However, we cannot have our head in the sand.

429
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:49,880
We can't act like it's always somebody else, and we don't have any need for revival, personally

430
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,560
or corporately.

431
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,400
Amen?

432
00:20:53,400 --> 00:21:01,240
And I want to share some truth with you that I hope would help us to acknowledge the need

433
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,040
for revival.

434
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:08,040
The sources for the statistics that I'll provide you with this morning are varied.

435
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:17,480
I used the Gallup Poll, Ignite America, the American Bible Society, the Barna Group, Probe

436
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:24,560
Ministries, and the Cultural Research Center at Arizona Christian University.

437
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,880
So I used a number of sources to come up with these statistics and did quite a bit of research

438
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:36,120
and really just three aspects of things that I want to share with you.

439
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:43,320
To look at the church as a whole, and really I'll say this right at the forefront, really

440
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:51,280
I believe this morning that the state of the church, quote-unquote church, in America

441
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,520
is weak and anemic.

442
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:02,660
And if the church is weak and anemic, she needs revival.

443
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:08,880
Because revival is God bringing His people back to spiritual health.

444
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,880
Amen?

445
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,120
And as we think about that definition, we think about the need for revival, as we acknowledge

446
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,720
these things here in just a moment, we would easily be able to look at and say, yes, the

447
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,480
church is weak, the church is anemic, the church has lost her voice.

448
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,720
The church has lost her way.

449
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,400
I would say this, in America the church has gotten comfortable.

450
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,400
The church has gotten apathetic.

451
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:46,520
There are more times in which the health of a church is measured by its finances and

452
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:53,800
its buildings than being measured by its converts and its disciples.

453
00:22:53,800 --> 00:23:02,040
And quite frankly, the latter should be what we use to measure the health of a church.

454
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,760
The church is seeing people saved and discipled and scraping the bottom of the barrel to pay

455
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,280
the rent.

456
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,120
So be it.

457
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,400
Because God is able.

458
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
God is able.

459
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,080
I want to share with you these statistics.

460
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,960
The first one is with regard to church attendance, and I know that you're here this morning,

461
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,240
but I want you to think about this.

462
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,920
This is from the Gallup poll, and they first started measuring church attendance or church

463
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,360
membership in 1937.

464
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:36,640
In 1937, they reported that 73% of the American population had some type of church membership,

465
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,360
and those statistics really remained consistent all the way up until 1999, when the number

466
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,320
was at 70%.

467
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,440
Now over the period of time, the definition of church membership was broadened and dealt

468
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,520
with not only a church, but a synagogue or a mosque.

469
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:05,720
And it went from 73% in 1937 to 70% in 1999, but by 2020, the number had dropped to 47%.

470
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,040
That's significant.

471
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,120
And here's what it says.

472
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:19,000
Here's what the statistics show, that every year, 2.3 million people leave the church.

473
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,560
That's a lot of people.

474
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,560
2.3 million people annually will leave church.

475
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,440
28% of those who claimed...

476
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,120
Now obviously, that's just a claim that somebody makes.

477
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,480
28% of those who claimed regular church attendance or claimed to be regular church attenders

478
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,240
pre-COVID...

479
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,600
I'm not sure how they answered this or why they answered the question, but they did.

480
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:51,000
28% that claimed pre-COVID to be regular church attenders have said that they have not attended

481
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,320
an in-person church service or even watched an online worship service one time since the

482
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,880
outbreak.

483
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,000
28%.

484
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,240
How does that happen?

485
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:11,440
They used to go to church, and then there's a virus and churches made live stream available

486
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,720
and 28% didn't even do that?

487
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,320
Let me share with you the statistics of our church, Fellowship Baptist Church.

488
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:29,580
On March 29th, 2020, pandemic, live stream, right?

489
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:38,280
We had 101 viewers, individuals, families, whatever, 101 that were watching our service

490
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,280
on March 29th.

491
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:47,120
By May 10th, that was the last Sunday where it was primarily live stream.

492
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,820
We never shut down entirely.

493
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:59,400
But from March 29th, 101 to May 10th, 40, 40.

494
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:05,680
That's a 60% decrease in like seven weeks.

495
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,740
Those are just the numbers.

496
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,720
We can go into our live stream and we can log in tomorrow and find out how many people

497
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,120
were logged in today.

498
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:24,440
Now, we don't know who they are specifically, but we can get the numbers, 101 to 40.

499
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:33,040
That's representative of our church that were logged in on live stream during the hype

500
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:37,960
of the, you can't go to church.

501
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,680
Let me share with you about Bible reading.

502
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,120
No doubt if church attendance is not important, Bible reading probably is even going to be

503
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,160
less important.

504
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:54,480
39% of the US adult population would be described as Bible users.

505
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,280
Now let me tell you how the American Bible Society defines a Bible user, because it's

506
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,360
not how I would define a Bible user, okay?

507
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:07,900
So they say 39% of the adult population in America are Bible users.

508
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:15,400
But here's what they say defines a Bible user is an individual who at least three to four

509
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:24,960
times per year, on their own, outside of a church setting, use the Bible.

510
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,960
That's not how I would define a Bible user.

511
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:36,440
Three to four times a year, wow, 39% are Bible users of the adult population.

512
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,280
Now that's a low number.

513
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:43,080
Of the 39%, 60% of them, okay?

514
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:49,840
So you take the 39% of the adults that say they're Bible users, 60% of them say that

515
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,000
they read the Bible less than one time per month.

516
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,640
Only 10% say they read it daily.

517
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,400
So 10% of the 39% would read their Bible daily.

518
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,760
Wow.

519
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,800
The church needs revival.

520
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,080
The church needs revival.

521
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,000
Job said this, I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food,

522
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,760
in Job 23, in verse number 10.

523
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,360
The psalmist cries out in Psalm 19, in verse number 10, speaking about the law of the Lord,

524
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,360
which is perfect.

525
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,840
He says, more to be desired they than gold, yea, than much fine gold, sweeter also than

526
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,520
the honey in the honeycomb.

527
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,200
The psalmist says this in Psalm 119, in verse 162, what a great verse of scripture.

528
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,160
He says, I rejoice at thy word.

529
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:41,280
And here's the description, the way in which he's rejoicing, as one that findeth great

530
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,520
spoil.

531
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:52,559
What a great example to help us understand the importance of the word of God.

532
00:28:52,559 --> 00:29:00,800
In a 2022, this year, a Barna study said this, that 25%, again, I'm not sure why people answer

533
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,360
the questions that they do, it just boggles my mind, but they do.

534
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:11,000
25% of those that were polled, that claim to be American Christians, so 25% that claim

535
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,160
to be American Christians say, it's no big deal whether they grow spiritually or not.

536
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,320
What?

537
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:30,520
Talk about a church that's apathetic, talk about a church that's anemic and weak, a church

538
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,600
that needs revival.

539
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,280
It's the church in America.

540
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:43,480
I think about church attendance and I think about Bible reading and I think about our

541
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,720
worldview.

542
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,400
How are we going to have a biblical worldview if we're not reading the Bible?

543
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,400
How are we going to have a biblical worldview if we're not going to church?

544
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,600
It'd be very challenging.

545
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,440
And we begin to think about the thought of...

546
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,120
a biblical worldview.

547
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,720
The Cultural Research Center at Arizona State University gave 54 questions that related

548
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:14,160
to worldview to senior pastors, associate pastors, youth pastors, and executive pastors.

549
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:19,920
And after they took all of their data from these that they gave the questions to, they

550
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:29,280
reached the conclusion that only 37% of American pastors have a biblical worldview.

551
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:39,320
How in the world are the folks standing behind a pulpit, they don't have a biblical worldview?

552
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,760
Only 37%?

553
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,560
After answering the 54 questions, and by the way, Arizona Christian University isn't exactly

554
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:54,900
where I'd be, but they're the ones doing the research, and they said only 37%.

555
00:30:54,900 --> 00:31:03,160
By the way, that was the number as they took all of the responses, but amongst those that

556
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:09,639
were the youth pastors that were dealing with the kids in the church, it was like 14%.

557
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:11,220
Now think about that.

558
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:16,520
If the people working with the kids in our churches in America, if only 14% of them have

559
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:21,639
a biblical worldview, how do you think the kids are going to have a biblical worldview?

560
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:25,400
It's never going to happen.

561
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,900
Here's how they said that they best would describe the worldview of those that they

562
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,880
did the poll on.

563
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,480
They said this, their prevailing worldview is best described as syncretism.

564
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,240
You say, I never heard of that word before.

565
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,800
Syncretism, according to how they've defined it with regard to worldview, is the blending

566
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:51,440
of ideas and applications from a variety of holistic worldviews into a unique but inconsistent

567
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:58,480
combination that represents their personal preferences.

568
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,760
That's a church in America.

569
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,760
It's a church in America.

570
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:11,160
My personal experience, we are sitting right now in Fairfax County, but more specifically

571
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:16,240
we're sitting in the Providence District of Fairfax County.

572
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:24,639
Back in February of 2021, the supervisor of our district hosted what they called a faith

573
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:26,960
leaders webinar.

574
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,960
I was invited.

575
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,960
Why?

576
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,880
Because I'm a faith leader in Providence District.

577
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,639
So I was invited, and I thought, you know, I don't have time for that.

578
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:39,639
That was my initial response.

579
00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:45,160
And then I said, you know, I ought to get on that just to see what's going on, kind

580
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,760
of get the pulse in our district.

581
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:57,880
Now understand it's faith community leaders, so it's every stripe that you can think of.

582
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,559
And I get on the call, and to be very transparent with you, I was doing some other things.

583
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,440
I was multitasking.

584
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,440
You can ask Holly.

585
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,720
I'm actually pretty good at multitasking.

586
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,080
Drives her crazy.

587
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,400
Brianna drives her crazy.

588
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,800
Brianna will say, are you even listening to me?

589
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:22,800
And then I'll tell her exactly what she says, and she's like, drives me crazy.

590
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:28,360
I was multitasking until I heard a statement, and it got my attention.

591
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,000
But then I found out that I misheard what the person said, because they said what I

592
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,760
thought they said was the iniquities within our district.

593
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,960
And I thought, man, iniquities within our district, that's what we need to be talking

594
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
about.

595
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
No, no.

596
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,600
They said the inequalities within our district.

597
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:55,160
Now this is a webinar with faith leaders in our district, right where we're sitting.

598
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,160
The inequalities.

599
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,559
Can I tell you the three...

600
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,520
There were three things that they specifically spoke about that took the entirety of the

601
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,639
webinar.

602
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:11,360
Number one, in our district, there is a transportation inequality.

603
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,119
There are people that are driving $100,000 cars, and there are people that don't have

604
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,040
a car.

605
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,640
Is there some truth to that?

606
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,640
Sure.

607
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,839
There are families that have five cars, and there are families that have one car, or no

608
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,660
cars, okay?

609
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:32,140
Why is that the focus of the faith leaders' webinar?

610
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:36,940
They went from transportation inequality to housing inequality.

611
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:42,299
We have mansions in our district, and we have homeless people in our district.

612
00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:45,820
Then they went to a healthcare inequality.

613
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:50,580
There are people that have great healthcare, and there are people that don't have healthcare.

614
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,299
And that was the focus.

615
00:34:52,299 --> 00:35:02,179
I was disgusted that as faith leaders in our community, that the focus of our time

616
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:07,860
would be on inequalities amongst our district, but it really gives us an idea of the pulse

617
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:12,779
of the church in America and what their focus is.

618
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:19,940
Now the reality is this, that with the problems in the pulpit, and only 30% of American pastors

619
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:25,299
that were polled having a biblical worldview, we would certainly have the expectation that

620
00:35:25,299 --> 00:35:31,940
those attending a church would be adversely impacted as well.

621
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,420
Probe Ministries is dealing with this idea of a worldview.

622
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:41,660
They conducted a survey, and they categorized people as they answered certain questions.

623
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,899
So you had to answer some certain questions, and as you answered those questions, they

624
00:35:44,899 --> 00:35:47,779
would categorize you based on how you answered the questions.

625
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:52,739
And so one of the ways in which they categorized people was this, as being born-again Christians.

626
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:56,619
All right, now that excites me, born-again Christians.

627
00:35:56,619 --> 00:36:00,500
Because if you say that you're a born-again Christian, there's something typically that

628
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,220
kind of carries with that idea, right?

629
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:10,779
But those that were polled by Probe Ministries that were classified as being born-again Christians,

630
00:36:10,779 --> 00:36:18,260
70% of them said that other religions can lead people to heaven.

631
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:24,299
So 70% of the people that said they were born-again Christians said there are other ways to get

632
00:36:24,299 --> 00:36:27,019
to heaven.

633
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,100
Seriously?

634
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:36,459
My Bible says that Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

635
00:36:36,459 --> 00:36:42,100
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

636
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:47,500
Peter who heard those words stands up and answers the religious leaders in Acts 4, and

637
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,179
he says, listen, neither is there salvation in any other.

638
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:56,420
There's no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.

639
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:00,140
And just in case you don't know what name we're speaking of, a few verses before, he

640
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,820
speaks it's Jesus of Nazareth.

641
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,459
The name of Jesus.

642
00:37:05,459 --> 00:37:14,839
So 70% of those that would say they're born-again Christians say there are other ways to heaven.

643
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:20,339
That same subcategory was then asked this question with regard to why they do not share

644
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:23,119
their faith.

645
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,299
And here were the top three answers as to why they did not share their faith.

646
00:37:27,299 --> 00:37:30,540
Number one, you probably already can guess it because of what they said, and that is

647
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:35,220
this, that people can get to heaven through their different religious beliefs.

648
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,820
Number two, we shouldn't impose our ideas on others.

649
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,540
And number three, the Bible tells us not to judge others.

650
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:46,500
Isn't it funny how a people that do not have a biblical worldview pull a verse of Scripture

651
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:51,179
that's not even within context and use it as their excuse for not doing what God told

652
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:57,619
them to do?

653
00:37:57,619 --> 00:38:03,500
You think about these three categories, church attendance, Bible reading, and worldview.

654
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:10,500
No wonder the church in America has missed it on so many other biblical matters.

655
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:16,179
The church in America, the church, again, I'm talking broadly, I'm not speaking specifically

656
00:38:16,179 --> 00:38:20,380
about fellowship after church, I'm talking about the church in America.

657
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:25,260
Church in America missed it on so many other biblical matters.

658
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:33,220
Church in America lost her voice with regard to life, with regard to marriage, with regard

659
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,020
to gender.

660
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,900
You think about it.

661
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:42,880
You can go across, listen, I went by a Baptist church in Fairfax County.

662
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,419
I won't name the name of the Baptist church, but I went by a Baptist church in Fairfax

663
00:38:46,419 --> 00:38:51,700
County and they had every flag hanging that you could imagine and big old banners, love

664
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,700
is love.

665
00:38:52,700 --> 00:39:00,099
Listen, I'm not saying that we need to be unkind, ugly, rude.

666
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:02,460
God's Word is God's Word.

667
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:05,460
God's Word settles it.

668
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,700
Someone said this, God makes the rules, not us, and He never changes.

669
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,700
Amen?

670
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:16,099
And the reality is that, listen, we've been given the responsibility in the book of Ephesians

671
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:21,940
in the fourth chapter that we are to speak the truth in love, but we must speak the truth.

672
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:26,940
And if the church has lost its voice, we find that as we look at all of the problems in

673
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:32,099
our country today, as we begin to sit around and talk about how these people are doing

674
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:40,359
this wrong and those people are doing this wrong and this, the church has lost its voice.

675
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:45,340
Many people in America today have no confidence in the church.

676
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,179
They would speak about the church being full of hypocrisy.

677
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:50,140
They would speak about the church just wanting money.

678
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,179
They would speak about the church, you fill in the blanks of all of the things that they

679
00:39:53,179 --> 00:39:54,539
would say about the church.

680
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:56,700
The church has lost her way.

681
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:02,420
I believe that a great problem that we're having in America, really in the American

682
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:07,220
church, is the same problem that the church in Corinth dealt with, and that is this.

683
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:12,900
The Lord placed us here to influence our culture.

684
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:17,660
But what's happened in the last generation, really more than one generation, is that the

685
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:21,340
culture has influenced the church.

686
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,900
I used this illustration years ago.

687
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:28,340
I think it would be advantageous to use it again this morning.

688
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:33,160
If we took and looked at a map geographically, and if you say, man, I'm not good at geography,

689
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:38,940
just bear with me, but if we say that leading from the east coast of the United States to

690
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:43,820
the west coast of the United States, if you would say that the church at one point was

691
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:50,420
in New York City, that's where we were established, and the world was in Philadelphia.

692
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:54,340
So the world's further left, more liberal.

693
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,060
The world, they're lost.

694
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:59,860
We would expect them to not have a biblical worldview.

695
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:09,620
But what's happened generationally is that the world moved from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh.

696
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,520
But the church didn't stay in New York City.

697
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:17,260
The church moved from New York City to Philadelphia.

698
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:21,300
And then the church stayed in Philadelphia, and the world was in Pittsburgh, but then

699
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,660
the church, excuse me, the world left Pittsburgh and they went to Chicago.

700
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:28,840
We're just going to use some big, big milestones, okay?

701
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,840
They went to Chicago.

702
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,500
And you already know what I'm going to say.

703
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,140
The church didn't stay in Philadelphia.

704
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:38,320
The church moved over to Pittsburgh.

705
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,220
And the church is in Pittsburgh, but the world is in Chicago, and so we say, well, we're

706
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,820
not as bad as they are.

707
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:49,380
The world's never been what we're to measure ourselves by.

708
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:56,100
The standard is the Lord Jesus Christ and His Word.

709
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:01,420
And to end the illustration, the church, the world moves from Chicago to Seattle.

710
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,980
We'll just go all the way to the West Coast.

711
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,780
But the church did not stay in Pittsburgh.

712
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:11,220
The church moved to Chicago.

713
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:16,220
And when you think about that illustration, what you will find is that a hundred years

714
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:24,180
ago, what was vile to the world is now accepted in the church.

715
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:34,500
What was vile to the world is now accepted in God's house, and it ought not be that way.

716
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,860
We're told in the Word of God, come out from among them and be ye separate, saith the Lord.

717
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:43,180
We are different by design, but we keep moving left.

718
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,180
Why?

719
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,180
I don't know why.

720
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,580
We want to be inclusive.

721
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,580
We've lost our way.

722
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:50,900
We've lost our voice.

723
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:55,980
And churches all across this land have Ichabod written over them, the glory of the Lord has

724
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,980
departed.

725
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:01,740
By the way, if you think about some of the denominations today that are completely apostate,

726
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:05,820
if you go back, we've never agreed with them a hundred percent, but if you go back several

727
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,820
hundred years, you'll find that they preached the gospel.

728
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:13,460
They stood for a lot of the same truth that we stand for.

729
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,780
And today they're completely apostate.

730
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,940
The church has lost its voice.

731
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,700
We've lost our way.

732
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:33,300
And so often the church is guilty of sitting back and accepting the division that our world

733
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:39,860
has painted and we're looking at people based upon a political affiliation and we're looking

734
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:44,340
at this political group and that political group and this is wrong and that's wrong instead

735
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:49,740
of us saying, listen, the church has lost its voice.

736
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,060
The church has lost her way.

737
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:56,740
The church needs revival.

738
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:01,380
God bringing His people back to spiritual health, why do we need to be brought back

739
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,580
to spiritual health?

740
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:06,700
Because we're weak and we're anemic.

741
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:17,380
And we can no longer just sit back and point our finger at other people and say, it's the

742
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:20,460
whatever group you want to talk about.

743
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,500
It's because of what they legislate.

744
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:27,180
I'd tell you if there's revival in our land and the church of God got revived and we did

745
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:30,820
what we're supposed to do, they wouldn't be legislating like they're legislating.

746
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:38,340
And I don't care which side of the aisle they sit on, amen?

747
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:43,580
Because righteousness exalteth the nation, but sin is a reproach to any people.

748
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:51,020
And it's the house of God, it's the people of God that need revival.

749
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:55,620
It's us as individuals saying, God, I need revival.

750
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:59,160
I need to be brought back to spiritual health.

751
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:07,559
Why is it that what was not accepted by the world a hundred years ago is now accepted

752
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:10,760
in my life?

753
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,760
Why do I...

754
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:18,100
I mean, look, we can get real pointed this morning, and maybe we need to.

755
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,860
Why do we listen to the things that we listen to?

756
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:23,120
Why do we watch the things that we watch?

757
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:28,200
Why do we allow garbage into our house that's going to influence our heads, our minds, that's

758
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:34,320
not been taken through the filter of Philippians 4.8?

759
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,840
Why do we have the associations that we have?

760
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,320
Why do we go to the places that we go?

761
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,840
Why do we dress the way that we dress?

762
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,840
Why do...

763
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,040
I mean, we could just keep going on and on and on.

764
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:50,960
The reality this morning is that there's a lot of problem outside, but if we're going

765
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,559
to be honest this morning, we say, God, we need revival.

766
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:57,720
It's me, it's me, it's me, O Lord.

767
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:03,080
We sing the song with the kids, standing in the need of prayer.

768
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:08,240
Not my brother, not my sister, but it's me, O Lord.

769
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,880
I need revival.

770
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:17,760
I hope that you would acknowledge this morning as we receive a report of the condition of

771
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:23,240
the church in America, we could, again, we could go on and on and on.

772
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:29,559
I've just looked at a few things this morning, and I hope this morning that we'd say, as

773
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:40,160
Nehemiah said, oh God, he wept, he mourned, he fasted, and he prayed.

774
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:45,000
When he prayed, he saw God for who He is.

775
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,880
By the way, that's a big problem is that we don't really see God in His rightful place

776
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,440
because when we see God in His rightful place, it's no longer that we're comparing ourselves

777
00:46:53,440 --> 00:47:00,559
amongst the church down the road or the lost people across the street.

778
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:02,840
We're seeing God.

779
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:12,000
When Isaiah saw God in all of His right to holiness, he said, woe is me, Isaiah 6.

780
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
He adored God.

781
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,760
He saw Him in His rightful place, and then he confessed, acknowledged the sin.

782
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,680
Oh God, if we just had a better government.

783
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:25,720
Oh God, if we just had a better...it's us.

784
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:32,400
Revival is God bringing His people back to spiritual health.

785
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,760
This morning, there's a need for revival, and we can expect, we can anticipate God's

786
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,600
working just as Nehemiah did.

787
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,600
Why?

788
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:45,220
Because God is God and He's faithful.

789
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:49,580
And as we seek the face of God and we say, God, we want to be obedient, we want to live

790
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:54,980
holy lives, we want to live lives that are pleasing in Your sight, God says, I can bless

791
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,420
you.

792
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:00,580
I can pour my blessing out and I will use you.

793
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:03,860
This morning, the need for revival.

794
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:08,100
Next week, we're going to look at the pathway for revival.

795
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,660
There's no point in looking at a pathway for revival if we don't first acknowledge the

796
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:14,260
need for revival.

797
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:18,220
We acknowledge the need for revival and then we study, what's the pathway?

798
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,460
I recognize I need it, but now how do we get there?

799
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:25,220
It's me, it's me, it's me, oh Lord.

800
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,380
We need revival.

801
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:30,059
Father, we love You.

802
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:32,059
We thank You for loving us.

803
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:38,980
God, I pray that in the quietness of this moment, as we have our invitation in just

804
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,940
a moment, that God, You'd move and work.

805
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:46,179
Would You help us this morning to be doers of the Word and not hearers only?

806
00:48:46,179 --> 00:48:49,340
Would You help us to be honest with You, Lord?

807
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:59,460
Would You help us to come to this old-fashioned altar and just plead, weep, Lord, over the

808
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:05,580
report of the church in this nation?

809
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:11,780
And though we would hope that these statistics would not be representative of our church,

810
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:18,140
we must not have our head in the sand.

811
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:22,820
I pray that Your people this morning, Lord, would do business with You.

812
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,940
We'll give You the glory for all that You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.
