00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
One, I'll be looking at verses one through 11,

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.960
the entirety of this first chapter this morning.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.280
And I've titled the message,

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.399
if you've seen in the bulletin already this morning,

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:12.199
The Need for Revival.

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:16.159
And we are going to have our fall revival

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:17.680
in just a few weeks.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.840
Brother Jason Caldwell will be with us

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.000
and we're looking forward to a great time

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.959
and looking that God would move and work

00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:26.620
in and through our midst.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.620
And I am so thankful that we can have a revival meeting.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.340
I believe it's important for us to have

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.299
this special type of meeting on our church calendar

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:38.779
with the emphasis on revival.

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:41.580
And the reality is that just because

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.540
you put a special meeting on the calendar

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.099
doesn't really mean a whole lot.

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:48.259
Amen, and we don't just put it on the calendar

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:50.619
because to be a good independent Baptist church,

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:52.500
you gotta have a revival meeting.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.099
That's not the purpose, that's not the point.

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:59.580
We earnestly desire that God would move and work

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.020
in and through our lives.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.660
Over the next three weeks today and the next two Sundays,

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.199
I plan to preach a mini series

00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:12.739
that really is intended to be a preparation for revival.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.699
The reality is that as an individual believer

00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:19.500
and as your pastor, I desire personally,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.379
and I desire for you personally, to be revival ready.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.379
It is possible that we could be revival resistant.

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:30.540
I don't wanna be revival resistant.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.699
I wanna be revival ready.

00:01:32.699 --> 00:01:35.620
We begin to think about the preparation

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.620
as we would personally and corporately as a church

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.180
prepare for this special meeting,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.540
that we would ask God that we would have

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.940
that longing in our hearts to see God work

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.419
in our lives individually, to see God work in our homes,

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:53.900
to see God work in our church,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.620
to see God work in our city and in our state

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.860
and in our nation.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.220
We long to see God work.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.419
God is able, by the way.

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:06.220
We begin to think about the truth of revival

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.779
and the need for revival,

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:10.619
and I came across this definition of revival.

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.380
It's a very simple definition, and I like it.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.339
And the definition is simply this.

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:21.339
God bringing His people back to spiritual health.

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:27.179
God bringing His people back to spiritual health.

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:31.779
I believe that a New Testament phrase

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:35.539
that would very adequately define for us

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:39.979
the idea, the thought of revival is found in John 15

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:43.020
when we speak about the truth of abiding.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.220
Abiding.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.179
We find that in that passage of Scripture,

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:48.660
Jesus is giving the truth that He's the vine

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.979
and we're the branches,

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:52.339
and He says repeatedly about the importance

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:55.179
of abiding in Him.

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:57.300
And I believe that that word abiding,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.220
it carries with it the idea of a continuance

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.220
or a remaining.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.619
You think about the truth of abiding in Him.

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:11.619
If I am abiding in Him, if you are abiding in Him,

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:16.100
the reality is that we ought to be learning of Him.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.940
Why?

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:17.779
Because we're continuing with Him.

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:19.220
We're remaining in His presence

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.179
and we're learning of Him.

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:23.380
And then as we learn of Him,

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.380
we ought to live in obedience to His Word.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.380
Oftentimes we speak about God's blessing.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.899
No doubt we pray that God would bless individuals,

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:39.699
that God would bless our church corporately,

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:43.580
and we pray about God's blessing upon our nation.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.860
The reality is that more than us

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.899
maybe using the term that God would you bless them,

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:54.580
the truth of God's Word, as I grow and learn,

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.580
I find that it's more that we would live blessable lives.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.619
Because God's blessing is the result

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:05.500
of the obedience of His people.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.539
We long for God's blessing in our lives individually,

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:11.460
but we ought to be living lives that are blessable.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.860
We long for God's blessing upon our church corporately,

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.940
but we have to be a church that is blessable.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.940
As a nation, we long for God's blessing.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.179
I would tell you that as a nation,

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:25.700
we are not very blessable right now.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.779
The Bible says that righteousness exalteth the nation,

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:34.820
but sin is a reproach to any people.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.500
And we find that as we think about

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.700
the subject matter of revival,

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.179
as I use that definition, that simple definition,

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.220
that it is God bringing His people back to spiritual health.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.179
We would find that at the very onset of this message

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:54.260
this morning that it's important to note

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.299
that revival is biblical.

00:04:57.299 --> 00:05:00.339
Revival is a biblical concept.

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:03.899
Revival, as you study the truth of revival,

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:06.380
you find in the Old Testament,

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.339
historically biblical record of the nation of Israel,

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:15.339
really Judah in particular, experiencing periods of revival

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.660
when God brought His people back into spiritual health.

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:25.339
Not only is revival biblical,

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:28.940
I would say this, revival is possible.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.019
You know, there's some people today, unfortunately,

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:33.820
that would take the perspective

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.940
that revival is just not possible.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.700
But I believe this morning that revival is possible.

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:41.420
I believe this morning that it is possible

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.179
for God to bring His people back to spiritual health.

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:49.739
And I would say this, that revival is for God's people.

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:54.059
It is God bringing His people back to spiritual health.

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:56.339
So revival is for God's people.

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:59.019
With understanding those truths,

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:02.619
it will help us to be able to conclude with accuracy

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:04.540
that we need revival.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.220
Oftentimes when we think about revival,

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.660
we think about the nation as a large entity.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.140
We think about the wickedness of our nation.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.100
We say, man, we need revival.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.579
No, no, no, the church, revival's for God's people.

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:20.100
Now, as God's people have revival,

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.420
as God brings His people back to spiritual health,

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.619
it will impact the world.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.940
It will.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.339
You read about some revivals historically,

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:33.299
not only biblically,

00:06:33.299 --> 00:06:36.140
but you read about some revivals historically

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:37.899
in our own nation,

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:38.940
and you begin to think about some revivals,

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.500
and you see how the people of God

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.380
were brought back to spiritual health,

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.500
and it affected the nation, the impact.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.179
As we look at Nehemiah 1 this morning,

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:53.220
I wanna examine this passage of Scripture,

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.940
and then I want us to make some application

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.980
that will, I believe, enable us

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.820
to establish the need for revival.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.859
Before we establish the need for revival,

00:07:04.859 --> 00:07:07.299
let's examine this passage of Scripture.

00:07:07.299 --> 00:07:08.420
Beginning in verse number one,

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.260
the Bible says,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.980
the words of Nehemiah, the son of Hakaliah,

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.260
and it came to pass in the month Chislu

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.739
in the 20th year as I was in Shushan, the palace.

00:07:17.739 --> 00:07:20.739
And so we find the setting is given to us in verse number one

00:07:20.739 --> 00:07:22.779
with regard to the timing and the place,

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:26.619
and we find that Nehemiah is about to reveal some things

00:07:26.619 --> 00:07:28.220
to us with regard to the condition.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.540
If you're taking notes,

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.940
I've simply given the thought for the first point,

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.660
the report received.

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:36.299
In verses two and three,

00:07:36.299 --> 00:07:37.940
we read of this report that is being received.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.339
Notice the Bible says that Hanani,

00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:44.019
one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah.

00:07:44.019 --> 00:07:45.859
And notice the Bible says in verse number two,

00:07:45.859 --> 00:07:50.260
and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.660
which were left of the captivity,

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.660
and concerning Jerusalem.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.420
We understand that Nehemiah is written

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.500
after the Babylonian captivity.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.980
There's already been an opportunity for a remnant to return,

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.739
and we find that Nehemiah reveals to us here

00:08:05.739 --> 00:08:07.859
in verse number two that Hanani

00:08:07.859 --> 00:08:09.179
and some of the brethren came,

00:08:09.179 --> 00:08:12.660
and notice what the Bible says that Nehemiah inquired.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.619
He says, I asked of them concerning the Jews

00:08:16.619 --> 00:08:19.820
that had escaped, which were left of the captivity,

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.739
and concerning Jerusalem.

00:08:21.739 --> 00:08:24.660
As I note that Nehemiah requested the report,

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.700
it reveals to me that Nehemiah had a measure of concern.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.500
Nehemiah, though he was there in Shushan,

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.859
according to verse number one,

00:08:32.859 --> 00:08:35.619
he had a concern for what was happening in Jerusalem.

00:08:35.619 --> 00:08:37.700
He had a concern, he wanted to know,

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.260
he did not want his head to be in the sand.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
He wanted to know what was going on.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.859
And so he requested the report,

00:08:44.859 --> 00:08:46.659
and we find that in verse number three,

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:49.619
the report is provided, the report is received,

00:08:49.619 --> 00:08:52.260
and notice the Bible tells us that they answer,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.099
Hanani and these other certain men of Judah,

00:08:55.099 --> 00:08:57.299
they answer, and it says in verse number three,

00:08:57.299 --> 00:08:59.340
that they said unto me,

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.700
notice there are three things that are mentioned,

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.299
the remnant that are left of the captivity

00:09:04.299 --> 00:09:06.780
there in the province, notice number one,

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:11.780
are in great affliction and reproach.

00:09:13.299 --> 00:09:18.140
Not only are the people that remain

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.739
in great affliction and reproach,

00:09:19.739 --> 00:09:21.340
but we find number two,

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:25.219
that the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down.

00:09:26.539 --> 00:09:29.219
And number three, that the gates thereof

00:09:29.219 --> 00:09:31.820
are burned with fire.

00:09:33.219 --> 00:09:35.979
I'm not sure what Nehemiah expected to receive

00:09:35.979 --> 00:09:38.820
in the report when he requested it,

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.140
but we find that what he received was an honest evaluation,

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.460
it was an honest report of the condition in Jerusalem.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.979
And it started with the people

00:09:46.979 --> 00:09:50.340
that they're in great affliction and reproach,

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.140
and then he talked about the wall and the gates,

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:58.539
and we find that Nehemiah receives this report.

00:09:58.539 --> 00:10:00.340
And what I'm most interested in.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.860
and as we could examine and speak about the report,

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.340
but what I'm most interested in is number two this morning,

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.220
his response is recorded,

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.500
how he responds to the report that he receives,

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.740
and we find that his response is recorded for us.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.220
And I believe that as we look at the response of Nehemiah

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.340
in this text of Scripture that we ought to take heed,

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.660
and we find that the Bible says this in verse number four,

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:24.780
and it came to pass,

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:25.740
notice this phrase,

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.580
when I heard these words,

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.220
he inquired,

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.660
he requested the report,

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.820
the report was then received by Nehemiah,

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.220
the men, Hanani and those other brethren,

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.380
they gave him an honest report of the condition

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.980
of the people and of the city,

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.140
and we find that Nehemiah responds to these words,

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:52.060
and it tells us this fourfold response in verse number four,

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.420
that I sat down, noticed, and wept,

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.100
and mourned certain days,

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:02.540
and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.020
You think he was impacted

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.980
because of the report that he received?

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:13.540
Man, he asked, and he received a report,

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:15.300
and it was broken.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.460
The Bible says that he wept,

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.180
he mourned,

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.100
he fasted, and he prayed.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.620
In the next several verses,

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.140
we read the prayer of Nehemiah.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.740
Again, very insightful,

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.860
as we begin to think about the need for revival

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.980
and establishing here this historical account

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.380
and then seeking to make application

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.420
for our own lives and our own time

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.020
so that we would establish this need for revival.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.660
Notice as Nehemiah begins to pray,

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.060
it says that he prayed before the God of heaven

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:52.780
at the end of verse number four,

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.420
and we notice as we come to verse number five

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.540
that his prayer begins with adoration.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:01.220
His prayer begins with adoring the God of heaven

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.340
and recognizing who God is.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.020
Notice it says, and I said,

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:10.020
I beseech thee, O Lord God of heaven,

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.980
the great and terrible God

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.060
that keepeth covenant and mercy

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:21.060
for them that love him and observe his commandments.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.940
Wow.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.020
Nehemiah is recognizing, he's acknowledging who God is.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.860
He says that he is the Lord God of heaven.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.260
We must never forget that we serve the Lord God omnipotent.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.700
We must never forget that he is king of kings

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.100
and Lord of lords, that he is the great I am,

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.100
that he sits upon his throne,

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.460
that he rules and he is able,

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.780
and we find that Nehemiah approaches God

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:48.020
in adoration, acknowledging who God is.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.700
He says the great and the terrible God,

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.540
notice what he says, that keepeth covenant.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.220
Aren't you thankful that our God is faithful?

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.580
Aren't you thankful this morning

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.940
that he is trustworthy, that he's dependable,

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.620
that he always does what he says he would do?

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.660
And it says that he keeps covenant,

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.300
notice what he says, and mercy.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.860
Now understand that our God is gracious

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.500
and our God is merciful,

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:16.860
and Nehemiah is recognizing that the God that he serves,

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.500
the God that he is praying to is a God

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.420
that keeps covenant and is merciful.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.340
Now we'll mention in just a few moments

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.660
as you come to verse number eight

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.140
how that Nehemiah rehearses the very covenant

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.940
by which he speaks of here in verse number five.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.220
We find that he then continues,

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:41.220
for them that love him and observe his commandments.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:43.980
By way of introduction,

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:48.980
I mentioned that we need to live blessable lives.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:56.180
See, God blesses those who are living lives of obedience.

00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.300
You say, well, God's blessing,

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.820
I understand that there are times

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.380
in which there are blessings,

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.820
and the Bible says the goodness of God

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.620
leadeth thee to repentance,

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.100
but I want you to understand that the Bible says

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.140
that the way of the transgressor is hard.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.020
God resisteth the proud.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.740
He gives grace to the humble.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.420
And we find here that our God is a God who keeps covenant,

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.660
our God is a God who is merciful,

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.900
and then notice as he continues to pray,

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.700
this adoration for God quickly turns

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.260
to an acknowledgement of sin in verses six and seven.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.540
Notice what he says, let thine ear now be attentive.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.660
By the way, aren't you thankful

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.300
that God hears us when we pray?

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.500
We have a God who hears and answers.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:43.140
Let thine ear now be attentive and thine eyes open,

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.540
that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant,

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.180
which I pray before thee now,

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.700
day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants,

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.540
notice this, and confess the sins

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.340
of the children of Israel,

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.980
which we have sinned against thee,

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:04.980
both I and my Father's house have sinned.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.500
Notice he continues,

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.940
we have dealt very corruptly against thee

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.420
and have not kept the commandments nor the statutes

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:19.420
nor the judgments which thou commandest thy servant Moses.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:24.540
This acknowledgement of sin is a necessary step

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.020
when we speak about revival,

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.380
and we'll deal with this a little bit more

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.980
next week in our message,

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.380
but the reality is that we find

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.180
that Nehemiah is acknowledging the sin,

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.660
he's not sugarcoating it.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.540
There's an honest evaluation that's taking place here.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.620
And he says, we're guilty, we're guilty.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:49.620
And notice that he then anticipates God's working,

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.380
for he says in verse number eight,

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.740
remember I beseech thee,

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.620
the word that thou commandest thy servant Moses,

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.460
saying, if ye transgress,

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.980
I will scatter you abroad among the nations.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.360
Why did they just go through the captivity

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.200
that they went through?

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.420
Why were they dealing with what they were dealing with?

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.060
Because they had forsaken the Lord.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.220
Jeremiah spells it out very plainly

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.460
as you read the prophet Jeremiah,

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.180
he says, listen, you have forsaken me,

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.820
you have forgotten me,

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.900
and you have followed after idols.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.600
That's what God's indictment against Judah is

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.860
in the book of Jeremiah,

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.540
and we find that here,

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:31.540
Nehemiah is recognizing that God had already said to Moses,

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.020
he'd already said that if we transgress,

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.980
I will scatter you abroad among the nations.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:41.100
Notice, but, aren't you thankful for that conjunction?

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.860
But, if ye turn unto me

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.520
and keep my commandments and do them.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.980
Though there were of you cast out

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.600
unto the uttermost part of the heaven,

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.760
yet will I gather thee from thence

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.420
and will bring them unto the place

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.920
that I have chosen to set my name there.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.200
Now these are thy servants and thy people

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.680
whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.320
and by thy strong hand.

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.800
Oh, Lord, I beseech thee,

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.520
let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant,

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.960
to the prayer of thy servants

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.400
who desire to fear thy name and prosper.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.200
I pray thee, thy servant, this day,

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.320
and grant him mercy in the sight of this man,

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:22.840
for I was the king's cupbearer.

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.760
I want you to notice the truth of verse number nine,

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.480
when he says, but if ye turn unto me

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.440
and keep my commandments and do them.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:36.040
God bringing His people back to spiritual health.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.760
We think about revival and we understand here

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.980
in the nation of Judah and the timing

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.320
and Nehemiah acknowledging all that had taken place

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.840
as he receives the report.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.880
And we find that he receives that report

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.800
and he responds really with brokenness.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.720
He responds by seeking God.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.200
He responds by not talking about

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.400
the wickedness of the Babylonians.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.400
He doesn't sit here and confess

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.800
how bad the Babylonians are.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.440
He doesn't confess the sin of the Egyptians

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.920
or of any other people group.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.560
No, he confesses their sin.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.600
Amen.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.080
Were the Babylonians wicked people?

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.840
Sure they were.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.520
God used them to judge Judah

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.640
and then God judged them because they were wicked.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.600
And we find here, you read the book of Habakkuk.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.560
It's a very interesting book in the Old Testament,

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.320
the prophet, because Habakkuk's asking questions

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.640
and God's giving them answers to help them understand

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.480
the revelation of God and understanding the truth

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.640
of all that was taking place with the judgment of God.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.120
But we find that in this response,

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:52.200
we find that Nehemiah acknowledged that there was a need

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:57.200
for the people of God to have revival in their time.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.800
I believe this morning that it is important,

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.120
even as I said that we would examine

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.520
this portion of Scripture,

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.280
but then as we would seek to make application

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.080
and then establish the need for revival,

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.040
I want to provide you with a report.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.280
The report that I provide you with is different

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.600
than the report that Hanani

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.480
and these brethren provided Nehemiah with.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.320
And quite frankly, you didn't ask me for the report.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.320
But if it's okay with you, I'm gonna give you the report.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:32.000
And I hope that even as Nehemiah had inquired of the report

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.840
he had required of the condition

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.840
that he receives the report and he's broken,

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.480
that as we receive the report this morning

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.040
to seek to establish the need for revival,

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:45.760
again, revival is God bringing His people

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.240
back to spiritual health.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.559
So when we think about the need for revival,

00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:53.240
listen, the reality is that we could sit around

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.280
and we could talk about all of the problems in America

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.400
and certainly there are plenty.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:03.480
But revival is for God's people, so what we really need to do is talk about the problems

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:10.240
with God's people, the church.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:17.080
Now understand this morning as I speak about the church, I'm using the term very broadly.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:21.040
Understand this morning that as I use the term church and share with you the statistics

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:25.440
that I'm going to share with you, that it is cross-denomination, all right?

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:30.400
Because we understand that at the very beginning, and I would hope that as I share these statistics

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:37.040
with you this morning, that these statistics would not be representative of our church.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:41.840
However, we cannot have our head in the sand.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:49.880
We can't act like it's always somebody else, and we don't have any need for revival, personally

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.560
or corporately.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.400
Amen?

00:20:53.400 --> 00:21:01.240
And I want to share some truth with you that I hope would help us to acknowledge the need

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.040
for revival.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:08.040
The sources for the statistics that I'll provide you with this morning are varied.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:17.480
I used the Gallup Poll, Ignite America, the American Bible Society, the Barna Group, Probe

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:24.560
Ministries, and the Cultural Research Center at Arizona Christian University.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:29.880
So I used a number of sources to come up with these statistics and did quite a bit of research

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:36.120
and really just three aspects of things that I want to share with you.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:43.320
To look at the church as a whole, and really I'll say this right at the forefront, really

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:51.280
I believe this morning that the state of the church, quote-unquote church, in America

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.520
is weak and anemic.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:02.660
And if the church is weak and anemic, she needs revival.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:08.880
Because revival is God bringing His people back to spiritual health.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.880
Amen?

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:15.120
And as we think about that definition, we think about the need for revival, as we acknowledge

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:20.720
these things here in just a moment, we would easily be able to look at and say, yes, the

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:25.480
church is weak, the church is anemic, the church has lost her voice.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:29.720
The church has lost her way.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:34.400
I would say this, in America the church has gotten comfortable.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.400
The church has gotten apathetic.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:46.520
There are more times in which the health of a church is measured by its finances and

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:53.800
its buildings than being measured by its converts and its disciples.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:23:02.040
And quite frankly, the latter should be what we use to measure the health of a church.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.760
The church is seeing people saved and discipled and scraping the bottom of the barrel to pay

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.280
the rent.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.120
So be it.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.400
Because God is able.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.400
God is able.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.080
I want to share with you these statistics.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:20.960
The first one is with regard to church attendance, and I know that you're here this morning,

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.240
but I want you to think about this.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.920
This is from the Gallup poll, and they first started measuring church attendance or church

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.360
membership in 1937.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:36.640
In 1937, they reported that 73% of the American population had some type of church membership,

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:42.360
and those statistics really remained consistent all the way up until 1999, when the number

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.320
was at 70%.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:50.440
Now over the period of time, the definition of church membership was broadened and dealt

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:54.520
with not only a church, but a synagogue or a mosque.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:24:05.720
And it went from 73% in 1937 to 70% in 1999, but by 2020, the number had dropped to 47%.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.040
That's significant.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.120
And here's what it says.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:19.000
Here's what the statistics show, that every year, 2.3 million people leave the church.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.560
That's a lot of people.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:25.560
2.3 million people annually will leave church.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.440
28% of those who claimed...

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.120
Now obviously, that's just a claim that somebody makes.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:37.480
28% of those who claimed regular church attendance or claimed to be regular church attenders

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.240
pre-COVID...

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.600
I'm not sure how they answered this or why they answered the question, but they did.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:51.000
28% that claimed pre-COVID to be regular church attenders have said that they have not attended

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.320
an in-person church service or even watched an online worship service one time since the

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.880
outbreak.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.000
28%.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.240
How does that happen?

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:11.440
They used to go to church, and then there's a virus and churches made live stream available

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:16.720
and 28% didn't even do that?

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:22.320
Let me share with you the statistics of our church, Fellowship Baptist Church.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:29.580
On March 29th, 2020, pandemic, live stream, right?

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:38.280
We had 101 viewers, individuals, families, whatever, 101 that were watching our service

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.280
on March 29th.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:47.120
By May 10th, that was the last Sunday where it was primarily live stream.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.820
We never shut down entirely.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:59.400
But from March 29th, 101 to May 10th, 40, 40.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:05.680
That's a 60% decrease in like seven weeks.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.740
Those are just the numbers.

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.720
We can go into our live stream and we can log in tomorrow and find out how many people

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.120
were logged in today.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:24.440
Now, we don't know who they are specifically, but we can get the numbers, 101 to 40.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:33.040
That's representative of our church that were logged in on live stream during the hype

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:37.960
of the, you can't go to church.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.680
Let me share with you about Bible reading.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:45.120
No doubt if church attendance is not important, Bible reading probably is even going to be

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.160
less important.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:54.480
39% of the US adult population would be described as Bible users.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:58.280
Now let me tell you how the American Bible Society defines a Bible user, because it's

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:02.360
not how I would define a Bible user, okay?

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:07.900
So they say 39% of the adult population in America are Bible users.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:15.400
But here's what they say defines a Bible user is an individual who at least three to four

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:24.960
times per year, on their own, outside of a church setting, use the Bible.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.960
That's not how I would define a Bible user.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:36.440
Three to four times a year, wow, 39% are Bible users of the adult population.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.280
Now that's a low number.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:43.080
Of the 39%, 60% of them, okay?

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:49.840
So you take the 39% of the adults that say they're Bible users, 60% of them say that

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:54.000
they read the Bible less than one time per month.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.640
Only 10% say they read it daily.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:02.400
So 10% of the 39% would read their Bible daily.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.760
Wow.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.800
The church needs revival.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.080
The church needs revival.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:14.000
Job said this, I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.760
in Job 23, in verse number 10.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:20.360
The psalmist cries out in Psalm 19, in verse number 10, speaking about the law of the Lord,

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.360
which is perfect.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:25.840
He says, more to be desired they than gold, yea, than much fine gold, sweeter also than

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.520
the honey in the honeycomb.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:32.200
The psalmist says this in Psalm 119, in verse 162, what a great verse of scripture.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.160
He says, I rejoice at thy word.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:41.280
And here's the description, the way in which he's rejoicing, as one that findeth great

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.520
spoil.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:52.559
What a great example to help us understand the importance of the word of God.

00:28:52.559 --> 00:29:00.800
In a 2022, this year, a Barna study said this, that 25%, again, I'm not sure why people answer

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.360
the questions that they do, it just boggles my mind, but they do.

00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:11.000
25% of those that were polled, that claim to be American Christians, so 25% that claim

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:18.160
to be American Christians say, it's no big deal whether they grow spiritually or not.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:22.320
What?

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:30.520
Talk about a church that's apathetic, talk about a church that's anemic and weak, a church

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.600
that needs revival.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:38.280
It's the church in America.

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:43.480
I think about church attendance and I think about Bible reading and I think about our

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.720
worldview.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:50.400
How are we going to have a biblical worldview if we're not reading the Bible?

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.400
How are we going to have a biblical worldview if we're not going to church?

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.600
It'd be very challenging.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.440
And we begin to think about the thought of...

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:02.120
a biblical worldview.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:06.720
The Cultural Research Center at Arizona State University gave 54 questions that related

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:14.160
to worldview to senior pastors, associate pastors, youth pastors, and executive pastors.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:19.920
And after they took all of their data from these that they gave the questions to, they

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:29.280
reached the conclusion that only 37% of American pastors have a biblical worldview.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:39.320
How in the world are the folks standing behind a pulpit, they don't have a biblical worldview?

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.760
Only 37%?

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:47.560
After answering the 54 questions, and by the way, Arizona Christian University isn't exactly

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:54.900
where I'd be, but they're the ones doing the research, and they said only 37%.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:31:03.160
By the way, that was the number as they took all of the responses, but amongst those that

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:09.639
were the youth pastors that were dealing with the kids in the church, it was like 14%.

00:31:09.639 --> 00:31:11.220
Now think about that.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:16.520
If the people working with the kids in our churches in America, if only 14% of them have

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:21.639
a biblical worldview, how do you think the kids are going to have a biblical worldview?

00:31:21.639 --> 00:31:25.400
It's never going to happen.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:28.900
Here's how they said that they best would describe the worldview of those that they

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.880
did the poll on.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.480
They said this, their prevailing worldview is best described as syncretism.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.240
You say, I never heard of that word before.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:42.800
Syncretism, according to how they've defined it with regard to worldview, is the blending

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:51.440
of ideas and applications from a variety of holistic worldviews into a unique but inconsistent

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:58.480
combination that represents their personal preferences.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.760
That's a church in America.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.760
It's a church in America.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:11.160
My personal experience, we are sitting right now in Fairfax County, but more specifically

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:16.240
we're sitting in the Providence District of Fairfax County.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:24.639
Back in February of 2021, the supervisor of our district hosted what they called a faith

00:32:24.639 --> 00:32:26.960
leaders webinar.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:27.960
I was invited.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:28.960
Why?

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.880
Because I'm a faith leader in Providence District.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:38.639
So I was invited, and I thought, you know, I don't have time for that.

00:32:38.639 --> 00:32:39.639
That was my initial response.

00:32:39.639 --> 00:32:45.160
And then I said, you know, I ought to get on that just to see what's going on, kind

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.760
of get the pulse in our district.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:57.880
Now understand it's faith community leaders, so it's every stripe that you can think of.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:02.559
And I get on the call, and to be very transparent with you, I was doing some other things.

00:33:02.559 --> 00:33:05.440
I was multitasking.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.440
You can ask Holly.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.720
I'm actually pretty good at multitasking.

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.080
Drives her crazy.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.400
Brianna drives her crazy.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.800
Brianna will say, are you even listening to me?

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:22.800
And then I'll tell her exactly what she says, and she's like, drives me crazy.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:28.360
I was multitasking until I heard a statement, and it got my attention.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:33.000
But then I found out that I misheard what the person said, because they said what I

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.760
thought they said was the iniquities within our district.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.960
And I thought, man, iniquities within our district, that's what we need to be talking

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:42.960
about.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.960
No, no.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:48.600
They said the inequalities within our district.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:55.160
Now this is a webinar with faith leaders in our district, right where we're sitting.

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.160
The inequalities.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.559
Can I tell you the three...

00:33:58.559 --> 00:34:03.520
There were three things that they specifically spoke about that took the entirety of the

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.639
webinar.

00:34:04.639 --> 00:34:11.360
Number one, in our district, there is a transportation inequality.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:15.119
There are people that are driving $100,000 cars, and there are people that don't have

00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:18.040
a car.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.640
Is there some truth to that?

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:20.640
Sure.

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:23.839
There are families that have five cars, and there are families that have one car, or no

00:34:23.839 --> 00:34:26.660
cars, okay?

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:32.140
Why is that the focus of the faith leaders' webinar?

00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:36.940
They went from transportation inequality to housing inequality.

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:42.299
We have mansions in our district, and we have homeless people in our district.

00:34:42.299 --> 00:34:45.820
Then they went to a healthcare inequality.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:50.580
There are people that have great healthcare, and there are people that don't have healthcare.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.299
And that was the focus.

00:34:52.299 --> 00:35:02.179
I was disgusted that as faith leaders in our community, that the focus of our time

00:35:02.179 --> 00:35:07.860
would be on inequalities amongst our district, but it really gives us an idea of the pulse

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:12.779
of the church in America and what their focus is.

00:35:12.779 --> 00:35:19.940
Now the reality is this, that with the problems in the pulpit, and only 30% of American pastors

00:35:20.059 --> 00:35:25.299
that were polled having a biblical worldview, we would certainly have the expectation that

00:35:25.299 --> 00:35:31.940
those attending a church would be adversely impacted as well.

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:35.420
Probe Ministries is dealing with this idea of a worldview.

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:41.660
They conducted a survey, and they categorized people as they answered certain questions.

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:44.899
So you had to answer some certain questions, and as you answered those questions, they

00:35:44.899 --> 00:35:47.779
would categorize you based on how you answered the questions.

00:35:47.779 --> 00:35:52.739
And so one of the ways in which they categorized people was this, as being born-again Christians.

00:35:52.739 --> 00:35:56.619
All right, now that excites me, born-again Christians.

00:35:56.619 --> 00:36:00.500
Because if you say that you're a born-again Christian, there's something typically that

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:04.220
kind of carries with that idea, right?

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:10.779
But those that were polled by Probe Ministries that were classified as being born-again Christians,

00:36:10.779 --> 00:36:18.260
70% of them said that other religions can lead people to heaven.

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:24.299
So 70% of the people that said they were born-again Christians said there are other ways to get

00:36:24.299 --> 00:36:27.019
to heaven.

00:36:27.019 --> 00:36:29.100
Seriously?

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:36.459
My Bible says that Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:36:36.459 --> 00:36:42.100
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:47.500
Peter who heard those words stands up and answers the religious leaders in Acts 4, and

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:51.179
he says, listen, neither is there salvation in any other.

00:36:51.179 --> 00:36:56.420
There's no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.

00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:00.140
And just in case you don't know what name we're speaking of, a few verses before, he

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:03.820
speaks it's Jesus of Nazareth.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.459
The name of Jesus.

00:37:05.459 --> 00:37:14.839
So 70% of those that would say they're born-again Christians say there are other ways to heaven.

00:37:14.839 --> 00:37:20.339
That same subcategory was then asked this question with regard to why they do not share

00:37:20.339 --> 00:37:23.119
their faith.

00:37:23.119 --> 00:37:27.299
And here were the top three answers as to why they did not share their faith.

00:37:27.299 --> 00:37:30.540
Number one, you probably already can guess it because of what they said, and that is

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:35.220
this, that people can get to heaven through their different religious beliefs.

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:38.820
Number two, we shouldn't impose our ideas on others.

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.540
And number three, the Bible tells us not to judge others.

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:46.500
Isn't it funny how a people that do not have a biblical worldview pull a verse of Scripture

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:51.179
that's not even within context and use it as their excuse for not doing what God told

00:37:51.179 --> 00:37:57.619
them to do?

00:37:57.619 --> 00:38:03.500
You think about these three categories, church attendance, Bible reading, and worldview.

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:10.500
No wonder the church in America has missed it on so many other biblical matters.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:16.179
The church in America, the church, again, I'm talking broadly, I'm not speaking specifically

00:38:16.179 --> 00:38:20.380
about fellowship after church, I'm talking about the church in America.

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:25.260
Church in America missed it on so many other biblical matters.

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:33.220
Church in America lost her voice with regard to life, with regard to marriage, with regard

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.020
to gender.

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:36.900
You think about it.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:42.880
You can go across, listen, I went by a Baptist church in Fairfax County.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:46.419
I won't name the name of the Baptist church, but I went by a Baptist church in Fairfax

00:38:46.419 --> 00:38:51.700
County and they had every flag hanging that you could imagine and big old banners, love

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:52.700
is love.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:39:00.099
Listen, I'm not saying that we need to be unkind, ugly, rude.

00:39:00.099 --> 00:39:02.460
God's Word is God's Word.

00:39:02.739 --> 00:39:05.460
God's Word settles it.

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:09.700
Someone said this, God makes the rules, not us, and He never changes.

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:10.700
Amen?

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:16.099
And the reality is that, listen, we've been given the responsibility in the book of Ephesians

00:39:16.099 --> 00:39:21.940
in the fourth chapter that we are to speak the truth in love, but we must speak the truth.

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:26.940
And if the church has lost its voice, we find that as we look at all of the problems in

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:32.099
our country today, as we begin to sit around and talk about how these people are doing

00:39:32.099 --> 00:39:40.359
this wrong and those people are doing this wrong and this, the church has lost its voice.

00:39:40.359 --> 00:39:45.340
Many people in America today have no confidence in the church.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:48.179
They would speak about the church being full of hypocrisy.

00:39:48.179 --> 00:39:50.140
They would speak about the church just wanting money.

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.179
They would speak about the church, you fill in the blanks of all of the things that they

00:39:53.179 --> 00:39:54.539
would say about the church.

00:39:54.539 --> 00:39:56.700
The church has lost her way.

00:39:56.700 --> 00:40:02.420
I believe that a great problem that we're having in America, really in the American

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:07.220
church, is the same problem that the church in Corinth dealt with, and that is this.

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:12.900
The Lord placed us here to influence our culture.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:17.660
But what's happened in the last generation, really more than one generation, is that the

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:21.340
culture has influenced the church.

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:23.900
I used this illustration years ago.

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:28.340
I think it would be advantageous to use it again this morning.

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:33.160
If we took and looked at a map geographically, and if you say, man, I'm not good at geography,

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:38.940
just bear with me, but if we say that leading from the east coast of the United States to

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:43.820
the west coast of the United States, if you would say that the church at one point was

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:50.420
in New York City, that's where we were established, and the world was in Philadelphia.

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:54.340
So the world's further left, more liberal.

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:56.060
The world, they're lost.

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:59.860
We would expect them to not have a biblical worldview.

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:09.620
But what's happened generationally is that the world moved from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh.

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:12.520
But the church didn't stay in New York City.

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:17.260
The church moved from New York City to Philadelphia.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:21.300
And then the church stayed in Philadelphia, and the world was in Pittsburgh, but then

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:25.660
the church, excuse me, the world left Pittsburgh and they went to Chicago.

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:28.840
We're just going to use some big, big milestones, okay?

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.840
They went to Chicago.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.500
And you already know what I'm going to say.

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.140
The church didn't stay in Philadelphia.

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:38.320
The church moved over to Pittsburgh.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:42.220
And the church is in Pittsburgh, but the world is in Chicago, and so we say, well, we're

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:44.820
not as bad as they are.

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:49.380
The world's never been what we're to measure ourselves by.

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:56.100
The standard is the Lord Jesus Christ and His Word.

00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:01.420
And to end the illustration, the church, the world moves from Chicago to Seattle.

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:04.980
We'll just go all the way to the West Coast.

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:06.780
But the church did not stay in Pittsburgh.

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:11.220
The church moved to Chicago.

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:16.220
And when you think about that illustration, what you will find is that a hundred years

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:24.180
ago, what was vile to the world is now accepted in the church.

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:34.500
What was vile to the world is now accepted in God's house, and it ought not be that way.

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:38.860
We're told in the Word of God, come out from among them and be ye separate, saith the Lord.

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:43.180
We are different by design, but we keep moving left.

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.180
Why?

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:45.180
I don't know why.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.580
We want to be inclusive.

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:47.580
We've lost our way.

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:50.900
We've lost our voice.

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:55.980
And churches all across this land have Ichabod written over them, the glory of the Lord has

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:56.980
departed.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:01.740
By the way, if you think about some of the denominations today that are completely apostate,

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:05.820
if you go back, we've never agreed with them a hundred percent, but if you go back several

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:09.820
hundred years, you'll find that they preached the gospel.

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:13.460
They stood for a lot of the same truth that we stand for.

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:16.780
And today they're completely apostate.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:19.940
The church has lost its voice.

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:22.700
We've lost our way.

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:33.300
And so often the church is guilty of sitting back and accepting the division that our world

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:39.860
has painted and we're looking at people based upon a political affiliation and we're looking

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:44.340
at this political group and that political group and this is wrong and that's wrong instead

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:49.740
of us saying, listen, the church has lost its voice.

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:52.060
The church has lost her way.

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:56.740
The church needs revival.

00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:01.380
God bringing His people back to spiritual health, why do we need to be brought back

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:02.580
to spiritual health?

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:06.700
Because we're weak and we're anemic.

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:17.380
And we can no longer just sit back and point our finger at other people and say, it's the

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:20.460
whatever group you want to talk about.

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:22.500
It's because of what they legislate.

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:27.180
I'd tell you if there's revival in our land and the church of God got revived and we did

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:30.820
what we're supposed to do, they wouldn't be legislating like they're legislating.

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:38.340
And I don't care which side of the aisle they sit on, amen?

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:43.580
Because righteousness exalteth the nation, but sin is a reproach to any people.

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:51.020
And it's the house of God, it's the people of God that need revival.

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:55.620
It's us as individuals saying, God, I need revival.

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:59.160
I need to be brought back to spiritual health.

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:07.559
Why is it that what was not accepted by the world a hundred years ago is now accepted

00:45:07.559 --> 00:45:10.760
in my life?

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:11.760
Why do I...

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:18.100
I mean, look, we can get real pointed this morning, and maybe we need to.

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:20.860
Why do we listen to the things that we listen to?

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:23.120
Why do we watch the things that we watch?

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:28.200
Why do we allow garbage into our house that's going to influence our heads, our minds, that's

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:34.320
not been taken through the filter of Philippians 4.8?

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.840
Why do we have the associations that we have?

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.320
Why do we go to the places that we go?

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:39.840
Why do we dress the way that we dress?

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:40.840
Why do...

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:44.040
I mean, we could just keep going on and on and on.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:50.960
The reality this morning is that there's a lot of problem outside, but if we're going

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:55.559
to be honest this morning, we say, God, we need revival.

00:45:55.559 --> 00:45:57.720
It's me, it's me, it's me, O Lord.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:03.080
We sing the song with the kids, standing in the need of prayer.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:08.240
Not my brother, not my sister, but it's me, O Lord.

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.880
I need revival.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:17.760
I hope that you would acknowledge this morning as we receive a report of the condition of

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:23.240
the church in America, we could, again, we could go on and on and on.

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:29.559
I've just looked at a few things this morning, and I hope this morning that we'd say, as

00:46:29.559 --> 00:46:40.160
Nehemiah said, oh God, he wept, he mourned, he fasted, and he prayed.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:45.000
When he prayed, he saw God for who He is.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.880
By the way, that's a big problem is that we don't really see God in His rightful place

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:53.440
because when we see God in His rightful place, it's no longer that we're comparing ourselves

00:46:53.440 --> 00:47:00.559
amongst the church down the road or the lost people across the street.

00:47:00.559 --> 00:47:02.840
We're seeing God.

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:12.000
When Isaiah saw God in all of His right to holiness, he said, woe is me, Isaiah 6.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000
He adored God.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.760
He saw Him in His rightful place, and then he confessed, acknowledged the sin.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.680
Oh God, if we just had a better government.

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:25.720
Oh God, if we just had a better...it's us.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:32.400
Revival is God bringing His people back to spiritual health.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:37.760
This morning, there's a need for revival, and we can expect, we can anticipate God's

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.600
working just as Nehemiah did.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:41.600
Why?

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:45.220
Because God is God and He's faithful.

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:49.580
And as we seek the face of God and we say, God, we want to be obedient, we want to live

00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:54.980
holy lives, we want to live lives that are pleasing in Your sight, God says, I can bless

00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:56.420
you.

00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:00.580
I can pour my blessing out and I will use you.

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:03.860
This morning, the need for revival.

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:08.100
Next week, we're going to look at the pathway for revival.

00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:11.660
There's no point in looking at a pathway for revival if we don't first acknowledge the

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:14.260
need for revival.

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:18.220
We acknowledge the need for revival and then we study, what's the pathway?

00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:21.460
I recognize I need it, but now how do we get there?

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:25.220
It's me, it's me, it's me, oh Lord.

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:27.380
We need revival.

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:30.059
Father, we love You.

00:48:30.059 --> 00:48:32.059
We thank You for loving us.

00:48:32.059 --> 00:48:38.980
God, I pray that in the quietness of this moment, as we have our invitation in just

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:41.940
a moment, that God, You'd move and work.

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:46.179
Would You help us this morning to be doers of the Word and not hearers only?

00:48:46.179 --> 00:48:49.340
Would You help us to be honest with You, Lord?

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:59.460
Would You help us to come to this old-fashioned altar and just plead, weep, Lord, over the

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:05.580
report of the church in this nation?

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:11.780
And though we would hope that these statistics would not be representative of our church,

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:18.140
we must not have our head in the sand.

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:22.820
I pray that Your people this morning, Lord, would do business with You.

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:25.940
We'll give You the glory for all that You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.
