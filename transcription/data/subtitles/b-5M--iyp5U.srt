1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,199
We're not going to get real far just looking at the first verse, in fact, this evening,

2
00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:10,000
and I'll be dealing with the full content of Genesis 19 in our next study with regard

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,119
to the destruction, of course, of Sodom and Gomorrah and all that was taking place there.

4
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:20,479
But I want to note, as we really look at the introduction to this particular chapter, and

5
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:26,940
I want to take note of the life of Lot, and I hope that it would serve as a warning to

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,540
each of us that are here this evening, those that are watching via live stream, as we would

7
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,860
note the progression of Lot in his life.

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,900
And of course, as we understand even in the 19th chapter, some of the information that

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:45,540
is given to us with regard to Lot, and look at verse number one, if you will, Luke, excuse

10
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:51,259
me, Genesis 19, verse number one, the Bible says, and there came two angels to Sodom at

11
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,259
Even.

12
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:57,380
These are the two, of course, that had been there with Abraham back in chapter 18.

13
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:02,540
We studied on two Sunday evenings through Genesis chapter 18, and we made note of the

14
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:08,660
ministry of Abraham as he met these that came, and of course, the Lord being one of them

15
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,980
and these two angels.

16
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:15,040
And then we took note as to the interaction and the discussion that took place, the intercession

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,099
of Abraham as he prayed to the Lord with regard to the total destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah

18
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:27,019
because of their wickedness and their sin, as God announced was very grievous, according

19
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:29,860
to verse number 20 of Genesis 18.

20
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:36,779
The Bible says that these two angels, they came to Sodom at Even, and it says this, and

21
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:43,900
Lot sat in the gate of Sodom, and Lot, seeing them, rose up to meet them, and he bowed himself

22
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,540
with his face toward the ground.

23
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:52,260
You'll remember that as we looked at chapter number 18 that the two angels left from the

24
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:58,379
presence of Abraham, but the Lord God Almighty stayed there, and Abraham drew near.

25
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:03,459
If you look in verse number 21 of chapter 18, it says, I will go down now and see whether

26
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:06,980
they have done all together according to the cry of it which has come unto me, and if not,

27
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,980
I will know.

28
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,860
And the men turned their faces from thence and went toward Sodom, the two angels.

29
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,059
It says, but Abraham yet stood, excuse me, stood yet before the Lord, and Abraham drew

30
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:24,059
near and said, wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?

31
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:30,259
And then the progression from 50 all the way down to 10, and you see in verse number 33

32
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:33,820
of chapter 18, the Bible says the Lord went his way as soon as he had left communing with

33
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,740
Abraham and Abraham returned unto his place.

34
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,539
And so we see that while Abraham is interceding, while Abraham is speaking to the Lord, in

35
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:46,940
verses 23 through 32, we find that really the event in verse number 1 of chapter 19

36
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:52,419
is taking place where those two angels, they come to Sodom at even.

37
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:57,059
And we make note of the statement when it says that Lot sat in the gate of Sodom, and

38
00:02:57,059 --> 00:03:02,580
that will be the title for the message this evening, Lot sat in the gate of Sodom.

39
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,220
I remember that while I was in Bible college and we had a professor, I don't remember which

40
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,539
one it was, but one of our professors, he would say often with regard to sin that it

41
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:14,660
will keep you longer than you want to stay.

42
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:21,300
That sin will take you further than you want to go, and that sin will cost you more than

43
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,300
you want to pay.

44
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,820
And I always thought that was interesting that this particular professor would use that

45
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:33,199
phraseology and that quote, if you will, and it reminded us of that and about the importance

46
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:39,119
of God's people walking in holiness as obedient children unto our Heavenly Father.

47
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:46,160
And as we look at the Word of God, we understand that there is an influence here in the life

48
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,960
of Lot, and we'll note the progression as we go through the message this evening.

49
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,039
But I want you to think about a couple of New Testament principles.

50
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,880
Hold your place here in Genesis 19.

51
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,160
I want you to turn to the book of Hebrews in chapter number 3, and then we'll go back

52
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,399
to 1 Corinthians just for a moment.

53
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:04,759
And I want to mention these two principles from the New Testament as we begin our study

54
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,020
this evening.

55
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:11,240
In Hebrews chapter number 3, note what the Word of God says.

56
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:18,640
Of course, in this particular text of Scripture, in verse number 8, the Word of God says,

57
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,559
"...hardened not your hearts in the day of provocation, in the day of temptation, in

58
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:25,640
the wilderness," and speaking about that hardened heart and what have you.

59
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,559
We come to verse number 12, it says, "...take heed, brethren, lest there be any of you an

60
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:34,040
evil heart of unbelief and departing from the living God.

61
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:40,160
But exhort one another daily while it is called today, lest any of you be hardened through

62
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,440
the deceitfulness of sin."

63
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,640
One thing that the Bible teaches us about sin is the deceitfulness of sin.

64
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,559
We speak about being deceived, and we understand what it means to be deceived, and we've been

65
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,320
deceived no doubt in our lives at some point.

66
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,119
We think about the way in which others could deceive us.

67
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:03,880
We are aware of self-deception, where we could deceive ourselves.

68
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,720
We think about this deceitfulness of sin, and the reality is that there are times in

69
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,079
which individuals would engage in sinful behavior, and they would be deceived in thinking that

70
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:19,720
they have some level of control over that which they're doing, perhaps even over the

71
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,760
consequences in which they will endure.

72
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:28,799
The reality is that sin is deceitful, and it reminds me again, I'll say it, what that

73
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:33,640
professor said to us on a number of occasions, sin will keep you longer than you want to

74
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,640
stay.

75
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,839
It will take you further than you want to go, and it will cost you more than you want

76
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,839
to pay.

77
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:44,720
When we think about this truth, the deceitfulness of sin, notice over the book of 1 Corinthians

78
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,679
chapter 15, and I want you to note verse number 33, as we use these principles as we dive

79
00:05:51,679 --> 00:06:00,359
into the text of Scripture there, and thinking about Lot, and learning from his life, hopefully

80
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,679
a valuable lesson for us.

81
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:08,920
In 1 Corinthians 15 and verse number 33, notice what the Bible says, be not deceived.

82
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
That's interesting, is it not?

83
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,040
We just talked about the deceitfulness of sin, and now we see that the Word of God says,

84
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,119
be not deceived.

85
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:22,720
So, therefore, we understand that what God is preparing to tell us here is given the

86
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,959
introductory thought of be not deceived.

87
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:25,959
Why?

88
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,119
Because we can be deceived with this thought.

89
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:35,200
And therefore, be not deceived, notice what he says, evil communications corrupt good

90
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
manners.

91
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:42,040
How many of you ever had your mom tell you when you were growing up that the bad apple

92
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,480
is always going to spoil the good apples, right?

93
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,679
You've heard it so many times as children, you heard it, maybe you've said it to your

94
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:54,799
children, and the idea is that you don't want to be around that bad apple because the bad

95
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:57,880
apple is going to spoil the good apples.

96
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:05,559
And here the Word of God says, evil communications corrupt good manners.

97
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:09,160
Be not deceived, evil communications corrupt good manners.

98
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,440
Oh, well, I can go over here and I can be with this group of people, and I will influence

99
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,040
them.

100
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:23,559
Be not deceived, evil communications corrupt good manners.

101
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:28,000
There's more than one person that has lived and walked upon the face of this earth that

102
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,200
thought that they could put themselves into a group of people that were evil people, that

103
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,920
were wicked people, ungodly people, and that they would be able to influence them to be

104
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,880
good.

105
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:47,720
And yet, evil communications corrupt good manners.

106
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,079
And we understand that principle.

107
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:54,519
We've lived, many of us, long enough in life to understand how that works and to see how

108
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:57,399
that works out in life.

109
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:01,799
I believe that as we look at the life of Lot back in Genesis 19, and really we're going

110
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:06,920
to look at a few chapters preceding Genesis 19, I want you to note back, if you will,

111
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,440
to Genesis chapter number 13.

112
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,600
This is where it really began in the life of Lot with regard to his demise, if you will,

113
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,160
to his downward spiral.

114
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,359
We note the progression in his life.

115
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:27,399
In Genesis chapter number 13, remember there was the strife between the herdmen of Abram

116
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:32,880
and the herdmen of Lot's cattle, according to verse number 7, and Abram gave Lot the

117
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,200
option of picking the land.

118
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,960
The Bible tells us in verse number 12, Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt

119
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:47,239
in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.

120
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:52,840
So we see, initially, if we were to consider the progression of Lot and to see where he

121
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:59,119
ends up in chapter 19, that it begins here in chapter 13, where he simply pitched his

122
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:02,239
tent toward Sodom.

123
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:04,440
He wasn't all the way in Sodom yet.

124
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,500
He wasn't living among them, but he faced his tent.

125
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,239
He pitched his tent toward Sodom.

126
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:22,200
The Bible tells us in verse number 13 of Genesis 13, but the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners

127
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,119
before the Lord exceedingly.

128
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:33,919
Yet we find that Lot pitched his tent toward Sodom.

129
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,320
Now there are some things that we understand about Lot, and we'll look at it more even

130
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,919
next week as we study the entirety of chapter 19, but when you look at the life of Lot and

131
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:48,000
you look at the unfortunate set of circumstances with regard to his family, and really the

132
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,559
way that he lost his family, and all of the things that go on, I don't think that here

133
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,520
in Genesis chapter 13, when he pitched his tent toward Sodom, that he ever thought that

134
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,520
would be the end.

135
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:04,400
We don't we don't think that way right? I don't think that lot said, you know, I'm gonna offer my children

136
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,560
I'm gonna let them go and live wicked ungodly lifestyles

137
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,200
And and these are going to be the actions that my children are gonna be known for

138
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,140
And and I I know that's gonna happen, but I'm gonna pitch my tent towards Sodom anyway now

139
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,760
Wasn't what he planned to happen

140
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,640
But he pitched his tent towards Sodom chapter 13 and verses 12 notice in chapter number 14

141
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
in chapter number 14

142
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,440
The battle is recorded here

143
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,240
of course Abram goes and delivers Sodom and

144
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,580
Lot and all of those that were dwelling there in that particular land

145
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,720
But I want you to notice in verse number 11 of Genesis 14

146
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,680
The Bible says and they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and went all their vittles and went their way

147
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,720
Notice verse number 12 and they took lot

148
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,720
Abram's brother's son

149
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,520
who dwelt in Sodom and

150
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
his goods and

151
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,160
departed in

152
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,760
chapter number 13 he pitched his tent towards Sodom in

153
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,760
Chapter number 14 the Bible tells us that he dwelt in Sodom

154
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
There's a progression, right?

155
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,800
He's no longer

156
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,480
There in the plain that's well watered and just simply looking toward Sodom

157
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,200
But now according to Genesis chapter number 14 he dwelt in

158
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,720
Sodom

159
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:42,840
And then of course we come to our text this evening in Genesis 19 in verse number 1 where the Bible says that lot sat

160
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,880
in the gate of

161
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:51,200
Sodom he wasn't just living in a wicked community. He wasn't just living in a wicked

162
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,600
City, but he was actually in a place a prominent position of leadership

163
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,400
Even within that city thus sitting in the gate of the city Wow

164
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,360
What a progression

165
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,800
It's true that we're in the world, but we're not of the world

166
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:16,640
In fact in John 17 in verse number 15 when Jesus is praying before he would go to the cross of Calvary

167
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:23,320
He asked the Lord to keep us his people keep them from the evil. We live in an evil world

168
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,320
We live in a wicked world

169
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,840
And we live in a world that does not

170
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,480
follow

171
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,480
Biblical teaching with regard to morality with regard to behavior that is acceptable to God

172
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,320
It's interesting if you were to consider the verbiage that the New Testament uses in describing lot

173
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,640
If you want to jot it down in 2nd Peter chapter 2

174
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,920
verses 7 and 8

175
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,820
The Bible says this and delivered just lot

176
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
vexed with the filthy

177
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,920
conversation of the wicked

178
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,600
For that righteous man it then says this dwelling

179
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
among them in

180
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
seeing and hearing

181
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,760
vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds

182
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,160
See

183
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,400
Lot made a decision in Genesis chapter number 13

184
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,120
The decision he made was that he was gonna pitch his tent

185
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
towards Sodom

186
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,320
And by the time you come to Genesis chapter number 14, he's dwelling in Sodom

187
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:38,480
By the time you come to Genesis chapter number 19, he's sitting in the gate of Sodom you see the progression

188
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,680
It's easy for us to note it in these few chapters and just looking at these few phrases of Scripture

189
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:50,560
I believe this evening that the enemy continues to work in the lives of the people of God and I believe that even as he worked

190
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,120
in the life of lot and seeking to do this very thing and that is this to

191
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,000
desensitize

192
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
the people of God to sin

193
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,800
To desensitize us to just kind of get used to it

194
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,160
No longer seeing sin for as wicked and ungodly as it really is

195
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,800
See as lot if you can imagine your mind this evening as he would pitch his tent towards Sodom and the Bible tells us that

196
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,800
These people were wicked

197
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,240
people

198
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,440
Grievous sinners and

199
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,920
Lot according to what Peter says in 2nd Peter chapter 2

200
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,960
Seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds

201
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,480
and you believe as you look at the progression to begin to see how that he would be

202
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
desensitized to wickedness

203
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,480
And no longer has that

204
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,360
appalling response that maybe at once did I

205
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,160
Don't know in your life if you can evaluate and identify

206
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,520
Maybe how that you've become desensitized to sin

207
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,840
How that living in this fallen world?

208
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,840
We've just kind of gotten comfortable with some things that are going on around us

209
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:16,360
We begin to hear some things we begin to see some things and we begin to just get desensitized to it. We're not as

210
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,640
Maybe it's not as appalling to us as it once was

211
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,840
Maybe that thing that we saw maybe that thing that we heard

212
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:33,160
We've just heard it so many times. We've seen it so often. It's just we've just become desensitized to it. You understand

213
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,040
It's a danger

214
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,520
Because sin is wicked. It's ungodly and

215
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,840
we as God's people are called to be holy and

216
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Here's what happens

217
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,600
Think about this just from when I was meditating upon this this week

218
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,400
When you read Genesis chapter 19 and you look at all of it and you see

219
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,480
Lot

220
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,480
You see his family

221
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,160
He's the nephew of Abraham. I

222
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,760
Mean think about that

223
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,920
Abraham we hold Abraham in high regard

224
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,880
and you think about the

225
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,840
the influence of Abraham and you think about the the position of Abraham in the Word of God and

226
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
his faith

227
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
But lot made a decision and

228
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,960
Lot pitched his tent towards Sodom and before too long. He was desensitized to wickedness to sin

229
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,160
He lost his family

230
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,400
It's a sad sad truth as we study through this 19th chapter

231
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,120
As you begin to read and understand all that takes place

232
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,240
Remember he goes to talk after he hears about the destruction that's coming

233
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,440
He goes to talk to his children and they don't even listen to him

234
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
They're not gonna listen to him

235
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
they become desensitized and

236
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,920
What lot had allowed in his life what what he had?

237
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,560
Just accepted as being

238
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,640
Allowable you start seeing that others begin to practice that immoral behavior

239
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:12,860
Read the end of Genesis 19. We'll look at it next week. Oh, man, it's terrible. What happens?

240
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
with the daughters of lot

241
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
But you think about this

242
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,040
Truth this evening. I wonder

243
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,080
How is the enemy trying to desensitize us?

244
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,280
Maybe I should ask it this way first is the enemy trying to desensitize us

245
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,480
Do you think the enemy is trying to desensitize you to sin?

246
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,560
You look at the morals of our society

247
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Have they not gone in an extremely downward spiral in the last 50 years in this nation alone?

248
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,520
Have they I mean sure

249
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,280
You see the downward spiral the

250
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:57,320
Immorality that is so prevalent in our society today in our culture today in which people just accept it as being well

251
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,320
That just happens

252
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:05,260
Right. I mean honestly, let's just be transparent this evening. It's all around us and listen

253
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:10,680
I'm not suggesting this evening that we need to go attack every individual that's living in some sort of sin

254
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:17,480
Misunderstand what I'm saying, but we need to be careful not to be desensitized to the the sinfulness of sin

255
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:25,840
That we're not deceived by it that our children understand that sin is is a reproach against the Holy God and

256
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,160
That we're not seeking to be desensitized to it that we still have

257
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:37,080
That response that sin is appalling to us that when we see or observe certain things that we say look at we're not gonna watch

258
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:42,160
That we're not gonna listen to that. We're not gonna allow that why because it's wicked. It's ungodly

259
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,160
I don't want to become

260
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,040
desensitized to that

261
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,040
Does that make sense this evening?

262
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,679
Because we get desensitized to it and before long what happened to say? Hey, did you hear what they just said?

263
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,280
I mean, I don't even know what they just said

264
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,480
Why because we just hear it so often. Did you see that? No, did I see what?

265
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,280
You

266
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,200
Didn't see that over there. Whatever that is. Whatever is being referred to. Well, you just see it so often

267
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
You just become so desensitized to it

268
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,440
We think about this

269
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,960
progression in the the life of lot

270
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,119
And we're gonna study chapter 19 next week

271
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:21,640
But I want to take you to a different passage this evening

272
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,040
And I want to share with you some things about King a has look at 2nd Chronicles chapter 28

273
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:33,080
2nd Chronicles chapter 28 now, I'm just gonna pick through a few of these verses this evening

274
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,720
To kind of illustrate the point if you will in in someone else's life

275
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:44,840
of this desensitizing to sin and sin keeping you longer than you want to stay taking you further you want to go and

276
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,559
Costing you more than you want to pay

277
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,820
As you think about King a has some of you

278
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:58,500
Immediately would be familiar with the wickedness of this man through your own Bible study

279
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,660
study and reading of the Scriptures,

280
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,340
and this is that King Ahaz,

281
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,039
the Word of God says about him,

282
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,760
and he's wicked.

283
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,880
But before we jump into chapter 28

284
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,800
of 2 Chronicles and look at some things

285
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,420
in the life of King Ahaz,

286
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,039
I want you to understand that he was

287
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,760
the son of Jotham

288
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,520
and the grandson of Uzziah.

289
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,059
You say, ok, what does that mean?

290
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:25,540
Well, these guys, Jotham and Uzziah,

291
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,479
we find that Uzziah in particular,

292
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:31,759
he was a man that God used in a great way.

293
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:33,599
The Bible says that God helped him.

294
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,500
God used him.

295
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,099
God strengthened him.

296
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:38,520
The Bible says of Uzziah

297
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,340
that he was marvelously helped.

298
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,400
We understand that in the life of Uzziah,

299
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,500
he goes in to offer incense

300
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,180
and he's smitten because of that

301
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,360
and he becomes a leper.

302
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,479
We understand that,

303
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:50,900
but Uzziah would basically be counted

304
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,040
as being a good king.

305
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,040
He's the grandfather of this man Ahaz.

306
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:02,479
Jotham, in chapter 27 of 2 Chronicles 27,

307
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:05,059
the Bible says of this man Jotham,

308
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:08,019
the father of Ahaz in verse 2,

309
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:09,860
it says he did that which was right

310
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,019
in the sight of the Lord

311
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:15,239
according to all that his father Uzziah did.

312
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:17,419
Howbeit, he entered not into the temple

313
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:20,360
of the Lord and the people did yet corruptly.

314
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,959
It's interesting in verse 2 of 2 Chronicles 27,

315
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:25,599
the Bible tells us about Jotham

316
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:28,860
that he was a man that was a good king.

317
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,300
He obeyed the Lord.

318
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,620
In fact, he learned a very valuable lesson

319
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,739
from his father entering into the temple

320
00:21:35,739 --> 00:21:37,160
and offering that incense.

321
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,620
And this man Jotham did not enter into the temple.

322
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,559
He understood that there was a role for the king

323
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:47,139
and there was a role for the priest.

324
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,440
But this man Ahaz,

325
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,599
his father is Jotham.

326
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:56,000
His grandfather is Uzziah.

327
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,879
But yet the Bible says in verse 1 of 2 Chronicles 28,

328
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:03,760
Ahaz was 20 years old when he began to reign,

329
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,479
and he reigned 16 years in Jerusalem.

330
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:08,479
Notice what it says,

331
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:12,279
but he did not that which was right

332
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:16,199
in the sight of the Lord like David his father.

333
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:18,820
For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel

334
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,860
and made also molten images for Balaam.

335
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,059
We're going to read some more about Ahaz here in just a moment.

336
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:29,360
But you understand that in the life of this man Ahaz,

337
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,559
though he had a godly heritage,

338
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,979
he had some decisions he had to make for himself.

339
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,240
He had to make a determination of how he was going to live

340
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,960
before the Lord God Almighty.

341
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,880
And we find that this man Ahaz,

342
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,619
he followed in the ways of the kings of Israel,

343
00:22:48,639 --> 00:22:51,559
often as there would be a reference in the Word of God

344
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:57,820
to the ways of Jeroboam.

345
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,520
I'm not sure why I said Jehoshaphat.

346
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,619
Jeroboam.

347
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:02,619
And they would walk in the ways of Jeroboam.

348
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:04,580
And the reality is that here,

349
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,119
you find that it just simply says

350
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:08,740
in the ways of the kings of Israel.

351
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,740
If you were to understand the nation of Israel

352
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,860
as a united kingdom,

353
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,380
and then after the reign of course of Solomon

354
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,860
as a divided kingdom,

355
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,220
Israel referring to the ten tribes of the north,

356
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,339
and then Judah the two tribes of the south,

357
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:23,979
and you would find of those ten tribes of the north,

358
00:23:23,979 --> 00:23:26,979
the nation of Israel as we'd often refer to it as,

359
00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:29,199
they were taken captive by the Assyrians,

360
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,160
but if you were to trace their heritage

361
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,660
and you were to look at all of their kings,

362
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,899
there's not one good king.

363
00:23:34,899 --> 00:23:37,419
They're all wicked.

364
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:39,979
It's an immediate downward spiral.

365
00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:43,699
You find that within the ranks of the kings of Judah,

366
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:45,660
that there were periods of revival.

367
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,139
There were good kings and there were bad kings.

368
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:50,139
And you see that process.

369
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:53,259
And here we find that Ahaz is one of those bad kings.

370
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:55,100
He's one of those that would follow

371
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,940
in the ways of the kings of Israel.

372
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,539
As we begin to think about the slippery slope of sin,

373
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:06,059
if you will,

374
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:09,179
the Bible tells us that he really had ungodly influences

375
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:11,539
according to v. 2 when it says that he walked

376
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:13,820
in the ways of the kings of Israel.

377
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,500
What are some of the things that this man Ahaz did?

378
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,739
In v. 2 it says that he had idols.

379
00:24:18,739 --> 00:24:22,859
He made also molten images for Balaam.

380
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:24,859
It tells us in v. 3,

381
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:27,579
moreover he burnt incense

382
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:30,540
in the valley of the son of Hinnom

383
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:34,579
and burnt his children in the fire.

384
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:35,899
Did you catch that?

385
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:37,700
He burnt his children in the fire.

386
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,059
You know the Word of God warns

387
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:43,420
about offering your children to Molech?

388
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:46,339
And yet we find that Ahaz,

389
00:24:46,339 --> 00:24:48,899
as he would get wrapped up in this idolatry

390
00:24:48,899 --> 00:24:52,299
as he would be influenced by these ungodly influences,

391
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:54,299
and he's burning incense to idols,

392
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:56,660
and now you find that he's offered his children,

393
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,019
it says, and burnt his children in the fire

394
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:01,459
after the abominations of the heathen

395
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:03,179
whom the Lord had cast out

396
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:05,739
before the children of Israel.

397
00:25:05,739 --> 00:25:08,380
V. 4, he sacrificed also and burnt incense

398
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,500
in the high places and on the hills

399
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,260
and under every green tree.

400
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,500
Wherefore, the Lord his God delivered him

401
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,700
into the hand of the king of Syria.

402
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,739
Isn't that interesting verbiage?

403
00:25:20,739 --> 00:25:22,859
Often we like to hear how God delivers us

404
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:24,339
from something,

405
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:27,339
but yet because of the wickedness of Ahaz,

406
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:30,380
the Bible tells us that God delivered him

407
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,619
into the hand of the enemy.

408
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:35,980
The king of Syria.

409
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,899
And they smote him

410
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,059
and carried away a great multitude of them captives

411
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:42,619
and brought them to Damascus.

412
00:25:42,619 --> 00:25:44,140
And he was also delivered into the hand

413
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,260
of the king of Israel

414
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,059
who smote him with a great slaughter.

415
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:49,540
Wow.

416
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:54,140
You think about the negative influences and impact.

417
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,059
I don't believe as you look at chapter 28 here

418
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:59,619
of 2 Chronicles that Ahaz had anticipated

419
00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:04,820
that this would be the result of his behavior.

420
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,179
He was participating in this wicked behavior

421
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,220
and he was doing these wicked things

422
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,820
and we find that he paid a great price,

423
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,339
that he suffered greatly.

424
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:16,500
He was deceived by sin.

425
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,940
We noted in v. 5 the way that he was dealing

426
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,339
with being delivered into the hand of the enemy.

427
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:24,540
Notice in v. 19, if you will, skip down

428
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,339
and look at v. 19, it says,

429
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:29,660
for the Lord brought Judah low

430
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,619
because of Ahaz king of Israel,

431
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:34,179
for he made Judah naked

432
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,700
and transgressed sore against the Lord.

433
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,779
When you look at the passage here

434
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:42,540
and you begin to think about how the Lord

435
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,019
brought Judah low,

436
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,500
and it says in v. 20,

437
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,859
until Gath-Pilneser king of Assyria

438
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:49,820
came unto him and distressed him,

439
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,779
but strengthened him not.

440
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,579
If you look previous in the passage,

441
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:54,660
we don't have time to deal with it,

442
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,779
but he actually offered to have these guys

443
00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:01,059
come and help him.

444
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:02,619
It says that they helped him not.

445
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:03,980
They strengthened him not.

446
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:05,420
Notice v. 21, the last phrase,

447
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,339
but he helped him not.

448
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:09,700
Notice v. 22, in the time of his distress,

449
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,179
did he trespass yet more against the Lord.

450
00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:18,739
This is that king Ahaz.

451
00:27:18,739 --> 00:27:21,220
For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus

452
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,779
which smote him.

453
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:24,299
Notice this.

454
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:26,579
And he said,

455
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:28,940
because the gods of the kings of Syria

456
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,420
helped them,

457
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,420
therefore will I sacrifice to them

458
00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:35,700
that they may help me.

459
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,899
But they were the ruin of him

460
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:38,179
and of all Israel.

461
00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:42,299
Now, did you catch v. 23?

462
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,500
Notice what it says.

463
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,579
This man Ahaz,

464
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:48,299
he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus.

465
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,420
Now, those are false gods.

466
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,940
Those are idols, right?

467
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,619
So he's offering these sacrifices

468
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:54,260
unto these idols,

469
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,820
and it says which smote him.

470
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,779
And so he suffered at the hand

471
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:00,299
of the people of Damascus,

472
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:02,700
and so he's going to make these offerings

473
00:28:02,739 --> 00:28:05,420
unto these false gods, these idols.

474
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,700
And his logic, his reasoning

475
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,899
for making these sacrifices

476
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:11,420
was because the kings,

477
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,220
excuse me, because the gods,

478
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,540
these false gods, these false idols

479
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,940
of the kings of Syria helped them.

480
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,779
And so I was defeated by these guys,

481
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:22,420
and they served these false gods,

482
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,619
and they have these idols that they worship,

483
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:27,579
and so their idols evidently helped them,

484
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:30,220
so now I'm going to go offer sacrifices

485
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,539
to these idols

486
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:33,820
because those idols helped them,

487
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,340
so maybe they'll help me.

488
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,140
He says, therefore, will I sacrifice to them.

489
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,460
Now, does that make your head hurt?

490
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,020
I mean, honestly,

491
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,739
when you read that,

492
00:28:46,739 --> 00:28:48,260
and you understand who his father

493
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,580
and his grandfather were,

494
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,260
when you understand the responsibility

495
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,619
that he had as serving as a king

496
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:57,299
under the Lord God Almighty,

497
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:58,580
and in the book of Deuteronomy,

498
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,940
the kings had been instructed

499
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,219
that if they were to write out

500
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:02,260
the law of the Lord,

501
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,380
and they were to read it

502
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,219
and to be engaged in it and to know it,

503
00:29:05,219 --> 00:29:06,739
in what's one of the commandments,

504
00:29:06,739 --> 00:29:09,260
thou shalt have no other gods before Me.

505
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,099
Amen?

506
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:12,260
I mean, listen, he's literally...

507
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,659
You tell me that sin's not deceptive?

508
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:17,859
The deceitfulness of sin?

509
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:20,140
He's now offering sacrifices

510
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,539
to these false gods, to these idols,

511
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:24,780
because he says, well, the idols helped them,

512
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,460
so therefore, I'm going to sacrifice to them.

513
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,299
Really?

514
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,340
Therefore, will I sacrifice to them

515
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:36,580
that they may help me.

516
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,219
Messed up.

517
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,700
You say, oh, pastor, you're being...

518
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,260
It's not gonna happen like that in my life.

519
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,739
Do you think Ahaz planned for that

520
00:29:47,739 --> 00:29:48,859
to happen in his life?

521
00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:51,260
Do you think Lot planned for it

522
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,739
to happen in his life the way that it did?

523
00:29:53,739 --> 00:29:55,059
I mean, we can go through a whole number

524
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:55,900
of illustrations.

525
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,340
In fact, there are people

526
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,619
that have written books.

527
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:03,819
that have given testimony of the deceitfulness of sin in their own lives and how they began

528
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:09,779
being engaged in activities that they never planned to participate in.

529
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:16,379
Sin is deceptive.

530
00:30:16,379 --> 00:30:19,099
Don't you think we're being a little overzealous here?

531
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:24,899
No, I don't think Ahaz planned that this was going to happen.

532
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:30,659
Young people begin to play around with sin a little bit, think they can get away with

533
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:34,619
this and get away with that and let's participate in this and let's do that.

534
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:37,499
Oh, sin is deceitful.

535
00:30:37,499 --> 00:30:41,299
But sometimes we just think about young people doing that.

536
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:46,939
Listen, sin is deceptive for all people.

537
00:30:46,939 --> 00:30:51,299
The devil's trying to get you in a trap, deceive you.

538
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:54,059
He's trying to get you to be desensitized.

539
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:59,179
The thing that comes up on the internet when you're searching for something that is supposed

540
00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:07,179
to be wholesome or good, and the enemy allows that thing to come up, you begin to get desensitized

541
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:12,739
to it because you've seen it and you've seen it and you look at it and you look at it.

542
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:18,419
You know, pornography is a big problem in America, huge issue.

543
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:22,979
It's amazing, it used to be something that predominantly affected males, but there are

544
00:31:22,979 --> 00:31:27,299
studies that suggest almost as many females are caught up in pornography as are males.

545
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:29,339
You say, I don't believe it.

546
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:32,539
You just go look at the studies yourself then.

547
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:35,259
Sad.

548
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:45,859
I worked with a man at this point, probably 20 years ago, 19 years ago.

549
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:50,339
The man got desensitized to images on his computer.

550
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:56,299
I really didn't know the man well, but I know the story well.

551
00:31:56,299 --> 00:32:02,579
He was a schoolteacher at a public school and he got desensitized because a deacon in

552
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:08,819
a church is a public schoolteacher, and he got desensitized.

553
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:14,059
And then he began to have an appetite for that stuff.

554
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:16,940
And then he had to start using the computers at school because he didn't want his wife

555
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,940
to find out.

556
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:22,259
Well, then there were some people in the school that had some IT experience and knew what

557
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:25,019
was going on and he got fired, he lost his job.

558
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:32,819
It was found out, terrible, terrible consequences for him.

559
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:37,580
That man came and worked for our company for one day.

560
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:43,179
I had jury duty that day and my boss had an exam in his master's class.

561
00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:47,019
It was just a small office, we only had four people, the other two were out of the office

562
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:51,979
that day, and this man came to work for our company one day, and all he did for the four

563
00:32:51,979 --> 00:32:57,179
hours he was there was search pornography and destroy our whole system.

564
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:00,500
It just destroyed him.

565
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:06,419
What I'm saying this evening is that that man never set out to lose his wife, his career,

566
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:10,699
his family, his children.

567
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:13,419
The devil wants to desensitize us.

568
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:21,059
He wants to think that we can handle it, that we can control it, but sin is deceitful

569
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:23,619
and it's destructive.

570
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:30,099
You find here at the end of verse number 23 in 2 Chronicles 28 it says,

571
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:36,500
But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel, and Ahaz gathered together the vessels of

572
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,799
the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors

573
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,119
of the house of the Lord, and he made them altars in every corner of Jerusalem.

574
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:50,159
Not only did he worship these false gods and sacrifice and make offerings to these false

575
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,039
gods, but the Bible says that he took all the vessels of the house of God and he cut

576
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,720
the pieces of the vessels of the house of God.

577
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,199
He shut the doors for the house of the Lord.

578
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:06,679
I mean, it wasn't that he had gone far enough that he's just worshiping and sacrificing

579
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:13,399
these idols, but he's ensuring that there's not going to be any worship of Jehovah either.

580
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:20,519
And it says that he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem at the end of verse 24

581
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:21,519
and verse 25.

582
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:26,919
And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods

583
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:31,600
and provoked to anger the Lord God of his fathers.

584
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:38,720
It's amazing that Hezekiah would be the son of Ahaz and that Hezekiah would be a good

585
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,720
king.

586
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,239
I mean, there'd be a revival in Judah under the reign of Hezekiah.

587
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:50,119
But as we begin to look and to really consider this evening of this thought in Genesis 19

588
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:58,399
and verse number 1, that this man Lot, he sat in the gate of Sodom.

589
00:34:58,399 --> 00:35:01,720
I want to remind you of Psalm 1.

590
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:09,199
The Bible says this in Psalm chapter number 1, blessed is the man that walketh not in

591
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:18,000
the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat

592
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,320
of the scornful.

593
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:27,959
And this evening, as God's people, I hope that we would understand the importance of

594
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,639
godly living.

595
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:33,839
Listen, we can live right in a wrong world.

596
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,579
We can.

597
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:37,239
We can live right in a wrong world.

598
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:42,679
We can obey God and serve God acceptably.

599
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:48,239
And we can, you know, somebody said this, I think it was actually Brother Mershawn said

600
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,679
this, it seems as if in America we don't blush at sin anymore.

601
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:58,279
And you can think about that expression and the verbiage in which Brother Mershawn used

602
00:35:58,279 --> 00:36:02,839
in making that assessment.

603
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:06,839
But why would it be that in America we don't blush at sin anymore?

604
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:10,839
Perhaps because we've been desensitized.

605
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:15,600
It's just become acceptable that this is just the way it is.

606
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:22,399
I wonder when's the last time we've been able to, parents, sit down with our children

607
00:36:22,399 --> 00:36:26,919
and explain to them why some of the accepted behavior in our society is not accepted by

608
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:29,679
God Almighty.

609
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:36,600
Biblically, why this is not approved, why this is not acceptable.

610
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,559
Why we don't support this.

611
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:44,919
Not suggesting that we go out there and boycott everybody and throw a big fit and have all

612
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
these kind of scenes.

613
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,699
No, I'm just saying, are your children being desensitized?

614
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:59,040
If you're not teaching them why the standards of morals in our society are not accepted

615
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,119
by God, they're being desensitized.

616
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:11,479
In the classrooms, alternative lifestyles and behaviors, again, I'm not suggesting we

617
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,760
go out there and attack everyone.

618
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,519
I'm just simply saying we can't be desensitized to it.

619
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:19,979
Because all of a sudden, you're a young person, you're going to come home and think that this

620
00:37:19,979 --> 00:37:23,160
thing is okay, whatever this thing is.

621
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,199
Because it's just another option.

622
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:32,559
You say, no, here's what God says.

623
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:36,279
See we've been saved, we've been born again.

624
00:37:36,279 --> 00:37:40,760
We have a higher authority and a higher standard.

625
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:47,320
Lot, he made a terrible mistake when he pitched his tent towards Sodom.

626
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:52,880
And it wasn't long before he was dwelling in Sodom.

627
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,839
And then according to verse number one of chapter 19 of Genesis, we find that he's sitting

628
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:03,199
in the gate of Sodom.

629
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:07,959
This evening, I believe that each of us would acknowledge that the enemy wants to desensitize

630
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:08,959
us to sin.

631
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:18,600
He wants us to think sin is normal and acceptable and it's just another way of doing things.

632
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:23,000
And I wonder this evening in your life, how is God working in your life, and then how

633
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,959
is the enemy working to desensitize you to sin in your life?

634
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:32,599
Are we permitting things in our home that maybe just a few years ago we wouldn't have

635
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:34,839
permitted in our home?

636
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:43,080
We're permitting things on our TV, we're permitting things in the radio, permitting

637
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:47,880
things through publications, permitting things through video games.

638
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:54,320
What are we permitting that's desensitizing us to sin?

639
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,880
And what we permit, unfortunately, we're going to begin to accept.

640
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:05,440
Unfortunately, you're going to see some people doing some things, perhaps even our own children

641
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,479
participating in activities and say, why in the world would they do that?

642
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:13,960
They weren't taught the sinfulness of sin.

643
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,479
They were deceived by it.

644
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,479
They thought it was acceptable.

645
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:20,679
They thought it was okay.

646
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:27,039
Next week, we'll study the entirety of Genesis 19, but I thought it important for us to understand

647
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:36,400
this progression and to be warned against being desensitized to sin in our society.

648
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,880
Because though the world and the enemy want to paint sin as being something glamorous,

649
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,559
it's a reproach against the Holy God.

650
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:49,799
And we need to understand that as the people of God.

651
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:53,440
So no, I don't want to be desensitized to this stuff.

652
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,839
I don't want to get on that slippery slope of sin.

653
00:39:56,839 --> 00:39:58,640
I don't want to come to a place and we say.

654
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,040
Say, how in the world did we get here?

655
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:10,560
What little things did I allow that opened up the floodgates, if you will, that brought

656
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,160
me to the place where I am now?

657
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:20,000
It's a much better thing to acknowledge the way in which the enemy is seeking to work

658
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
and say, I'm going to stand against that.

659
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,440
I'm going to get into the Word of God and allow the Word of God to get into me, and

660
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,320
I'm going to be careful as to what we will allow in our home, the things that we would

661
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:38,040
participate and engage in, because I don't want to become desensitized to sin.

662
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,200
Lot sat in the gate, but before he ever sat in the gate, he lived in the city, and before

663
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,880
he ever lived in the city, he pitched his tent toward the city.

664
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,840
We need to be careful what we're allowing in our lives.

665
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,840
Let's pray.

666
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,880
Father, we love you.

667
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,020
We thank you for loving us.

668
00:40:55,020 --> 00:41:01,540
We thank you for the warning from the life of Lot, the life of Ahaz.

669
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:08,900
God, I pray that this evening you would allow this warning from your Word to help us as

670
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,380
your people.

671
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:19,100
We know that the enemy would like to desensitize us to sin.

672
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:27,740
The way in which they would seek to describe the era in which we're living, the things

673
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:38,380
that they would allow and celebrate and legislate, just because the law of the land would allow

674
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:42,020
certain behavior doesn't mean it's right.

675
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:54,260
God, I pray that you'd help us as your people to blush at sin, to guard against the influences

676
00:41:54,260 --> 00:42:02,380
and the deceitfulness of sin in our lives, the lives of our children.

677
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:09,700
Would you help those that have children at home still to be particularly aware of the

678
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:18,620
dangers and the influences of the sin and the culture upon their children, that we'd

679
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:27,380
guard against it, that we might live as obedient children, that we might be holy even as you

680
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:31,660
are holy in all manner of conversation.

681
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,740
I pray that you'd work in this time of invitation, and we'll thank you for it.

682
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,900
In Christ's name we pray.
