00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.199
We're not going to get real far just looking at the first verse, in fact, this evening,

00:00:05.199 --> 00:00:10.000
and I'll be dealing with the full content of Genesis 19 in our next study with regard

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.119
to the destruction, of course, of Sodom and Gomorrah and all that was taking place there.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:20.479
But I want to note, as we really look at the introduction to this particular chapter, and

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:26.940
I want to take note of the life of Lot, and I hope that it would serve as a warning to

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.540
each of us that are here this evening, those that are watching via live stream, as we would

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.860
note the progression of Lot in his life.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.900
And of course, as we understand even in the 19th chapter, some of the information that

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.540
is given to us with regard to Lot, and look at verse number one, if you will, Luke, excuse

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.259
me, Genesis 19, verse number one, the Bible says, and there came two angels to Sodom at

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:52.259
Even.

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:57.380
These are the two, of course, that had been there with Abraham back in chapter 18.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.540
We studied on two Sunday evenings through Genesis chapter 18, and we made note of the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.660
ministry of Abraham as he met these that came, and of course, the Lord being one of them

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.980
and these two angels.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.040
And then we took note as to the interaction and the discussion that took place, the intercession

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:22.099
of Abraham as he prayed to the Lord with regard to the total destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:27.019
because of their wickedness and their sin, as God announced was very grievous, according

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:29.860
to verse number 20 of Genesis 18.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.779
The Bible says that these two angels, they came to Sodom at Even, and it says this, and

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:43.900
Lot sat in the gate of Sodom, and Lot, seeing them, rose up to meet them, and he bowed himself

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.540
with his face toward the ground.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.260
You'll remember that as we looked at chapter number 18 that the two angels left from the

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.379
presence of Abraham, but the Lord God Almighty stayed there, and Abraham drew near.

00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:03.459
If you look in verse number 21 of chapter 18, it says, I will go down now and see whether

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.980
they have done all together according to the cry of it which has come unto me, and if not,

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:07.980
I will know.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.860
And the men turned their faces from thence and went toward Sodom, the two angels.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.059
It says, but Abraham yet stood, excuse me, stood yet before the Lord, and Abraham drew

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:24.059
near and said, wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:30.259
And then the progression from 50 all the way down to 10, and you see in verse number 33

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.820
of chapter 18, the Bible says the Lord went his way as soon as he had left communing with

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.740
Abraham and Abraham returned unto his place.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.539
And so we see that while Abraham is interceding, while Abraham is speaking to the Lord, in

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:46.940
verses 23 through 32, we find that really the event in verse number 1 of chapter 19

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.419
is taking place where those two angels, they come to Sodom at even.

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:57.059
And we make note of the statement when it says that Lot sat in the gate of Sodom, and

00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:02.580
that will be the title for the message this evening, Lot sat in the gate of Sodom.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.220
I remember that while I was in Bible college and we had a professor, I don't remember which

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.539
one it was, but one of our professors, he would say often with regard to sin that it

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:14.660
will keep you longer than you want to stay.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.300
That sin will take you further than you want to go, and that sin will cost you more than

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.300
you want to pay.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.820
And I always thought that was interesting that this particular professor would use that

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.199
phraseology and that quote, if you will, and it reminded us of that and about the importance

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:39.119
of God's people walking in holiness as obedient children unto our Heavenly Father.

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:46.160
And as we look at the Word of God, we understand that there is an influence here in the life

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.960
of Lot, and we'll note the progression as we go through the message this evening.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.039
But I want you to think about a couple of New Testament principles.

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:54.880
Hold your place here in Genesis 19.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.160
I want you to turn to the book of Hebrews in chapter number 3, and then we'll go back

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.399
to 1 Corinthians just for a moment.

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:04.759
And I want to mention these two principles from the New Testament as we begin our study

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:06.020
this evening.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.240
In Hebrews chapter number 3, note what the Word of God says.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:18.640
Of course, in this particular text of Scripture, in verse number 8, the Word of God says,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.559
"...hardened not your hearts in the day of provocation, in the day of temptation, in

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:25.640
the wilderness," and speaking about that hardened heart and what have you.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.559
We come to verse number 12, it says, "...take heed, brethren, lest there be any of you an

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:34.040
evil heart of unbelief and departing from the living God.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:40.160
But exhort one another daily while it is called today, lest any of you be hardened through

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.440
the deceitfulness of sin."

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.640
One thing that the Bible teaches us about sin is the deceitfulness of sin.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.559
We speak about being deceived, and we understand what it means to be deceived, and we've been

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:56.320
deceived no doubt in our lives at some point.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.119
We think about the way in which others could deceive us.

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:03.880
We are aware of self-deception, where we could deceive ourselves.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.720
We think about this deceitfulness of sin, and the reality is that there are times in

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.079
which individuals would engage in sinful behavior, and they would be deceived in thinking that

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:19.720
they have some level of control over that which they're doing, perhaps even over the

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.760
consequences in which they will endure.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.799
The reality is that sin is deceitful, and it reminds me again, I'll say it, what that

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:33.640
professor said to us on a number of occasions, sin will keep you longer than you want to

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.640
stay.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.839
It will take you further than you want to go, and it will cost you more than you want

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:40.839
to pay.

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:44.720
When we think about this truth, the deceitfulness of sin, notice over the book of 1 Corinthians

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.679
chapter 15, and I want you to note verse number 33, as we use these principles as we dive

00:05:51.679 --> 00:06:00.359
into the text of Scripture there, and thinking about Lot, and learning from his life, hopefully

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:02.679
a valuable lesson for us.

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:08.920
In 1 Corinthians 15 and verse number 33, notice what the Bible says, be not deceived.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:09.920
That's interesting, is it not?

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.040
We just talked about the deceitfulness of sin, and now we see that the Word of God says,

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.119
be not deceived.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:22.720
So, therefore, we understand that what God is preparing to tell us here is given the

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.959
introductory thought of be not deceived.

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:25.959
Why?

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:28.119
Because we can be deceived with this thought.

00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:35.200
And therefore, be not deceived, notice what he says, evil communications corrupt good

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.200
manners.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:42.040
How many of you ever had your mom tell you when you were growing up that the bad apple

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.480
is always going to spoil the good apples, right?

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.679
You've heard it so many times as children, you heard it, maybe you've said it to your

00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:54.799
children, and the idea is that you don't want to be around that bad apple because the bad

00:06:54.799 --> 00:06:57.880
apple is going to spoil the good apples.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:05.559
And here the Word of God says, evil communications corrupt good manners.

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:09.160
Be not deceived, evil communications corrupt good manners.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:14.440
Oh, well, I can go over here and I can be with this group of people, and I will influence

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.040
them.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:23.559
Be not deceived, evil communications corrupt good manners.

00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:28.000
There's more than one person that has lived and walked upon the face of this earth that

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.200
thought that they could put themselves into a group of people that were evil people, that

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:39.920
were wicked people, ungodly people, and that they would be able to influence them to be

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.880
good.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:47.720
And yet, evil communications corrupt good manners.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.079
And we understand that principle.

00:07:49.079 --> 00:07:54.519
We've lived, many of us, long enough in life to understand how that works and to see how

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:57.399
that works out in life.

00:07:57.399 --> 00:08:01.799
I believe that as we look at the life of Lot back in Genesis 19, and really we're going

00:08:01.799 --> 00:08:06.920
to look at a few chapters preceding Genesis 19, I want you to note back, if you will,

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.440
to Genesis chapter number 13.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:14.600
This is where it really began in the life of Lot with regard to his demise, if you will,

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.160
to his downward spiral.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.359
We note the progression in his life.

00:08:20.359 --> 00:08:27.399
In Genesis chapter number 13, remember there was the strife between the herdmen of Abram

00:08:27.399 --> 00:08:32.880
and the herdmen of Lot's cattle, according to verse number 7, and Abram gave Lot the

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.200
option of picking the land.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:41.960
The Bible tells us in verse number 12, Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:47.239
in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.

00:08:47.239 --> 00:08:52.840
So we see, initially, if we were to consider the progression of Lot and to see where he

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:59.119
ends up in chapter 19, that it begins here in chapter 13, where he simply pitched his

00:08:59.119 --> 00:09:02.239
tent toward Sodom.

00:09:02.239 --> 00:09:04.440
He wasn't all the way in Sodom yet.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:09.500
He wasn't living among them, but he faced his tent.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.239
He pitched his tent toward Sodom.

00:09:13.239 --> 00:09:22.200
The Bible tells us in verse number 13 of Genesis 13, but the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:28.119
before the Lord exceedingly.

00:09:28.119 --> 00:09:33.919
Yet we find that Lot pitched his tent toward Sodom.

00:09:33.919 --> 00:09:37.320
Now there are some things that we understand about Lot, and we'll look at it more even

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.919
next week as we study the entirety of chapter 19, but when you look at the life of Lot and

00:09:41.919 --> 00:09:48.000
you look at the unfortunate set of circumstances with regard to his family, and really the

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.559
way that he lost his family, and all of the things that go on, I don't think that here

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:57.520
in Genesis chapter 13, when he pitched his tent toward Sodom, that he ever thought that

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.520
would be the end.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:04.400
We don't we don't think that way right? I don't think that lot said, you know, I'm gonna offer my children

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.560
I'm gonna let them go and live wicked ungodly lifestyles

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:13.200
And and these are going to be the actions that my children are gonna be known for

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:19.140
And and I I know that's gonna happen, but I'm gonna pitch my tent towards Sodom anyway now

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.760
Wasn't what he planned to happen

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:27.640
But he pitched his tent towards Sodom chapter 13 and verses 12 notice in chapter number 14

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.600
in chapter number 14

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.440
The battle is recorded here

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.240
of course Abram goes and delivers Sodom and

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.580
Lot and all of those that were dwelling there in that particular land

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.720
But I want you to notice in verse number 11 of Genesis 14

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:53.680
The Bible says and they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and went all their vittles and went their way

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.720
Notice verse number 12 and they took lot

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.720
Abram's brother's son

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.520
who dwelt in Sodom and

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.200
his goods and

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.160
departed in

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.760
chapter number 13 he pitched his tent towards Sodom in

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:17.760
Chapter number 14 the Bible tells us that he dwelt in Sodom

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.560
There's a progression, right?

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.800
He's no longer

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:28.480
There in the plain that's well watered and just simply looking toward Sodom

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.200
But now according to Genesis chapter number 14 he dwelt in

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.720
Sodom

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:42.840
And then of course we come to our text this evening in Genesis 19 in verse number 1 where the Bible says that lot sat

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.880
in the gate of

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:51.200
Sodom he wasn't just living in a wicked community. He wasn't just living in a wicked

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.600
City, but he was actually in a place a prominent position of leadership

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:02.400
Even within that city thus sitting in the gate of the city Wow

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.360
What a progression

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.800
It's true that we're in the world, but we're not of the world

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:16.640
In fact in John 17 in verse number 15 when Jesus is praying before he would go to the cross of Calvary

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:23.320
He asked the Lord to keep us his people keep them from the evil. We live in an evil world

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.320
We live in a wicked world

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.840
And we live in a world that does not

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.480
follow

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:36.480
Biblical teaching with regard to morality with regard to behavior that is acceptable to God

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:43.320
It's interesting if you were to consider the verbiage that the New Testament uses in describing lot

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.640
If you want to jot it down in 2nd Peter chapter 2

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.920
verses 7 and 8

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.820
The Bible says this and delivered just lot

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.200
vexed with the filthy

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.920
conversation of the wicked

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.600
For that righteous man it then says this dwelling

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.360
among them in

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.440
seeing and hearing

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:13.760
vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.160
See

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.400
Lot made a decision in Genesis chapter number 13

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.120
The decision he made was that he was gonna pitch his tent

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.720
towards Sodom

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.320
And by the time you come to Genesis chapter number 14, he's dwelling in Sodom

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:38.480
By the time you come to Genesis chapter number 19, he's sitting in the gate of Sodom you see the progression

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:43.680
It's easy for us to note it in these few chapters and just looking at these few phrases of Scripture

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:50.560
I believe this evening that the enemy continues to work in the lives of the people of God and I believe that even as he worked

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:55.120
in the life of lot and seeking to do this very thing and that is this to

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.000
desensitize

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
the people of God to sin

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:04.800
To desensitize us to just kind of get used to it

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:10.160
No longer seeing sin for as wicked and ungodly as it really is

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:17.800
See as lot if you can imagine your mind this evening as he would pitch his tent towards Sodom and the Bible tells us that

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.800
These people were wicked

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.240
people

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.440
Grievous sinners and

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.920
Lot according to what Peter says in 2nd Peter chapter 2

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:35.960
Seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:41.480
and you believe as you look at the progression to begin to see how that he would be

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
desensitized to wickedness

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.480
And no longer has that

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.360
appalling response that maybe at once did I

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.160
Don't know in your life if you can evaluate and identify

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.520
Maybe how that you've become desensitized to sin

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.840
How that living in this fallen world?

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.840
We've just kind of gotten comfortable with some things that are going on around us

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:16.360
We begin to hear some things we begin to see some things and we begin to just get desensitized to it. We're not as

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.640
Maybe it's not as appalling to us as it once was

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.840
Maybe that thing that we saw maybe that thing that we heard

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:33.160
We've just heard it so many times. We've seen it so often. It's just we've just become desensitized to it. You understand

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.040
It's a danger

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.520
Because sin is wicked. It's ungodly and

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.840
we as God's people are called to be holy and

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Here's what happens

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.600
Think about this just from when I was meditating upon this this week

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:55.400
When you read Genesis chapter 19 and you look at all of it and you see

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.480
Lot

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.480
You see his family

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.160
He's the nephew of Abraham. I

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.760
Mean think about that

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.920
Abraham we hold Abraham in high regard

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.880
and you think about the

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.840
the influence of Abraham and you think about the the position of Abraham in the Word of God and

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.320
his faith

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.560
But lot made a decision and

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:29.960
Lot pitched his tent towards Sodom and before too long. He was desensitized to wickedness to sin

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.160
He lost his family

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.400
It's a sad sad truth as we study through this 19th chapter

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.120
As you begin to read and understand all that takes place

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.240
Remember he goes to talk after he hears about the destruction that's coming

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.440
He goes to talk to his children and they don't even listen to him

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.600
They're not gonna listen to him

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.800
they become desensitized and

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:56.920
What lot had allowed in his life what what he had?

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.560
Just accepted as being

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:05.640
Allowable you start seeing that others begin to practice that immoral behavior

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:12.860
Read the end of Genesis 19. We'll look at it next week. Oh, man, it's terrible. What happens?

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.520
with the daughters of lot

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.800
But you think about this

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.040
Truth this evening. I wonder

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.080
How is the enemy trying to desensitize us?

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.280
Maybe I should ask it this way first is the enemy trying to desensitize us

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.480
Do you think the enemy is trying to desensitize you to sin?

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.560
You look at the morals of our society

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:42.200
Have they not gone in an extremely downward spiral in the last 50 years in this nation alone?

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.520
Have they I mean sure

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.280
You see the downward spiral the

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:57.320
Immorality that is so prevalent in our society today in our culture today in which people just accept it as being well

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.320
That just happens

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:05.260
Right. I mean honestly, let's just be transparent this evening. It's all around us and listen

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:10.680
I'm not suggesting this evening that we need to go attack every individual that's living in some sort of sin

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:17.480
Misunderstand what I'm saying, but we need to be careful not to be desensitized to the the sinfulness of sin

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:25.840
That we're not deceived by it that our children understand that sin is is a reproach against the Holy God and

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.160
That we're not seeking to be desensitized to it that we still have

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:37.080
That response that sin is appalling to us that when we see or observe certain things that we say look at we're not gonna watch

00:18:37.119 --> 00:18:42.160
That we're not gonna listen to that. We're not gonna allow that why because it's wicked. It's ungodly

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.160
I don't want to become

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.040
desensitized to that

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.040
Does that make sense this evening?

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:53.679
Because we get desensitized to it and before long what happened to say? Hey, did you hear what they just said?

00:18:53.679 --> 00:18:56.280
I mean, I don't even know what they just said

00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:01.480
Why because we just hear it so often. Did you see that? No, did I see what?

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.280
You

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:08.200
Didn't see that over there. Whatever that is. Whatever is being referred to. Well, you just see it so often

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.200
You just become so desensitized to it

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.440
We think about this

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.960
progression in the the life of lot

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.119
And we're gonna study chapter 19 next week

00:19:19.119 --> 00:19:21.640
But I want to take you to a different passage this evening

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.040
And I want to share with you some things about King a has look at 2nd Chronicles chapter 28

00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:33.080
2nd Chronicles chapter 28 now, I'm just gonna pick through a few of these verses this evening

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.720
To kind of illustrate the point if you will in in someone else's life

00:19:38.679 --> 00:19:44.840
of this desensitizing to sin and sin keeping you longer than you want to stay taking you further you want to go and

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:47.559
Costing you more than you want to pay

00:19:49.679 --> 00:19:52.820
As you think about King a has some of you

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:58.500
Immediately would be familiar with the wickedness of this man through your own Bible study

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.660
study and reading of the Scriptures,

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.340
and this is that King Ahaz,

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.039
the Word of God says about him,

00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:06.760
and he's wicked.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.880
But before we jump into chapter 28

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.800
of 2 Chronicles and look at some things

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.420
in the life of King Ahaz,

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.039
I want you to understand that he was

00:20:14.039 --> 00:20:16.760
the son of Jotham

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.520
and the grandson of Uzziah.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.059
You say, ok, what does that mean?

00:20:22.059 --> 00:20:25.540
Well, these guys, Jotham and Uzziah,

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.479
we find that Uzziah in particular,

00:20:28.479 --> 00:20:31.759
he was a man that God used in a great way.

00:20:31.759 --> 00:20:33.599
The Bible says that God helped him.

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:34.500
God used him.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.099
God strengthened him.

00:20:37.099 --> 00:20:38.520
The Bible says of Uzziah

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.340
that he was marvelously helped.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.400
We understand that in the life of Uzziah,

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.500
he goes in to offer incense

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.180
and he's smitten because of that

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.360
and he becomes a leper.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.479
We understand that,

00:20:48.479 --> 00:20:50.900
but Uzziah would basically be counted

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:54.040
as being a good king.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:58.040
He's the grandfather of this man Ahaz.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:02.479
Jotham, in chapter 27 of 2 Chronicles 27,

00:21:02.479 --> 00:21:05.059
the Bible says of this man Jotham,

00:21:05.059 --> 00:21:08.019
the father of Ahaz in verse 2,

00:21:08.019 --> 00:21:09.860
it says he did that which was right

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.019
in the sight of the Lord

00:21:11.019 --> 00:21:15.239
according to all that his father Uzziah did.

00:21:15.239 --> 00:21:17.419
Howbeit, he entered not into the temple

00:21:17.419 --> 00:21:20.360
of the Lord and the people did yet corruptly.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.959
It's interesting in verse 2 of 2 Chronicles 27,

00:21:23.959 --> 00:21:25.599
the Bible tells us about Jotham

00:21:25.599 --> 00:21:28.860
that he was a man that was a good king.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.300
He obeyed the Lord.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.620
In fact, he learned a very valuable lesson

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.739
from his father entering into the temple

00:21:35.739 --> 00:21:37.160
and offering that incense.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.620
And this man Jotham did not enter into the temple.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.559
He understood that there was a role for the king

00:21:43.559 --> 00:21:47.139
and there was a role for the priest.

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:50.440
But this man Ahaz,

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.599
his father is Jotham.

00:21:52.639 --> 00:21:56.000
His grandfather is Uzziah.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.879
But yet the Bible says in verse 1 of 2 Chronicles 28,

00:21:59.879 --> 00:22:03.760
Ahaz was 20 years old when he began to reign,

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.479
and he reigned 16 years in Jerusalem.

00:22:07.479 --> 00:22:08.479
Notice what it says,

00:22:08.479 --> 00:22:12.279
but he did not that which was right

00:22:12.279 --> 00:22:16.199
in the sight of the Lord like David his father.

00:22:16.199 --> 00:22:18.820
For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:22.860
and made also molten images for Balaam.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:26.059
We're going to read some more about Ahaz here in just a moment.

00:22:26.059 --> 00:22:29.360
But you understand that in the life of this man Ahaz,

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.559
though he had a godly heritage,

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:35.979
he had some decisions he had to make for himself.

00:22:35.979 --> 00:22:38.240
He had to make a determination of how he was going to live

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.960
before the Lord God Almighty.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.880
And we find that this man Ahaz,

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.619
he followed in the ways of the kings of Israel,

00:22:48.639 --> 00:22:51.559
often as there would be a reference in the Word of God

00:22:51.559 --> 00:22:57.820
to the ways of Jeroboam.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.520
I'm not sure why I said Jehoshaphat.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.619
Jeroboam.

00:23:00.619 --> 00:23:02.619
And they would walk in the ways of Jeroboam.

00:23:02.619 --> 00:23:04.580
And the reality is that here,

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.119
you find that it just simply says

00:23:06.119 --> 00:23:08.740
in the ways of the kings of Israel.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:11.740
If you were to understand the nation of Israel

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:12.860
as a united kingdom,

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.380
and then after the reign of course of Solomon

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:16.860
as a divided kingdom,

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.220
Israel referring to the ten tribes of the north,

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.339
and then Judah the two tribes of the south,

00:23:21.339 --> 00:23:23.979
and you would find of those ten tribes of the north,

00:23:23.979 --> 00:23:26.979
the nation of Israel as we'd often refer to it as,

00:23:26.979 --> 00:23:29.199
they were taken captive by the Assyrians,

00:23:29.199 --> 00:23:31.160
but if you were to trace their heritage

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.660
and you were to look at all of their kings,

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.899
there's not one good king.

00:23:34.899 --> 00:23:37.419
They're all wicked.

00:23:37.419 --> 00:23:39.979
It's an immediate downward spiral.

00:23:39.979 --> 00:23:43.699
You find that within the ranks of the kings of Judah,

00:23:43.699 --> 00:23:45.660
that there were periods of revival.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.139
There were good kings and there were bad kings.

00:23:48.139 --> 00:23:50.139
And you see that process.

00:23:50.139 --> 00:23:53.259
And here we find that Ahaz is one of those bad kings.

00:23:53.259 --> 00:23:55.100
He's one of those that would follow

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:59.940
in the ways of the kings of Israel.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:04.539
As we begin to think about the slippery slope of sin,

00:24:04.539 --> 00:24:06.059
if you will,

00:24:06.059 --> 00:24:09.179
the Bible tells us that he really had ungodly influences

00:24:09.179 --> 00:24:11.539
according to v. 2 when it says that he walked

00:24:11.539 --> 00:24:13.820
in the ways of the kings of Israel.

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:16.500
What are some of the things that this man Ahaz did?

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.739
In v. 2 it says that he had idols.

00:24:18.739 --> 00:24:22.859
He made also molten images for Balaam.

00:24:22.859 --> 00:24:24.859
It tells us in v. 3,

00:24:24.859 --> 00:24:27.579
moreover he burnt incense

00:24:27.579 --> 00:24:30.540
in the valley of the son of Hinnom

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:34.579
and burnt his children in the fire.

00:24:34.579 --> 00:24:35.899
Did you catch that?

00:24:35.899 --> 00:24:37.700
He burnt his children in the fire.

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.059
You know the Word of God warns

00:24:39.059 --> 00:24:43.420
about offering your children to Molech?

00:24:43.459 --> 00:24:46.339
And yet we find that Ahaz,

00:24:46.339 --> 00:24:48.899
as he would get wrapped up in this idolatry

00:24:48.899 --> 00:24:52.299
as he would be influenced by these ungodly influences,

00:24:52.299 --> 00:24:54.299
and he's burning incense to idols,

00:24:54.299 --> 00:24:56.660
and now you find that he's offered his children,

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.019
it says, and burnt his children in the fire

00:24:59.019 --> 00:25:01.459
after the abominations of the heathen

00:25:01.459 --> 00:25:03.179
whom the Lord had cast out

00:25:03.179 --> 00:25:05.739
before the children of Israel.

00:25:05.739 --> 00:25:08.380
V. 4, he sacrificed also and burnt incense

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.500
in the high places and on the hills

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.260
and under every green tree.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.500
Wherefore, the Lord his God delivered him

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.700
into the hand of the king of Syria.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.739
Isn't that interesting verbiage?

00:25:20.739 --> 00:25:22.859
Often we like to hear how God delivers us

00:25:22.859 --> 00:25:24.339
from something,

00:25:24.339 --> 00:25:27.339
but yet because of the wickedness of Ahaz,

00:25:27.339 --> 00:25:30.380
the Bible tells us that God delivered him

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.619
into the hand of the enemy.

00:25:33.619 --> 00:25:35.980
The king of Syria.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.899
And they smote him

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:41.059
and carried away a great multitude of them captives

00:25:41.059 --> 00:25:42.619
and brought them to Damascus.

00:25:42.619 --> 00:25:44.140
And he was also delivered into the hand

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:45.260
of the king of Israel

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.059
who smote him with a great slaughter.

00:25:48.059 --> 00:25:49.540
Wow.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:54.140
You think about the negative influences and impact.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:57.059
I don't believe as you look at chapter 28 here

00:25:57.059 --> 00:25:59.619
of 2 Chronicles that Ahaz had anticipated

00:25:59.619 --> 00:26:04.820
that this would be the result of his behavior.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.179
He was participating in this wicked behavior

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.220
and he was doing these wicked things

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.820
and we find that he paid a great price,

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.339
that he suffered greatly.

00:26:13.339 --> 00:26:16.500
He was deceived by sin.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.940
We noted in v. 5 the way that he was dealing

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.339
with being delivered into the hand of the enemy.

00:26:22.339 --> 00:26:24.540
Notice in v. 19, if you will, skip down

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.339
and look at v. 19, it says,

00:26:26.339 --> 00:26:29.660
for the Lord brought Judah low

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.619
because of Ahaz king of Israel,

00:26:31.619 --> 00:26:34.179
for he made Judah naked

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:38.700
and transgressed sore against the Lord.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.779
When you look at the passage here

00:26:40.779 --> 00:26:42.540
and you begin to think about how the Lord

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.019
brought Judah low,

00:26:44.019 --> 00:26:45.500
and it says in v. 20,

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.859
until Gath-Pilneser king of Assyria

00:26:47.859 --> 00:26:49.820
came unto him and distressed him,

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.779
but strengthened him not.

00:26:51.779 --> 00:26:53.579
If you look previous in the passage,

00:26:53.579 --> 00:26:54.660
we don't have time to deal with it,

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.779
but he actually offered to have these guys

00:26:58.779 --> 00:27:01.059
come and help him.

00:27:01.059 --> 00:27:02.619
It says that they helped him not.

00:27:02.619 --> 00:27:03.980
They strengthened him not.

00:27:04.019 --> 00:27:05.420
Notice v. 21, the last phrase,

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.339
but he helped him not.

00:27:07.339 --> 00:27:09.700
Notice v. 22, in the time of his distress,

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:13.179
did he trespass yet more against the Lord.

00:27:13.179 --> 00:27:18.739
This is that king Ahaz.

00:27:18.739 --> 00:27:21.220
For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:22.779
which smote him.

00:27:22.779 --> 00:27:24.299
Notice this.

00:27:24.299 --> 00:27:26.579
And he said,

00:27:26.579 --> 00:27:28.940
because the gods of the kings of Syria

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:30.420
helped them,

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.420
therefore will I sacrifice to them

00:27:33.459 --> 00:27:35.700
that they may help me.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:36.899
But they were the ruin of him

00:27:36.899 --> 00:27:38.179
and of all Israel.

00:27:38.179 --> 00:27:42.299
Now, did you catch v. 23?

00:27:42.299 --> 00:27:44.500
Notice what it says.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.579
This man Ahaz,

00:27:45.579 --> 00:27:48.299
he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus.

00:27:48.299 --> 00:27:49.420
Now, those are false gods.

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:50.940
Those are idols, right?

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.619
So he's offering these sacrifices

00:27:52.619 --> 00:27:54.260
unto these idols,

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.820
and it says which smote him.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.779
And so he suffered at the hand

00:27:57.779 --> 00:28:00.299
of the people of Damascus,

00:28:00.299 --> 00:28:02.700
and so he's going to make these offerings

00:28:02.739 --> 00:28:05.420
unto these false gods, these idols.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.700
And his logic, his reasoning

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.899
for making these sacrifices

00:28:09.899 --> 00:28:11.420
was because the kings,

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.220
excuse me, because the gods,

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.540
these false gods, these false idols

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.940
of the kings of Syria helped them.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.779
And so I was defeated by these guys,

00:28:20.779 --> 00:28:22.420
and they served these false gods,

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.619
and they have these idols that they worship,

00:28:24.619 --> 00:28:27.579
and so their idols evidently helped them,

00:28:27.579 --> 00:28:30.220
so now I'm going to go offer sacrifices

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.539
to these idols

00:28:31.619 --> 00:28:33.820
because those idols helped them,

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.340
so maybe they'll help me.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.140
He says, therefore, will I sacrifice to them.

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:43.460
Now, does that make your head hurt?

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.020
I mean, honestly,

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:46.739
when you read that,

00:28:46.739 --> 00:28:48.260
and you understand who his father

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:49.580
and his grandfather were,

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:51.260
when you understand the responsibility

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.619
that he had as serving as a king

00:28:53.619 --> 00:28:57.299
under the Lord God Almighty,

00:28:57.299 --> 00:28:58.580
and in the book of Deuteronomy,

00:28:58.580 --> 00:28:59.940
the kings had been instructed

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.219
that if they were to write out

00:29:01.219 --> 00:29:02.260
the law of the Lord,

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.380
and they were to read it

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.219
and to be engaged in it and to know it,

00:29:05.219 --> 00:29:06.739
in what's one of the commandments,

00:29:06.739 --> 00:29:09.260
thou shalt have no other gods before Me.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.099
Amen?

00:29:10.099 --> 00:29:12.260
I mean, listen, he's literally...

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.659
You tell me that sin's not deceptive?

00:29:15.659 --> 00:29:17.859
The deceitfulness of sin?

00:29:17.859 --> 00:29:20.140
He's now offering sacrifices

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:22.539
to these false gods, to these idols,

00:29:22.539 --> 00:29:24.780
because he says, well, the idols helped them,

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:28.460
so therefore, I'm going to sacrifice to them.

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:29.299
Really?

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.340
Therefore, will I sacrifice to them

00:29:35.299 --> 00:29:36.580
that they may help me.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:39.219
Messed up.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.700
You say, oh, pastor, you're being...

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.260
It's not gonna happen like that in my life.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.739
Do you think Ahaz planned for that

00:29:47.739 --> 00:29:48.859
to happen in his life?

00:29:49.979 --> 00:29:51.260
Do you think Lot planned for it

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.739
to happen in his life the way that it did?

00:29:53.739 --> 00:29:55.059
I mean, we can go through a whole number

00:29:55.059 --> 00:29:55.900
of illustrations.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.340
In fact, there are people

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.619
that have written books.

00:29:58.619 --> 00:30:03.819
that have given testimony of the deceitfulness of sin in their own lives and how they began

00:30:03.819 --> 00:30:09.779
being engaged in activities that they never planned to participate in.

00:30:09.779 --> 00:30:16.379
Sin is deceptive.

00:30:16.379 --> 00:30:19.099
Don't you think we're being a little overzealous here?

00:30:19.099 --> 00:30:24.899
No, I don't think Ahaz planned that this was going to happen.

00:30:24.899 --> 00:30:30.659
Young people begin to play around with sin a little bit, think they can get away with

00:30:30.659 --> 00:30:34.619
this and get away with that and let's participate in this and let's do that.

00:30:34.619 --> 00:30:37.499
Oh, sin is deceitful.

00:30:37.499 --> 00:30:41.299
But sometimes we just think about young people doing that.

00:30:41.299 --> 00:30:46.939
Listen, sin is deceptive for all people.

00:30:46.939 --> 00:30:51.299
The devil's trying to get you in a trap, deceive you.

00:30:51.299 --> 00:30:54.059
He's trying to get you to be desensitized.

00:30:54.059 --> 00:30:59.179
The thing that comes up on the internet when you're searching for something that is supposed

00:30:59.179 --> 00:31:07.179
to be wholesome or good, and the enemy allows that thing to come up, you begin to get desensitized

00:31:07.179 --> 00:31:12.739
to it because you've seen it and you've seen it and you look at it and you look at it.

00:31:12.739 --> 00:31:18.419
You know, pornography is a big problem in America, huge issue.

00:31:18.419 --> 00:31:22.979
It's amazing, it used to be something that predominantly affected males, but there are

00:31:22.979 --> 00:31:27.299
studies that suggest almost as many females are caught up in pornography as are males.

00:31:27.299 --> 00:31:29.339
You say, I don't believe it.

00:31:29.339 --> 00:31:32.539
You just go look at the studies yourself then.

00:31:32.539 --> 00:31:35.259
Sad.

00:31:35.259 --> 00:31:45.859
I worked with a man at this point, probably 20 years ago, 19 years ago.

00:31:45.859 --> 00:31:50.339
The man got desensitized to images on his computer.

00:31:50.779 --> 00:31:56.299
I really didn't know the man well, but I know the story well.

00:31:56.299 --> 00:32:02.579
He was a schoolteacher at a public school and he got desensitized because a deacon in

00:32:02.579 --> 00:32:08.819
a church is a public schoolteacher, and he got desensitized.

00:32:08.819 --> 00:32:14.059
And then he began to have an appetite for that stuff.

00:32:14.059 --> 00:32:16.940
And then he had to start using the computers at school because he didn't want his wife

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:17.940
to find out.

00:32:18.539 --> 00:32:22.259
Well, then there were some people in the school that had some IT experience and knew what

00:32:22.259 --> 00:32:25.019
was going on and he got fired, he lost his job.

00:32:25.019 --> 00:32:32.819
It was found out, terrible, terrible consequences for him.

00:32:32.819 --> 00:32:37.580
That man came and worked for our company for one day.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:43.179
I had jury duty that day and my boss had an exam in his master's class.

00:32:43.179 --> 00:32:47.019
It was just a small office, we only had four people, the other two were out of the office

00:32:47.099 --> 00:32:51.979
that day, and this man came to work for our company one day, and all he did for the four

00:32:51.979 --> 00:32:57.179
hours he was there was search pornography and destroy our whole system.

00:32:57.179 --> 00:33:00.500
It just destroyed him.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:06.419
What I'm saying this evening is that that man never set out to lose his wife, his career,

00:33:06.419 --> 00:33:10.699
his family, his children.

00:33:10.699 --> 00:33:13.419
The devil wants to desensitize us.

00:33:13.419 --> 00:33:21.059
He wants to think that we can handle it, that we can control it, but sin is deceitful

00:33:21.059 --> 00:33:23.619
and it's destructive.

00:33:23.619 --> 00:33:30.099
You find here at the end of verse number 23 in 2 Chronicles 28 it says,

00:33:30.099 --> 00:33:36.500
But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel, and Ahaz gathered together the vessels of

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:40.799
the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors

00:33:40.799 --> 00:33:46.119
of the house of the Lord, and he made them altars in every corner of Jerusalem.

00:33:46.119 --> 00:33:50.159
Not only did he worship these false gods and sacrifice and make offerings to these false

00:33:50.159 --> 00:33:55.039
gods, but the Bible says that he took all the vessels of the house of God and he cut

00:33:55.039 --> 00:33:57.720
the pieces of the vessels of the house of God.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:02.199
He shut the doors for the house of the Lord.

00:34:02.199 --> 00:34:06.679
I mean, it wasn't that he had gone far enough that he's just worshiping and sacrificing

00:34:06.679 --> 00:34:13.399
these idols, but he's ensuring that there's not going to be any worship of Jehovah either.

00:34:13.399 --> 00:34:20.519
And it says that he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem at the end of verse 24

00:34:20.519 --> 00:34:21.519
and verse 25.

00:34:21.519 --> 00:34:26.919
And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods

00:34:26.919 --> 00:34:31.600
and provoked to anger the Lord God of his fathers.

00:34:32.519 --> 00:34:38.720
It's amazing that Hezekiah would be the son of Ahaz and that Hezekiah would be a good

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.720
king.

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:43.239
I mean, there'd be a revival in Judah under the reign of Hezekiah.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:50.119
But as we begin to look and to really consider this evening of this thought in Genesis 19

00:34:50.119 --> 00:34:58.399
and verse number 1, that this man Lot, he sat in the gate of Sodom.

00:34:58.399 --> 00:35:01.720
I want to remind you of Psalm 1.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:09.199
The Bible says this in Psalm chapter number 1, blessed is the man that walketh not in

00:35:09.199 --> 00:35:18.000
the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.320
of the scornful.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:27.959
And this evening, as God's people, I hope that we would understand the importance of

00:35:27.959 --> 00:35:29.639
godly living.

00:35:29.639 --> 00:35:33.839
Listen, we can live right in a wrong world.

00:35:33.839 --> 00:35:35.579
We can.

00:35:35.579 --> 00:35:37.239
We can live right in a wrong world.

00:35:37.239 --> 00:35:42.679
We can obey God and serve God acceptably.

00:35:42.679 --> 00:35:48.239
And we can, you know, somebody said this, I think it was actually Brother Mershawn said

00:35:48.239 --> 00:35:52.679
this, it seems as if in America we don't blush at sin anymore.

00:35:52.679 --> 00:35:58.279
And you can think about that expression and the verbiage in which Brother Mershawn used

00:35:58.279 --> 00:36:02.839
in making that assessment.

00:36:02.839 --> 00:36:06.839
But why would it be that in America we don't blush at sin anymore?

00:36:06.839 --> 00:36:10.839
Perhaps because we've been desensitized.

00:36:10.839 --> 00:36:15.600
It's just become acceptable that this is just the way it is.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:22.399
I wonder when's the last time we've been able to, parents, sit down with our children

00:36:22.399 --> 00:36:26.919
and explain to them why some of the accepted behavior in our society is not accepted by

00:36:26.919 --> 00:36:29.679
God Almighty.

00:36:29.679 --> 00:36:36.600
Biblically, why this is not approved, why this is not acceptable.

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.559
Why we don't support this.

00:36:40.559 --> 00:36:44.919
Not suggesting that we go out there and boycott everybody and throw a big fit and have all

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000
these kind of scenes.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.699
No, I'm just saying, are your children being desensitized?

00:36:51.699 --> 00:36:59.040
If you're not teaching them why the standards of morals in our society are not accepted

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:03.119
by God, they're being desensitized.

00:37:03.119 --> 00:37:11.479
In the classrooms, alternative lifestyles and behaviors, again, I'm not suggesting we

00:37:11.479 --> 00:37:12.760
go out there and attack everyone.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.519
I'm just simply saying we can't be desensitized to it.

00:37:16.519 --> 00:37:19.979
Because all of a sudden, you're a young person, you're going to come home and think that this

00:37:19.979 --> 00:37:23.160
thing is okay, whatever this thing is.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.199
Because it's just another option.

00:37:25.199 --> 00:37:32.559
You say, no, here's what God says.

00:37:32.559 --> 00:37:36.279
See we've been saved, we've been born again.

00:37:36.279 --> 00:37:40.760
We have a higher authority and a higher standard.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:47.320
Lot, he made a terrible mistake when he pitched his tent towards Sodom.

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:52.880
And it wasn't long before he was dwelling in Sodom.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:58.839
And then according to verse number one of chapter 19 of Genesis, we find that he's sitting

00:37:58.839 --> 00:38:03.199
in the gate of Sodom.

00:38:03.199 --> 00:38:07.959
This evening, I believe that each of us would acknowledge that the enemy wants to desensitize

00:38:07.959 --> 00:38:08.959
us to sin.

00:38:08.959 --> 00:38:18.600
He wants us to think sin is normal and acceptable and it's just another way of doing things.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:23.000
And I wonder this evening in your life, how is God working in your life, and then how

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.959
is the enemy working to desensitize you to sin in your life?

00:38:27.959 --> 00:38:32.599
Are we permitting things in our home that maybe just a few years ago we wouldn't have

00:38:32.599 --> 00:38:34.839
permitted in our home?

00:38:34.839 --> 00:38:43.080
We're permitting things on our TV, we're permitting things in the radio, permitting

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:47.880
things through publications, permitting things through video games.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:54.320
What are we permitting that's desensitizing us to sin?

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:59.880
And what we permit, unfortunately, we're going to begin to accept.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:05.440
Unfortunately, you're going to see some people doing some things, perhaps even our own children

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:09.479
participating in activities and say, why in the world would they do that?

00:39:09.479 --> 00:39:13.960
They weren't taught the sinfulness of sin.

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.479
They were deceived by it.

00:39:16.479 --> 00:39:17.479
They thought it was acceptable.

00:39:17.479 --> 00:39:20.679
They thought it was okay.

00:39:20.679 --> 00:39:27.039
Next week, we'll study the entirety of Genesis 19, but I thought it important for us to understand

00:39:27.039 --> 00:39:36.400
this progression and to be warned against being desensitized to sin in our society.

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:42.880
Because though the world and the enemy want to paint sin as being something glamorous,

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:46.559
it's a reproach against the Holy God.

00:39:46.559 --> 00:39:49.799
And we need to understand that as the people of God.

00:39:49.799 --> 00:39:53.440
So no, I don't want to be desensitized to this stuff.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:56.839
I don't want to get on that slippery slope of sin.

00:39:56.839 --> 00:39:58.640
I don't want to come to a place and we say.

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:03.040
Say, how in the world did we get here?

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:10.560
What little things did I allow that opened up the floodgates, if you will, that brought

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:14.160
me to the place where I am now?

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:20.000
It's a much better thing to acknowledge the way in which the enemy is seeking to work

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
and say, I'm going to stand against that.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.440
I'm going to get into the Word of God and allow the Word of God to get into me, and

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:32.320
I'm going to be careful as to what we will allow in our home, the things that we would

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:38.040
participate and engage in, because I don't want to become desensitized to sin.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:43.200
Lot sat in the gate, but before he ever sat in the gate, he lived in the city, and before

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.880
he ever lived in the city, he pitched his tent toward the city.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:50.840
We need to be careful what we're allowing in our lives.

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:51.840
Let's pray.

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.880
Father, we love you.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.020
We thank you for loving us.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:41:01.540
We thank you for the warning from the life of Lot, the life of Ahaz.

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:08.900
God, I pray that this evening you would allow this warning from your Word to help us as

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.380
your people.

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:19.100
We know that the enemy would like to desensitize us to sin.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:27.740
The way in which they would seek to describe the era in which we're living, the things

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:38.380
that they would allow and celebrate and legislate, just because the law of the land would allow

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:42.020
certain behavior doesn't mean it's right.

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:54.260
God, I pray that you'd help us as your people to blush at sin, to guard against the influences

00:41:54.260 --> 00:42:02.380
and the deceitfulness of sin in our lives, the lives of our children.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:09.700
Would you help those that have children at home still to be particularly aware of the

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:18.620
dangers and the influences of the sin and the culture upon their children, that we'd

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:27.380
guard against it, that we might live as obedient children, that we might be holy even as you

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:31.660
are holy in all manner of conversation.

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:34.740
I pray that you'd work in this time of invitation, and we'll thank you for it.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:35.900
In Christ's name we pray.
