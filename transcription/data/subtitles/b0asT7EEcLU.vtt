WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.759
I trust that you keep your eyes on Jesus, even as we've had our theme this year, looking

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:08.439
unto Jesus and what peace He gives, amen?

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:09.680
And so thankful for that.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.119
This morning we'll be in Hebrews 12, verses 4 through 17, and as we look at this passage

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:20.520
of Scripture, of course, last week we looked at the first few verses of Hebrews 12 and

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.860
dealing with the thought there of run the race and understanding that we're involved

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:31.180
in this race, and there are many that would seek to just cause us to be distracted, and

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.700
the distractions abound, and we dealt with that.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:40.540
As we move into this next section of Hebrews 12, we see that a subject matter is spoken

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.540
of.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.060
It's a subject matter that is rarely discussed, but I believe it's of significant importance,

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.299
and that subject matter is that of chastening, or the chastisement of the Lord.

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:57.700
And we find that the Lord has provided details in His Word regarding chastisement so that

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.060
we would understand at least two things.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:07.459
Number one, it is part of His divine plan, and number two, it has a definite purpose.

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:12.540
And chastisement is part of God's plan, and it does have a purpose.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.459
As we look at this particular text of Scripture, right in the beginning we find that these

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:21.260
first century believers had to be reminded of something.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.540
They're told that they had forgotten, and so they need to be reminded of some truth,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.139
and perhaps this morning there are some of us that need to be reminded of some of this

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:34.559
truth as well with regard to the subject matter of chastisement.

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:41.900
We see once again, as has been really the regular occurrence through the book of Hebrews,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:49.660
that the writer will use Old Testament passages, and then properly apply them many times.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.500
The Messianic prophecies, properly applying them to the person of Jesus Christ, we find

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.580
in this particular account, using an Old Testament portion of Scripture and properly applying

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.699
it to the people of God.

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:05.819
And I'm so thankful that we have the whole canon of Scripture, that God has given us

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:11.460
His Word, and that it is profitable for us, and what a blessing it is.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.539
Let's dig right in.

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:17.259
In verse number four, the Bible says, you have not yet resisted unto blood, striving

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:23.660
against sin, basically dealing with here as kind of this segue between the previous passage

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.820
and what we're dealing with to now this passage, is that these that are being written to, they've

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.380
not yet been martyred, they've faced some difficulties for sure, but they've not yet

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.380
been martyred.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.699
And we find that he then enters into the subject matter that is before us this morning, verse

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:47.139
number five, and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children.

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:54.500
My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.779
of him.

00:02:55.779 --> 00:03:03.059
For whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:07.100
We'll make our way through verse number 17 this morning, but the title of the message

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.979
comes from verse number six this morning, whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth.

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.899
Whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth.

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:19.820
And for some of us this morning, we might say, well, that doesn't make sense in my mind,

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.619
because if he loves me, then he's just going to let me get away with whatever's going on.

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:28.419
And that's where we've misunderstood the love of God, and really the definition of love

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:29.419
in general.

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:33.059
Let me give you a couple of definitions, we'll get right into the passage this morning.

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:36.139
Let me help you understand this word chastening.

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:41.740
It's instruction which aims at increasing virtue.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.779
Instruction which aims at increasing virtue.

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:47.160
It also carries with it the idea of correction and punishment.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.220
We find that then he uses the word, he says, for whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth in

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.679
verse number six, and then says this, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.

00:03:56.679 --> 00:04:04.419
That word scourge means to punish with severity, to chastise, to afflict for sins or faults.

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:11.000
And here's the great part of the definition, and with the purpose of correction.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.460
And we understand that even as we would look at the analogy that is used in verse number

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:21.859
nine of the physical human relationships that we're aware of this understanding of discipline,

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.380
that we would find that when we think about and consider the subject matter of the chastening

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.940
of the Lord, that we understand at the very onset that God chastens in love, whom the

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.579
Lord loveth, he chasteneth.

00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:36.299
And so we understand that he chastens in love.

00:04:36.299 --> 00:04:42.920
I also would say this, that his chastisement is measured and appropriate.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.540
What I mean by that is that his chastisement for you might be different than for me, and

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.380
at times in your life, his chastisement might have different levels of severity because

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.380
it is measured and it is appropriate.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.660
And it's important for us to understand that if you have children, and perhaps if you have

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.459
multiple children, you'll understand that discipline varies with your children.

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:10.260
It varies by offense, and it also varies based upon personality.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.459
My brother and I, there's only two of us, and we have very different personalities,

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:18.700
and what my parents would use for discipline for him didn't work so well for me, and what

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.940
they used as discipline for me didn't work so well for him.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.940
It's just the way it was.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:31.059
And the reality is that God, as the omniscient God, as our heavenly Father, when he chastens

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:36.700
us, when he disciplines us, we understand that it's measured and it's appropriate.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.220
And finally, I'd say this by way of introduction, that it is with a distinct purpose.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:49.579
And I'm so thankful that our God loves us and he has a plan for our lives.

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:53.700
There are times as human beings that we can kind of get sideways, if you will.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.540
There are times as human beings that we get distracted with the affairs of the world,

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.380
with the things that are going on, and there are times in which our God lovingly comes

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:09.059
and brings chastisement in our life for a purpose, and we are thankful for that.

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:14.179
I understand that many times, perhaps on a daily basis, you don't go through the process

00:06:14.179 --> 00:06:20.459
of praising God and maybe have chastening be on your list of why to praise God.

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:24.140
But I would submit to you this morning, and I would hope that by the end of the message

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:30.220
this morning, that we would come to that place in our lives where we say, I am thankful for

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.660
the chastening of God.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:38.260
I am thankful that God loves me so much that he is interested in my walk with him and he

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:44.339
chastens me to correct me so that I might have that increase of virtue, that I might

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:46.859
have my course corrected.

00:06:46.859 --> 00:06:50.420
As we look at the passage of Scripture this morning, I want you to notice first of all

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.119
what chastening proves.

00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:55.820
Number one, notice what chastening proves.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:00.420
I find first of all that chastening proves that God loves me.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.299
It proves that God loves me.

00:07:02.299 --> 00:07:07.700
Now I've already said, kind of by way of introduction, that generally speaking as a society, we have

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.899
lost the true meaning and expression of love.

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:14.260
There are some today that have this idea, and on Wednesday evening we spoke about some

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.380
of the moral attributes of God, and one of them being love.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.899
And I spent a few minutes on Wednesday evening dealing with the subject matter of the love

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:25.980
of God and how well that blends in with even the message for this morning.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:31.459
The reality is that we live in a society in which many people have this idea that if you

00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:35.779
love someone, that means you coddle them, you tell them what they want to hear, you

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:39.019
just tell them everything's going to be okay, and that's your expression of love.

00:07:39.019 --> 00:07:41.600
But really, that's not biblical love.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.119
And we understand that as we think about the love of God, that His love is a pure love,

00:07:46.119 --> 00:07:49.760
it is a perfect love, because our God is perfect.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.679
In God loving us, He therefore chastens us.

00:07:53.679 --> 00:07:58.600
Notice, as we consider the passage of Scripture and we think about the love, it says here

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.480
in verse number five, when He speaks about the fact that they have forgotten the exhortation

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.920
which speaketh unto you, notice, as unto children.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:12.440
He's going to reference a portion of Scripture from Proverbs 3, verses 11 and 12, and He

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.440
says this,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:21.279
My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked

00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:22.519
of Him.

00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:30.299
For whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.

00:08:30.299 --> 00:08:35.239
And we've used as our title this morning that portion of verse number six, whom the Lord

00:08:35.239 --> 00:08:39.559
loveth, He chasteneth, but we must wrap our minds around the truth this morning, that

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:43.679
when we consider the subject matter of chastening, that we find, first of all, we notice in the

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:48.599
Scriptures that it proves some things, and number one, it proves that God loves us.

00:08:48.599 --> 00:08:50.900
So often we speak about the love of God, and we should.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.239
We sing about the love of God, and we should.

00:08:53.239 --> 00:08:58.520
And we quote verses of Scripture that speak about how God has declared His love for us,

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:03.599
how He has demonstrated His love for us, and I'm so thankful for Calvary, I'm so thankful

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:08.359
that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth

00:09:08.359 --> 00:09:11.080
in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:16.200
I'm thankful for what Paul says in Romans 5, that God commendeth His love toward us,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.320
and that while we're yet sinners, that Christ died for us, but I want you to understand

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:25.200
this morning that another demonstration of God's love is when He corrects us, when He

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.840
chastens us.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.979
He's saying, I love you, and He chastens us.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.700
We find this morning, notice if you hold your place here and look over to the book of Revelation,

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:39.260
if you will, Revelation chapter number 3, and look at verse number 19 with me, and we

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:44.619
find that here in, of course, Revelation 2 and 3, the letters being sent, the messages

00:09:44.619 --> 00:09:49.380
being sent to the seven churches in Asia Minor, and we find that this last of the letters

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.219
is being sent to the church.

00:09:51.219 --> 00:09:55.659
It's very interesting, often we say the church of Laodicea, but you'll notice that the Scripture

00:09:55.659 --> 00:09:59.979
simply says, not the church of Laodicea, but the church of Laodicea.

00:09:59.979 --> 00:10:04.619
the Laodiceans. And I think it's interesting that distinction that God

00:10:04.619 --> 00:10:08.739
gives us, especially as we begin to find that which would characterize these

00:10:08.739 --> 00:10:13.859
believers, that they looked and they said, man, we are full of everything that we

00:10:13.859 --> 00:10:20.499
need, we have no need of anything, and God says that's what you say, but I'm gonna

00:10:20.499 --> 00:10:25.059
tell you your real condition. He says that you're wretched, you're miserable,

00:10:25.059 --> 00:10:29.579
you're poor, you're blind, and you're naked. Now that's quite a difference in

00:10:29.579 --> 00:10:34.779
understanding, is it not? You think about the the perspective, the perception of

00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:38.179
the church of the Laodiceans. They thought that they were doing pretty well.

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:44.019
They said, I'm rich, increased with goods, and have need of nothing. And God says,

00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:49.219
actually, here's your condition. But I want you to consider what God says to

00:10:49.219 --> 00:10:55.299
these believers in Laodicea, the church of the Laodiceans. He says to these, he

00:10:55.299 --> 00:11:00.459
says, I counsel thee in verse 18, but I want you to focus on the truth that

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:07.059
we're looking at here in verse 19. It says this, as many as I love, I rebuke

00:11:07.059 --> 00:11:18.619
and chasten. Be zealous, therefore, and repent. As many as I love, I rebuke and

00:11:18.619 --> 00:11:23.459
chasten. You know that the love of God was on display in the Old Testament each

00:11:23.459 --> 00:11:28.079
time he sent a prophet of God to the nation of Israel to call them back to

00:11:28.079 --> 00:11:34.099
himself? Not only was it God's love that was being displayed, we find that God's

00:11:34.099 --> 00:11:38.659
long-suffering, and his grace, and his mercy, and his care for his people. And

00:11:38.659 --> 00:11:43.099
yes, there were messages of judgment, and there were periods of judgment, and we

00:11:43.099 --> 00:11:48.139
find that God, in his love, he didn't just let him go. No, he kept calling and kept

00:11:48.139 --> 00:11:52.659
sending a prophet. And for us today, as New Testament believers, we find that

00:11:52.659 --> 00:11:56.939
there are times in which God will chasten us. He will correct us. He will

00:11:56.939 --> 00:12:02.179
rebuke us. And it proves to us that he loves us. Not only does it prove that he

00:12:02.179 --> 00:12:06.059
loves us, but it proves to us back in Hebrews chapter number 12, it proves to

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:12.459
us that we belong to him. We belong to him. We're his child. We're his son. I'm

00:12:12.459 --> 00:12:16.739
mindful, as you're there in Hebrews chapter number 12, of what the Gospel of

00:12:16.739 --> 00:12:20.819
John says in John 1 in verse number 12, but as many as received him, to then gave

00:12:20.819 --> 00:12:26.299
he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. I am

00:12:26.299 --> 00:12:29.999
thankful this morning to be a son of God. I'm thankful to be a child of God. What a

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:34.719
great privilege to be adopted into the family of God, to know that God is my

00:12:34.719 --> 00:12:39.439
father. What a blessing to know that because of the work of the Lord Jesus

00:12:39.439 --> 00:12:44.319
Christ on the cross of Calvary, that we have been reconciled, we've been redeemed,

00:12:44.319 --> 00:12:49.919
and we have been adopted into the family of God. And we find that as we

00:12:49.919 --> 00:12:53.759
consider the subject matter of chastening, not only does it prove that

00:12:53.759 --> 00:12:58.719
God loves me, but proves that I belong to him. Notice with me the use of the word

00:12:59.159 --> 00:13:04.199
son and sons. In verse number 5, it says that he speaketh unto you as unto

00:13:04.199 --> 00:13:10.919
children, and then notice he says, my son. This message that is being given, remember

00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:14.279
as we started and we looked at some portions of the book of Hebrews where

00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:18.919
there were various sections that were not necessarily written to the believers,

00:13:18.919 --> 00:13:23.199
I was speaking about another group of people, and we find especially as we

00:13:23.199 --> 00:13:28.359
enter into the 12th chapter, he says, let us, right, and he's beginning again to

00:13:28.359 --> 00:13:33.919
focus upon the believers here that he's writing to. He says, my son despise not

00:13:33.919 --> 00:13:37.279
thou the chastening of the Lord. Notice in verse number 6, whom the Lord loveth, he

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:42.679
chasteneth and scourgeth. Look what it says, every son whom he receiveth. And

00:13:42.679 --> 00:13:48.159
then he says this in verse number 7, if ye endure chastening, God dealeth with

00:13:48.359 --> 00:13:59.359
you as with sons. For what son is he whom the Father chasteneth not? If you're here this

00:13:59.359 --> 00:14:02.679
morning and you say, I have no idea what you're talking about chastening. I've

00:14:02.679 --> 00:14:06.199
never experienced chastening. I've never experienced the correction of God, the

00:14:06.199 --> 00:14:11.679
discipline of God. I would submit to you this morning that the Bible says, what

00:14:11.679 --> 00:14:17.399
son is he whom the Father chasteneth not? You're not perfect and neither am I. And

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:21.639
there are times in each of our lives that we need the correction of God and

00:14:21.639 --> 00:14:26.679
we experience the correction of God. We experience his chastening. Now I hope in

00:14:26.679 --> 00:14:30.679
your life, I hope and pray in my life, that I don't have to get to a place

00:14:30.679 --> 00:14:34.919
where it's too severe. You understand what I'm saying? I want to be sensitive

00:14:34.919 --> 00:14:40.399
to the correction of God. I would say to you that physically speaking as a child,

00:14:40.399 --> 00:14:45.039
I was not always sensitive to the discipline of mom and dad. I didn't,

00:14:45.039 --> 00:14:52.159
listen, I knew my dad's look. Some of you kids, you know, my kids, they know dad's

00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:57.519
look. They know if I kind of snap my fingers, they know I know what they're

00:14:57.519 --> 00:15:02.679
doing. I know what's going on. And some of you kids, you know mom and dad, but there

00:15:02.679 --> 00:15:06.959
were times in which, guess what I did when I saw that look from my dad or I

00:15:06.959 --> 00:15:11.279
heard that snap of his finger, I kind of just blew right through the red light,

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:15.039
you know what I mean? Just kind of avoided the whole warning sign that was

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:20.399
given. And then all of a sudden, the the discipline was not just a, hey you need

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:24.919
to stop. It elevated. You understand what I'm saying, right? I mean, you

00:15:24.919 --> 00:15:30.079
experience this, I hope. There are times in which we just blow through the

00:15:30.079 --> 00:15:33.959
warning signs and we just say, you know what, I'm enjoying what I'm doing.

00:15:33.959 --> 00:15:39.279
Whatever the messed up, I said we get sideways sometimes. And the reality is

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:44.839
that I want to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit of God. I don't want to quench or

00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:48.839
grieve the Spirit. Doesn't mean that I don't do it. I'm saying I want to be

00:15:48.839 --> 00:15:53.679
sensitive to. I want to hear when he's bringing that. Why? Because I don't want

00:15:53.679 --> 00:15:57.759
to deal with the severity. There were times in which, as a child, I dealt with

00:15:57.759 --> 00:16:02.679
severe, I would call it capital punishment, you know. And mom would say,

00:16:02.679 --> 00:16:06.079
wait until dad gets home. Now they're not here today. They're just watching online.

00:16:06.079 --> 00:16:09.839
They're up in New Jersey, so I have a little bit more liberty this morning.

00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:13.639
But she would say something like this, just wait until dad gets home. And

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:18.479
then negotiation came out, right? I was trying to negotiate with her as to why

00:16:18.479 --> 00:16:22.319
it was not a good idea to tell my dad what happened and how I was willing to

00:16:22.319 --> 00:16:27.879
do whatever I needed to do in order to avoid the wrath of dad. And sure enough,

00:16:27.879 --> 00:16:31.759
he'd come home from a long day's work and one of the things that would be said

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:35.919
is what happened that day, right? And then all of a sudden you do, and guess what,

00:16:35.919 --> 00:16:42.279
every time I was like, man, I wish, I wish that when mom said or did that I just

00:16:42.279 --> 00:16:49.079
took heed. Because then it wouldn't have been so bad. But the reality is that why

00:16:49.079 --> 00:16:53.639
did my dad, why, we look at the truth in verse number nine, furthermore we have

00:16:53.639 --> 00:16:58.039
had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence. Shall we

00:16:58.039 --> 00:17:01.519
not much rather be in subjection to the Father of Spirits and live? Why did my

00:17:01.559 --> 00:17:08.119
dad never came home from work and corrected the neighbor's kid? Never. Why?

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:16.799
Wasn't his son. Wasn't his daughter. Never corrected him. Never disciplined him. The

00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:20.919
Bible tells us with the subject matter of chastening, we consider what

00:17:20.919 --> 00:17:24.799
does chastening prove when we notice what the scriptures say. It proves not

00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:30.039
only that God loves me, but proves that I belong to him. I'm his child. He says this,

00:17:30.159 --> 00:17:36.159
we're of all our partakers in verse number eight. At the end of verse number

00:17:36.159 --> 00:17:42.759
seven, for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? As much as we try to

00:17:42.759 --> 00:17:47.519
think that our children are well-behaved, we understand there are times in which

00:17:47.519 --> 00:17:52.239
your children need correction. Your children need discipline. And as God's

00:17:52.239 --> 00:17:57.039
children, there are times in which we need the chastening hand of God. And it

00:17:57.079 --> 00:18:02.519
proves to us that we're his children. We notice here, and as we continue, we looked

00:18:02.519 --> 00:18:06.119
at the end of verse number seven, look at verse number eight, but if ye be without

00:18:06.119 --> 00:18:10.559
chastisement, and then you see the parenthesis there, we're of all our

00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:16.679
partakers, then are ye bastards and not sons. Illegitimate. There are some that

00:18:16.679 --> 00:18:20.159
would say that they're a child of God and they live like the devil and they

00:18:20.159 --> 00:18:26.279
never experience any kind of discipline. And by not, listen, that chastening is a

00:18:26.319 --> 00:18:31.919
birthmark of a believer. God loves you. He's your father, and therefore He

00:18:31.919 --> 00:18:38.320
chastens you. There are times in which, no doubt, maybe you've desired to discipline

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:45.199
your neighbor's child, but you hopefully didn't do it. God chastens me because I

00:18:45.199 --> 00:18:51.000
belong to Him. And God will chasten you if you belong to Him. We find that as we

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.519
think about this truth, that if we are, if we've been saved, if we're a child of

00:18:55.559 --> 00:19:00.039
God, that as His children we will experience chastisement in our lives, but

00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:04.760
we remember what He says in verse number five. He says, despise not thou the

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:09.760
chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of Him. You think about

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.279
the subject matter that is before us, and I know that it's not a super popular

00:19:13.279 --> 00:19:17.880
subject matter, I understand that, but it certainly is biblical, and it's

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.880
appropriate, and it's helpful, and we find this morning that when God tells us to

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:27.599
despise not, nor faint in verse number five, in verse number seven He says, endure

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:32.679
chastening, if ye endure chastening. We find that as He gives us this truth, that

00:19:32.679 --> 00:19:38.399
He's helping us because we understand, listen, it proves something. It's not just

00:19:38.399 --> 00:19:44.399
so that we can be tormented and have no purpose in it. No, it proves that I belong

00:19:44.399 --> 00:19:49.760
to Him. It proves that He loves me. We understand this morning as we study the

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.399
subject matter of chastisement, we notice first of all what it proves, not

00:19:53.399 --> 00:19:57.000
only what it proves, but notice with me as we continue through the text, notice

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.799
what it produces, notice what chastening produces.

00:20:01.799 --> 00:20:05.199
I said to you this in the beginning of the message,

00:20:05.199 --> 00:20:08.319
that we would understand that the Word of God

00:20:08.319 --> 00:20:10.999
gives us instruction with regard to chastisement

00:20:10.999 --> 00:20:13.919
so that we would understand that it is part of God's divine plan,

00:20:13.919 --> 00:20:16.719
and also that it has a definite purpose.

00:20:16.719 --> 00:20:18.959
It produces some things in our lives.

00:20:18.959 --> 00:20:22.159
Notice in v. 9, I've read it already.

00:20:22.159 --> 00:20:24.559
He's using the physical analogy or illustration

00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:26.999
of that human relationship that we have,

00:20:26.999 --> 00:20:28.359
and it says, furthermore,

00:20:28.359 --> 00:20:31.759
we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us.

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:34.639
And we gave them reverence.

00:20:34.639 --> 00:20:36.039
Now notice where he says,

00:20:36.039 --> 00:20:39.559
shall we not much rather be in subjection

00:20:39.559 --> 00:20:42.559
unto the Father of spirits and live?

00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:45.679
For they, he's referring to that human relationship

00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:49.999
that we're aware of between fathers and children.

00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:52.279
He says, for they verily for a few days

00:20:52.279 --> 00:20:54.479
chastened us after their own pleasure,

00:20:54.479 --> 00:20:56.719
but then look at this phrase,

00:20:56.719 --> 00:20:59.719
but He, speaking about God our Father,

00:20:59.719 --> 00:21:04.039
He, for our profit.

00:21:04.039 --> 00:21:05.999
It's for our benefit.

00:21:05.999 --> 00:21:08.159
It produces something in our lives.

00:21:08.159 --> 00:21:10.519
Now, when you discipline your children,

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:12.999
you're hoping that it produces something.

00:21:12.999 --> 00:21:17.119
You're hoping that there's a change in behavior, right?

00:21:17.119 --> 00:21:19.759
That sometimes when you have little ones

00:21:19.759 --> 00:21:23.159
and you're dealing with the same thing day after day,

00:21:23.159 --> 00:21:25.719
and you can find yourself coming to this thought of,

00:21:25.719 --> 00:21:28.239
is it ever going to sink in?

00:21:28.239 --> 00:21:30.919
Is it ever going to work?

00:21:30.919 --> 00:21:33.919
And I've said to parents so many times over the years

00:21:33.919 --> 00:21:35.639
that one of the main things,

00:21:35.639 --> 00:21:38.599
one of the best words of advice that I could give you

00:21:38.599 --> 00:21:40.999
as a parent with regard to discipline

00:21:40.999 --> 00:21:43.119
is consistency.

00:21:43.119 --> 00:21:44.599
Because there are times in which we think

00:21:44.599 --> 00:21:46.039
it's not going to work.

00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:48.399
And then one day, it like clicks with little Johnny

00:21:48.399 --> 00:21:50.359
and you see some change and you're like,

00:21:50.359 --> 00:21:52.919
praise the Lord, this is wonderful.

00:21:52.919 --> 00:21:54.719
But we think about the chastisement of the Lord,

00:21:54.719 --> 00:21:56.039
He says this,

00:21:56.039 --> 00:22:00.839
but He, for our profit.

00:22:00.839 --> 00:22:02.639
So I find that it proves some things,

00:22:02.639 --> 00:22:04.279
but I find that it produces some things.

00:22:04.279 --> 00:22:06.879
Listen, chastisement, correcting,

00:22:06.879 --> 00:22:08.919
this is for my good.

00:22:08.919 --> 00:22:11.239
Now I understand, again, this isn't popular.

00:22:11.239 --> 00:22:13.239
This isn't a message that people are gonna,

00:22:13.239 --> 00:22:14.479
man, this is wonderful.

00:22:14.479 --> 00:22:15.999
I mean, how popular is this?

00:22:15.999 --> 00:22:17.919
No, but we understand this morning

00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:21.399
that many have missed an important Bible truth

00:22:21.399 --> 00:22:23.599
by ignoring the subject matter,

00:22:23.599 --> 00:22:24.999
not wanting to discuss it.

00:22:24.999 --> 00:22:25.839
Why?

00:22:25.839 --> 00:22:26.679
Because it's not popular,

00:22:26.679 --> 00:22:28.639
but the reality is that it's for our benefit.

00:22:28.639 --> 00:22:29.679
It's for our profit.

00:22:29.679 --> 00:22:31.319
It produces some things.

00:22:31.319 --> 00:22:33.359
Notice what the Bible says

00:22:33.359 --> 00:22:34.639
at the end of verse number 10,

00:22:34.639 --> 00:22:39.639
that we might be partakers of His holiness.

00:22:39.839 --> 00:22:41.879
And we begin to think about the fact

00:22:41.879 --> 00:22:45.359
that our God is holy and how wonderful that is.

00:22:45.359 --> 00:22:47.999
It's the first attribute that we dealt with

00:22:47.999 --> 00:22:49.519
this past Wednesday evening

00:22:49.519 --> 00:22:52.359
in looking and speaking of the subject matter

00:22:52.359 --> 00:22:53.759
that His name is holy,

00:22:53.759 --> 00:22:56.239
one of His most prevalent character traits

00:22:56.239 --> 00:22:57.639
in all of the Scriptures.

00:22:57.639 --> 00:22:59.959
And we find that our God is holy

00:22:59.959 --> 00:23:03.599
and He calls us as His children to be holy.

00:23:03.599 --> 00:23:06.239
He says, be holy, for I am holy.

00:23:06.239 --> 00:23:07.919
We find that Peter says this

00:23:07.919 --> 00:23:11.399
in 1 Peter 1 in verses 14 through 16,

00:23:11.399 --> 00:23:13.239
when we think about the subject matter

00:23:13.239 --> 00:23:17.279
of holiness and godly living.

00:23:17.279 --> 00:23:18.839
I've said often through the years,

00:23:18.839 --> 00:23:20.679
and it's worth repeating this morning,

00:23:20.719 --> 00:23:22.839
God cares how you live.

00:23:22.839 --> 00:23:25.599
How you live your life matters to God.

00:23:25.599 --> 00:23:27.559
Sometimes we think, well, I can just do what I want.

00:23:27.559 --> 00:23:28.879
I'm saved.

00:23:28.879 --> 00:23:31.119
I'm thankful for the doctrine of eternal security

00:23:31.119 --> 00:23:35.599
and what a blessing to know that as His child,

00:23:35.599 --> 00:23:40.599
that He is my Savior, my Father forever and ever.

00:23:40.639 --> 00:23:42.159
In fact, Peter deals with that

00:23:42.159 --> 00:23:43.759
in the very beginning of this epistle

00:23:43.759 --> 00:23:44.679
when he talks about the fact

00:23:44.679 --> 00:23:46.839
that we have an inheritance, incorruptible,

00:23:46.839 --> 00:23:48.399
undefiled, that fadeth not away,

00:23:48.399 --> 00:23:50.359
reserved in heaven for you.

00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:51.879
We're kept by the power of God.

00:23:51.879 --> 00:23:53.399
What a blessing.

00:23:53.399 --> 00:23:55.519
And I'm so thankful for the truth of eternal security,

00:23:55.519 --> 00:23:58.999
but you know how you live and how I live matters to God?

00:23:58.999 --> 00:24:01.399
Your children are your children, amen?

00:24:01.399 --> 00:24:03.719
And they will forever be.

00:24:03.719 --> 00:24:06.439
No matter how estranged a relationship

00:24:06.439 --> 00:24:08.519
could ever become upon this earth,

00:24:08.519 --> 00:24:11.039
if your children are your biological children,

00:24:11.039 --> 00:24:12.839
they will forever be your children.

00:24:13.879 --> 00:24:14.719
Amen?

00:24:15.679 --> 00:24:17.839
But do you care how they live?

00:24:17.839 --> 00:24:19.279
Sure you do.

00:24:19.279 --> 00:24:20.879
Sure you do.

00:24:20.879 --> 00:24:22.759
And no one wants to say, well, my child,

00:24:22.759 --> 00:24:26.599
you know, they're in the big house and they're...

00:24:26.599 --> 00:24:28.839
Who wants to talk that way?

00:24:28.839 --> 00:24:31.159
Right, we don't want that to be the case.

00:24:32.039 --> 00:24:35.440
And so God cares about how we live as His children.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.599
We're His representatives.

00:24:36.599 --> 00:24:38.479
Notice what Peter says in 1 Peter 1.

00:24:38.479 --> 00:24:39.319
Look at verse 13.

00:24:39.319 --> 00:24:41.440
Wherefore, gird up the loins of your mind,

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.199
be sober and hope to the end

00:24:43.199 --> 00:24:45.279
for the grace that is to be brought unto you

00:24:45.279 --> 00:24:47.039
at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:49.319
As obedient children,

00:24:49.319 --> 00:24:50.440
not fashioning yourselves

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.279
according to the former lust and your ignorance,

00:24:52.279 --> 00:24:53.879
but as He which hath called you as holy,

00:24:53.879 --> 00:24:56.199
so be ye holy in all manner of conversation

00:24:56.199 --> 00:24:59.039
because it is written, be ye holy for I am holy.

00:24:59.879 --> 00:25:01.279
God cares how we live.

00:25:02.519 --> 00:25:03.759
We represent the Lord.

00:25:03.759 --> 00:25:04.799
We're His children.

00:25:06.119 --> 00:25:09.519
And oh, how we ought to be honoring His name.

00:25:09.519 --> 00:25:11.479
We find that it says that we might be partakers

00:25:11.479 --> 00:25:12.319
of His holiness.

00:25:12.319 --> 00:25:13.879
Continue with me back in Hebrews 12

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:16.319
and notice in verse number 11,

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.119
great truth is revealed to us here again

00:25:19.119 --> 00:25:21.919
with regard to the subject matter of chastening.

00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:24.679
It says, now, no chastening for the present

00:25:24.679 --> 00:25:26.239
seemeth to be joyous.

00:25:26.239 --> 00:25:27.479
How many of you can say amen?

00:25:27.479 --> 00:25:28.359
I agree, right?

00:25:28.359 --> 00:25:30.279
It's not enjoyable when you're dealing

00:25:30.279 --> 00:25:31.479
with the chastisement,

00:25:31.479 --> 00:25:34.039
but He's helping us by showing us what it proves

00:25:34.039 --> 00:25:35.079
and what it produces.

00:25:35.079 --> 00:25:36.679
He's helping us to understand

00:25:36.679 --> 00:25:38.079
that we're not going to faint,

00:25:38.079 --> 00:25:40.959
that we will despise not thou the chastening of the Lord,

00:25:40.959 --> 00:25:42.759
that we will endure chastening

00:25:42.759 --> 00:25:44.079
because we understand what it proves

00:25:44.079 --> 00:25:45.399
and what it produces.

00:25:45.399 --> 00:25:46.959
And yes, it's not joyous.

00:25:46.959 --> 00:25:48.759
It's not an enjoyable time.

00:25:48.759 --> 00:25:51.319
It's grievous as it says here in verse number 11.

00:25:51.319 --> 00:25:52.639
Notice what it says though.

00:25:52.639 --> 00:25:55.759
Nevertheless, afterward,

00:25:57.119 --> 00:26:02.119
it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness

00:26:02.599 --> 00:26:06.639
unto them which are exercised thereby.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.639
Yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness.

00:26:09.639 --> 00:26:13.519
It turns that unrighteous behavior

00:26:13.519 --> 00:26:15.239
to righteous behavior.

00:26:16.239 --> 00:26:17.559
That's the purpose anyway.

00:26:17.559 --> 00:26:18.879
That's the intent, right?

00:26:18.879 --> 00:26:20.279
That's why He's chastening us.

00:26:20.279 --> 00:26:21.919
That's why He's disciplining us.

00:26:21.919 --> 00:26:23.279
That's why He's correcting us.

00:26:23.279 --> 00:26:24.879
That's why He's scourging us

00:26:24.879 --> 00:26:27.879
so that that unrighteous behavior

00:26:27.879 --> 00:26:31.759
can be corrected to become righteous behavior,

00:26:31.759 --> 00:26:36.759
thus being in a condition that is pleasing to God.

00:26:36.759 --> 00:26:37.599
And we find that it says

00:26:37.599 --> 00:26:40.039
that it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness

00:26:40.039 --> 00:26:42.440
unto them which are exercised thereby.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.759
In other words, those that would respond properly,

00:26:44.759 --> 00:26:47.479
those that would heed the correction of God,

00:26:47.479 --> 00:26:48.759
the chastisement of God.

00:26:48.759 --> 00:26:51.399
By the way, you understand that sometimes chastisement

00:26:51.399 --> 00:26:52.720
can just come really simply

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.720
in the form of just a simple conviction.

00:26:57.119 --> 00:26:59.440
I like it when it comes that way.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.679
Amen.

00:27:00.679 --> 00:27:02.159
By the way, I've said this before.

00:27:02.159 --> 00:27:04.639
It's good when God steps on your toes

00:27:04.639 --> 00:27:05.919
through the preaching of the Word of God,

00:27:05.919 --> 00:27:07.319
through the reading of the Word of God.

00:27:07.319 --> 00:27:11.079
When you're reading in your daily time with God

00:27:11.079 --> 00:27:12.599
and you're getting alone with God

00:27:12.599 --> 00:27:14.039
and you're reading the Word of God

00:27:14.039 --> 00:27:17.039
and God, the Holy Spirit begins to prick your heart,

00:27:17.039 --> 00:27:18.399
begins to step upon your toes,

00:27:18.399 --> 00:27:19.759
that's a good thing.

00:27:21.239 --> 00:27:23.720
I like that kind of chastisement.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.079
But it can become more severe.

00:27:26.079 --> 00:27:28.159
In fact, we find that there are times in which,

00:27:28.159 --> 00:27:29.359
as I've mentioned earlier,

00:27:29.359 --> 00:27:31.919
we ignore all of those warning signs.

00:27:31.919 --> 00:27:34.159
We might be in a place where we quench

00:27:34.159 --> 00:27:36.239
and grieve the Holy Spirit of God.

00:27:36.239 --> 00:27:37.599
We've gotten so sideways

00:27:37.599 --> 00:27:40.440
that we've just kind of ignored all of those warning signs.

00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:42.559
And then all of a sudden it has to intensify.

00:27:42.559 --> 00:27:44.879
Remember, God's chastisement,

00:27:44.879 --> 00:27:47.279
it's measured and it's appropriate.

00:27:48.239 --> 00:27:50.199
There are times in which I remember Brianna,

00:27:50.199 --> 00:27:51.319
I'll pick on her just for a moment,

00:27:51.319 --> 00:27:53.239
this morning when she was younger

00:27:53.239 --> 00:27:55.279
and obviously still the case even today,

00:27:55.279 --> 00:27:56.679
there were times with Brianna

00:27:56.679 --> 00:27:58.959
that just her knowing that she disappointed me

00:27:58.959 --> 00:28:00.959
just broke her.

00:28:00.959 --> 00:28:03.000
She just didn't want to disappoint Daddy.

00:28:04.319 --> 00:28:06.720
And I wonder this morning how often we come to that place

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.919
with our Heavenly Father saying,

00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:10.599
I just don't want to disappoint God.

00:28:10.599 --> 00:28:12.599
I don't want to displease Him.

00:28:13.879 --> 00:28:15.599
The Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians

00:28:15.599 --> 00:28:18.479
when we read about Paul in chapter number 10,

00:28:18.479 --> 00:28:21.279
he's referencing several Old Testament events

00:28:21.279 --> 00:28:23.000
and really in rapid succession.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.399
And when he goes through those events,

00:28:24.399 --> 00:28:25.839
he starts by saying this,

00:28:25.839 --> 00:28:29.599
and with many of them, God was not well pleased.

00:28:30.479 --> 00:28:32.919
See, I want God to be pleased with my life.

00:28:32.919 --> 00:28:35.519
I want God to be pleased with my behavior.

00:28:35.519 --> 00:28:38.080
We find that it yieldeth the peaceable fruit

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.239
of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.

00:28:41.239 --> 00:28:42.760
As we look at the passage of Scripture,

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.559
we continue looking at verses 12 through 17 this morning.

00:28:45.559 --> 00:28:48.399
I want you to notice in our text of Scripture,

00:28:48.399 --> 00:28:52.200
not only what chastening proves and what it produces,

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.880
but at number three in your notes this morning,

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:57.080
I want you to consider your response to chastisement.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.839
I want you to consider how you respond to chastisement.

00:28:59.839 --> 00:29:04.000
We've established this morning from verses four through 11,

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.320
the fact that chastisement proves that God loves us.

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.320
It proves that we belong to Him.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:13.799
We've found that it produces in us that holiness,

00:29:13.799 --> 00:29:15.359
we're partakers of His holiness,

00:29:15.359 --> 00:29:18.440
that we can understand that it's for our profit

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.440
and that we can see that it yieldeth

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.119
the peaceable fruit of righteousness.

00:29:22.119 --> 00:29:24.679
But the question that we ask ourselves this morning

00:29:24.679 --> 00:29:26.959
as we consider these next few verses of Scripture

00:29:26.959 --> 00:29:28.880
is how do we respond to chastisement?

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.039
When the Lord has to chasten you because you belong to Him,

00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:34.679
because you're His child,

00:29:34.679 --> 00:29:37.359
and there's something that's gotten sideways in your life,

00:29:37.359 --> 00:29:41.679
and the Lord in His love and in His grace and mercy

00:29:41.679 --> 00:29:43.919
brings chastisement in your life,

00:29:43.919 --> 00:29:46.399
how do you respond to it?

00:29:46.399 --> 00:29:48.559
We notice in our text of Scripture

00:29:48.559 --> 00:29:50.719
in verses 12 and 13, number one,

00:29:50.719 --> 00:29:53.279
we must continue in holiness.

00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:54.799
I want you to think about this

00:29:54.799 --> 00:29:57.320
in light of really the entirety of the subject matter

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.519
in chapter number 12.

00:29:58.519 --> 00:30:00.000
Remember in verses one through three

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.599
it's talking about run the race.

00:30:01.599 --> 00:30:08.799
And in verses 1 through 3, he tells us, especially in verse number 1, about the fact that we

00:30:08.799 --> 00:30:12.319
need to lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and we talked

00:30:12.319 --> 00:30:16.799
last week about all those distractions, those things that would cause us to become detoured,

00:30:16.799 --> 00:30:23.039
that would cause us to stop running the race that we're supposed to run, to get off track,

00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:26.379
to not do that which God has called us to do.

00:30:26.379 --> 00:30:30.319
We find that he told us that we consider we're looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher

00:30:30.319 --> 00:30:34.319
of our faith, that we're to consider him, and all of those things, and how we're to

00:30:34.319 --> 00:30:39.139
keep in the race, but I would say to you this morning that even in the same vein of that

00:30:39.139 --> 00:30:43.539
thought of verses 1 through 3, as we enter into verses 4 through 17, and we deal with

00:30:43.539 --> 00:30:47.959
the subject matter of chastisement, that there are some that when they experience chastening,

00:30:47.959 --> 00:30:50.559
they can just kind of give up.

00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:53.959
Just kind of get overwhelmed with it.

00:30:53.959 --> 00:30:59.039
In fact, you've seen, and no doubt you've seen in some people's lives, humanly speaking,

00:30:59.039 --> 00:31:04.539
where someone is disciplined, and they respond wrong to the discipline.

00:31:04.539 --> 00:31:09.079
They respond incorrectly to the correction, so there's no doubt we've sought to correct

00:31:09.079 --> 00:31:12.319
someone maybe in a task that they're doing, we say, no, no, you're not supposed to do

00:31:12.319 --> 00:31:14.959
it that way, let me show you how to do it, and I'm not going to do it.

00:31:14.959 --> 00:31:17.699
Well, that didn't help so much, did it?

00:31:17.699 --> 00:31:20.139
That correction didn't go very far.

00:31:20.139 --> 00:31:24.079
It wasn't that I wanted to do the job, I simply wanted to help somebody know how to do the

00:31:24.079 --> 00:31:25.079
job.

00:31:25.999 --> 00:31:30.119
And so when we think about the subject matter of chastisement and correction, we understand

00:31:30.119 --> 00:31:35.519
that some might experience chastening, and they've forgotten that it proves that God

00:31:35.519 --> 00:31:40.839
loves them, and it proves that they belong to God, and it produces some things, and they

00:31:40.839 --> 00:31:43.639
begin to experience chastening, and they just give up.

00:31:43.639 --> 00:31:46.159
They become weak.

00:31:46.159 --> 00:31:51.439
The Bible tells us in verse number 12, wherefore, lift up the hands which hang down in the feeble

00:31:51.439 --> 00:31:52.439
knees.

00:31:52.439 --> 00:31:58.079
This is a child that's just been disciplined, and they're just moping, right?

00:31:58.079 --> 00:31:59.599
What happened to you?

00:31:59.599 --> 00:32:01.519
How much time do you have?

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:04.359
Let me tell you, you know what I mean?

00:32:04.359 --> 00:32:10.799
But here he says this, and make straight paths for your feet, in verse number 13, lest that

00:32:10.799 --> 00:32:14.719
which is lame, notice where it says, be turned out of the way, that literally means to just

00:32:14.719 --> 00:32:20.579
stop, to just give up, to just not continue, and so we find that it says, but let it rather

00:32:20.739 --> 00:32:23.259
be healed.

00:32:23.259 --> 00:32:27.779
We think about the chastening of the Lord, and we understand that we must not be discouraged,

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:33.319
that we must continue in holiness, that we understand the fact that God has done this

00:32:33.319 --> 00:32:38.379
for me in my life, because He loves me, and it proves that I belong to Him, and it's produced

00:32:38.379 --> 00:32:39.739
some things in my life.

00:32:39.739 --> 00:32:40.939
It's for my profit.

00:32:40.939 --> 00:32:43.699
It's not so that I get overwhelmed, and say, well, then I'm just going to throw in the

00:32:43.699 --> 00:32:47.619
towel, I give up, I can't do this, no, no, no, that I would continue in holiness, that

00:32:47.619 --> 00:32:54.339
I would respond, understanding God's purpose and God's plan, and that I would continue

00:32:54.339 --> 00:32:58.179
to live for Him, that I would continue, yes, I've corrected, remember, the end of verse

00:32:58.179 --> 00:33:00.699
number 11, to them which are exercised thereby.

00:33:00.699 --> 00:33:01.699
What does it do?

00:33:01.699 --> 00:33:08.019
It yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness, and then I get back and I continue on.

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:12.679
Not only do we find that we're to continue in holiness, but number two, when we consider

00:33:12.679 --> 00:33:19.239
our response to chastisement in verses 14 and 15, we must refuse to become bitter.

00:33:19.239 --> 00:33:20.239
Refuse to become bitter.

00:33:20.239 --> 00:33:25.739
Did you ever get upset with your parents when they disciplined you?

00:33:25.739 --> 00:33:30.439
Was there ever a time when your parent disciplined you and they said something like this, this

00:33:30.439 --> 00:33:33.239
hurts me more than it hurts you?

00:33:33.239 --> 00:33:36.279
I was always perplexed by that statement.

00:33:36.279 --> 00:33:38.039
I was like, you want to trade places then?

00:33:38.039 --> 00:33:41.679
Like, I mean, this doesn't feel very good.

00:33:41.679 --> 00:33:46.639
But the reality is that there are times, physically speaking, we think about that human relationship

00:33:46.639 --> 00:33:53.839
that when we were disciplined, we got upset, we got angry, perhaps we got bitter at our

00:33:53.839 --> 00:33:54.839
parents.

00:33:54.839 --> 00:33:58.799
See, we need to be careful when we understand the chastening of the Lord that we don't become

00:33:58.799 --> 00:34:06.599
bitter, that we understand that bitterness will trouble you, that bitterness is destructive.

00:34:06.599 --> 00:34:13.159
It says here in verse number 14, follow peace with all men and holiness, without which no

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:18.999
man shall see the Lord, looking diligently, lest any man fail of the grace of God, lest

00:34:18.999 --> 00:34:26.679
any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled.

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:30.799
Within the context of the portion of Scripture that we're looking at, we look at bitterness

00:34:30.799 --> 00:34:33.239
within that context of chastening.

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:37.079
We understand we could speak about the subject matter of bitterness in a whole host of arenas

00:34:37.079 --> 00:34:41.319
and the way in which people become bitter, but keeping in line with the context this

00:34:41.319 --> 00:34:47.079
morning, we'd understand that response to the chastening and how we can become bitter.

00:34:47.079 --> 00:34:49.359
How we can become angry.

00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:53.919
There are times in which we do something like what Peter did, and I understand it's a completely

00:34:53.919 --> 00:34:59.239
different context, but in John chapter number 21, as Jesus is giving Peter some instruction

00:34:59.239 --> 00:35:03.039
and he's talking to Peter about follow me, which by the way, is the same instruction

00:35:03.039 --> 00:35:06.839
that he gave Peter on the day that he called Peter, follow me and I will make you fishers

00:35:06.839 --> 00:35:13.559
of men, and after Peter in John chapter 21 goes fishing and catches nothing, by the way,

00:35:13.559 --> 00:35:18.439
we find that Jesus appears on the shore and he calls and they come and of course they

00:35:18.439 --> 00:35:23.559
feast and then Jesus is having some conversation with Peter.

00:35:23.559 --> 00:35:25.599
He asks him, do you love me?

00:35:25.599 --> 00:35:29.999
And we find that then the Lord Jesus Christ gives Peter some instruction.

00:35:29.999 --> 00:35:30.999
He says, follow me.

00:35:30.999 --> 00:35:31.999
You know what Peter says?

00:35:31.999 --> 00:35:32.999
Well, what about this guy?

00:35:32.999 --> 00:35:33.999
What about John?

00:35:33.999 --> 00:35:36.319
That's what he was talking about, John.

00:35:36.319 --> 00:35:37.319
What about John?

00:35:37.319 --> 00:35:38.879
And what does Jesus say?

00:35:38.879 --> 00:35:39.879
Don't worry about John.

00:35:39.879 --> 00:35:45.159
See, there are times in our lives that perhaps you say, well, why am I getting the discipline?

00:35:45.159 --> 00:35:46.839
Why isn't somebody else?

00:35:46.839 --> 00:35:51.719
And we can become bitter instead of understanding that it's for our prophet.

00:35:51.719 --> 00:35:56.599
I'm thankful that God loves me so much that he wants to deal with me, that he doesn't

00:35:56.599 --> 00:35:58.679
want to let me go too far.

00:35:58.679 --> 00:36:01.959
I hope that perhaps we would pray that way in our lives.

00:36:01.959 --> 00:36:04.279
God help me not to get sideways.

00:36:04.279 --> 00:36:05.799
Help me not to get off track.

00:36:05.799 --> 00:36:07.479
Help me not to get away from you.

00:36:07.479 --> 00:36:12.959
Help me to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit of God, the conviction through the preaching

00:36:12.959 --> 00:36:13.959
of your word.

00:36:13.959 --> 00:36:18.319
Listen, when I read the Bible, when I opened the scriptures early this morning to read

00:36:18.319 --> 00:36:22.359
personally from God's word this morning, I'm reading through the book of Acts, how exciting

00:36:22.359 --> 00:36:24.119
the book of Acts is.

00:36:24.119 --> 00:36:27.319
And I finished the Bible a couple of times through this year and now I've just been reading

00:36:27.359 --> 00:36:30.639
through the New Testament and I'm going to read through the New Testament a number of

00:36:30.639 --> 00:36:33.199
times in this last couple of months of the year.

00:36:33.199 --> 00:36:36.839
And as I'm reading through the book of Acts and I'm reading those first seven chapters

00:36:36.839 --> 00:36:42.719
this morning, and I'm just overwhelmed with how God is moving and working and what he's

00:36:42.719 --> 00:36:43.719
doing.

00:36:43.719 --> 00:36:48.559
But before I even began reading, I said, God, would you convict me this morning?

00:36:48.559 --> 00:36:51.879
God, would you comfort me this morning?

00:36:51.879 --> 00:36:55.159
You know that God will use his word to comfort and convict us.

00:36:55.159 --> 00:36:56.159
It's amazing.

00:36:56.599 --> 00:36:57.959
I'm reading his word.

00:36:57.959 --> 00:36:59.399
You know how I was convicted this morning?

00:36:59.399 --> 00:37:03.759
I was convicted because there's a bunch of disciples that are serving God and they're

00:37:03.759 --> 00:37:10.759
being faced with all sorts of just adversity, discipline, imprisoned and threatenings and

00:37:10.759 --> 00:37:11.759
all of these things.

00:37:11.759 --> 00:37:12.759
You know what they do?

00:37:12.759 --> 00:37:13.759
They keep on keeping on.

00:37:13.759 --> 00:37:18.959
Stephen, and I read the last part of chapter number seven this morning, he's stoned because

00:37:18.959 --> 00:37:22.639
of his preaching.

00:37:22.639 --> 00:37:25.079
The reality is that they were just continuing on.

00:37:25.079 --> 00:37:26.719
I was convicted by that.

00:37:26.719 --> 00:37:28.319
You know how I was comforted this morning?

00:37:28.319 --> 00:37:31.959
They threw those rascals in prison and God let them out.

00:37:31.959 --> 00:37:32.959
Amen.

00:37:32.959 --> 00:37:34.239
God said, uh-uh, we're going to have you out.

00:37:34.239 --> 00:37:38.719
And then he told them, go over to the temple over there and preach and teach.

00:37:38.719 --> 00:37:39.999
And they did.

00:37:39.999 --> 00:37:43.959
And then when they went to look for him, they said, truly, we found that the prison was

00:37:43.959 --> 00:37:46.399
locked and shut, but they weren't in there.

00:37:46.399 --> 00:37:47.399
I just started laughing.

00:37:47.399 --> 00:37:48.759
I've read it before.

00:37:48.759 --> 00:37:49.759
I know.

00:37:49.919 --> 00:37:56.039
I try to write it fresh every day because I want God to work in my heart, in my life.

00:37:56.039 --> 00:37:58.319
And I'm just rejoicing and I'm comforted.

00:37:58.319 --> 00:38:04.199
And we find that then when they find out where they are, they say to them, did not we straightly

00:38:04.199 --> 00:38:09.319
command you that you should no longer preach or teach in this man's name, yet you filled

00:38:09.319 --> 00:38:11.519
Jerusalem with your doctrine.

00:38:11.519 --> 00:38:12.519
Praise God.

00:38:12.519 --> 00:38:14.279
That's what we're supposed to do.

00:38:14.279 --> 00:38:15.279
Amen.

00:38:15.279 --> 00:38:16.279
We have the same marching orders.

00:38:16.279 --> 00:38:18.399
I was comforted.

00:38:18.399 --> 00:38:24.919
But we find that when God convicts us, when God chastens us, we've got to be careful that

00:38:24.919 --> 00:38:30.639
we do not respond in bitterness, that we refuse to become bitter, that we don't get angry

00:38:30.639 --> 00:38:36.799
when God's chastening hand comes in our life, when he has to discipline us, that it doesn't

00:38:36.799 --> 00:38:43.559
cause us to respond in an inappropriate way, but that we would continue in holiness, that

00:38:43.559 --> 00:38:47.319
we would follow peace with all men, as it says in verse 14, and holiness, that we would

00:38:47.319 --> 00:38:51.759
understand that there is the potential of becoming bitter when we face discipline, and

00:38:51.759 --> 00:38:53.959
we say, I'm not going to respond that way.

00:38:53.959 --> 00:38:54.959
Why?

00:38:54.959 --> 00:38:57.559
Because I understand what it proves and I understand what it produces.

00:38:57.559 --> 00:39:01.559
And that's why we've got to keep those two things in the forefront of our minds when

00:39:01.559 --> 00:39:04.159
we think about the subject matter of discipline, of chastening.

00:39:04.159 --> 00:39:08.319
I believe that's why verses 4 and 11 precede verses 12 through 17.

00:39:08.319 --> 00:39:09.319
Why?

00:39:09.319 --> 00:39:11.799
Because you're going to tell them, hey, this is what it's for.

00:39:11.799 --> 00:39:12.799
This is what it proves.

00:39:12.799 --> 00:39:15.359
This is what it produces.

00:39:15.359 --> 00:39:21.359
Number three, under our response to chastisement, we consider how we would respond to chastisement.

00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:27.039
In verses 16 and 17, I would say this, repent, repent.

00:39:27.039 --> 00:39:29.199
Respond properly to it.

00:39:29.199 --> 00:39:33.000
Repentance carries with it the idea of sorrow.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.839
Repentance is both desired and appropriate.

00:39:36.839 --> 00:39:38.599
Let me tell you what repentance is.

00:39:38.599 --> 00:39:43.479
Repentance is a change of mind that results in a change of direction.

00:39:43.479 --> 00:39:47.799
Repentance is that God disciplines me, He corrects me, He chastens me, and I say, okay,

00:39:47.799 --> 00:39:50.359
I'm not going to keep doing that anymore.

00:39:50.359 --> 00:39:54.919
I'm going to have a change of mind about this thing and it's going to impact my direction.

00:39:54.919 --> 00:39:58.479
That change of mind will result in a change of direction.

00:39:58.479 --> 00:40:01.719
As we look at the example in verses 16 and 17, we see the example.

00:40:01.719 --> 00:40:05.879
from all the way back in the book of Genesis in chapter 27 with regard to

00:40:05.879 --> 00:40:09.639
Esau. Now, you're familiar with Jacob and Esau, and you're familiar with some of the

00:40:09.639 --> 00:40:14.279
things. In fact, he says in verse number 17, for you know, the writer of Hebrews

00:40:14.279 --> 00:40:17.559
has the expectation that the people that he's writing to have a level of

00:40:17.559 --> 00:40:21.479
knowledge of the Old Testament. Not that they would be ignorant of it, that they

00:40:21.479 --> 00:40:24.399
would be aware of it. For you know. It's interesting that he says that you've

00:40:24.399 --> 00:40:27.599
forgotten the exhortation in verse number five. So there's some things from

00:40:27.599 --> 00:40:30.039
the Old Testament that he expected them to know, and he says, look, there's some

00:40:30.039 --> 00:40:34.159
things that you forgot. By the way, if you forgot it, that mean you knew it at

00:40:34.159 --> 00:40:39.599
one point. Amen? You don't forget something you've never been told. We

00:40:39.599 --> 00:40:46.079
forget. Amen? We forget all the time. Some more than others. But we forget. We need

00:40:46.079 --> 00:40:49.879
to be reminded of some things. And here he says in verse number 16, look at what

00:40:49.879 --> 00:40:57.219
he says about Esau. Lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau, who

00:40:57.219 --> 00:41:02.499
for one morsel of meat sold his birthright. For ye know how that

00:41:02.499 --> 00:41:09.619
afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected. Now let me

00:41:09.619 --> 00:41:12.579
pause there. We'll look at the last part of the verse in just a moment. You know

00:41:12.579 --> 00:41:16.619
what happened in the life of Esau? He was very temporally focused, was he not? He

00:41:16.619 --> 00:41:20.179
lived on the temporal plane. And we find that there was a day in which he needed

00:41:20.179 --> 00:41:23.819
some meat, and he was willing to sacrifice whatever, and we find that that

00:41:23.819 --> 00:41:28.299
took place. And yes, Jacob went through that process, and we see what's going on,

00:41:28.299 --> 00:41:31.699
and we see that it's described for us in verse 16. But notice what it says in

00:41:31.699 --> 00:41:36.499
verse 17, for you know how that afterward. See, when it came to the point when there

00:41:36.499 --> 00:41:41.259
was going to be a blessing, all of a sudden Esau was in a place where he

00:41:41.259 --> 00:41:48.059
wanted the blessing. He wasn't too interested in repentance. He wasn't too

00:41:48.059 --> 00:41:52.419
interested in having a change in really his behavior. In fact, if you look in

00:41:52.419 --> 00:41:56.699
Genesis chapter 27, you'll find a number of things about Esau. I'll turn over there

00:41:56.699 --> 00:42:00.299
just quickly. We don't have much time left this morning, but I do want to

00:42:00.299 --> 00:42:04.499
show you just a couple of things here. The Bible says, of course, with

00:42:04.499 --> 00:42:09.699
regard to all that had took in place, and this situation that Isaac was going to

00:42:09.699 --> 00:42:15.379
give that blessing, and then Esau comes in right after his brother Jacob had

00:42:15.379 --> 00:42:19.539
departed and received the blessing. And we find that here's what Esau says in

00:42:19.539 --> 00:42:24.299
verse number 41. It says this of Esau, and Esau hated Jacob because of the

00:42:24.299 --> 00:42:28.539
blessing, wherewith his father blessed him. And Esau said in his heart,

00:42:28.539 --> 00:42:33.219
the days of mourning for my father are at hand, then will I slay my brother Jacob.

00:42:33.219 --> 00:42:40.699
We find also that when we think about the situation with Esau, that he

00:42:40.699 --> 00:42:45.339
went and purposely married some folks that he knew that his parents wouldn't

00:42:45.339 --> 00:42:49.359
be, married a gal that his parents wouldn't be in agreement with. And we

00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:53.399
find that there's no repentance. In fact, he wanted the blessing. You ever want

00:42:53.399 --> 00:42:58.039
that, you know, the child wants the ice cream? We say, man, you missed out on the

00:42:58.039 --> 00:43:01.519
ice cream because of your behavior. And then they go and throw a fit. You're like,

00:43:01.519 --> 00:43:08.559
yeah, case in point, right? I mean, look at this, right? But the reality is that

00:43:08.559 --> 00:43:14.079
here it says, look what it says, back in Hebrews 12, verse 17. When he would

00:43:14.079 --> 00:43:17.799
have inherited the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place of

00:43:17.799 --> 00:43:20.639
repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears. And I want you to

00:43:20.639 --> 00:43:24.719
understand here that at the end of verse number 17, it's not saying that he sought

00:43:24.719 --> 00:43:30.159
it, meaning repentance carefully with tears. No, what he sought with tears was

00:43:30.159 --> 00:43:35.239
the blessing. Was the blessing. He wanted the blessing. He wasn't really too

00:43:35.239 --> 00:43:39.359
concerned about the direction of his life, about the character, about the

00:43:39.359 --> 00:43:45.259
behavior. He wanted the blessing. And we find that as God's people, as we would

00:43:45.259 --> 00:43:49.099
think about the subject matter of chastisement, and we would consider

00:43:49.099 --> 00:43:52.779
these last few verses of our text this morning, and we would consider our

00:43:52.779 --> 00:43:57.539
response to chastisement, I asked this morning, how do you respond to the

00:43:57.539 --> 00:44:05.099
chasing of the Lord? Can you remember the last time the Lord had to chase in you?

00:44:05.179 --> 00:44:12.699
Can you remember how God in love, with measured and appropriate discipline, came

00:44:12.699 --> 00:44:18.219
in your life? He used His Word to discipline you. He used the preaching of

00:44:18.219 --> 00:44:23.259
His Word to chasten you. He used some other thing to chasten you. I don't know

00:44:23.259 --> 00:44:29.299
what it was for you. But I wonder this morning, how do we respond to it? Do we

00:44:29.299 --> 00:44:34.099
just, as it says in verse number 12, that word picture that is given, do we have

00:44:34.099 --> 00:44:40.659
our hands which are hanging down in our feeble knees? Or do we continue? Say, no,

00:44:40.659 --> 00:44:43.019
no, I'm not going to be discouraged because of this. I'm going to understand

00:44:43.019 --> 00:44:49.339
that God in love has chastened me. And it's to produce something in my life. I'm

00:44:49.339 --> 00:44:53.739
going to refuse to get bitter. I'm going to determine to repent that I'm going to

00:44:53.739 --> 00:44:57.979
have a change of mind about this thing that's going to have a change in my

00:44:57.979 --> 00:45:03.779
behavior. So this morning we think about the chastisement of the Lord. I would say

00:45:03.779 --> 00:45:07.939
this, if you only get these two things this morning, I'll sum it up, I'll sum up

00:45:07.939 --> 00:45:14.139
the whole thing real quickly. Two takeaways. Number one, appreciate

00:45:14.139 --> 00:45:21.299
chastisement. Learn to appreciate it. Learn to thank God for it. Why? Because

00:45:21.299 --> 00:45:26.659
it proves some things. It proves that He loves you. It proves that you belong to Him.

00:45:26.659 --> 00:45:31.499
It produces some things in your life. He's not going to let you just keep on

00:45:31.499 --> 00:45:36.659
going and going and going. No, no, He's going to bring chastisement in

00:45:36.659 --> 00:45:39.859
your life because He loves you. He's going to bring about, it's going to yield

00:45:39.859 --> 00:45:45.619
that peaceable fruit of righteousness. So number one, learn to appreciate

00:45:45.619 --> 00:45:51.019
chastisement. Learn to thank God for it. You say, man, I've never thanked God for

00:45:51.019 --> 00:45:58.379
conviction before. Start. Thank you God for convicting me. Thank you God for

00:45:58.379 --> 00:46:03.579
chastening me. Number two takeaway this morning, determine that you'll respond

00:46:03.579 --> 00:46:09.179
properly to chastisement. I'm going to determine to respond properly to it. Why?

00:46:09.179 --> 00:46:16.099
Because I've understood what it proves and produces. See, if we had the knowledge

00:46:16.099 --> 00:46:21.779
of chastisement this morning without the truth that God has given us with regard

00:46:21.779 --> 00:46:27.019
to what it proves and what it produces, it'd really be hard to deal with. But when

00:46:27.019 --> 00:46:31.459
I understand this morning what chastisement proves and what it produces,

00:46:31.459 --> 00:46:36.299
it helps me to have a completely different approach to the subject

00:46:36.299 --> 00:46:40.819
matter of chastisement. Paul says this, I'll close with this portion of

00:46:40.819 --> 00:46:45.099
Scripture in 1 Corinthians 11. We often use the portion of Scripture with

00:46:45.099 --> 00:46:49.819
dealing with the Lord's Supper. We've said that the Lord's Supper, it's a time

00:46:49.819 --> 00:46:54.499
of remembrance, and certainly it is, this due in remembrance of me. It's a table of

00:46:54.499 --> 00:47:00.579
expectation. He said this due until He comes, right? What a blessing. It's a table

00:47:00.579 --> 00:47:04.219
of examination. Let a man examine himself. He says if we would

00:47:04.219 --> 00:47:08.139
judge ourselves, we would not be judged. And he talks about this, about many have

00:47:08.139 --> 00:47:14.619
eaten and drink that unworthily, and he says that for this cause many sleep.

00:47:14.619 --> 00:47:20.339
He talks about being dead is what it speaks of. And the reality this morning is

00:47:20.339 --> 00:47:25.699
that no doubt those individuals that are being spoken of by Paul in 1

00:47:25.699 --> 00:47:31.299
Corinthians chapter 11, they just ignored all of the chastisement, and it

00:47:31.299 --> 00:47:41.739
had to increase in severity until at one point they died. Because God said, I'm not

00:47:41.739 --> 00:47:47.259
gonna let you go any further. And see for our lives this morning, I want to learn

00:47:47.259 --> 00:47:51.779
the subject of chastisement so that I can respond properly to it, so that it

00:47:51.779 --> 00:47:58.659
does not have to intensify in its severity. Amen? Our God loves us, and

00:47:58.659 --> 00:48:05.379
because He loves us, He chasteneth us. Whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth.

00:48:05.379 --> 00:48:10.979
Let's pray. Father, we love you this morning. We thank you for loving us. Often

00:48:10.979 --> 00:48:17.219
in our lives, there are things in which we reference, remember, and speak of that

00:48:17.219 --> 00:48:24.979
would prove your love. Perhaps we've overlooked the subject matter that's

00:48:24.979 --> 00:48:33.099
been before us this day of chastisement, but yet we find biblically that

00:48:33.099 --> 00:48:39.500
chastisement proves that you love us. We're so thankful for your love. God, I

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:46.579
pray this morning that you would help us to learn to appreciate and thank you for

00:48:46.579 --> 00:48:51.299
chastisement in our lives. I pray this morning that you would help us to

00:48:51.299 --> 00:49:00.500
determine that we'd respond properly to chastisement in our lives. Help us, Lord,

00:49:00.579 --> 00:49:07.539
to take these truths from your Word and properly apply them in our lives. If

00:49:07.539 --> 00:49:11.379
there's one that's not sure of heaven, they've never been saved, I pray that

00:49:11.379 --> 00:49:13.939
you'd give us an opportunity to take a Bible and show them how they can know

00:49:13.939 --> 00:49:20.579
for sure that heaven is their home. But for your people this morning, God, would

00:49:20.579 --> 00:49:25.619
you help us to be encouraged? Would you help us determine to

00:49:25.619 --> 00:49:29.179
respond properly? We pray that in these few moments that you would have your

00:49:29.179 --> 00:49:33.699
will and way, that decisions would be made and sealed that would bring honor

00:49:33.699 --> 00:49:37.139
and glory to thy name. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand

00:49:37.139 --> 00:49:40.500
with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.
