1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,839
show at the conclusion of the service. I'm going to preach the message first,

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,599
and then we'll watch these update videos. I do trust that there'll be a blessing to you,

3
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:11,840
not only the message from the Word of God, especially, of course, as we look to the

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,559
truth of God's Word, but then as we have the opportunity to see the work of missions

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,319
and to see the investment that we've made, as we've given, as we've prayed.

6
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:28,719
And what a tremendous blessing this evening, as we have as our theme here for Mark 16 and verse 15,

7
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:31,440
the Bible, a very familiar verse of Scripture, and He said unto them,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,279
Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.

9
00:00:37,279 --> 00:00:41,599
We're familiar with that verse of Scripture. It's a verse of Scripture that is used often

10
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:46,880
with regard to the work of missions. Of course, the truth, as we would refer to this verse of

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,360
Scripture, is this is the Great Commission. We read it in the book of Matthew here in Mark. We

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,720
read it in Luke and John, also in the book of Acts. And we read that God has given us the Great

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,880
Commission. Someone wisely observed that the Great Commission is not an option to be considered,

14
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:09,360
but a command to be obeyed. Think about that. The Great Commission is not an option to be

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:18,879
considered. Rather, it is a command to be obeyed. And I like that quote. I like that thought.

16
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:24,720
And we need to fulfill our responsibility here to the Great Commission. I've titled the

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,040
message tonight, as you see in the bulletin there, Finding My Place in World Missions.

18
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:37,199
Finding my place. You say that yourself. I say that myself. Finding my place. Where is

19
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:43,440
my place in world missions? Do I have a place in world missions? The answer is yes.

20
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,199
And we need to find what our place is in world missions. And this evening, as we think about

21
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:53,599
the work of world missions, we think about the work of evangelism, the responsibility that we

22
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:59,199
have to reach the world with the gospel of Jesus Christ, we understand that this task that is

23
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:07,120
before us, that God has given us instruction with regard to completing the task. Not only has He

24
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:14,000
given us instruction with regard to completing the task, but I'm so thankful that He empowers us

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,399
to complete the task. This is a task that is beyond us. It is a task that we cannot, in our

26
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:28,080
power, in our own strength, we cannot complete this task. But in dependence upon the Lord,

27
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,720
we find that He will enable us to fulfill what He has called us to do. I'm thankful for the

28
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,720
opportunity that we have to be a light in this community. And as we look at the truth of world

29
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,679
missions and we think about the place that we have individually and then corporately as a church,

30
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:53,919
we find that we have a responsibility to reach our Jerusalem, and at the same time,

31
00:02:53,919 --> 00:03:01,039
to reach the uttermost as we have our map on the world, on our wall, the world map that reminds us

32
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:06,639
every time we come into this building, we're reminded about world missions. We see on this

33
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:13,679
side of the auditorium, send the light, and we sing that powerful gospel song of send the light,

34
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:19,039
the blessed gospel light. And then we see over here a map and all of the pictures and the

35
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,639
missions, and what a joy to think about the opportunity that we have to be engaged, to be

36
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,600
involved in world missions. I believe this evening that if you're here and you're saved,

37
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,440
that you have a place in world missions. We each have a place in world missions.

38
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:40,639
Let me just share with you three thoughts this evening. Number one, pray. Pray. We think about

39
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,199
world missions and I think what is my place, finding my place in world missions? I believe

40
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,880
it starts with prayer. I've said this many times over the years. Prayer is a distinct privilege to

41
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,520
the child of God. It is reserved for us as the people of God that we can go to the throne of

42
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:03,679
grace, that we can seek the very face of God, that we have many promises with regard to prayer,

43
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:11,759
that we have a God who hears and answers prayer. We hear that so often. We're so familiar with that

44
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:19,200
truth, but I hope this evening that we would stand in awe of that statement, that we recognize

45
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:25,920
how wonderful it is that we indeed have a God who hears and answers prayer. You think about the

46
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,679
billions of people around the globe that do not know the Lord Jesus Christ. They do not know

47
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:38,640
Jehovah God. They're serving some false deity, some idol, and they're praying and they're

48
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:46,399
seeking to appease, but they have a God, little g, that cannot hear. We have a God that hears us

49
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:55,119
and He answers. It's amazing to understand that truth. I wonder this evening as we think about

50
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:59,839
our place in world missions and we think about this aspect of prayer, I wonder this evening that

51
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:08,799
if we were to go and evaluate our prayer time and our daily time of prayer, is there a dedicated

52
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:16,000
time of prayer in our lives for world missions? Is it something that we consider? Think about this.

53
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,040
Turn to the book of Matthew, if you will, in chapter number 9. As we think about this place

54
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:27,519
in world missions, in fact, this is a place that every single child of God, we ought to, every

55
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:34,480
single one of us ought to be praying about world missions. We think about the truth, the statement

56
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,279
that is given here in Matthew 9 from the Lord Jesus Christ, the instruction from our Savior

57
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:45,119
with regard to prayer. And He says this in Matthew 9, in verse number 36, the Bible sets the scene

58
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:50,239
for us and it says, but when He, speaking of Jesus, saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion

59
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:55,359
on them. Why? Because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd.

60
00:05:55,359 --> 00:06:00,799
Then saith He unto His disciples, notice what He says, the harvest truly is plenteous, but the

61
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:08,559
labors are few. We know that to be the case. We see that this has been the case for many generations

62
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:14,079
and we find that Jesus gives this truth here in the passage of Scripture as He's speaking to the

63
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:21,200
disciples and He speaks about the harvest being plenteous, but the labors being few. I mentioned

64
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:28,480
to you before how many churches are without pastors, how many communities do not have churches,

65
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:34,959
how many mission fields, how many regions of the world, how many countries have no gospel witness,

66
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:42,880
and you think about the labors are few. Someone shared with me last week the number of churches

67
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,959
in their area in a radius of about 50 miles of churches that did not have pastors and it was

68
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:54,079
staggering. They're down in the south and so there's a lot more churches within the 50-mile

69
00:06:54,079 --> 00:07:00,239
radius of where they were located than maybe other parts of the nation, but it was staggering. So,

70
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:04,399
what does Jesus say to the disciples? We're familiar with the passage of Scripture, but let

71
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,239
me say this, being familiar with the passage of Scripture is a lot different than applying the

72
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:15,359
passage of Scripture. When I mention Matthew 9, 36-38, many of us tonight know the passage.

73
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,760
But when I say that Jesus said the labors are few, He said that the harvest is plenteous,

74
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,839
but the labors are few, we know what the next statement is that Jesus makes.

75
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:34,720
Pray. Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send forth laborers into His harvest.

76
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:41,519
And I just wonder this evening as we understand the truth of it, but when's the last time or how

77
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,079
often are we praying to the Lord of the harvest that He'd send forth laborers?

78
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:55,519
That we are actually fulfilling what Jesus said to us to do. Is the request of Jesus that He gave

79
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:00,880
to the disciples, is that part of my prayer life? Is that part of your prayer life? It ought to be.

80
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,640
Amen? It ought to be. We ought to be praying to the Lord of the harvest that He would send forth

81
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:15,040
laborers into His harvest. And as we pray that prayer, then we get to see God answer

82
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:20,880
that prayer, because God hears and answers prayer, and He answers specific prayer.

83
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:29,359
And I'd love to see God send forth a laborer from our congregation. Amen? I think it'd be wonderful,

84
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:37,280
and not called by the pastor or called by the parent, but called by God and answer that call

85
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,960
and go. That'd be wonderful. But if we're not praying to the Lord of the harvest that He'd

86
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,520
send forth laborers, why would we expect that someone would say, here am I, send me?

87
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,919
Think about the request of the Apostle Paul. Notice in Colossians chapter number four,

88
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:58,239
and I'll look at two references, the Apostle Paul actually on a number of occasion

89
00:08:58,239 --> 00:09:03,280
requested prayer with regard to the work of missions in Colossians four, in verses two

90
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,559
through four. Notice what Paul says. He says, continue in prayer and watch in the same with

91
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:15,919
thanksgiving. And then he directs them specifically with regard to a prayer request, really with regard

92
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:23,919
to the work of missions. With all praying also for us that God would open unto us a door of utterance

93
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:31,359
to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds, that I may make it manifest as I

94
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:39,359
ought to speak. Man, that we'd be praying for open doors. We'd be praying for those opportunities,

95
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:43,280
not only opportunities for ourselves, but opportunities for our brothers and sisters

96
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:48,479
in Christ, those that we attend church together, those that are church members together, that we're

97
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:54,719
praying that God would open doors of opportunity, that we're praying for our missionaries that God

98
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:59,919
would open doors of opportunity, doors of utterance. Notice what Paul says.

99
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,599
says in 2 Thessalonians, it's very similar

100
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:05,079
to what we read here in 2 Thessalonians 3.

101
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:07,339
It's interesting, in 1 Thessalonians in chapter five,

102
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:10,219
he simply says this, brethren, pray for us.

103
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:13,179
And it's a broad statement, and obviously,

104
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,899
the request of prayer and understanding

105
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:16,259
the importance of prayer.

106
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:17,959
But as he's writing to that same church

107
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:20,259
in 2 Thessalonians chapter number three,

108
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:21,859
beginning in verse number one, Paul says,

109
00:10:21,859 --> 00:10:23,939
finally, brethren, pray for us.

110
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:25,419
What does he ask that they pray for?

111
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:28,059
That the word of the Lord may have free course

112
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:31,019
and be glorified, even as it is with you,

113
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:33,459
and that we may be delivered from unreasonable

114
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:36,459
and wicked men, for all men have not faith.

115
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:39,859
Have you realized that truth of verse number two?

116
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:42,079
All men do not have faith.

117
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,119
And we pray that God would give deliverance

118
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:46,339
from unreasonable and wicked men.

119
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:49,899
You know, there are people that wanna silence the church.

120
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,339
They wanna silence the gospel from going forth.

121
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,859
But we pray, and we pray that as Paul says here,

122
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,059
that the word of the Lord may have free course.

123
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,419
I'm so thankful that as Paul is writing to Timothy,

124
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:05,619
he says, listen, I'm thankful that I'm bound,

125
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:08,139
but God's word is not bound.

126
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:09,639
Aren't you thankful for that?

127
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:12,899
What a blessing to think about the opportunity

128
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:16,099
that we have when we think about my place in world missions

129
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:17,979
for each and every one of us,

130
00:11:17,979 --> 00:11:21,539
prayer is part of my place in world missions.

131
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:25,099
And part of my prayer time daily ought to be,

132
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:28,419
there should be a dedicated time in my prayer time daily

133
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:30,779
with regard to the work of missions,

134
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,899
to reaching the world with the gospel of Jesus Christ.

135
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,259
I think of this number two, not only to pray,

136
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:39,219
but to give, to give.

137
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:41,499
Obviously, we understand that our missionaries,

138
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:44,659
it requires funds for them to be able to go to the field

139
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:47,199
and to serve in the capacity in which they're serving.

140
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:48,699
In fact, many of the missionaries,

141
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:52,579
if not all of them on our wall this evening,

142
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,259
you find that there's a few of them

143
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:55,179
that are in the United States,

144
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:56,819
and so it really wouldn't be applicable to them.

145
00:11:56,819 --> 00:11:59,579
But to those that are abroad in a different country,

146
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,379
most countries of the world,

147
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:04,659
before you enter into their nation as a missionary,

148
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:08,999
they require that there's some level of guarantee

149
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:11,339
that you are financially stable,

150
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,499
that you're not going to take from their economy.

151
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,419
So guess what that means?

152
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:18,619
That means missionaries come to a church like ours.

153
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:20,399
We know it, we have missionaries.

154
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,179
The Ballou family, they're gonna come next week.

155
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:23,779
They're gonna be in Idaho.

156
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:26,379
And so certainly they can get a job in America

157
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:29,179
because they're US citizens, but they're gonna go.

158
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:31,859
And what a blessing for them to have support

159
00:12:31,859 --> 00:12:34,899
for a couple of years that they won't have to work a job,

160
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:37,379
Lord willing, and be dedicated completely

161
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:41,399
to starting a church and not have that responsibility

162
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,619
of working a job and full-time

163
00:12:43,619 --> 00:12:45,979
and then trying to part-time pastor a church

164
00:12:45,979 --> 00:12:46,939
and start a church.

165
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:49,059
And man, the missionaries that come

166
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:53,559
that are going all over the world that we can give.

167
00:12:53,979 --> 00:12:55,699
So that they can be on the field,

168
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:58,119
so that they can serve, so they can do the work

169
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:00,139
that God has called them to.

170
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:01,939
We pray, but we give.

171
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:05,519
Giving financially to missions is separate from tithing.

172
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,619
It's just a separate thing.

173
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:10,619
And I say personally in my own life,

174
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:13,299
and I'm not saying this boastfully or pridefully,

175
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:16,059
but I am so thankful for the privilege

176
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:18,699
that we have to give to world missions.

177
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:22,139
We watch these missionary update letters, videos,

178
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,619
when we hear these missionary update letters

179
00:13:24,619 --> 00:13:26,339
and we hear about what God is doing

180
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,899
and how God is working, I understand that a part of that,

181
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:32,739
and it doesn't matter how small of a part of that,

182
00:13:32,739 --> 00:13:35,159
but a part of that is an investment

183
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:39,159
that personally I have made in world missions.

184
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,659
What a blessing.

185
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:45,659
What a privilege to give to the work of world missions

186
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,819
that we can take of the resources

187
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:50,579
that God has blessed us with,

188
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:52,379
and we can take those and we can say,

189
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:57,379
I'm going to specifically give these funds for missions,

190
00:13:57,739 --> 00:13:59,699
that the work of missions can go forward.

191
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:01,299
Think about this, turn to the book of Philippians,

192
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,459
if you will, in Philippians chapter number four,

193
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:07,819
it's a designated giving that is for a specific purpose,

194
00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:10,459
that of world missions.

195
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:12,259
In Philippians chapter number four,

196
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:15,259
I'm thankful that someone taught me many years ago,

197
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:17,559
not only about the truth of tithing,

198
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,959
but about the truth of giving to world missions,

199
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,959
and it has been a great joy in our lives,

200
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,279
the 20 plus years that Holly and I have been married,

201
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,599
and then even before we were married as an individual

202
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:32,639
to be able to give to the work of world missions.

203
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,239
Notice in Philippians four in verse number 14,

204
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:37,759
the Bible says, notwithstanding ye have well done

205
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:40,519
that ye did communicate with my affliction.

206
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,019
Now you Philippians know also

207
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:43,939
that in the beginning of the gospel,

208
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:45,839
when I departed from Macedonia,

209
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,439
no church communicated with me

210
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:49,699
as concerning giving and receiving,

211
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:51,779
but ye only, so Paul is commending them,

212
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:55,219
thanking them for their giving to the work of missions,

213
00:14:55,219 --> 00:14:57,519
we know that Paul went on three missionary journeys,

214
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,659
he was a, you study the book of Acts,

215
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:01,279
and you can see those missionary journeys,

216
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,539
and he says how you communicated with me,

217
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:06,459
with specifically, he says with giving and receiving,

218
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:08,859
notice in verse 16, for even in Thessalonica,

219
00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:12,099
ye sent once and again unto my necessity.

220
00:15:12,099 --> 00:15:16,179
But notice what he says, not because I desire a gift,

221
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:20,859
but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.

222
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:25,379
Now listen, God's economy is different than our economy,

223
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:27,079
and God has designed it such,

224
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:28,419
so often people wanna talk about

225
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:30,099
what's the return on my investment,

226
00:15:30,099 --> 00:15:33,179
the return on investment in missions is out of this world,

227
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:35,579
and I don't say that just tongue in cheek to be funny,

228
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:39,039
but the reality is that it is an eternal return.

229
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:43,219
When you think about that return on that investment,

230
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:45,879
and Paul says, listen, I'm not desiring a gift,

231
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:48,279
but I'm desiring, listen, that fruit

232
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,759
that may abound to your account,

233
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,279
and somehow, in God's economy, he has designed it,

234
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:57,239
and determined that as we give to world missions,

235
00:15:57,239 --> 00:16:00,119
as an individual, as we give to world missions,

236
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:03,119
and the work of missions is done,

237
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:06,839
then at some level, there's a blessing for us

238
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,839
in what is being done, it's amazing.

239
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,439
It's fruit that would abound to our account.

240
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:16,479
It says in verse number 18,

241
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:18,239
but I have all and abound, I am full,

242
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:20,199
having received of Epaphroditus

243
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:21,559
the things which were sent from you,

244
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:24,999
an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable,

245
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:26,279
well-pleasing to God.

246
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,079
What great truth in verse number 18

247
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,979
that it is a sacrifice, and certainly,

248
00:16:31,979 --> 00:16:34,079
there are times in which we make sacrifice

249
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,599
in giving to God with regard to this thing of missions,

250
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:42,639
and Paul says it is a sacrifice that's acceptable,

251
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:45,159
and it's well-pleasing to God.

252
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:50,319
So often, this promise of verse 19 of Philippians 4

253
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:51,959
is really taken out of context,

254
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,639
but really, the context of this promise

255
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,859
is with regard to giving to world missions.

256
00:16:57,859 --> 00:16:59,519
Notice what he says in verse number 19,

257
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,379
but my God shall supply all your need

258
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:06,719
according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.

259
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:10,439
How much do we give to missions?

260
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:11,639
Pray and ask God.

261
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:14,599
I don't have a formula.

262
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:18,039
I know what a tithe is, it's easy to calculate.

263
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,559
Really, it is, right, it's pretty simple.

264
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,119
Missions, there's nothing that's in the word of God

265
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,879
that says here's how much of your income

266
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,359
you're to give to missions,

267
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,199
but can I tell you that as you give to missions,

268
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:35,939
God will bless, and you'll be able to see

269
00:17:35,939 --> 00:17:38,999
that this is an eternal investment.

270
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:42,199
I believe that every single person,

271
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:43,599
every single child of God

272
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,759
ought to be involved in giving to missions.

273
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:47,599
I just believe that.

274
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,079
I believe that as we come to that place

275
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,439
and say, well, things are tight,

276
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:56,439
just start with a dollar, honestly,

277
00:17:56,439 --> 00:18:01,439
just do something, and see God bless, and see God work.

278
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,599
We think about the, sometimes we have this perspective

279
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:09,759
that we can't do much, so we do nothing at all,

280
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,439
but the reality is little is much when God is in it.

281
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:18,579
The reality is that when Jesus saw those people giving,

282
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:22,859
he says of this widow that cast in really the least,

283
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:25,499
he said that she gave more than they did.

284
00:18:25,499 --> 00:18:26,339
Why?

285
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,799
Because they all gave out of their abundance,

286
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,399
but she gave everything that she had.

287
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:35,479
It's just that God's ways are not our ways,

288
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:37,200
and so as we have an opportunity, we say,

289
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,419
God, I don't have much, but what I have,

290
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:42,099
I'm gonna invest it in missions,

291
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:45,059
and I'm gonna seek to be involved in giving.

292
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,739
I'm gonna pray.

293
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:48,179
I'm gonna give.

294
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:51,299
And then finally this evening, I would say go.

295
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,260
Look at Acts 1 and verse number eight.

296
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,619
I mentioned that the Great Commission,

297
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:57,739
as we started this evening in Mark 16,

298
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:00,419
is given in each of the four Gospels,

299
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:01,820
and then also in the book of Acts.

300
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,940
In Acts 1 and verse number eight,

301
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,219
we find that the Bible speaks and gives us here

302
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:09,579
the record of the Great Commission.

303
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:13,339
In Acts 1 and verse number eight, Jesus says,

304
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:15,299
that you shall receive power,

305
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,339
after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you,

306
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:19,700
and I'm thankful that he enables us

307
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,099
for the work of missions.

308
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:24,419
It says that ye shall be witnesses unto me,

309
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:26,859
both in Jerusalem, and I'm gonna stop there.

310
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:28,339
We'll get to the rest in just a moment,

311
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:30,659
because when I speak of going,

312
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:33,059
first it starts locally,

313
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:37,579
as coworkers together in reaching the world

314
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:39,500
with the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

315
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,779
I know I've said this before,

316
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,299
but it's worth repeating this evening.

317
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:43,979
If you were to go and look at our missions map,

318
00:19:43,979 --> 00:19:47,059
if you push every single tile on that wall

319
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:48,579
and see every single light,

320
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:49,739
if you push the red button

321
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:51,260
and see them all light up at one time,

322
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,899
you will not find a light,

323
00:19:53,899 --> 00:19:57,059
you will not find a tile of missionaries

324
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:58,419
to Oakton, Virginia.

325
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:00,179
Why?

326
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:03,419
because we're the missionaries to Oakden, Virginia.

327
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,599
We're the missionaries to Fairfax.

328
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:07,719
We're the missionaries to Vienna.

329
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:08,719
We are the missionaries.

330
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:13,719
We are the light that God has placed in this community.

331
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:16,399
And we take that responsibility

332
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:18,939
and we need to take that responsibility seriously

333
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:21,079
and we need to understand that we have a responsibility

334
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,399
to go locally.

335
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,719
And as we go locally, what does that look like?

336
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:29,039
We know that we have coworkers, we have neighbors,

337
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,919
there are friends, there are people that we interact with,

338
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,719
there are people at the store.

339
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:36,959
Ms. Joyce shared with us a testimony on Wednesday evening

340
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:39,959
about the worker there at Wegmans

341
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:42,279
that she gave some gospel literature to.

342
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:45,199
You think about doctors and nurses and appointments

343
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:47,879
and auto care, all of those types of things.

344
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:51,319
Wherever our daily routine takes us,

345
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,979
there's opportunity for us to go.

346
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:55,159
Someone said this,

347
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:58,599
being a missionary doesn't require crossing a sea.

348
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,819
Sometimes it's just crossing the street.

349
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:04,939
Sometimes we have the idea of being a missionary

350
00:21:04,939 --> 00:21:07,439
is that we go to some foreign land

351
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:10,679
that has a different culture and a different language

352
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:12,519
and a different time zone

353
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,399
and that means that we're a missionary.

354
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:17,799
The reality is that we're a missionary here.

355
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:19,439
God's called us.

356
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:23,039
God's given us a responsibility to let our light so shine,

357
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:28,719
not just locally, but we think about the aspect of globally.

358
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:30,839
It says, and you shall be witnesses unto me.

359
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:33,999
That word both is significant

360
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:36,799
because really the idea in Acts 1A,

361
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,919
when he says both in Jerusalem and all Judea

362
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,239
and then Samaria and to the uttermost part of the earth,

363
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:45,919
that word carries with the idea is at the same time.

364
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,099
So we're to be reaching our Jerusalem

365
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,759
at the same time of reaching Judea, Samaria

366
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:51,839
and the uttermost.

367
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:54,519
And we understand the region geographically

368
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,159
with the nation of Israel

369
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,519
and you understand the early church there in Jerusalem

370
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:01,519
and you understand the geographic implication

371
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,799
of what Jesus is saying to these disciples.

372
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:05,879
And then if we would by application

373
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:08,319
take that and apply it for us this evening

374
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:09,919
and we understand that our Jerusalem,

375
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,959
as I mentioned just a moment ago, is our locale.

376
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:12,919
It's our region.

377
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:14,359
It's where we are.

378
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:16,759
And then you just keep making a circle bigger and bigger

379
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:19,339
until you encircle the whole globe.

380
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:22,259
And that's the uttermost part of the earth

381
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:25,019
as verse number eight ends.

382
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:27,019
And so this evening when we think about praying

383
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:29,019
and giving and going and we say,

384
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:31,139
I wanna find my place in world missions.

385
00:22:31,139 --> 00:22:32,899
God, I want you to use me.

386
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:35,939
I want you to use me in this area of world missions,

387
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:39,379
of reaching people with the gospel of Jesus Christ.

388
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:41,219
God, I'm gonna make a commitment

389
00:22:41,219 --> 00:22:44,299
to pray specifically about missions.

390
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:48,459
That I'm gonna carve out some time daily, weekly

391
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:50,459
to pray about missions.

392
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:53,739
I'm gonna pray that request that Jesus gave

393
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,739
that we would pray to the Lord of the harvest

394
00:22:55,739 --> 00:22:59,819
that he would send forth laborers into his harvest.

395
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:00,899
I'm gonna give.

396
00:23:01,899 --> 00:23:02,899
I'm gonna give.

397
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:06,419
And God, I'm gonna go.

398
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,699
I'm gonna go locally.

399
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:10,379
But then I'd say this,

400
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:13,839
I ought to be willing to go wherever he calls me to go.

401
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:15,939
Amen?

402
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:23,299
I was at BIMI last week and someone gave the testimony

403
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,379
about the oldest person that they knew

404
00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:31,059
that surrendered to missions and went through BIMI.

405
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:33,859
Nearly 65 years old.

406
00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:35,979
I said, wow.

407
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:38,259
That's encouraging.

408
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:41,500
Because you know what someone decided?

409
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,819
Whoever that, I don't know who the person is.

410
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:44,299
I have no idea who they are.

411
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:47,259
I didn't ask, I wouldn't ask.

412
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:49,299
But you know what they did?

413
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:50,819
They were just willing to go.

414
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:53,739
It's like Isaiah, here am I, send me.

415
00:23:53,739 --> 00:23:57,579
I think really all of us should have that perspective.

416
00:23:57,579 --> 00:24:00,859
God's not gonna call all of us to go somewhere globally.

417
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:02,739
But he might.

418
00:24:04,139 --> 00:24:08,059
It's amazing as I consider the work of world missions.

419
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:10,699
We're gonna watch these videos here in just a few minutes.

420
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,979
And as we look at these videos,

421
00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:16,739
I want you to think about what God is doing

422
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:18,139
and how God is working.

423
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:23,619
The Thomas family in Ukraine, we'll watch a video from them.

424
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:26,299
The Vallis family down in the Turks and Caicos Islands,

425
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,139
we'll watch a video from them.

426
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:30,579
The Clement family over in Liverpool, England,

427
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:32,459
watch a video from them.

428
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:34,179
And then the last, I don't know if I got them in the order.

429
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:36,979
However the order is, is fine that you do back there, bud.

430
00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:39,299
But the fourth family is the McKinney family,

431
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:41,459
serving the Lord in Bolivia.

432
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:45,019
I want you to think about those servants of the Lord.

433
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,899
They found what their place was in world missions.

434
00:24:49,899 --> 00:24:51,859
And say, God, I wanna know what my place is

435
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:53,660
in world missions.

436
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,299
I wanna do, God, what you want me to do.

437
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:58,820
I wanna pray, give.

438
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,019
God, I'm willing to go.

439
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:04,220
Pray that maybe God would raise someone up

440
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,419
from within our congregation.

441
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:08,139
What a blessing.

442
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:11,299
What a tremendous blessing to have the privilege

443
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:13,979
of being able to be the sending church

444
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:16,500
of someone that goes into world missions.

445
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,380
It's exciting.

446
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,859
What is my place in world missions?

447
00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:22,660
Father, we love you.

448
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,660
We thank you for loving us.

449
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,179
We thank you for the opportunity

450
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:28,779
to have service this evening.

451
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:33,660
As we've briefly considered this thought

452
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,739
of finding my place in world missions,

453
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:38,299
I pray, God, that you've used your word

454
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:39,859
in the hearts of your people.

455
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:42,459
And that we take a few moments

456
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:44,419
before we watch these videos

457
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,059
to truly evaluate our own lives.

458
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:54,739
To evaluate our level of surrender.

459
00:25:54,739 --> 00:25:57,660
I know often we sing, I surrender all.

460
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:03,899
God, that we would evaluate our prayer lives.

461
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:09,820
That we would evaluate specifically our giving to missions.

462
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,539
Not our tithing, but our giving to missions.

463
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,619
That we would evaluate this evening

464
00:26:17,899 --> 00:26:20,619
our obedience to the Great Commission.

465
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:22,899
Would you move and work as only you can

466
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:25,739
in these few moments of invitation.

467
00:26:25,739 --> 00:26:27,259
We'll thank you for all that you'll do

468
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:29,139
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

469
00:26:29,139 --> 00:26:30,899
Would you stand with me?

470
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:32,179
We'll have a brief invitation

471
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:33,940
before we watch the videos this evening.

472
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,259
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

473
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:37,779
Maybe you just need to come to this altar tonight

474
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:39,660
and pray and ask the Lord to help you.

475
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,100
Maybe God spoke to you specifically

476
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:44,220
about something from his word

477
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,899
with regard to your place in world missions.

478
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:49,100
The altar is open as Kimberly plays.
