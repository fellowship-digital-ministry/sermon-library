1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Number one, 2 Timothy chapter number one,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,099
we finished last week, 1 Timothy.

3
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:10,720
And of course, our theme for this calendar year is continue.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,779
And we have had this theme throughout the year.

5
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:17,680
In fact, even for our missions conference this year,

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,200
we kept the same theme

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,159
because we wanna keep ingrained in our minds

8
00:00:22,159 --> 00:00:24,319
the importance of continuing

9
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:26,959
and to continue to serve the Lord,

10
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:29,959
to remain faithful in the midst of opposition

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,080
and adversity and all that we would face,

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,180
that our eyes are on Jesus,

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,639
we're looking unto Jesus,

14
00:00:35,639 --> 00:00:37,799
the author and finisher of our faith.

15
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:40,520
We find that the apostle Paul is used of God

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,520
in 1 and 2 Timothy to encourage his son in the faith,

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,880
as he's referred to, to continue.

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,520
And he tells them in this particular book

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,959
in 2 Timothy, we'll get there in a few,

20
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:55,360
probably a couple of months,

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,080
in 2 Timothy chapter number three,

22
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,240
he tells them about the last days that we're living in

23
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,599
and the perilous times

24
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:04,620
and all the characteristics of those days.

25
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,639
And he says that evil men and seducers

26
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:09,160
shall wax worse and worse,

27
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,720
deceiving and being deceived,

28
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,360
but continue and don't give up,

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,419
don't throw in the towel,

30
00:01:17,419 --> 00:01:20,400
continue, remain steadfast, unmovable,

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,440
always abounding in the work of the Lord.

32
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,279
Why?

33
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:27,919
For we know that our labor is not in vain in the Lord.

34
00:01:27,919 --> 00:01:31,000
And what a joy, as we enter into the second book,

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,800
the second letter, 2 Timothy chapter number one,

36
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,360
we'll just be looking at two verses this morning.

37
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,239
And we note the similarities and the greetings

38
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:42,879
in 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and also in the book of Titus.

39
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,599
These three books or three letters

40
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,400
are often referred to as the pastoral epistles.

41
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,760
We think about these three particular letters

42
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:56,120
and we find that as Paul would have it,

43
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,120
of course, all scripture is given by inspiration of God,

44
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,680
but as Paul would be writing to Timothy and to Titus,

45
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,800
he refers to both of them as being his son.

46
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,080
Now, they're not his son biologically or physically,

47
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,779
but we understand that spiritually speaking,

48
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:17,360
the apostle Paul had a great relationship

49
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,919
with both Timothy and Titus.

50
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,720
I believe that that relationship

51
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,199
with these younger servants of the Lord

52
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:27,440
was both special and unique.

53
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,839
I believe that the apostle Paul in his heart

54
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:34,279
had a special place for Timothy and for Titus.

55
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:38,720
And I think that Titus and Timothy also held in their heart

56
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,240
a special place for Paul and all the influence

57
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,360
that he had upon their lives.

58
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,360
In fact, it's interesting to note how Paul,

59
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,880
yes, he encourages many that he writes to

60
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:53,679
with regard to how he's praying for them,

61
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:55,759
but I think about these individuals,

62
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,460
Timothy and Titus engaged in the work of the ministry

63
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,460
as pastors that God would use Paul to encourage them

64
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:09,419
and to remind them that he's praying for them.

65
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:12,139
And what a tremendous blessing that is.

66
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:14,360
Paul, of course, through these two books,

67
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,759
specifically dealing with the life and ministry of Timothy,

68
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:22,320
Paul would be used of the Lord to both instruct

69
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,059
and encourage Timothy.

70
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:27,000
We find that he'll be used of the Lord

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,800
in the book of Titus to, again,

72
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,600
both instruct and encourage Titus.

73
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,039
But what was Paul's desire?

74
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:37,479
I believe that Paul desired that these men,

75
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:40,279
that Timothy, in the context of what we're looking at

76
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:41,800
this calendar year,

77
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,419
that Timothy would serve the Lord faithfully,

78
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:49,779
that Timothy would serve God all the days of his life,

79
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:53,339
that he would be able to say, as Paul will say

80
00:03:53,339 --> 00:03:56,020
in this particular letter in the fourth chapter,

81
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,339
that I have finished.

82
00:03:57,339 --> 00:04:01,460
I've come to the end and I fought a good fight.

83
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,580
I kept the faith and what a joy.

84
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,880
And I believe that that's Paul's desire.

85
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,720
So Paul, understanding all of the circumstances

86
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,639
of what was taking place at Ephesus

87
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,979
with regard to the false teaching

88
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,140
and all of the opposition

89
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,220
that Timothy would be dealing with,

90
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,700
God understands that as well.

91
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,000
And therefore, God would send and use Paul

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,760
to write these letters to be a blessing

93
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,899
and an encouragement to Timothy.

94
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:33,739
We find that this letter that is before us this morning

95
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:38,019
is the final letter that we have of the Apostle Paul.

96
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:42,940
We do not know with certainty how many weeks, months

97
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,059
took place between the writing of this letter

98
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:48,179
and Paul's death.

99
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:51,140
But we know that it was within this short period of time

100
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,239
that after Paul wrote this letter,

101
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:55,619
that Paul would face a martyr's death,

102
00:04:55,619 --> 00:04:59,260
that he would die for his faith in Christ Jesus.

103
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,739
And as we look at this passage,

104
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:02,619
notice with me in chapter one,

105
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:04,579
we're just gonna look at verses one and two.

106
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:05,500
The Bible says this,

107
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,820
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ,

108
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,059
by the will of God,

109
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:15,140
according to the promise of life,

110
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,739
which is in Christ Jesus,

111
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:23,540
to Timothy, my dearly beloved son,

112
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,920
grace, mercy, and peace

113
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,920
from God the Father and Christ Jesus, our Lord.

114
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:35,220
If you've looked at the back of the bulletin

115
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,100
already this morning,

116
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,640
I've simply titled the message

117
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,179
from verse number two this morning,

118
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:43,059
grace, mercy, and peace.

119
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:45,019
I mean, just the sound of those words

120
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:47,619
brings a measure of encouragement, does it?

121
00:05:47,619 --> 00:05:49,679
And we think about this truth

122
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:52,660
and what Paul is giving to Timothy here.

123
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,899
And I just have two thoughts for you this morning,

124
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:57,100
but remember, just because there's two points

125
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,940
doesn't mean it's gonna be any shorter.

126
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,440
And first point this morning, if you're taking notes,

127
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,579
the first thought is this,

128
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:05,859
notice what Paul acknowledged.

129
00:06:05,859 --> 00:06:08,380
As we look at these two verses of scripture,

130
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,320
we find that Paul acknowledged some things

131
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,100
that are important not only for Paul,

132
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,579
they're important for Timothy,

133
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:17,660
but they're important for each of us as well.

134
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,220
As the people of God,

135
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,700
there are some things that we must acknowledge

136
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,019
or recognize.

137
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:25,299
And we find in the text of scripture,

138
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:29,899
number one, that Paul acknowledged the authority of God.

139
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:31,299
Notice in verse number one,

140
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:35,619
the Bible says Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ,

141
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:37,899
by the will of God.

142
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,260
And we find that the apostle Paul,

143
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,179
he understood who he was,

144
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:46,059
and he understood who God is.

145
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:48,359
I believe that if we begin to understand

146
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:51,459
how that Paul acknowledges the authority of God,

147
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:55,179
even in the greeting that he writes to Timothy,

148
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:58,380
that it's crucial, it's absolutely imperative,

149
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,160
it is critical for every child of God

150
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,859
to acknowledge God's authority in our lives.

151
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:09,940
See, the reality is that we have this society

152
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,700
and this culture has almost ingrained

153
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,619
in the minds of people that you are your own authority

154
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:19,140
and you are the one that determines

155
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,899
and you make the decision.

156
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,739
But as a child of God,

157
00:07:22,739 --> 00:07:25,779
I understand that Paul says to the believers in Corinth

158
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,299
in chapter number six of the first letter he writes them

159
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:29,700
in first Corinthians six,

160
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,540
what?

161
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,220
Know ye not that what?

162
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,540
Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost,

163
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,739
which is in you what you have of God,

164
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:41,940
and ye are not your own,

165
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,459
for you are bought with a price.

166
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:45,940
Therefore, we're to glorify God.

167
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,779
How?

168
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:50,540
In every way, in every part of my being,

169
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,299
I am to glorify God.

170
00:07:52,299 --> 00:07:53,140
Why?

171
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,079
Because he owns me.

172
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:56,420
It's a matter of authority.

173
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,339
It's a matter of ownership.

174
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:01,299
And we find this morning as we look at this truth

175
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:02,579
as the apostle Paul,

176
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:05,700
he's acknowledged the authority of God in his life.

177
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,260
Understand with me that the apostle Paul,

178
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,179
before his name was ever Paul,

179
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:12,779
we know him as Saul.

180
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:15,339
And we understand that Saul was a man

181
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:17,059
that was a religious man.

182
00:08:17,059 --> 00:08:20,220
Saul was a man that knew the Old Testament.

183
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,679
I mean, he was trained by the best of the best.

184
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:26,859
He was extremely familiar with Judaism

185
00:08:26,859 --> 00:08:28,339
and all of its ins and outs.

186
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:30,380
And he was a religious man,

187
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,940
but as he's going and persecuting

188
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,979
and giving consent to the death of Stephen

189
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:37,419
and all that he's doing,

190
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,059
he has letters in his hand.

191
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,539
He has the authority that he could go

192
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:47,059
and put to death to imprison any that be of this way

193
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,539
or of that way, that being Christians.

194
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:53,500
We find that the apostle Paul,

195
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,700
at that point, his name is Saul.

196
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,419
He meets Jesus.

197
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:01,739
In Acts chapter number nine, it's recorded for us.

198
00:09:01,739 --> 00:09:04,299
The Bible says that he sees this bright light

199
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:05,900
and he hears a voice.

200
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,739
And the voice is, Saul, Saul,

201
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:12,460
why persecutest thou me?

202
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,940
And we find that Saul answers and says,

203
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,179
who art thou, Lord?

204
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:24,820
I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest.

205
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,919
It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.

206
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,119
There was a measure of conviction

207
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:31,799
that was coming in Saul's life.

208
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:34,840
And then Saul follows up the question

209
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,559
of who art thou, Lord, with this,

210
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:40,840
Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?

211
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,200
Isn't that amazing?

212
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,559
To consider immediately upon salvation

213
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:48,559
how the apostle Paul, in that moment,

214
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,400
he acknowledged, he recognized the authority of God

215
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,919
in his life that he's going with a certain purpose,

216
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,599
with a certain agenda.

217
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:59,799
But his life is transformed.

218
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,239
If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.

219
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:04,539
Old things are passed away.

220
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:06,439
Behold, all things are become new.

221
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:10,159
And we find that this man, after his conversion,

222
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:16,579
he says, Lord, what will Thou have me to do?

223
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:19,919
He did not say, now, Lord, here's what I plan to do.

224
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,519
He didn't say, now, Lord, here's my ability.

225
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,879
Here's my talent.

226
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:27,679
Here's how you, God, can use me.

227
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:33,639
No, he said, Lord, what will Thou have me to do?

228
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:38,119
Now, God used the apostle Paul in a mighty way.

229
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:42,399
God used Paul to establish churches and regions

230
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,719
where the gospel had not yet been.

231
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:48,159
He used Paul to stand before leaders,

232
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,039
both religious and political, and to profess

233
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,639
the gospel of Jesus Christ.

234
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,399
But I believe that no matter, as we look at the life of Paul,

235
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,279
I believe that no matter what God would have assigned him

236
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,239
to do, he would have willingly done it.

237
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:05,719
Why?

238
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:08,279
Because he recognized God's authority.

239
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:12,119
I believe this morning that when you and when

240
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:16,479
I acknowledge God's authority in our lives,

241
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:18,959
that it will have a great impact.

242
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,879
It will change the direction of our lives.

243
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:25,719
Shortly after I got saved as a senior in high school,

244
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,759
I mean, I was just a couple of days

245
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,519
into my senior year of high school

246
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,479
when I trusted Christ as my Savior,

247
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:34,639
when my life was changed radically

248
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,479
by the truth of being born again.

249
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:40,719
And my pastor at that time, you know,

250
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:43,039
as a senior in high school, typically,

251
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,919
you've already been thinking about what you're

252
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,639
going to do with your life.

253
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,959
You've already considered the colleges

254
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,519
that you potentially are going to attend,

255
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,999
and perhaps even the majors that you're

256
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:55,519
interested in pursuing.

257
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,999
And I'd had those conversations, and I'd

258
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:01,919
had those ambitions, and what have you.

259
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,719
And I remember my pastor saying something like this

260
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:08,879
after I got saved.

261
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,159
He said, now, Chris, what does God

262
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:15,839
want you to do with your life?

263
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,719
You know, up until that point in my life,

264
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:21,119
no one had ever asked me that question.

265
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,599
You know, the question that I heard so often is,

266
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:27,639
what do you want to do with your life?

267
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:29,719
And if we're not careful, sometimes we still

268
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:31,159
ask young people that question.

269
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:33,039
Hey, what are you going to do with your life?

270
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,879
What do you want to do with your life?

271
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,999
Can I tell you, if we're saved by the grace of God,

272
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:40,799
the best question is not, what do I want to do with my life?

273
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,039
It's, what does God want me to do with my life?

274
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:48,079
We must acknowledge this morning God's authority.

275
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,479
I believe that the Apostle Paul recognized

276
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,199
and he acknowledged that God has authority in his life.

277
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:57,119
When God opens a door, Paul goes forward.

278
00:12:57,119 --> 00:12:59,399
When God shuts a door, Paul waits.

279
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,039
Paul understands God's authority.

280
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,239
By the way, it is far better for God

281
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:08,639
to have the authority in your life

282
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,479
than for you to have the authority in your life.

283
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:14,079
Sometimes we want to hold on to that authority,

284
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,599
that power, and think that we have control,

285
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:19,199
but you know, oftentimes we end up shipwrecked.

286
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,559
In fact, that's what Paul spoke of

287
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,159
in the book of 1 Timothy.

288
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:26,719
We talked about those that were shipwrecked.

289
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:29,239
And the reality is that it's far better

290
00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:31,999
to let God have control.

291
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:34,119
Perhaps some of you have seen the bumper sticker

292
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:37,079
that says, God is my co-pilot.

293
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,519
Can I tell you this morning, God better be your pilot.

294
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,999
Amen?

295
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:43,359
God better be your pilot.

296
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:45,879
He has all the authority in your life.

297
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:48,479
That's true of every child of God.

298
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:51,519
We mention even at times with pastors

299
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,359
moving from one place to another,

300
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:55,439
or missionaries moving from one place

301
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:56,679
of ministry to another.

302
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:00,039
Listen, God is God, and he is the authority.

303
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,599
And if God tells us to move, we better move.

304
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:05,439
If God tells us to stay, we better stay.

305
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:07,279
Because God is the authority.

306
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:10,519
And that's true of every child of God.

307
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,959
I've heard people say, I'm gonna move.

308
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:13,919
I'm gonna move here, I'm gonna go do this.

309
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,440
Are you sure that's what God wants you to do?

310
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,159
I'm not God, I can't tell you,

311
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,399
but I better encourage you and counsel you

312
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:24,359
to know that it's the will of God.

313
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:26,839
God's authority.

314
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:29,919
See, we find that Paul first acknowledged

315
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,679
the authority of God in his life.

316
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,679
Number two, Paul acknowledged God's will for his life.

317
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:39,479
Notice in verse number one, he says,

318
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:43,639
Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God.

319
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,879
And so we find that there's an acknowledgement

320
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,319
of God's authority.

321
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:52,319
God is sovereign and God has the right.

322
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,199
And we find that Paul also acknowledged

323
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,199
what God's will was for his life.

324
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:02,239
He says that his will, he's an apostle of Jesus Christ

325
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:04,720
by the will of God.

326
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,000
Can you understand with me just for a moment this morning

327
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,199
that the apostle Paul did not submit an application

328
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:11,479
to be an apostle.

329
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:14,839
He did not submit an application with the resume

330
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:16,199
and he came to the, no.

331
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:19,239
We find that it was the Lord's will

332
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:22,000
that Paul be an apostle.

333
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,879
And we find that Paul embraced that, why?

334
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:26,759
Because he understood authority.

335
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,379
Because of understanding the authority,

336
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:33,959
it's no problem accepting the will of God for our lives.

337
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:37,879
Because if I do not understand the authority of God,

338
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:41,079
if you do not understand the authority of God,

339
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:43,839
it's gonna be really difficult to accept

340
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,000
and acknowledge the will of God.

341
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:51,039
We start with acknowledging the authority of God.

342
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,639
It's interesting here in 2 Timothy chapter one,

343
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,559
he says Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ

344
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,759
by the will of God.

345
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,259
If you turn back a few pages in your Bible

346
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:03,519
and look at the beginning,

347
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,799
the introduction to the book of 1 Timothy,

348
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,500
I want you to notice how Paul references it here

349
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,119
in 1 Timothy.

350
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:16,079
He says this in 1 Timothy one and verse number one,

351
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,679
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ.

352
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:20,979
So we understand his office.

353
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:23,440
He says in chapter, in the second letter,

354
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,479
by the will of God, here he says,

355
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:29,000
by the commandment of God.

356
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,839
It's kind of interesting.

357
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,879
He uses in the first letter, the commandment of God

358
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:35,239
and the second letter, the will of God.

359
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:38,399
Do you know that God's commandment to you and to me

360
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,239
is God's will?

361
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:43,500
And God's will for you and I is his commandment.

362
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,159
They really can be used synonymously.

363
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:51,459
And we understand this morning that God gave a command

364
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:54,599
and Paul understood that command

365
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:58,279
to be also God's will for his life.

366
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:01,720
And what a joy to think about the apostle Paul

367
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,720
fulfilling what God had desired for him to do.

368
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,959
Listen to me this morning,

369
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,079
God's will is not simply revealed to me

370
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,279
or to you so that we could consider it.

371
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,199
God's will is revealed to us so that we would fulfill it.

372
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:20,399
God's will is not something that's open for consideration.

373
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:23,559
Far too often though, that's how we deal with it.

374
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:26,199
Well, I'll consider that, I'll think about that.

375
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:28,479
Maybe we even say, I'll pray about that.

376
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:32,319
But when God makes his will clear to us,

377
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:35,199
it is not something for me to simply consider,

378
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:38,479
to think over, no, it is for me to fulfill,

379
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:40,479
for me to simply obey.

380
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:44,239
By the way, it's a joy to know

381
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:46,839
that you're doing what God wants you to do.

382
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:50,000
It is an absolute joy to know that you're in the very place

383
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,859
where God wants you to be doing what God wants you to do.

384
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,519
We find here this morning that understanding

385
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,720
the authority of God helps me to obey the will of God.

386
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,639
And Paul acknowledged in these first few words

387
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:06,679
of the second letter to Timothy,

388
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:10,239
that he's an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God.

389
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:12,039
How does this help Timothy?

390
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:15,739
Well, Timothy had a position as well.

391
00:18:15,739 --> 00:18:18,720
Timothy had to understand God's authority as well.

392
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,479
And as Paul is seeking to encourage his son in the faith

393
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:25,940
who's dealing with adversity and opposition in Ephesus,

394
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,799
Paul reminds him of what he personally

395
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:31,079
had acknowledged in his life.

396
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:33,519
By the way, Paul faced much persecution

397
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,080
and adversity as well.

398
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,000
What kept him going?

399
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,080
God's authority and God's will.

400
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,479
Because he knew that God had authority in his life

401
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:46,080
and he knew the will of God.

402
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,440
And therefore he continued to do

403
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,559
what God had commanded him to do.

404
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:55,159
How would Timothy be able to continue in Ephesus?

405
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:58,080
How would Timothy be able to come to the end of his life

406
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,000
and say, as Paul will say in the fourth chapter,

407
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,640
I have finished, I have completed,

408
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:08,159
I have fulfilled what God had for me to do.

409
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,399
How could Timothy in the midst of the opposition

410
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:13,760
and the adversity, well, Timothy,

411
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,760
he better understand and acknowledge the authority of God.

412
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:22,519
And he better understand and acknowledge the will of God.

413
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:23,919
Listen, God's will doesn't change

414
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,559
just because there's some opposition.

415
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,559
We don't just run in the face of adversity or opposition.

416
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,019
No, if we're doing the will of God,

417
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,739
we continue, we remain steadfast, why?

418
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:40,700
Because we're doing the will of God.

419
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:43,380
And Timothy had to understand that.

420
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,619
Let me say to you this morning

421
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:48,019
that we too must understand this truth.

422
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:50,700
We must acknowledge God's authority.

423
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,899
Who's the authority in your life?

424
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:54,779
Honestly, who's the authority in your life?

425
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:56,419
Who's the authority in my life?

426
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,419
God is the ultimate authority.

427
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:06,299
authority in our lives and we must acknowledge that this morning. What is God's will for your life?

428
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:11,319
Do you know God's will? Are you doing God's will? Are you fulfilling the will of God?

429
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:16,259
I'll tell you this morning that at times no doubt the will of God can be a scary thing.

430
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:21,699
I mean when God first called me to preach, I thought you got the wrong guy. Like that's not for me.

431
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:23,699
That's not something I'm interested in doing.

432
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:26,819
But the question kept coming back.

433
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:29,939
What does God want you to do?

434
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:36,899
What is God's will? He acknowledges something else in this text of scripture. Notice with me number three.

435
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:40,659
The Apostle Paul acknowledged that God is the source

436
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:43,059
of grace,

437
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:44,179
mercy,

438
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:45,459
and peace.

439
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:49,299
The Bible says in verse number two to Timothy, my dearly beloved son,

440
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:51,219
grace,

441
00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:52,179
mercy,

442
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:53,539
and peace.

443
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:55,539
From God the Father

444
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:58,019
and Christ Jesus,

445
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:00,259
our Lord.

446
00:21:00,499 --> 00:21:02,019
Grace,

447
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:03,379
mercy,

448
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:05,059
and peace.

449
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:11,399
We understand as we speak about grace and the unmerited favor, love, and favor of God. We understand

450
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:14,259
grace. We sing about amazing grace.

451
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:20,339
We talk about saving grace and no doubt for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves

452
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:26,259
is the gift of God, not of works lest any man should boast. And we understand being

453
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:32,419
saved by grace, but we acknowledge this morning that Paul is writing to a saved man.

454
00:21:32,739 --> 00:21:38,099
He's writing to Timothy, his own son in the faith that's saved. He's going to heaven.

455
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:40,579
He's been born again. He's a child of the king,

456
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:43,139
but he says grace.

457
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:46,659
We look in the scriptures and we find that not only

458
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:50,499
is there saving grace, but there's serving grace.

459
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:53,299
The grace to serve God.

460
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,779
The grace,

461
00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:01,619
the ability that God gives us to do what God has called us to do.

462
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:09,059
In fact, we find that Paul says this, for by the grace of God I am what I am. We find that Paul

463
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,779
acknowledges this as he's praying for deliverance and God says

464
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:18,979
as he did not deliver him, he says in 2 Corinthians chapter 12, my grace

465
00:22:19,699 --> 00:22:21,299
is sufficient

466
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:25,619
for thee. We find that Peter would say that we're to be good

467
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:32,019
stewards of the manifold grace of God in 1 Peter chapter 4. Within the context

468
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:39,059
specifically, the Bible says as every man hath received the gift, even so minister.

469
00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:46,259
Right? And we see that he says how are we to minister as being good stewards of the manifold grace of God?

470
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:50,899
And the reason by which we minister is so that God might receive the glory.

471
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:57,619
So that God would be exalted and magnified. And so we find this truth of grace that's being

472
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,579
reminded to Timothy of God's grace. Oh, that grace

473
00:23:02,979 --> 00:23:07,079
would be evidenced in your life that you would understand

474
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:10,099
the grace of God.

475
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:12,339
He says mercy.

476
00:23:12,339 --> 00:23:14,099
Mercy.

477
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:17,799
I'm thankful that the Bible tells us that his mercy endureth

478
00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:20,179
forever.

479
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:23,719
I'm thankful this morning, mercy dealing with compassion that's manifested

480
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:26,659
towards a person

481
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:28,819
in distress.

482
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:32,419
That's one of many definitions for mercy.

483
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:35,139
But I think specifically with regard to

484
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:41,459
the writing of this particular letter to his son in the faith, to Timothy as a pastor, as a

485
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:49,139
leader there in Ephesus, that he, the apostle Paul, is saying, listen, yes, there's going to be times of distress,

486
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,379
but I'm praying for God's mercy

487
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:54,019
in your life.

488
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:55,859
God's grace.

489
00:23:55,859 --> 00:23:59,539
God's mercy. But then notice number three. He says

490
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,099
peace.

491
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:04,019
Peace.

492
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:05,699
Harmony and rest.

493
00:24:05,699 --> 00:24:12,339
Psalm 118 and 165 says, great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them.

494
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:18,499
Great peace have they which love thy law. I'm thankful that our God is the prince of peace.

495
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:26,979
I'm thankful that he gives a peace according to what the Bible says in Philippians 4 and verse number 7 is a peace that passeth all

496
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,219
understanding.

497
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:33,059
We're to allow, let the peace of God rule

498
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:36,119
in our hearts according to the book of Colossians.

499
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:39,379
We find that Paul,

500
00:24:39,699 --> 00:24:47,779
as he's speaking to Timothy as he's writing this letter, Paul acknowledged that God alone is the source of grace.

501
00:24:48,499 --> 00:24:49,779
mercy

502
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,619
and peace.

503
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:54,899
Peace is not simply found in the absence of trouble.

504
00:24:55,619 --> 00:25:02,659
So often we find that the mindset of an individual is that if I could just have my life void of trouble,

505
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:06,339
then I might achieve peace in my life.

506
00:25:07,219 --> 00:25:13,459
The problem is that God reveals to us in the book of Job that man is born a woman of few days and full of troubles.

507
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:20,179
The psalmist says that God has delivered me out of all my troubles and no doubt

508
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:24,279
we understand that as we live in this life, there will be troubles.

509
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:27,539
But you know that we can have peace in the midst of trouble.

510
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:30,339
Why? Because peace comes from God.

511
00:25:31,219 --> 00:25:36,499
Peace is not found in the absence of trouble rather in the very presence of God.

512
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:42,659
So understand that my God is on his throne. My God has a plan.

513
00:25:43,219 --> 00:25:44,659
My God

514
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:51,399
loves me with an everlasting love, with a love that is beyond my ability to fully comprehend.

515
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:54,019
And I find that I can have great peace.

516
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:56,739
Great peace.

517
00:25:56,739 --> 00:25:58,419
This morning

518
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:02,839
we look at these two verses of scripture and we find that Paul acknowledged

519
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:05,859
the authority of God in his life.

520
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:10,259
I hope that every one of us this morning would acknowledge God's authority in our lives.

521
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:13,939
I am not the authority of my life. God is.

522
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,399
And I must. If I understand, if I recognize,

523
00:26:18,499 --> 00:26:21,639
if I acknowledge this morning that he is the authority,

524
00:26:22,579 --> 00:26:24,579
then it will help me to do

525
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:27,059
what he commands me to do.

526
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:31,539
And Paul acknowledged the will of God. I'm an apostle of Jesus Christ by

527
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:34,179
the will of God.

528
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,979
I want to fulfill what God's will is for my life.

529
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:42,899
And he acknowledged that God is the source for grace, mercy, and peace. Paul knew

530
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:45,939
he'd been in the ministry for a number of years.

531
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:47,699
Paul knew

532
00:26:47,699 --> 00:26:53,779
the hardships and the difficulties that would be encountered, the opposition that would be faced. And Paul knew

533
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:56,259
that he himself needed grace,

534
00:26:56,819 --> 00:26:57,859
mercy,

535
00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:06,739
and peace. And therefore, as he writes to Timothy, he says grace, mercy, and peace. Why? Because Timothy, if he's going to fulfill

536
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:09,379
what God has for him, he needs grace,

537
00:27:09,939 --> 00:27:11,939
mercy, and peace.

538
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:15,779
So do you. So do I. I'm thankful that God is the source

539
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:17,779
of grace,

540
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:18,979
mercy,

541
00:27:18,979 --> 00:27:20,259
and peace.

542
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:22,099
Number two,

543
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:28,519
in your notes this morning, we, number one, notice what Paul acknowledged. Number two, notice what Paul appreciated.

544
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:32,819
What did he appreciate? Well, as I look at these two verses of scripture and just kind of

545
00:27:33,139 --> 00:27:36,499
meditate upon them, and I begin to find that Paul,

546
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:43,779
in these two verses, he reveals some things to us. I believe that that one thing that he appreciated, if you're taking notes,

547
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:48,739
he appreciated the work of the ministry. He appreciated the work of the ministry. You know,

548
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:52,679
I believe that Paul believed that it was a privilege to be an apostle.

549
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:56,359
He said that he was the least of all the apostles.

550
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:00,979
He says in the same text that I mentioned a moment ago that I am what I am by the grace of God.

551
00:28:01,219 --> 00:28:06,339
Listen, Paul, I believe he appreciated the opportunity to serve God.

552
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:11,539
Do you recognize this morning what a blessing it is to serve the Lord?

553
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:13,539
I mean,

554
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:20,499
there are times in which we think about service to God, and maybe we think about it just in the context of the preacher

555
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:27,219
standing up and preaching as I'm doing now, or the musicians standing up and singing as they did a few moments ago.

556
00:28:27,379 --> 00:28:32,419
But I'm telling you, it's a blessing to serve God when you're cutting the grass of God's property, when you're

557
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:40,099
vacuuming the floors in the house of the Lord, when you're a doorkeeper, is what the book of Psalms says, in the house of the Lord.

558
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:42,260
Amen?

559
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:47,539
Why? It's just a privilege to serve him. He's the king of kings, lord of lords. He's the creator of the universe.

560
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:53,380
He has all power, all authority, and I know me and you know you,

561
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:58,019
and he says that he would allow us to serve him.

562
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:00,739
It's absolutely amazing.

563
00:29:00,979 --> 00:29:02,979
I think,

564
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:05,219
as I studied the scriptures,

565
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:09,239
I think that there probably wasn't a day that passed that Paul didn't appreciate

566
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:12,179
what God did in his life.

567
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:14,979
Not only by saving his soul, but letting him serve.

568
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:20,179
Can you imagine? It's a joy and privilege to serve the Lord. We sing the song,

569
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:25,380
there is joy in serving Jesus. And there is, there's joy.

570
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:28,339
We get to go and be his

571
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:35,299
representatives, his ambassadors, to be able to serve. I believe that specifically as we look here and think about the apostle Paul,

572
00:29:35,459 --> 00:29:39,619
yes, he's appreciative of the work of the ministry, the privilege of being an apostle.

573
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:46,419
I think also he's appreciative of the ministry with regard to the role of being a mentor. Notice

574
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:51,299
he says in verse number two, to Timothy, my dearly beloved son.

575
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:58,339
That opportunity to be a mentor, the ability to influence somebody else for the cause of Christ.

576
00:29:58,739 --> 00:30:00,739
I mean, what a joy.

577
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:04,819
we ought to appreciate the fact that God would use us

578
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:08,499
to be able to have an impact in someone else's life.

579
00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:13,499
I hope this morning that you have in your life a Paul,

580
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:17,859
somebody that invested in you,

581
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:22,859
somebody that discipled you, somebody that taught you.

582
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:26,259
I've heard before preachers say

583
00:30:26,499 --> 00:30:31,139
that every Christian needs to have a Paul.

584
00:30:31,139 --> 00:30:31,979
What do they mean by that?

585
00:30:31,979 --> 00:30:35,099
Well, somebody that mentors us,

586
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:40,099
somebody that instructs us, somebody that invests in us.

587
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:42,679
Maybe this morning, even as I make those statements,

588
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:46,579
you can think in your mind of who your Paul is.

589
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:49,899
It's interesting for me, my Paul is Paul.

590
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:51,739
Paul Mershon is his name,

591
00:30:51,739 --> 00:30:55,439
and he's a man that has the same name as this apostle,

592
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:59,159
and many of you know him, and he is a mentor to me.

593
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:01,219
I spent an hour on the phone with him on Thursday

594
00:31:01,219 --> 00:31:02,679
to see how he and his wife are doing

595
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:04,919
because of the current situations,

596
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:09,579
and man, he's just invested in me over the years.

597
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:11,159
And oh, how I appreciate that.

598
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:12,319
He's not the only Paul.

599
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:13,379
There's a number of others

600
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:15,279
that I could mention this morning by name

601
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,179
that have actively invested in my life.

602
00:31:20,219 --> 00:31:21,959
Just like every believer needs a Paul,

603
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:24,319
I'll say this, every believer needs a Timothy.

604
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,119
What do I mean by that?

605
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:28,079
Well, Paul had a Timothy.

606
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:29,479
Who's your Timothy?

607
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:31,559
Who are you investing in?

608
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:35,919
Who are you trying to be a mentor to,

609
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,119
that you're trying to point them to Christ,

610
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:40,439
that you're trying to lead them along

611
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:43,519
in their journey and their walk with Christ?

612
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,679
You understand this morning,

613
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,239
I enjoy, I thoroughly love discipleship.

614
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:50,279
I truly do.

615
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:52,979
I love sitting down with people on a one-on-one

616
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:56,659
or a one-on-two kind of a setting in my office

617
00:31:56,659 --> 00:31:58,719
and just discipling people,

618
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:02,019
just teaching them and having questions and answers

619
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:03,659
and all of that, it's enjoyable.

620
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:04,779
But you understand this morning

621
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:07,799
that I can't do that with every single person,

622
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,459
nor is it really my job.

623
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,459
Every Christian should have a Timothy.

624
00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:16,179
Who are we investing in?

625
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:17,819
I mean, purposefully.

626
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:20,539
Who are we seeking to influence?

627
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:22,799
Acknowledging and appreciating the fact

628
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:24,479
that God would use us.

629
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:25,919
You say, well, I don't know everything.

630
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,519
Listen, whatever you do know, you can help somebody with.

631
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:31,599
You can let them know what God's done in your life

632
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:34,919
and you can lead them and teach them.

633
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,959
It's also said in that same context

634
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,839
that every Christian needs a Barnabas

635
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:43,499
and we understand how he encouraged.

636
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:49,079
Paul often was encouraged by others.

637
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:50,759
In fact, in this first chapter,

638
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:53,839
he mentions a man by the name of Anesiphorus,

639
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:57,759
a man that oft refreshed him is what he says.

640
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:59,199
He oft refreshed me.

641
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:00,759
What a blessing.

642
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:02,599
The thing about Barnabas and the ministry that he had

643
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:04,959
in the life of the Apostle Paul early on

644
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:09,399
with regard to Paul's ministry,

645
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:12,199
this morning we ought to be encouraging one another.

646
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,399
You know what Paul appreciated?

647
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:15,559
He appreciated that God saved him

648
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:17,719
and God would let him serve him.

649
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:19,259
I hope this morning you appreciate

650
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:21,059
the privilege of serving.

651
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:22,739
You say, well, all I do is cut the grass.

652
00:33:22,739 --> 00:33:25,539
Praise God, praise God.

653
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:27,819
All I can do anymore is this, praise God.

654
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:30,319
Everyone can't, listen, can you know how chaotic it'd be

655
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:32,919
if all of us tried to preach right now at the same time?

656
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:34,399
It'd be absolute mess.

657
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,339
Would it not?

658
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:37,179
Would it not?

659
00:33:38,459 --> 00:33:40,359
I remember talking to a man years ago.

660
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,219
I would describe him as a senior saint.

661
00:33:43,219 --> 00:33:45,579
I think he would describe himself the same way.

662
00:33:46,699 --> 00:33:47,979
And he met with me one day and he said,

663
00:33:47,979 --> 00:33:49,739
Pastor, I just can't do this anymore

664
00:33:49,739 --> 00:33:52,499
and I can't do this anymore and I can't do this anymore

665
00:33:52,499 --> 00:33:54,339
and I just can't do this anymore

666
00:33:54,339 --> 00:33:55,619
and I can't do this anymore.

667
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:57,219
And I kind of, after about four or five things,

668
00:33:57,219 --> 00:33:59,379
I just kind of stopped them.

669
00:33:59,379 --> 00:34:00,779
And I said, listen,

670
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:03,779
I really don't care about what you can't do.

671
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:06,819
Here's what I want to know, what can you do?

672
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:08,999
Because if you're still here,

673
00:34:08,999 --> 00:34:11,259
there's something that God can use you to do.

674
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,899
God can use you to do something.

675
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:17,179
And you know, when I asked that gentleman that question,

676
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,339
his whole demeanor changed

677
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:20,819
because he's really kind of overwhelmed

678
00:34:20,819 --> 00:34:22,119
with a measure of sadness

679
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:24,199
because of the things that he no longer could do

680
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,139
because of his elevated age.

681
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:28,779
And I said, well, what are some things that you can do?

682
00:34:28,779 --> 00:34:30,019
And he said, well, I can do this.

683
00:34:30,019 --> 00:34:32,039
And I was like, you know, as far as I know,

684
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:34,619
there's no one else in our church that can do that.

685
00:34:36,259 --> 00:34:37,899
That's how God has equipped you.

686
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:41,139
And that's what God wants you to do.

687
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:43,099
And his countenance just completely changed

688
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:44,019
through that conversation.

689
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:44,859
Why?

690
00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:49,019
Because he recognized there's still something

691
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:51,819
that God can use me to do.

692
00:34:51,819 --> 00:34:56,739
And it's a joy to serve Christ.

693
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:57,979
What did Paul appreciate?

694
00:34:57,979 --> 00:34:59,539
Well, he appreciated the work of the ministry.

695
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:03,779
Number two, I think he appreciated physical life.

696
00:35:03,779 --> 00:35:05,319
He says this in verse number one,

697
00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:07,819
notice it says, Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ,

698
00:35:07,819 --> 00:35:09,739
by the will of God, notice it says,

699
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:13,660
according to the promise of life, which is in Christ Jesus.

700
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,859
Now, I'm gonna get to a final point here in just a moment,

701
00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:18,819
but I do think there is an acknowledgement here

702
00:35:18,819 --> 00:35:22,139
of being appreciative of life, physical life.

703
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:24,539
Somebody says, you've heard people say it before,

704
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,139
that every day I put my feet on the ground,

705
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:28,339
I thank God for the day that he's given me.

706
00:35:28,339 --> 00:35:30,059
The Bible says this in Psalm 118,

707
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:32,739
this is the day the Lord hath made.

708
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:36,179
We will rejoice and be glad in it.

709
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:39,539
God is the author and giver of life.

710
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:41,419
He's given you the ability to breathe

711
00:35:41,459 --> 00:35:43,819
and to have life today.

712
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:44,899
But he asked this question,

713
00:35:44,899 --> 00:35:49,339
or he tells us this truth in his word, what is your life?

714
00:35:49,339 --> 00:35:51,339
It's but a vapor that appears for a little time

715
00:35:51,339 --> 00:35:54,339
and then vanisheth away.

716
00:35:54,339 --> 00:35:57,259
We find that here in 2 Timothy chapter number one,

717
00:35:57,259 --> 00:36:01,179
as Paul is taking out the pen and he's writing this letter

718
00:36:01,179 --> 00:36:03,539
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

719
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:08,539
we find that Paul is sitting in a prison awaiting death.

720
00:36:12,419 --> 00:36:14,739
As Paul was aware of the reality

721
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,940
that he would soon be put to death,

722
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,299
I believe that this reality would cause Paul,

723
00:36:20,299 --> 00:36:24,259
but really would cause any individual to evaluate

724
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:29,779
and to appreciate the gift of life that was given to them.

725
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:35,019
I'm so thankful for life.

726
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:39,899
And I think Paul, he was thankful for life.

727
00:36:39,899 --> 00:36:42,940
But I think greater than being thankful for physical life,

728
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,859
as it says, the promise of life, which is in Christ Jesus,

729
00:36:45,859 --> 00:36:48,380
I think in a far greater sense,

730
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:52,019
he was appreciative of the truth of eternal life,

731
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:53,299
of eternal life.

732
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:56,979
See, Peter says it this way,

733
00:36:56,979 --> 00:37:00,380
that his tabernacle he would soon put off.

734
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:03,059
In other words, he would die.

735
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:05,019
I said to a half a dozen people yesterday

736
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:06,819
as we're out door knocking,

737
00:37:06,819 --> 00:37:08,539
that one day we're gonna die.

738
00:37:08,539 --> 00:37:10,339
And I said this to several of them,

739
00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:12,579
that David said in the book of 1 Samuel,

740
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:14,940
there's but a step between me and death.

741
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,019
I said, no, contextually,

742
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:17,339
the reason that David says that

743
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:22,339
is because Saul's trying to kill him, hunting him.

744
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:25,059
And David says there's but a step between me and death,

745
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:27,179
but in a very real way,

746
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:30,500
in a very real way, for all of us this morning,

747
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,500
there's but a step between me and death.

748
00:37:33,979 --> 00:37:35,940
You say, oh no, I'm young, I'm full of life.

749
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,459
And I got, have you ever read the obituaries?

750
00:37:39,459 --> 00:37:43,660
Have you ever gone through a cemetery or a graveyard?

751
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:48,019
You can find, I don't enjoy doing that,

752
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:51,539
but I have before, and you can go through

753
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:55,699
and you can see dates on headstones.

754
00:37:55,699 --> 00:38:00,699
And you can see some that the individual was 70, 80, 90.

755
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,299
Some that they're seven, eight, nine.

756
00:38:06,339 --> 00:38:10,500
Some that are just infants, days old.

757
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,380
Am I not right?

758
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:16,019
I spoke with a man years ago,

759
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:20,699
Mary Finley's granddaughter was dying.

760
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,579
Some of you wouldn't remember Mary Finley

761
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:25,339
and her granddaughter was dying

762
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:27,919
and she's probably about my age.

763
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,419
And her husband was Chris and I sat in the room,

764
00:38:31,419 --> 00:38:34,099
Holly and I were sitting there with them

765
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:39,099
and the doctor had given her just a few days to live.

766
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:46,140
As best I knew, and in fact, as best I still know today,

767
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:48,260
Chris was not a saved person.

768
00:38:50,459 --> 00:38:54,059
The focus in that particular day was not on Chris,

769
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:57,099
but on his wife who had been given the words

770
00:38:57,099 --> 00:38:59,859
from the doctor that you just have a few days to live.

771
00:39:00,899 --> 00:39:03,500
But as best I knew and what had been communicated to me

772
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,419
was she had trusted Christ as her savior.

773
00:39:06,419 --> 00:39:09,779
So I knew and I had assurance that if that were true,

774
00:39:10,899 --> 00:39:12,459
based upon the truth of the Bible,

775
00:39:12,459 --> 00:39:16,179
that she would enter into heaven

776
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:18,979
because her physical life would end,

777
00:39:18,979 --> 00:39:21,619
but she would cross that door

778
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:24,299
and enter into the presence of heaven.

779
00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:26,339
So my concern really was Chris.

780
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,820
And I said this to Chris, I said, listen,

781
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,479
I understand what the doctors have said

782
00:39:31,479 --> 00:39:33,039
and you understand what the doctors have said,

783
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,959
but you know that either one of us could die before she does.

784
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:42,520
I had driven to their house that day and I said, listen,

785
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,359
I could get in the car to go back to the office

786
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:45,599
and I could die in a car accident

787
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,559
on the way back to the office.

788
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:49,959
You know, people die in car accidents all the time.

789
00:39:50,799 --> 00:39:51,640
All the time.

790
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,799
We're about a step between us and death.

791
00:39:55,799 --> 00:40:00,760
And Paul knew that his physical life was soon going to end.

792
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:09,560
But I think Paul appreciated the truth of eternal life, in this great sense of being

793
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:13,360
a recipient of the gift of God, which is eternal life.

794
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:18,840
Paul, I believe, that as he's writing here, and he says, according to the promise of life

795
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:23,240
which is in Christ Jesus, yes, there's the life that we're living, that physical life,

796
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,880
but we understand the focus on eternal life.

797
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,280
I asked this question this morning, before I ever got into the Scriptures in 2 Timothy,

798
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,400
after they sang that song, I said, are you sure that you're going to heaven?

799
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,800
Are you a child of the King?

800
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,280
I'm thankful that the Apostle Paul, he had this assurance that though he would soon die,

801
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,480
that he would be in the presence of his Savior.

802
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,320
Turn back, if you will, to the book of 2 Corinthians in chapter number 5.

803
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:59,720
2 Corinthians, chapter number 5, there's a great discourse here in this passage of

804
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:06,080
Scripture with regard to the certainty that Paul had of eternal life, and the certainty

805
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:13,400
this morning that every human being can have of eternal life.

806
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,440
Ron and I, we were knocking doors yesterday.

807
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,080
He was my partner as we went out, and one man said this to us when I asked him if he

808
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:24,520
was 100% sure if he were to die that he'd go to heaven.

809
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,720
How could anyone know that?

810
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,360
If you try to tell me that you know that, you're just prideful.

811
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,400
Can I tell you this morning?

812
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,160
I don't know that I'm going to heaven because of anything I've done.

813
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,680
It's all because of what Jesus did.

814
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,080
The truth of the matter is that there's not one of us that deserve it.

815
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,520
We're not deserving.

816
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,800
It's because of His grace and His mercy that we could be born again, that we could be saved.

817
00:41:53,800 --> 00:42:04,040
By the way, Jesus said to Nicodemus, a religious man, marvel not that I say unto thee, ye must

818
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,000
be born again.

819
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,640
Except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

820
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,480
We find here in 2 Corinthians chapter number 5, notice how it begins in verse number 1,

821
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,000
for we know.

822
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
For we know.

823
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,240
Aren't you thankful that we can know?

824
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,080
Paul doesn't say for we think.

825
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,680
He doesn't say for we hope.

826
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,880
He says for we know.

827
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,880
The authority that God has given us in His Word.

828
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,000
For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved.

829
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,320
What does he mean by that?

830
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,840
Why is he using this language?

831
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:44,520
Well basically he's saying, listen, when this old flesh, when I die, when this, if our earthly

832
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:52,040
house of this tabernacle were dissolved, notice we have a building of God and house not made

833
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,600
with hands eternal in the heavens.

834
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:00,480
For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house, which is from

835
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,480
heaven.

836
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,480
What's he saying in verse number 2?

837
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,280
Listen, there are days that we long for heaven, amen?

838
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,640
We say, man, heaven is a wonderful place and I'm ready to go.

839
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,200
Now what a joy it's going to be to be in the presence of our Savior.

840
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,120
People sometimes ask this question, what's heaven going to be like?

841
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,760
Oh, there's a whole lot of things that God tells us that heaven's going to be like, but

842
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,960
I'll tell you what makes heaven heaven is Jesus will be there.

843
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,680
You can take all the other things that are mentioned about heaven and if you remove Jesus,

844
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,560
it ain't the same.

845
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,520
Jesus in the presence of our Savior.

846
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:41,200
Listen, verse 3, if so be that being clothed, we shall not be found naked.

847
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:48,160
For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened, not for that we would be unclothed,

848
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:58,000
but clothed upon that notice when he says that mortality might be swallowed up of life.

849
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
D.L.

850
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,680
Moody said this, he said, one day you're going to read in the headlines that D.L.

851
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:09,160
Moody's dead.

852
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,000
Don't believe it for a second.

853
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,160
For in the day that you read that headline, I will be more alive than I've ever been.

854
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,000
What was he talking about?

855
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,640
He's talking about mortality being swallowed up of life because we have the truth of eternal

856
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,640
life.

857
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:34,559
Now, verse 5, he that hath wrought us for the self, same thing as God, who also hath

858
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:37,360
given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.

859
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,520
If you've been born again this morning, if you've been saved by the grace of God, the

860
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:47,800
Bible teaches us that at the moment of salvation, the Holy Spirit indwells us.

861
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,680
He is the earnest of our inheritance.

862
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,480
We see it here in 2 Corinthians 5.

863
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,279
We see it in Ephesians chapter 1.

864
00:44:54,279 --> 00:44:58,800
I referenced earlier about 1 Corinthians chapter 6, that the Holy Spirit is, that our bodies

865
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,279
are the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which you have of God.

866
00:45:03,279 --> 00:45:10,360
And he says that we have been given the Holy Spirit, which is the earnest of our inheritance,

867
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,880
Ephesians 1, verses 12 through 14.

868
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:19,200
Therefore, we are always confident, knowing that whilst we are at home in the body, we

869
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,880
are absent from the Lord.

870
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,880
Do you know that this morning?

871
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,520
I mean, listen, this is not heaven.

872
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:25,880
Someone tried to tell me that this is heaven.

873
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,960
Man, this is not heaven.

874
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,800
This is absolutely not heaven.

875
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,600
How many of you know this is not heaven?

876
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,600
Amen?

877
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,600
This is not heaven.

878
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,920
Somebody try to tell me that.

879
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,040
This is not heaven?

880
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,920
You've lost your mind if you think this is heaven.

881
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,240
Amen?

882
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:47,580
We know, look in verse 7, for we walk by faith, not by sight, and I love verse number 8.

883
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:56,180
He says, we are confident, I say, and willing, rather to be absent from the body and to

884
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:59,660
be present with the Lord.

885
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:05,420
Wherefore, we labor that whether present or absent, we may be accepted of Him.

886
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:08,380
Listen, Paul said, I'm confident.

887
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,900
Paul wasn't afraid of dying.

888
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,380
Paul had no fear of death.

889
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:13,380
Why?

890
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,100
Because he knew whom he had believed.

891
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:26,619
He knew that Jesus is the author of eternal life, life, yes, but eternal life.

892
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:29,779
And he had been given that gift of God.

893
00:46:29,779 --> 00:46:30,920
He could not work for it.

894
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,559
You cannot work for it.

895
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:33,559
He did not earn it.

896
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:36,180
You cannot earn it.

897
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,140
Jesus paid for all of it.

898
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,660
He didn't just put a down payment and you got to work for the rest.

899
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:43,020
No, He paid for it all.

900
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:50,260
Paul, he says, we're confident, I say, and willing, rather, to be absent from the body

901
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,740
and to be present with the Lord.

902
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:59,940
Back in the book of 2 Timothy, notice with me in chapter number 4, familiar text of Scripture,

903
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,420
one that I've hinted at twice already this morning.

904
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:15,860
But in chapter number 4 and verse number 6, Paul says this, for I am now ready to be

905
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:20,980
offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.

906
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:26,300
I want you to think about the phraseology that he says, I'm ready.

907
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:34,860
Listen, if you're not confident of heaven, you're crazy to say, I'm ready to die.

908
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:39,580
But when you're confident of heaven, because of the gift of God, which is eternal life

909
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:45,900
that you are a possessor of, then you can say, I am ready.

910
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,660
I am ready to be offered.

911
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,420
The time of my departure is at hand.

912
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:52,020
I have fought a good fight.

913
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,380
I have finished my course.

914
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,820
I have kept the faith.

915
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:00,059
But I want you to notice verse number 8, henceforth, there is laid up for me a crown

916
00:48:00,059 --> 00:48:07,380
of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day, and not

917
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:12,619
to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.

918
00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:16,540
You know, he gives clarity here in verse number 8.

919
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,420
Some people, I asked the guy yesterday, what's going to happen when he dies?

920
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,059
He's like, well, you know, you just become a tree, you become a dog, you become a bird.

921
00:48:22,059 --> 00:48:24,460
Like, come on, man.

922
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:29,140
We just know that's not true.

923
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,700
Amen?

924
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,979
As is appointed unto man, he wants to die, but after this, the judgment.

925
00:48:36,979 --> 00:48:41,619
Here Paul says that there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which, notice what

926
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:47,780
he says, the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me, but he says at that day.

927
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:50,900
There are two judgments that are mentioned in the Bible, and we're running out of time

928
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:55,340
this morning, but one of them is the bema seat, the judgment seat of Christ.

929
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:58,100
Can I tell you this morning, if you're saved by the grace of God, that's the judgment seat

930
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,700
that you'll stand at.

931
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:06,580
By the way, that's the one you would prefer to stand at, the bema, the judgment seat.

932
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:11,059
And the Bible tells us that Paul had this confidence that he would receive a crown from

933
00:49:11,059 --> 00:49:15,859
the Lord, the righteous judge, and he says this, not to me only, but also unto all them

934
00:49:15,859 --> 00:49:18,220
also that love his appearing.

935
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:20,299
There's some crowns that we could receive.

936
00:49:20,299 --> 00:49:22,100
We could suffer loss.

937
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:25,260
We could receive reward, according to 1 Corinthians.

938
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:29,380
But there's a second judgment that's explained to us in the book of Revelation in chapter

939
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:34,739
20, and it's called the great white throne judgment.

940
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:39,540
That's a judgment that you don't want to stand at, because that judgment is for those that

941
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:43,100
have not trusted Christ as their Savior.

942
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:51,380
That judgment is a judgment that will end in being cast in the lake of fire.

943
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:58,900
The Bible tells us very plainly and very clearly that there's but two destinations for mankind,

944
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,660
heaven or the lake of fire.

945
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:06,900
And we look at this text of Scripture and we say, listen, Paul acknowledged some things,

946
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:11,420
but Paul was also appreciative of some things. What did Paul appreciate? Well, he appreciated

947
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:15,580
the work of the ministry, he appreciated life, but most importantly, he appreciated the truth

948
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:23,100
of eternal life. I wonder this morning, how thankful are we to have eternal life? I hope

949
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:28,300
every day of your life, you thank God for being saved. I hope every day of your life,

950
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:34,340
you thank God that somebody cared enough to tell you the truth of the gospel, and that

951
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:39,980
it would convict us to tell others the truth of the gospel, because men are dying. People

952
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:46,740
are dying. They need to know the truth of the gospel. Do you acknowledge this morning

953
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:55,540
that God has all authority in your life? Young people, so often, it's the young people that

954
00:50:55,540 --> 00:51:01,020
hear this message so often about God as the authority of your life, and it's true. But

955
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:06,020
can I tell you, for every single one of us, regardless of our age, we must acknowledge

956
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:12,660
this morning that God is the authority, that God has a will for us, a purpose, a plan for

957
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:19,260
your life and for my life, that God is the one who gives grace, mercy, and peace. Now,

958
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:25,300
we would serve the Lord joyfully, appreciating the fact that He would allow us to serve Him.

959
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:33,020
You know, He could have used the angels, but He chose to use us. It's amazing. It's amazing.

960
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:39,420
Grace, mercy, and peace. There's some things that Paul acknowledged, some things that Paul

961
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:45,220
appreciated, and I hope this morning, just as it would be the case for Timothy, that

962
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:49,660
he had to acknowledge and appreciate those things, that we too, we must acknowledge those

963
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:54,860
things and appreciate those things. Allow God to have His will and His way in our lives.

964
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:58,680
Let's pray together. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. We thank You

965
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:04,020
for Your Word, the truth contained therein. God, if there's one here this morning or tuned

966
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:08,140
in via live stream that's not sure of heaven, God, I pray that today would be the day of

967
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:12,980
their salvation. They'd come to this old-fashioned altar in just a moment as we have an invitation

968
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:16,540
and allow us to take a Bible and show them how they could know for sure that heaven is

969
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:22,060
their home. God, I pray for every Christian, every believer this morning. I pray, God,

970
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:28,260
that You'd help us to acknowledge Your authority in our lives. God, if we've been trying to

971
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:33,740
live as if we are the authority, would You help us to confess that and forsake that?

972
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:38,500
Lord, help us to yield and submit to Thee that You might use us, God, for Your honor

973
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:43,740
and for Your glory. I pray that however it may be that You've worked in the hearts and

974
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:48,260
lives of Your people this morning, God, that You'd help us to be doers of the Word and

975
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:53,740
not hearers only. Help us to respond in obedience and we'll thank You for it. In Christ's name

976
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:54,420
we pray.
