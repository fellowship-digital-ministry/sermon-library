00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
Number one, 2 Timothy chapter number one,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.099
we finished last week, 1 Timothy.

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:10.720
And of course, our theme for this calendar year is continue.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.779
And we have had this theme throughout the year.

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:17.680
In fact, even for our missions conference this year,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.200
we kept the same theme

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.159
because we wanna keep ingrained in our minds

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:24.319
the importance of continuing

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:26.959
and to continue to serve the Lord,

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:29.959
to remain faithful in the midst of opposition

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.080
and adversity and all that we would face,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.180
that our eyes are on Jesus,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.639
we're looking unto Jesus,

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:37.799
the author and finisher of our faith.

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:40.520
We find that the apostle Paul is used of God

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.520
in 1 and 2 Timothy to encourage his son in the faith,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.880
as he's referred to, to continue.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.520
And he tells them in this particular book

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.959
in 2 Timothy, we'll get there in a few,

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:55.360
probably a couple of months,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.080
in 2 Timothy chapter number three,

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:00.240
he tells them about the last days that we're living in

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.599
and the perilous times

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:04.620
and all the characteristics of those days.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.639
And he says that evil men and seducers

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:09.160
shall wax worse and worse,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.720
deceiving and being deceived,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.360
but continue and don't give up,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.419
don't throw in the towel,

00:01:17.419 --> 00:01:20.400
continue, remain steadfast, unmovable,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.440
always abounding in the work of the Lord.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.279
Why?

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:27.919
For we know that our labor is not in vain in the Lord.

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:31.000
And what a joy, as we enter into the second book,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.800
the second letter, 2 Timothy chapter number one,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.360
we'll just be looking at two verses this morning.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.239
And we note the similarities and the greetings

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:42.879
in 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and also in the book of Titus.

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:45.599
These three books or three letters

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:50.400
are often referred to as the pastoral epistles.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.760
We think about these three particular letters

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:56.120
and we find that as Paul would have it,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.120
of course, all scripture is given by inspiration of God,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.680
but as Paul would be writing to Timothy and to Titus,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.800
he refers to both of them as being his son.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.080
Now, they're not his son biologically or physically,

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.779
but we understand that spiritually speaking,

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:17.360
the apostle Paul had a great relationship

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.919
with both Timothy and Titus.

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:21.720
I believe that that relationship

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.199
with these younger servants of the Lord

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:27.440
was both special and unique.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.839
I believe that the apostle Paul in his heart

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:34.279
had a special place for Timothy and for Titus.

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:38.720
And I think that Titus and Timothy also held in their heart

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.240
a special place for Paul and all the influence

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.360
that he had upon their lives.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.360
In fact, it's interesting to note how Paul,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.880
yes, he encourages many that he writes to

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:53.679
with regard to how he's praying for them,

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:55.759
but I think about these individuals,

00:02:55.759 --> 00:03:00.460
Timothy and Titus engaged in the work of the ministry

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.460
as pastors that God would use Paul to encourage them

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:09.419
and to remind them that he's praying for them.

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.139
And what a tremendous blessing that is.

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:14.360
Paul, of course, through these two books,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.759
specifically dealing with the life and ministry of Timothy,

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:22.320
Paul would be used of the Lord to both instruct

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.059
and encourage Timothy.

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:27.000
We find that he'll be used of the Lord

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.800
in the book of Titus to, again,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.600
both instruct and encourage Titus.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.039
But what was Paul's desire?

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:37.479
I believe that Paul desired that these men,

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:40.279
that Timothy, in the context of what we're looking at

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:41.800
this calendar year,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.419
that Timothy would serve the Lord faithfully,

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:49.779
that Timothy would serve God all the days of his life,

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:53.339
that he would be able to say, as Paul will say

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:56.020
in this particular letter in the fourth chapter,

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.339
that I have finished.

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:01.460
I've come to the end and I fought a good fight.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.580
I kept the faith and what a joy.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.880
And I believe that that's Paul's desire.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.720
So Paul, understanding all of the circumstances

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.639
of what was taking place at Ephesus

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.979
with regard to the false teaching

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.140
and all of the opposition

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.220
that Timothy would be dealing with,

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.700
God understands that as well.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.000
And therefore, God would send and use Paul

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.760
to write these letters to be a blessing

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.899
and an encouragement to Timothy.

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:33.739
We find that this letter that is before us this morning

00:04:33.739 --> 00:04:38.019
is the final letter that we have of the Apostle Paul.

00:04:38.019 --> 00:04:42.940
We do not know with certainty how many weeks, months

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.059
took place between the writing of this letter

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:48.179
and Paul's death.

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:51.140
But we know that it was within this short period of time

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.239
that after Paul wrote this letter,

00:04:53.239 --> 00:04:55.619
that Paul would face a martyr's death,

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:59.260
that he would die for his faith in Christ Jesus.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.739
And as we look at this passage,

00:05:00.739 --> 00:05:02.619
notice with me in chapter one,

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:04.579
we're just gonna look at verses one and two.

00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:05.500
The Bible says this,

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.820
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ,

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.059
by the will of God,

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:15.140
according to the promise of life,

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.739
which is in Christ Jesus,

00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:23.540
to Timothy, my dearly beloved son,

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.920
grace, mercy, and peace

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.920
from God the Father and Christ Jesus, our Lord.

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:35.220
If you've looked at the back of the bulletin

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.100
already this morning,

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.640
I've simply titled the message

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.179
from verse number two this morning,

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:43.059
grace, mercy, and peace.

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:45.019
I mean, just the sound of those words

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:47.619
brings a measure of encouragement, does it?

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:49.679
And we think about this truth

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:52.660
and what Paul is giving to Timothy here.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.899
And I just have two thoughts for you this morning,

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:57.100
but remember, just because there's two points

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.940
doesn't mean it's gonna be any shorter.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.440
And first point this morning, if you're taking notes,

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.579
the first thought is this,

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:05.859
notice what Paul acknowledged.

00:06:05.859 --> 00:06:08.380
As we look at these two verses of scripture,

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.320
we find that Paul acknowledged some things

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.100
that are important not only for Paul,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.579
they're important for Timothy,

00:06:15.579 --> 00:06:17.660
but they're important for each of us as well.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.220
As the people of God,

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.700
there are some things that we must acknowledge

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.019
or recognize.

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:25.299
And we find in the text of scripture,

00:06:25.299 --> 00:06:29.899
number one, that Paul acknowledged the authority of God.

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:31.299
Notice in verse number one,

00:06:31.299 --> 00:06:35.619
the Bible says Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ,

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:37.899
by the will of God.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.260
And we find that the apostle Paul,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.179
he understood who he was,

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:46.059
and he understood who God is.

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:48.359
I believe that if we begin to understand

00:06:48.359 --> 00:06:51.459
how that Paul acknowledges the authority of God,

00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:55.179
even in the greeting that he writes to Timothy,

00:06:55.179 --> 00:06:58.380
that it's crucial, it's absolutely imperative,

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.160
it is critical for every child of God

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.859
to acknowledge God's authority in our lives.

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:09.940
See, the reality is that we have this society

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.700
and this culture has almost ingrained

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.619
in the minds of people that you are your own authority

00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:19.140
and you are the one that determines

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.899
and you make the decision.

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:22.739
But as a child of God,

00:07:22.739 --> 00:07:25.779
I understand that Paul says to the believers in Corinth

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:28.299
in chapter number six of the first letter he writes them

00:07:28.299 --> 00:07:29.700
in first Corinthians six,

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.540
what?

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.220
Know ye not that what?

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.540
Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost,

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.739
which is in you what you have of God,

00:07:37.739 --> 00:07:41.940
and ye are not your own,

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.459
for you are bought with a price.

00:07:43.459 --> 00:07:45.940
Therefore, we're to glorify God.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:46.779
How?

00:07:46.779 --> 00:07:50.540
In every way, in every part of my being,

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.299
I am to glorify God.

00:07:52.299 --> 00:07:53.140
Why?

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.079
Because he owns me.

00:07:55.239 --> 00:07:56.420
It's a matter of authority.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.339
It's a matter of ownership.

00:07:58.339 --> 00:08:01.299
And we find this morning as we look at this truth

00:08:01.299 --> 00:08:02.579
as the apostle Paul,

00:08:02.579 --> 00:08:05.700
he's acknowledged the authority of God in his life.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.260
Understand with me that the apostle Paul,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.179
before his name was ever Paul,

00:08:10.179 --> 00:08:12.779
we know him as Saul.

00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:15.339
And we understand that Saul was a man

00:08:15.339 --> 00:08:17.059
that was a religious man.

00:08:17.059 --> 00:08:20.220
Saul was a man that knew the Old Testament.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.679
I mean, he was trained by the best of the best.

00:08:23.679 --> 00:08:26.859
He was extremely familiar with Judaism

00:08:26.859 --> 00:08:28.339
and all of its ins and outs.

00:08:28.339 --> 00:08:30.380
And he was a religious man,

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.940
but as he's going and persecuting

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.979
and giving consent to the death of Stephen

00:08:35.979 --> 00:08:37.419
and all that he's doing,

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:39.059
he has letters in his hand.

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:42.539
He has the authority that he could go

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:47.059
and put to death to imprison any that be of this way

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:50.539
or of that way, that being Christians.

00:08:50.539 --> 00:08:53.500
We find that the apostle Paul,

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.700
at that point, his name is Saul.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.419
He meets Jesus.

00:08:58.419 --> 00:09:01.739
In Acts chapter number nine, it's recorded for us.

00:09:01.739 --> 00:09:04.299
The Bible says that he sees this bright light

00:09:04.299 --> 00:09:05.900
and he hears a voice.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.739
And the voice is, Saul, Saul,

00:09:09.739 --> 00:09:12.460
why persecutest thou me?

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.940
And we find that Saul answers and says,

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.179
who art thou, Lord?

00:09:20.659 --> 00:09:24.820
I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.919
It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.119
There was a measure of conviction

00:09:29.119 --> 00:09:31.799
that was coming in Saul's life.

00:09:31.799 --> 00:09:34.840
And then Saul follows up the question

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.559
of who art thou, Lord, with this,

00:09:37.559 --> 00:09:40.840
Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.200
Isn't that amazing?

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.559
To consider immediately upon salvation

00:09:45.559 --> 00:09:48.559
how the apostle Paul, in that moment,

00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:52.400
he acknowledged, he recognized the authority of God

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.919
in his life that he's going with a certain purpose,

00:09:55.919 --> 00:09:57.599
with a certain agenda.

00:09:57.599 --> 00:09:59.799
But his life is transformed.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:03.239
If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.

00:10:03.239 --> 00:10:04.539
Old things are passed away.

00:10:04.539 --> 00:10:06.439
Behold, all things are become new.

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:10.159
And we find that this man, after his conversion,

00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:16.579
he says, Lord, what will Thou have me to do?

00:10:16.579 --> 00:10:19.919
He did not say, now, Lord, here's what I plan to do.

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:22.519
He didn't say, now, Lord, here's my ability.

00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:23.879
Here's my talent.

00:10:23.879 --> 00:10:27.679
Here's how you, God, can use me.

00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:33.639
No, he said, Lord, what will Thou have me to do?

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:38.119
Now, God used the apostle Paul in a mighty way.

00:10:38.119 --> 00:10:42.399
God used Paul to establish churches and regions

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:44.719
where the gospel had not yet been.

00:10:44.719 --> 00:10:48.159
He used Paul to stand before leaders,

00:10:48.159 --> 00:10:52.039
both religious and political, and to profess

00:10:52.039 --> 00:10:54.639
the gospel of Jesus Christ.

00:10:54.639 --> 00:10:58.399
But I believe that no matter, as we look at the life of Paul,

00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:01.279
I believe that no matter what God would have assigned him

00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:04.239
to do, he would have willingly done it.

00:11:04.239 --> 00:11:05.719
Why?

00:11:05.719 --> 00:11:08.279
Because he recognized God's authority.

00:11:08.279 --> 00:11:12.119
I believe this morning that when you and when

00:11:12.119 --> 00:11:16.479
I acknowledge God's authority in our lives,

00:11:16.479 --> 00:11:18.959
that it will have a great impact.

00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:22.879
It will change the direction of our lives.

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:25.719
Shortly after I got saved as a senior in high school,

00:11:25.719 --> 00:11:27.759
I mean, I was just a couple of days

00:11:27.759 --> 00:11:29.519
into my senior year of high school

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:31.479
when I trusted Christ as my Savior,

00:11:31.479 --> 00:11:34.639
when my life was changed radically

00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:38.479
by the truth of being born again.

00:11:38.479 --> 00:11:40.719
And my pastor at that time, you know,

00:11:40.719 --> 00:11:43.039
as a senior in high school, typically,

00:11:43.039 --> 00:11:44.919
you've already been thinking about what you're

00:11:44.919 --> 00:11:46.639
going to do with your life.

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:48.959
You've already considered the colleges

00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:51.519
that you potentially are going to attend,

00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:53.999
and perhaps even the majors that you're

00:11:53.999 --> 00:11:55.519
interested in pursuing.

00:11:55.519 --> 00:11:57.999
And I'd had those conversations, and I'd

00:11:57.999 --> 00:12:01.919
had those ambitions, and what have you.

00:12:01.919 --> 00:12:06.719
And I remember my pastor saying something like this

00:12:06.719 --> 00:12:08.879
after I got saved.

00:12:08.879 --> 00:12:13.159
He said, now, Chris, what does God

00:12:13.159 --> 00:12:15.839
want you to do with your life?

00:12:15.839 --> 00:12:17.719
You know, up until that point in my life,

00:12:17.719 --> 00:12:21.119
no one had ever asked me that question.

00:12:21.119 --> 00:12:23.599
You know, the question that I heard so often is,

00:12:23.599 --> 00:12:27.639
what do you want to do with your life?

00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:29.719
And if we're not careful, sometimes we still

00:12:29.719 --> 00:12:31.159
ask young people that question.

00:12:31.159 --> 00:12:33.039
Hey, what are you going to do with your life?

00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:34.879
What do you want to do with your life?

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:37.999
Can I tell you, if we're saved by the grace of God,

00:12:37.999 --> 00:12:40.799
the best question is not, what do I want to do with my life?

00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:44.039
It's, what does God want me to do with my life?

00:12:44.039 --> 00:12:48.079
We must acknowledge this morning God's authority.

00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:50.479
I believe that the Apostle Paul recognized

00:12:50.839 --> 00:12:54.199
and he acknowledged that God has authority in his life.

00:12:54.199 --> 00:12:57.119
When God opens a door, Paul goes forward.

00:12:57.119 --> 00:12:59.399
When God shuts a door, Paul waits.

00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:03.039
Paul understands God's authority.

00:13:03.039 --> 00:13:07.239
By the way, it is far better for God

00:13:07.239 --> 00:13:08.639
to have the authority in your life

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:11.479
than for you to have the authority in your life.

00:13:11.479 --> 00:13:14.079
Sometimes we want to hold on to that authority,

00:13:14.079 --> 00:13:16.599
that power, and think that we have control,

00:13:16.599 --> 00:13:19.199
but you know, oftentimes we end up shipwrecked.

00:13:20.159 --> 00:13:22.559
In fact, that's what Paul spoke of

00:13:22.559 --> 00:13:24.159
in the book of 1 Timothy.

00:13:24.159 --> 00:13:26.719
We talked about those that were shipwrecked.

00:13:26.719 --> 00:13:29.239
And the reality is that it's far better

00:13:29.239 --> 00:13:31.999
to let God have control.

00:13:31.999 --> 00:13:34.119
Perhaps some of you have seen the bumper sticker

00:13:34.119 --> 00:13:37.079
that says, God is my co-pilot.

00:13:37.079 --> 00:13:40.519
Can I tell you this morning, God better be your pilot.

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:41.999
Amen?

00:13:41.999 --> 00:13:43.359
God better be your pilot.

00:13:43.359 --> 00:13:45.879
He has all the authority in your life.

00:13:45.879 --> 00:13:48.479
That's true of every child of God.

00:13:48.519 --> 00:13:51.519
We mention even at times with pastors

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:53.359
moving from one place to another,

00:13:53.359 --> 00:13:55.439
or missionaries moving from one place

00:13:55.439 --> 00:13:56.679
of ministry to another.

00:13:56.679 --> 00:14:00.039
Listen, God is God, and he is the authority.

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:02.599
And if God tells us to move, we better move.

00:14:02.599 --> 00:14:05.439
If God tells us to stay, we better stay.

00:14:05.439 --> 00:14:07.279
Because God is the authority.

00:14:08.839 --> 00:14:10.519
And that's true of every child of God.

00:14:10.519 --> 00:14:11.959
I've heard people say, I'm gonna move.

00:14:11.959 --> 00:14:13.919
I'm gonna move here, I'm gonna go do this.

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:16.440
Are you sure that's what God wants you to do?

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.159
I'm not God, I can't tell you,

00:14:18.839 --> 00:14:21.399
but I better encourage you and counsel you

00:14:21.399 --> 00:14:24.359
to know that it's the will of God.

00:14:25.599 --> 00:14:26.839
God's authority.

00:14:26.839 --> 00:14:29.919
See, we find that Paul first acknowledged

00:14:29.919 --> 00:14:31.679
the authority of God in his life.

00:14:31.679 --> 00:14:36.679
Number two, Paul acknowledged God's will for his life.

00:14:37.119 --> 00:14:39.479
Notice in verse number one, he says,

00:14:39.479 --> 00:14:43.639
Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God.

00:14:43.639 --> 00:14:45.879
And so we find that there's an acknowledgement

00:14:45.879 --> 00:14:47.319
of God's authority.

00:14:47.319 --> 00:14:52.319
God is sovereign and God has the right.

00:14:52.639 --> 00:14:55.199
And we find that Paul also acknowledged

00:14:55.199 --> 00:14:58.199
what God's will was for his life.

00:14:58.199 --> 00:15:02.239
He says that his will, he's an apostle of Jesus Christ

00:15:02.239 --> 00:15:04.720
by the will of God.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.000
Can you understand with me just for a moment this morning

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.199
that the apostle Paul did not submit an application

00:15:10.199 --> 00:15:11.479
to be an apostle.

00:15:11.479 --> 00:15:14.839
He did not submit an application with the resume

00:15:14.839 --> 00:15:16.199
and he came to the, no.

00:15:16.199 --> 00:15:19.239
We find that it was the Lord's will

00:15:19.239 --> 00:15:22.000
that Paul be an apostle.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.879
And we find that Paul embraced that, why?

00:15:24.879 --> 00:15:26.759
Because he understood authority.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:29.379
Because of understanding the authority,

00:15:29.379 --> 00:15:33.959
it's no problem accepting the will of God for our lives.

00:15:33.959 --> 00:15:37.879
Because if I do not understand the authority of God,

00:15:37.879 --> 00:15:41.079
if you do not understand the authority of God,

00:15:41.079 --> 00:15:43.839
it's gonna be really difficult to accept

00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:46.000
and acknowledge the will of God.

00:15:47.639 --> 00:15:51.039
We start with acknowledging the authority of God.

00:15:51.039 --> 00:15:54.639
It's interesting here in 2 Timothy chapter one,

00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:57.559
he says Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ

00:15:57.559 --> 00:15:59.759
by the will of God.

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:02.259
If you turn back a few pages in your Bible

00:16:02.259 --> 00:16:03.519
and look at the beginning,

00:16:03.519 --> 00:16:06.799
the introduction to the book of 1 Timothy,

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:09.500
I want you to notice how Paul references it here

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.119
in 1 Timothy.

00:16:11.119 --> 00:16:16.079
He says this in 1 Timothy one and verse number one,

00:16:16.079 --> 00:16:18.679
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ.

00:16:18.679 --> 00:16:20.979
So we understand his office.

00:16:20.979 --> 00:16:23.440
He says in chapter, in the second letter,

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.479
by the will of God, here he says,

00:16:25.479 --> 00:16:29.000
by the commandment of God.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:29.839
It's kind of interesting.

00:16:29.839 --> 00:16:32.879
He uses in the first letter, the commandment of God

00:16:32.879 --> 00:16:35.239
and the second letter, the will of God.

00:16:35.239 --> 00:16:38.399
Do you know that God's commandment to you and to me

00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:40.239
is God's will?

00:16:40.239 --> 00:16:43.500
And God's will for you and I is his commandment.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.159
They really can be used synonymously.

00:16:47.159 --> 00:16:51.459
And we understand this morning that God gave a command

00:16:51.459 --> 00:16:54.599
and Paul understood that command

00:16:54.599 --> 00:16:58.279
to be also God's will for his life.

00:16:58.279 --> 00:17:01.720
And what a joy to think about the apostle Paul

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.720
fulfilling what God had desired for him to do.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.959
Listen to me this morning,

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:10.079
God's will is not simply revealed to me

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.279
or to you so that we could consider it.

00:17:13.279 --> 00:17:16.199
God's will is revealed to us so that we would fulfill it.

00:17:17.239 --> 00:17:20.399
God's will is not something that's open for consideration.

00:17:20.399 --> 00:17:23.559
Far too often though, that's how we deal with it.

00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:26.199
Well, I'll consider that, I'll think about that.

00:17:26.199 --> 00:17:28.479
Maybe we even say, I'll pray about that.

00:17:29.359 --> 00:17:32.319
But when God makes his will clear to us,

00:17:32.319 --> 00:17:35.199
it is not something for me to simply consider,

00:17:35.199 --> 00:17:38.479
to think over, no, it is for me to fulfill,

00:17:38.479 --> 00:17:40.479
for me to simply obey.

00:17:40.479 --> 00:17:44.239
By the way, it's a joy to know

00:17:44.239 --> 00:17:46.839
that you're doing what God wants you to do.

00:17:46.839 --> 00:17:50.000
It is an absolute joy to know that you're in the very place

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.859
where God wants you to be doing what God wants you to do.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.519
We find here this morning that understanding

00:17:57.519 --> 00:18:01.720
the authority of God helps me to obey the will of God.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.639
And Paul acknowledged in these first few words

00:18:04.639 --> 00:18:06.679
of the second letter to Timothy,

00:18:06.679 --> 00:18:10.239
that he's an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God.

00:18:10.239 --> 00:18:12.039
How does this help Timothy?

00:18:12.039 --> 00:18:15.739
Well, Timothy had a position as well.

00:18:15.739 --> 00:18:18.720
Timothy had to understand God's authority as well.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.479
And as Paul is seeking to encourage his son in the faith

00:18:22.479 --> 00:18:25.940
who's dealing with adversity and opposition in Ephesus,

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.799
Paul reminds him of what he personally

00:18:29.799 --> 00:18:31.079
had acknowledged in his life.

00:18:31.079 --> 00:18:33.519
By the way, Paul faced much persecution

00:18:33.519 --> 00:18:35.080
and adversity as well.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.000
What kept him going?

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.080
God's authority and God's will.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.479
Because he knew that God had authority in his life

00:18:44.479 --> 00:18:46.080
and he knew the will of God.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.440
And therefore he continued to do

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.559
what God had commanded him to do.

00:18:51.559 --> 00:18:55.159
How would Timothy be able to continue in Ephesus?

00:18:55.159 --> 00:18:58.080
How would Timothy be able to come to the end of his life

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.000
and say, as Paul will say in the fourth chapter,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.640
I have finished, I have completed,

00:19:05.239 --> 00:19:08.159
I have fulfilled what God had for me to do.

00:19:08.159 --> 00:19:11.399
How could Timothy in the midst of the opposition

00:19:11.399 --> 00:19:13.760
and the adversity, well, Timothy,

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:18.760
he better understand and acknowledge the authority of God.

00:19:18.839 --> 00:19:22.519
And he better understand and acknowledge the will of God.

00:19:22.519 --> 00:19:23.919
Listen, God's will doesn't change

00:19:23.919 --> 00:19:26.559
just because there's some opposition.

00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:31.559
We don't just run in the face of adversity or opposition.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.019
No, if we're doing the will of God,

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.739
we continue, we remain steadfast, why?

00:19:37.739 --> 00:19:40.700
Because we're doing the will of God.

00:19:41.659 --> 00:19:43.380
And Timothy had to understand that.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.619
Let me say to you this morning

00:19:44.619 --> 00:19:48.019
that we too must understand this truth.

00:19:48.019 --> 00:19:50.700
We must acknowledge God's authority.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.899
Who's the authority in your life?

00:19:52.899 --> 00:19:54.779
Honestly, who's the authority in your life?

00:19:54.779 --> 00:19:56.419
Who's the authority in my life?

00:19:57.739 --> 00:20:00.419
God is the ultimate authority.

00:20:00.419 --> 00:20:06.299
authority in our lives and we must acknowledge that this morning. What is God's will for your life?

00:20:06.659 --> 00:20:11.319
Do you know God's will? Are you doing God's will? Are you fulfilling the will of God?

00:20:11.319 --> 00:20:16.259
I'll tell you this morning that at times no doubt the will of God can be a scary thing.

00:20:16.859 --> 00:20:21.699
I mean when God first called me to preach, I thought you got the wrong guy. Like that's not for me.

00:20:21.699 --> 00:20:23.699
That's not something I'm interested in doing.

00:20:24.819 --> 00:20:26.819
But the question kept coming back.

00:20:27.779 --> 00:20:29.939
What does God want you to do?

00:20:30.499 --> 00:20:36.899
What is God's will? He acknowledges something else in this text of scripture. Notice with me number three.

00:20:37.379 --> 00:20:40.659
The Apostle Paul acknowledged that God is the source

00:20:41.459 --> 00:20:43.059
of grace,

00:20:43.059 --> 00:20:44.179
mercy,

00:20:44.179 --> 00:20:45.459
and peace.

00:20:45.459 --> 00:20:49.299
The Bible says in verse number two to Timothy, my dearly beloved son,

00:20:50.019 --> 00:20:51.219
grace,

00:20:51.219 --> 00:20:52.179
mercy,

00:20:52.179 --> 00:20:53.539
and peace.

00:20:53.539 --> 00:20:55.539
From God the Father

00:20:56.019 --> 00:20:58.019
and Christ Jesus,

00:20:58.259 --> 00:21:00.259
our Lord.

00:21:00.499 --> 00:21:02.019
Grace,

00:21:02.019 --> 00:21:03.379
mercy,

00:21:03.379 --> 00:21:05.059
and peace.

00:21:05.059 --> 00:21:11.399
We understand as we speak about grace and the unmerited favor, love, and favor of God. We understand

00:21:12.099 --> 00:21:14.259
grace. We sing about amazing grace.

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:20.339
We talk about saving grace and no doubt for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves

00:21:20.419 --> 00:21:26.259
is the gift of God, not of works lest any man should boast. And we understand being

00:21:26.899 --> 00:21:32.419
saved by grace, but we acknowledge this morning that Paul is writing to a saved man.

00:21:32.739 --> 00:21:38.099
He's writing to Timothy, his own son in the faith that's saved. He's going to heaven.

00:21:38.419 --> 00:21:40.579
He's been born again. He's a child of the king,

00:21:41.139 --> 00:21:43.139
but he says grace.

00:21:44.019 --> 00:21:46.659
We look in the scriptures and we find that not only

00:21:47.779 --> 00:21:50.499
is there saving grace, but there's serving grace.

00:21:51.299 --> 00:21:53.299
The grace to serve God.

00:21:53.779 --> 00:21:55.779
The grace,

00:21:56.419 --> 00:22:01.619
the ability that God gives us to do what God has called us to do.

00:22:02.019 --> 00:22:09.059
In fact, we find that Paul says this, for by the grace of God I am what I am. We find that Paul

00:22:09.919 --> 00:22:13.779
acknowledges this as he's praying for deliverance and God says

00:22:14.419 --> 00:22:18.979
as he did not deliver him, he says in 2 Corinthians chapter 12, my grace

00:22:19.699 --> 00:22:21.299
is sufficient

00:22:21.299 --> 00:22:25.619
for thee. We find that Peter would say that we're to be good

00:22:26.079 --> 00:22:32.019
stewards of the manifold grace of God in 1 Peter chapter 4. Within the context

00:22:32.639 --> 00:22:39.059
specifically, the Bible says as every man hath received the gift, even so minister.

00:22:40.899 --> 00:22:46.259
Right? And we see that he says how are we to minister as being good stewards of the manifold grace of God?

00:22:46.499 --> 00:22:50.899
And the reason by which we minister is so that God might receive the glory.

00:22:51.379 --> 00:22:57.619
So that God would be exalted and magnified. And so we find this truth of grace that's being

00:22:58.559 --> 00:23:02.579
reminded to Timothy of God's grace. Oh, that grace

00:23:02.979 --> 00:23:07.079
would be evidenced in your life that you would understand

00:23:08.099 --> 00:23:10.099
the grace of God.

00:23:10.419 --> 00:23:12.339
He says mercy.

00:23:12.339 --> 00:23:14.099
Mercy.

00:23:14.099 --> 00:23:17.799
I'm thankful that the Bible tells us that his mercy endureth

00:23:18.639 --> 00:23:20.179
forever.

00:23:20.179 --> 00:23:23.719
I'm thankful this morning, mercy dealing with compassion that's manifested

00:23:24.659 --> 00:23:26.659
towards a person

00:23:26.819 --> 00:23:28.819
in distress.

00:23:28.979 --> 00:23:32.419
That's one of many definitions for mercy.

00:23:32.739 --> 00:23:35.139
But I think specifically with regard to

00:23:35.619 --> 00:23:41.459
the writing of this particular letter to his son in the faith, to Timothy as a pastor, as a

00:23:42.019 --> 00:23:49.139
leader there in Ephesus, that he, the apostle Paul, is saying, listen, yes, there's going to be times of distress,

00:23:49.219 --> 00:23:51.379
but I'm praying for God's mercy

00:23:52.099 --> 00:23:54.019
in your life.

00:23:54.019 --> 00:23:55.859
God's grace.

00:23:55.859 --> 00:23:59.539
God's mercy. But then notice number three. He says

00:24:00.339 --> 00:24:02.099
peace.

00:24:02.099 --> 00:24:04.019
Peace.

00:24:04.019 --> 00:24:05.699
Harmony and rest.

00:24:05.699 --> 00:24:12.339
Psalm 118 and 165 says, great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them.

00:24:13.379 --> 00:24:18.499
Great peace have they which love thy law. I'm thankful that our God is the prince of peace.

00:24:18.579 --> 00:24:26.979
I'm thankful that he gives a peace according to what the Bible says in Philippians 4 and verse number 7 is a peace that passeth all

00:24:28.079 --> 00:24:29.219
understanding.

00:24:29.219 --> 00:24:33.059
We're to allow, let the peace of God rule

00:24:33.859 --> 00:24:36.119
in our hearts according to the book of Colossians.

00:24:37.379 --> 00:24:39.379
We find that Paul,

00:24:39.699 --> 00:24:47.779
as he's speaking to Timothy as he's writing this letter, Paul acknowledged that God alone is the source of grace.

00:24:48.499 --> 00:24:49.779
mercy

00:24:49.779 --> 00:24:51.619
and peace.

00:24:51.619 --> 00:24:54.899
Peace is not simply found in the absence of trouble.

00:24:55.619 --> 00:25:02.659
So often we find that the mindset of an individual is that if I could just have my life void of trouble,

00:25:03.299 --> 00:25:06.339
then I might achieve peace in my life.

00:25:07.219 --> 00:25:13.459
The problem is that God reveals to us in the book of Job that man is born a woman of few days and full of troubles.

00:25:14.419 --> 00:25:20.179
The psalmist says that God has delivered me out of all my troubles and no doubt

00:25:20.579 --> 00:25:24.279
we understand that as we live in this life, there will be troubles.

00:25:25.219 --> 00:25:27.539
But you know that we can have peace in the midst of trouble.

00:25:28.339 --> 00:25:30.339
Why? Because peace comes from God.

00:25:31.219 --> 00:25:36.499
Peace is not found in the absence of trouble rather in the very presence of God.

00:25:37.859 --> 00:25:42.659
So understand that my God is on his throne. My God has a plan.

00:25:43.219 --> 00:25:44.659
My God

00:25:44.659 --> 00:25:51.399
loves me with an everlasting love, with a love that is beyond my ability to fully comprehend.

00:25:51.859 --> 00:25:54.019
And I find that I can have great peace.

00:25:55.059 --> 00:25:56.739
Great peace.

00:25:56.739 --> 00:25:58.419
This morning

00:25:58.419 --> 00:26:02.839
we look at these two verses of scripture and we find that Paul acknowledged

00:26:03.859 --> 00:26:05.859
the authority of God in his life.

00:26:06.179 --> 00:26:10.259
I hope that every one of us this morning would acknowledge God's authority in our lives.

00:26:10.899 --> 00:26:13.939
I am not the authority of my life. God is.

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:17.399
And I must. If I understand, if I recognize,

00:26:18.499 --> 00:26:21.639
if I acknowledge this morning that he is the authority,

00:26:22.579 --> 00:26:24.579
then it will help me to do

00:26:25.059 --> 00:26:27.059
what he commands me to do.

00:26:27.219 --> 00:26:31.539
And Paul acknowledged the will of God. I'm an apostle of Jesus Christ by

00:26:32.179 --> 00:26:34.179
the will of God.

00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:36.979
I want to fulfill what God's will is for my life.

00:26:37.619 --> 00:26:42.899
And he acknowledged that God is the source for grace, mercy, and peace. Paul knew

00:26:43.859 --> 00:26:45.939
he'd been in the ministry for a number of years.

00:26:46.579 --> 00:26:47.699
Paul knew

00:26:47.699 --> 00:26:53.779
the hardships and the difficulties that would be encountered, the opposition that would be faced. And Paul knew

00:26:54.259 --> 00:26:56.259
that he himself needed grace,

00:26:56.819 --> 00:26:57.859
mercy,

00:26:57.859 --> 00:27:06.739
and peace. And therefore, as he writes to Timothy, he says grace, mercy, and peace. Why? Because Timothy, if he's going to fulfill

00:27:07.059 --> 00:27:09.379
what God has for him, he needs grace,

00:27:09.939 --> 00:27:11.939
mercy, and peace.

00:27:11.939 --> 00:27:15.779
So do you. So do I. I'm thankful that God is the source

00:27:16.339 --> 00:27:17.779
of grace,

00:27:17.779 --> 00:27:18.979
mercy,

00:27:18.979 --> 00:27:20.259
and peace.

00:27:20.259 --> 00:27:22.099
Number two,

00:27:22.099 --> 00:27:28.519
in your notes this morning, we, number one, notice what Paul acknowledged. Number two, notice what Paul appreciated.

00:27:29.539 --> 00:27:32.819
What did he appreciate? Well, as I look at these two verses of scripture and just kind of

00:27:33.139 --> 00:27:36.499
meditate upon them, and I begin to find that Paul,

00:27:37.059 --> 00:27:43.779
in these two verses, he reveals some things to us. I believe that that one thing that he appreciated, if you're taking notes,

00:27:43.779 --> 00:27:48.739
he appreciated the work of the ministry. He appreciated the work of the ministry. You know,

00:27:49.619 --> 00:27:52.679
I believe that Paul believed that it was a privilege to be an apostle.

00:27:54.099 --> 00:27:56.359
He said that he was the least of all the apostles.

00:27:57.059 --> 00:28:00.979
He says in the same text that I mentioned a moment ago that I am what I am by the grace of God.

00:28:01.219 --> 00:28:06.339
Listen, Paul, I believe he appreciated the opportunity to serve God.

00:28:07.299 --> 00:28:11.539
Do you recognize this morning what a blessing it is to serve the Lord?

00:28:12.339 --> 00:28:13.539
I mean,

00:28:13.539 --> 00:28:20.499
there are times in which we think about service to God, and maybe we think about it just in the context of the preacher

00:28:21.059 --> 00:28:27.219
standing up and preaching as I'm doing now, or the musicians standing up and singing as they did a few moments ago.

00:28:27.379 --> 00:28:32.419
But I'm telling you, it's a blessing to serve God when you're cutting the grass of God's property, when you're

00:28:32.659 --> 00:28:40.099
vacuuming the floors in the house of the Lord, when you're a doorkeeper, is what the book of Psalms says, in the house of the Lord.

00:28:40.899 --> 00:28:42.260
Amen?

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:47.539
Why? It's just a privilege to serve him. He's the king of kings, lord of lords. He's the creator of the universe.

00:28:47.859 --> 00:28:53.380
He has all power, all authority, and I know me and you know you,

00:28:54.339 --> 00:28:58.019
and he says that he would allow us to serve him.

00:28:58.739 --> 00:29:00.739
It's absolutely amazing.

00:29:00.979 --> 00:29:02.979
I think,

00:29:03.219 --> 00:29:05.219
as I studied the scriptures,

00:29:05.539 --> 00:29:09.239
I think that there probably wasn't a day that passed that Paul didn't appreciate

00:29:10.179 --> 00:29:12.179
what God did in his life.

00:29:12.339 --> 00:29:14.979
Not only by saving his soul, but letting him serve.

00:29:15.859 --> 00:29:20.179
Can you imagine? It's a joy and privilege to serve the Lord. We sing the song,

00:29:20.179 --> 00:29:25.380
there is joy in serving Jesus. And there is, there's joy.

00:29:26.339 --> 00:29:28.339
We get to go and be his

00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:35.299
representatives, his ambassadors, to be able to serve. I believe that specifically as we look here and think about the apostle Paul,

00:29:35.459 --> 00:29:39.619
yes, he's appreciative of the work of the ministry, the privilege of being an apostle.

00:29:39.779 --> 00:29:46.419
I think also he's appreciative of the ministry with regard to the role of being a mentor. Notice

00:29:46.419 --> 00:29:51.299
he says in verse number two, to Timothy, my dearly beloved son.

00:29:51.859 --> 00:29:58.339
That opportunity to be a mentor, the ability to influence somebody else for the cause of Christ.

00:29:58.739 --> 00:30:00.739
I mean, what a joy.

00:30:00.739 --> 00:30:04.819
we ought to appreciate the fact that God would use us

00:30:04.819 --> 00:30:08.499
to be able to have an impact in someone else's life.

00:30:08.499 --> 00:30:13.499
I hope this morning that you have in your life a Paul,

00:30:15.259 --> 00:30:17.859
somebody that invested in you,

00:30:17.859 --> 00:30:22.859
somebody that discipled you, somebody that taught you.

00:30:23.339 --> 00:30:26.259
I've heard before preachers say

00:30:26.499 --> 00:30:31.139
that every Christian needs to have a Paul.

00:30:31.139 --> 00:30:31.979
What do they mean by that?

00:30:31.979 --> 00:30:35.099
Well, somebody that mentors us,

00:30:35.099 --> 00:30:40.099
somebody that instructs us, somebody that invests in us.

00:30:40.099 --> 00:30:42.679
Maybe this morning, even as I make those statements,

00:30:42.679 --> 00:30:46.579
you can think in your mind of who your Paul is.

00:30:46.579 --> 00:30:49.899
It's interesting for me, my Paul is Paul.

00:30:49.899 --> 00:30:51.739
Paul Mershon is his name,

00:30:51.739 --> 00:30:55.439
and he's a man that has the same name as this apostle,

00:30:55.439 --> 00:30:59.159
and many of you know him, and he is a mentor to me.

00:30:59.159 --> 00:31:01.219
I spent an hour on the phone with him on Thursday

00:31:01.219 --> 00:31:02.679
to see how he and his wife are doing

00:31:02.679 --> 00:31:04.919
because of the current situations,

00:31:04.919 --> 00:31:09.579
and man, he's just invested in me over the years.

00:31:09.579 --> 00:31:11.159
And oh, how I appreciate that.

00:31:11.159 --> 00:31:12.319
He's not the only Paul.

00:31:12.319 --> 00:31:13.379
There's a number of others

00:31:13.379 --> 00:31:15.279
that I could mention this morning by name

00:31:15.279 --> 00:31:19.179
that have actively invested in my life.

00:31:20.219 --> 00:31:21.959
Just like every believer needs a Paul,

00:31:21.959 --> 00:31:24.319
I'll say this, every believer needs a Timothy.

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:26.119
What do I mean by that?

00:31:26.119 --> 00:31:28.079
Well, Paul had a Timothy.

00:31:28.079 --> 00:31:29.479
Who's your Timothy?

00:31:29.479 --> 00:31:31.559
Who are you investing in?

00:31:31.559 --> 00:31:35.919
Who are you trying to be a mentor to,

00:31:35.919 --> 00:31:38.119
that you're trying to point them to Christ,

00:31:38.119 --> 00:31:40.439
that you're trying to lead them along

00:31:40.439 --> 00:31:43.519
in their journey and their walk with Christ?

00:31:43.519 --> 00:31:45.679
You understand this morning,

00:31:45.679 --> 00:31:49.239
I enjoy, I thoroughly love discipleship.

00:31:49.239 --> 00:31:50.279
I truly do.

00:31:50.279 --> 00:31:52.979
I love sitting down with people on a one-on-one

00:31:52.979 --> 00:31:56.659
or a one-on-two kind of a setting in my office

00:31:56.659 --> 00:31:58.719
and just discipling people,

00:31:58.719 --> 00:32:02.019
just teaching them and having questions and answers

00:32:02.019 --> 00:32:03.659
and all of that, it's enjoyable.

00:32:03.659 --> 00:32:04.779
But you understand this morning

00:32:04.779 --> 00:32:07.799
that I can't do that with every single person,

00:32:07.799 --> 00:32:09.459
nor is it really my job.

00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:14.459
Every Christian should have a Timothy.

00:32:14.459 --> 00:32:16.179
Who are we investing in?

00:32:16.179 --> 00:32:17.819
I mean, purposefully.

00:32:17.819 --> 00:32:20.539
Who are we seeking to influence?

00:32:20.539 --> 00:32:22.799
Acknowledging and appreciating the fact

00:32:23.639 --> 00:32:24.479
that God would use us.

00:32:24.479 --> 00:32:25.919
You say, well, I don't know everything.

00:32:25.919 --> 00:32:28.519
Listen, whatever you do know, you can help somebody with.

00:32:28.519 --> 00:32:31.599
You can let them know what God's done in your life

00:32:31.599 --> 00:32:34.919
and you can lead them and teach them.

00:32:36.839 --> 00:32:38.959
It's also said in that same context

00:32:38.959 --> 00:32:40.839
that every Christian needs a Barnabas

00:32:40.839 --> 00:32:43.499
and we understand how he encouraged.

00:32:45.099 --> 00:32:49.079
Paul often was encouraged by others.

00:32:49.079 --> 00:32:50.759
In fact, in this first chapter,

00:32:50.759 --> 00:32:53.839
he mentions a man by the name of Anesiphorus,

00:32:53.839 --> 00:32:57.759
a man that oft refreshed him is what he says.

00:32:57.759 --> 00:32:59.199
He oft refreshed me.

00:32:59.199 --> 00:33:00.759
What a blessing.

00:33:00.759 --> 00:33:02.599
The thing about Barnabas and the ministry that he had

00:33:02.599 --> 00:33:04.959
in the life of the Apostle Paul early on

00:33:06.679 --> 00:33:09.399
with regard to Paul's ministry,

00:33:09.399 --> 00:33:12.199
this morning we ought to be encouraging one another.

00:33:12.199 --> 00:33:13.399
You know what Paul appreciated?

00:33:13.399 --> 00:33:15.559
He appreciated that God saved him

00:33:15.559 --> 00:33:17.719
and God would let him serve him.

00:33:17.719 --> 00:33:19.259
I hope this morning you appreciate

00:33:19.259 --> 00:33:21.059
the privilege of serving.

00:33:21.059 --> 00:33:22.739
You say, well, all I do is cut the grass.

00:33:22.739 --> 00:33:25.539
Praise God, praise God.

00:33:25.539 --> 00:33:27.819
All I can do anymore is this, praise God.

00:33:27.819 --> 00:33:30.319
Everyone can't, listen, can you know how chaotic it'd be

00:33:30.319 --> 00:33:32.919
if all of us tried to preach right now at the same time?

00:33:32.919 --> 00:33:34.399
It'd be absolute mess.

00:33:34.399 --> 00:33:35.339
Would it not?

00:33:36.339 --> 00:33:37.179
Would it not?

00:33:38.459 --> 00:33:40.359
I remember talking to a man years ago.

00:33:41.619 --> 00:33:43.219
I would describe him as a senior saint.

00:33:43.219 --> 00:33:45.579
I think he would describe himself the same way.

00:33:46.699 --> 00:33:47.979
And he met with me one day and he said,

00:33:47.979 --> 00:33:49.739
Pastor, I just can't do this anymore

00:33:49.739 --> 00:33:52.499
and I can't do this anymore and I can't do this anymore

00:33:52.499 --> 00:33:54.339
and I just can't do this anymore

00:33:54.339 --> 00:33:55.619
and I can't do this anymore.

00:33:55.619 --> 00:33:57.219
And I kind of, after about four or five things,

00:33:57.219 --> 00:33:59.379
I just kind of stopped them.

00:33:59.379 --> 00:34:00.779
And I said, listen,

00:34:00.779 --> 00:34:03.779
I really don't care about what you can't do.

00:34:03.779 --> 00:34:06.819
Here's what I want to know, what can you do?

00:34:06.819 --> 00:34:08.999
Because if you're still here,

00:34:08.999 --> 00:34:11.259
there's something that God can use you to do.

00:34:12.259 --> 00:34:14.899
God can use you to do something.

00:34:14.899 --> 00:34:17.179
And you know, when I asked that gentleman that question,

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:18.339
his whole demeanor changed

00:34:18.339 --> 00:34:20.819
because he's really kind of overwhelmed

00:34:20.819 --> 00:34:22.119
with a measure of sadness

00:34:22.119 --> 00:34:24.199
because of the things that he no longer could do

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:26.139
because of his elevated age.

00:34:27.079 --> 00:34:28.779
And I said, well, what are some things that you can do?

00:34:28.779 --> 00:34:30.019
And he said, well, I can do this.

00:34:30.019 --> 00:34:32.039
And I was like, you know, as far as I know,

00:34:32.039 --> 00:34:34.619
there's no one else in our church that can do that.

00:34:36.259 --> 00:34:37.899
That's how God has equipped you.

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:41.139
And that's what God wants you to do.

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:43.099
And his countenance just completely changed

00:34:43.099 --> 00:34:44.019
through that conversation.

00:34:44.019 --> 00:34:44.859
Why?

00:34:45.819 --> 00:34:49.019
Because he recognized there's still something

00:34:49.019 --> 00:34:51.819
that God can use me to do.

00:34:51.819 --> 00:34:56.739
And it's a joy to serve Christ.

00:34:56.739 --> 00:34:57.979
What did Paul appreciate?

00:34:57.979 --> 00:34:59.539
Well, he appreciated the work of the ministry.

00:34:59.539 --> 00:35:03.779
Number two, I think he appreciated physical life.

00:35:03.779 --> 00:35:05.319
He says this in verse number one,

00:35:05.319 --> 00:35:07.819
notice it says, Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ,

00:35:07.819 --> 00:35:09.739
by the will of God, notice it says,

00:35:09.739 --> 00:35:13.660
according to the promise of life, which is in Christ Jesus.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:15.859
Now, I'm gonna get to a final point here in just a moment,

00:35:15.859 --> 00:35:18.819
but I do think there is an acknowledgement here

00:35:18.819 --> 00:35:22.139
of being appreciative of life, physical life.

00:35:22.139 --> 00:35:24.539
Somebody says, you've heard people say it before,

00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:26.139
that every day I put my feet on the ground,

00:35:26.139 --> 00:35:28.339
I thank God for the day that he's given me.

00:35:28.339 --> 00:35:30.059
The Bible says this in Psalm 118,

00:35:30.059 --> 00:35:32.739
this is the day the Lord hath made.

00:35:32.739 --> 00:35:36.179
We will rejoice and be glad in it.

00:35:36.179 --> 00:35:39.539
God is the author and giver of life.

00:35:39.539 --> 00:35:41.419
He's given you the ability to breathe

00:35:41.459 --> 00:35:43.819
and to have life today.

00:35:43.819 --> 00:35:44.899
But he asked this question,

00:35:44.899 --> 00:35:49.339
or he tells us this truth in his word, what is your life?

00:35:49.339 --> 00:35:51.339
It's but a vapor that appears for a little time

00:35:51.339 --> 00:35:54.339
and then vanisheth away.

00:35:54.339 --> 00:35:57.259
We find that here in 2 Timothy chapter number one,

00:35:57.259 --> 00:36:01.179
as Paul is taking out the pen and he's writing this letter

00:36:01.179 --> 00:36:03.539
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:36:03.539 --> 00:36:08.539
we find that Paul is sitting in a prison awaiting death.

00:36:12.419 --> 00:36:14.739
As Paul was aware of the reality

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:16.940
that he would soon be put to death,

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:20.299
I believe that this reality would cause Paul,

00:36:20.299 --> 00:36:24.259
but really would cause any individual to evaluate

00:36:25.139 --> 00:36:29.779
and to appreciate the gift of life that was given to them.

00:36:31.579 --> 00:36:35.019
I'm so thankful for life.

00:36:36.179 --> 00:36:39.899
And I think Paul, he was thankful for life.

00:36:39.899 --> 00:36:42.940
But I think greater than being thankful for physical life,

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.859
as it says, the promise of life, which is in Christ Jesus,

00:36:45.859 --> 00:36:48.380
I think in a far greater sense,

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:52.019
he was appreciative of the truth of eternal life,

00:36:52.019 --> 00:36:53.299
of eternal life.

00:36:53.299 --> 00:36:56.979
See, Peter says it this way,

00:36:56.979 --> 00:37:00.380
that his tabernacle he would soon put off.

00:37:01.299 --> 00:37:03.059
In other words, he would die.

00:37:03.059 --> 00:37:05.019
I said to a half a dozen people yesterday

00:37:05.019 --> 00:37:06.819
as we're out door knocking,

00:37:06.819 --> 00:37:08.539
that one day we're gonna die.

00:37:08.539 --> 00:37:10.339
And I said this to several of them,

00:37:10.339 --> 00:37:12.579
that David said in the book of 1 Samuel,

00:37:12.579 --> 00:37:14.940
there's but a step between me and death.

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.019
I said, no, contextually,

00:37:16.019 --> 00:37:17.339
the reason that David says that

00:37:17.339 --> 00:37:22.339
is because Saul's trying to kill him, hunting him.

00:37:23.099 --> 00:37:25.059
And David says there's but a step between me and death,

00:37:25.059 --> 00:37:27.179
but in a very real way,

00:37:27.179 --> 00:37:30.500
in a very real way, for all of us this morning,

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.500
there's but a step between me and death.

00:37:33.979 --> 00:37:35.940
You say, oh no, I'm young, I'm full of life.

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:39.459
And I got, have you ever read the obituaries?

00:37:39.459 --> 00:37:43.660
Have you ever gone through a cemetery or a graveyard?

00:37:45.139 --> 00:37:48.019
You can find, I don't enjoy doing that,

00:37:49.619 --> 00:37:51.539
but I have before, and you can go through

00:37:51.539 --> 00:37:55.699
and you can see dates on headstones.

00:37:55.699 --> 00:38:00.699
And you can see some that the individual was 70, 80, 90.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:05.299
Some that they're seven, eight, nine.

00:38:06.339 --> 00:38:10.500
Some that are just infants, days old.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:11.380
Am I not right?

00:38:14.099 --> 00:38:16.019
I spoke with a man years ago,

00:38:17.539 --> 00:38:20.699
Mary Finley's granddaughter was dying.

00:38:20.699 --> 00:38:22.579
Some of you wouldn't remember Mary Finley

00:38:22.579 --> 00:38:25.339
and her granddaughter was dying

00:38:25.339 --> 00:38:27.919
and she's probably about my age.

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.419
And her husband was Chris and I sat in the room,

00:38:31.419 --> 00:38:34.099
Holly and I were sitting there with them

00:38:34.099 --> 00:38:39.099
and the doctor had given her just a few days to live.

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:46.140
As best I knew, and in fact, as best I still know today,

00:38:46.339 --> 00:38:48.260
Chris was not a saved person.

00:38:50.459 --> 00:38:54.059
The focus in that particular day was not on Chris,

00:38:54.059 --> 00:38:57.099
but on his wife who had been given the words

00:38:57.099 --> 00:38:59.859
from the doctor that you just have a few days to live.

00:39:00.899 --> 00:39:03.500
But as best I knew and what had been communicated to me

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:06.419
was she had trusted Christ as her savior.

00:39:06.419 --> 00:39:09.779
So I knew and I had assurance that if that were true,

00:39:10.899 --> 00:39:12.459
based upon the truth of the Bible,

00:39:12.459 --> 00:39:16.179
that she would enter into heaven

00:39:16.179 --> 00:39:18.979
because her physical life would end,

00:39:18.979 --> 00:39:21.619
but she would cross that door

00:39:21.619 --> 00:39:24.299
and enter into the presence of heaven.

00:39:24.299 --> 00:39:26.339
So my concern really was Chris.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.820
And I said this to Chris, I said, listen,

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:31.479
I understand what the doctors have said

00:39:31.479 --> 00:39:33.039
and you understand what the doctors have said,

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.959
but you know that either one of us could die before she does.

00:39:39.239 --> 00:39:42.520
I had driven to their house that day and I said, listen,

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.359
I could get in the car to go back to the office

00:39:44.359 --> 00:39:45.599
and I could die in a car accident

00:39:45.599 --> 00:39:47.559
on the way back to the office.

00:39:47.559 --> 00:39:49.959
You know, people die in car accidents all the time.

00:39:50.799 --> 00:39:51.640
All the time.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.799
We're about a step between us and death.

00:39:55.799 --> 00:40:00.760
And Paul knew that his physical life was soon going to end.

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:09.560
But I think Paul appreciated the truth of eternal life, in this great sense of being

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:13.360
a recipient of the gift of God, which is eternal life.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:18.840
Paul, I believe, that as he's writing here, and he says, according to the promise of life

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:23.240
which is in Christ Jesus, yes, there's the life that we're living, that physical life,

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.880
but we understand the focus on eternal life.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:33.280
I asked this question this morning, before I ever got into the Scriptures in 2 Timothy,

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:37.400
after they sang that song, I said, are you sure that you're going to heaven?

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.800
Are you a child of the King?

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:45.280
I'm thankful that the Apostle Paul, he had this assurance that though he would soon die,

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.480
that he would be in the presence of his Savior.

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:52.320
Turn back, if you will, to the book of 2 Corinthians in chapter number 5.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:59.720
2 Corinthians, chapter number 5, there's a great discourse here in this passage of

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:06.080
Scripture with regard to the certainty that Paul had of eternal life, and the certainty

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:13.400
this morning that every human being can have of eternal life.

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.440
Ron and I, we were knocking doors yesterday.

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:20.080
He was my partner as we went out, and one man said this to us when I asked him if he

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:24.520
was 100% sure if he were to die that he'd go to heaven.

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.720
How could anyone know that?

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:31.360
If you try to tell me that you know that, you're just prideful.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.400
Can I tell you this morning?

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:37.160
I don't know that I'm going to heaven because of anything I've done.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:41.680
It's all because of what Jesus did.

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:45.080
The truth of the matter is that there's not one of us that deserve it.

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.520
We're not deserving.

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:53.800
It's because of His grace and His mercy that we could be born again, that we could be saved.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:42:04.040
By the way, Jesus said to Nicodemus, a religious man, marvel not that I say unto thee, ye must

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.000
be born again.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.640
Except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.480
We find here in 2 Corinthians chapter number 5, notice how it begins in verse number 1,

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.000
for we know.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000
For we know.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.240
Aren't you thankful that we can know?

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.080
Paul doesn't say for we think.

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.680
He doesn't say for we hope.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.880
He says for we know.

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.880
The authority that God has given us in His Word.

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:35.000
For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.320
What does he mean by that?

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.840
Why is he using this language?

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:44.520
Well basically he's saying, listen, when this old flesh, when I die, when this, if our earthly

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:52.040
house of this tabernacle were dissolved, notice we have a building of God and house not made

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:55.600
with hands eternal in the heavens.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:00.480
For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house, which is from

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.480
heaven.

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.480
What's he saying in verse number 2?

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:07.280
Listen, there are days that we long for heaven, amen?

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.640
We say, man, heaven is a wonderful place and I'm ready to go.

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:14.200
Now what a joy it's going to be to be in the presence of our Savior.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.120
People sometimes ask this question, what's heaven going to be like?

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:20.760
Oh, there's a whole lot of things that God tells us that heaven's going to be like, but

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:24.960
I'll tell you what makes heaven heaven is Jesus will be there.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:30.680
You can take all the other things that are mentioned about heaven and if you remove Jesus,

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.560
it ain't the same.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.520
Jesus in the presence of our Savior.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:41.200
Listen, verse 3, if so be that being clothed, we shall not be found naked.

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:48.160
For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened, not for that we would be unclothed,

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:58.000
but clothed upon that notice when he says that mortality might be swallowed up of life.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000
D.L.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.680
Moody said this, he said, one day you're going to read in the headlines that D.L.

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:09.160
Moody's dead.

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:12.000
Don't believe it for a second.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:18.160
For in the day that you read that headline, I will be more alive than I've ever been.

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.000
What was he talking about?

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:27.640
He's talking about mortality being swallowed up of life because we have the truth of eternal

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:28.640
life.

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:34.559
Now, verse 5, he that hath wrought us for the self, same thing as God, who also hath

00:44:34.559 --> 00:44:37.360
given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:41.520
If you've been born again this morning, if you've been saved by the grace of God, the

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:47.800
Bible teaches us that at the moment of salvation, the Holy Spirit indwells us.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:50.680
He is the earnest of our inheritance.

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.480
We see it here in 2 Corinthians 5.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.279
We see it in Ephesians chapter 1.

00:44:54.279 --> 00:44:58.800
I referenced earlier about 1 Corinthians chapter 6, that the Holy Spirit is, that our bodies

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:03.279
are the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which you have of God.

00:45:03.279 --> 00:45:10.360
And he says that we have been given the Holy Spirit, which is the earnest of our inheritance,

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.880
Ephesians 1, verses 12 through 14.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:19.200
Therefore, we are always confident, knowing that whilst we are at home in the body, we

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.880
are absent from the Lord.

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:21.880
Do you know that this morning?

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.520
I mean, listen, this is not heaven.

00:45:24.119 --> 00:45:25.880
Someone tried to tell me that this is heaven.

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:28.960
Man, this is not heaven.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.800
This is absolutely not heaven.

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.600
How many of you know this is not heaven?

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:33.600
Amen?

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:34.600
This is not heaven.

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.920
Somebody try to tell me that.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:38.040
This is not heaven?

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:40.920
You've lost your mind if you think this is heaven.

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.240
Amen?

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:47.580
We know, look in verse 7, for we walk by faith, not by sight, and I love verse number 8.

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:56.180
He says, we are confident, I say, and willing, rather to be absent from the body and to

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:59.660
be present with the Lord.

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:05.420
Wherefore, we labor that whether present or absent, we may be accepted of Him.

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:08.380
Listen, Paul said, I'm confident.

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:10.900
Paul wasn't afraid of dying.

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:12.380
Paul had no fear of death.

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:13.380
Why?

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:16.100
Because he knew whom he had believed.

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:26.619
He knew that Jesus is the author of eternal life, life, yes, but eternal life.

00:46:26.619 --> 00:46:29.779
And he had been given that gift of God.

00:46:29.779 --> 00:46:30.920
He could not work for it.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.559
You cannot work for it.

00:46:32.559 --> 00:46:33.559
He did not earn it.

00:46:33.559 --> 00:46:36.180
You cannot earn it.

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:38.140
Jesus paid for all of it.

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:40.660
He didn't just put a down payment and you got to work for the rest.

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:43.020
No, He paid for it all.

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:50.260
Paul, he says, we're confident, I say, and willing, rather, to be absent from the body

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:51.740
and to be present with the Lord.

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:59.940
Back in the book of 2 Timothy, notice with me in chapter number 4, familiar text of Scripture,

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:03.420
one that I've hinted at twice already this morning.

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:15.860
But in chapter number 4 and verse number 6, Paul says this, for I am now ready to be

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:20.980
offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:26.300
I want you to think about the phraseology that he says, I'm ready.

00:47:26.619 --> 00:47:34.860
Listen, if you're not confident of heaven, you're crazy to say, I'm ready to die.

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:39.580
But when you're confident of heaven, because of the gift of God, which is eternal life

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:45.900
that you are a possessor of, then you can say, I am ready.

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:47.660
I am ready to be offered.

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:49.420
The time of my departure is at hand.

00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:52.020
I have fought a good fight.

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:53.380
I have finished my course.

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:54.820
I have kept the faith.

00:47:54.820 --> 00:48:00.059
But I want you to notice verse number 8, henceforth, there is laid up for me a crown

00:48:00.059 --> 00:48:07.380
of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day, and not

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:12.619
to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.

00:48:12.619 --> 00:48:16.540
You know, he gives clarity here in verse number 8.

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:18.420
Some people, I asked the guy yesterday, what's going to happen when he dies?

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:22.059
He's like, well, you know, you just become a tree, you become a dog, you become a bird.

00:48:22.059 --> 00:48:24.460
Like, come on, man.

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:29.140
We just know that's not true.

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:32.700
Amen?

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:36.979
As is appointed unto man, he wants to die, but after this, the judgment.

00:48:36.979 --> 00:48:41.619
Here Paul says that there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which, notice what

00:48:41.619 --> 00:48:47.780
he says, the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me, but he says at that day.

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:50.900
There are two judgments that are mentioned in the Bible, and we're running out of time

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:55.340
this morning, but one of them is the bema seat, the judgment seat of Christ.

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:58.100
Can I tell you this morning, if you're saved by the grace of God, that's the judgment seat

00:48:58.100 --> 00:48:59.700
that you'll stand at.

00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:06.580
By the way, that's the one you would prefer to stand at, the bema, the judgment seat.

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:11.059
And the Bible tells us that Paul had this confidence that he would receive a crown from

00:49:11.059 --> 00:49:15.859
the Lord, the righteous judge, and he says this, not to me only, but also unto all them

00:49:15.859 --> 00:49:18.220
also that love his appearing.

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:20.299
There's some crowns that we could receive.

00:49:20.299 --> 00:49:22.100
We could suffer loss.

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.260
We could receive reward, according to 1 Corinthians.

00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:29.380
But there's a second judgment that's explained to us in the book of Revelation in chapter

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:34.739
20, and it's called the great white throne judgment.

00:49:34.739 --> 00:49:39.540
That's a judgment that you don't want to stand at, because that judgment is for those that

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:43.100
have not trusted Christ as their Savior.

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:51.380
That judgment is a judgment that will end in being cast in the lake of fire.

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:58.900
The Bible tells us very plainly and very clearly that there's but two destinations for mankind,

00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:00.660
heaven or the lake of fire.

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:06.900
And we look at this text of Scripture and we say, listen, Paul acknowledged some things,

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:11.420
but Paul was also appreciative of some things. What did Paul appreciate? Well, he appreciated

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:15.580
the work of the ministry, he appreciated life, but most importantly, he appreciated the truth

00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:23.100
of eternal life. I wonder this morning, how thankful are we to have eternal life? I hope

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:28.300
every day of your life, you thank God for being saved. I hope every day of your life,

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:34.340
you thank God that somebody cared enough to tell you the truth of the gospel, and that

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:39.980
it would convict us to tell others the truth of the gospel, because men are dying. People

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:46.740
are dying. They need to know the truth of the gospel. Do you acknowledge this morning

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:55.540
that God has all authority in your life? Young people, so often, it's the young people that

00:50:55.540 --> 00:51:01.020
hear this message so often about God as the authority of your life, and it's true. But

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:06.020
can I tell you, for every single one of us, regardless of our age, we must acknowledge

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:12.660
this morning that God is the authority, that God has a will for us, a purpose, a plan for

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:19.260
your life and for my life, that God is the one who gives grace, mercy, and peace. Now,

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:25.300
we would serve the Lord joyfully, appreciating the fact that He would allow us to serve Him.

00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:33.020
You know, He could have used the angels, but He chose to use us. It's amazing. It's amazing.

00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:39.420
Grace, mercy, and peace. There's some things that Paul acknowledged, some things that Paul

00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:45.220
appreciated, and I hope this morning, just as it would be the case for Timothy, that

00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:49.660
he had to acknowledge and appreciate those things, that we too, we must acknowledge those

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:54.860
things and appreciate those things. Allow God to have His will and His way in our lives.

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:58.680
Let's pray together. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. We thank You

00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:04.020
for Your Word, the truth contained therein. God, if there's one here this morning or tuned

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:08.140
in via live stream that's not sure of heaven, God, I pray that today would be the day of

00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:12.980
their salvation. They'd come to this old-fashioned altar in just a moment as we have an invitation

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:16.540
and allow us to take a Bible and show them how they could know for sure that heaven is

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:22.060
their home. God, I pray for every Christian, every believer this morning. I pray, God,

00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:28.260
that You'd help us to acknowledge Your authority in our lives. God, if we've been trying to

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:33.740
live as if we are the authority, would You help us to confess that and forsake that?

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:38.500
Lord, help us to yield and submit to Thee that You might use us, God, for Your honor

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:43.740
and for Your glory. I pray that however it may be that You've worked in the hearts and

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:48.260
lives of Your people this morning, God, that You'd help us to be doers of the Word and

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:53.740
not hearers only. Help us to respond in obedience and we'll thank You for it. In Christ's name
